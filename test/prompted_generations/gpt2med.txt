<joey> like you know like me </joey>
<joey> and me and me and me you know what I </joey>

<joey>      </        <                               

<joey> in terms of culture and everything. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.

<joey> - And I remember I had to ask Sydney, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was like, "If
you're asking if you're </joey>
<joey> an american and you're asking
if you're a joey, </joey>
<joey> is it a big deal?" </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "No, no, no, no." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Okay, okay, okay." </joey>
<joey> - I can understand why it's a big deal </joey>
<joey> because I've been
living here for like two months </joey>
<joey> and I think I've seen
this side of America. </joey>
<joey> I can understand why people
would be confused, right? </joey>
<joey> People who are like,
"Oh, oh, I'm an american." </joey>

<garnt> americans are like too honest and i think </garnt>
<garnt> that's why they're like so good at </garnt>
<garnt> trying to convince other countries to </garnt>
<garnt> just put americans in the same box because </garnt>
<garnt> they're like they can like make </garnt>
<garnt> them look like you're just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> talking to a [ __ ] brain dead </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> you're you're like [ __ ] like i i just </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to see americans in the same </garnt>
<garnt> box of like i think americans are just </garnt>

<connor> so there are like different levels </connor>
<joey> and different cultures and different </joey>
<joey> accents so sometimes it's just like </joey>
