<title> the differences between japanese and american people </title>

<joey> oh yeah so basically yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> basically like the the american way of </joey>
<joey> thinking is that you know you have to go </joey>
<joey> home at a certain time yeah and then you </joey>
<joey> can tell when the Japanese are okay </joey>
<joey> because you know in the in the in in the </joey>
<joey> house in the morning and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> you can tell when they're okay because </joey>
<joey> you know it's it's it's kind of like a </joey>
<joey> little like a test for like for me it's </joey>
<joey> to me it kind of like it kind of like </joey>
<joey> a test to see if there's any like </joey>
<connor> differences between the two cultures </connor>
<joey> yeah it kind of it kind of is like a </joey>
<joey> test to see if there's any differences </joey>
<joey> between the two cultures yeah it's like </joey>
<garnt> oh it's the same with you for example </garnt>
<joey> like for example like you know going </joey>
<joey> to the gym and stuff like that you can </joey>
<joey> tell immediately you know when they're </joey>
<joey> having a good time you know in the </joey>
<joey> morning you can tell when they're having </joey>
<joey> like a good time in the morning </joey>
<joey> because like you know when you go to a </joey>
<connor> gym it's usually like the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> everyone's like you know everyone's like </connor>
<connor> you know everyone's like busy it's like </connor>
<connor> I'm not doing anything until I go to the </connor>
<connor> gym and then you get to the room and </connor>
<connor> everyone's like oh he's having a good </connor>
<connor> time right now he makes a good [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> out of it </connor>
<connor> because it's like they're having a </connor>
<connor> good time but like you know when you're </connor>
<connor> watching Japanese TV the the whole </connor>
<joey> episodes are just like oh yeah the </joey>
<joey> american way of thinking is that you </joey>
<joey> have to go home at a certain time yeah </joey>
<joey> and then you get to the room and it's </joey>
<joey> like oh I guess that was that was a </joey>
<joey> really cool way of thinking yeah </joey>
<joey> um but yeah I mean like I don't know a </joey>
<joey> lot about Japan personally but like a </joey>
<joey> lot of the way you're just like talking </joey>
<joey> about Japan and like the way that the </joey>
<joey> we live in Japan and everything like </joey>
<joey> that yeah yeah that's all like that's </joey>
<joey> a lot of it I mean it's just it's a </joey>
<joey> very very very slow way of thinking right </joey>
<joey> because it's a very very very slow way </joey>
<joey> of thinking and people in Japan are way </joey>
<joey> more like you know people are way more </joey>
<joey> open to ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh </joey>
<joey> yeah a lot more so yeah and a lot of ugh </joe ugh ugh

<garnt> it's like the most insane thing to do </garnt>
<garnt> in the world I mean yeah I think I think </garnt>
<garnt> you know I think the reason why a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the people who are like uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> foreign and uh uh international </garnt>
<garnt> people are like people who are more </garnt>
<garnt> like on the edge of the spectrum yeah </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason </garnt>
<garnt> um it's been like decades since the </garnt>
<garnt> last time ever like a single person is </garnt>
<garnt> like hey hey hey this is the only place </garnt>
<garnt> that you can live in every other country </garnt>
<garnt> you know because it's like you know </garnt>
<joey> it's it's it's it's it's it's it's not just </joey>
<connor> Japan it's not just the Japanese we </connor>
<joey> are Americans as well yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> it's it's like a system that is kind of </joey>
<joey> built for like certain things that </joey>
<garnt> Japan does but it's also like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the times some of the rules that are </garnt>
<garnt> broken yeah because it's it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> like the rules are broken in a way </garnt>
<garnt> where people are just like oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like and it's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> like I I think I I think as well the </garnt>
<garnt> same thing with like the uh </garnt>
<garnt> international community as well </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like I think the one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that I always find fascinating is like </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's like oh yeah Japan is cool </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you know I think it's because </garnt>
<garnt> there's no other country that you can </garnt>
<garnt> compare to Japan in that kind of </garnt>
<garnt> sense right it's like you know you know </garnt>
<garnt> everyone always sees Japan being like </garnt>
<joey> oh I think Japan is cool </joey>
<joey> but it is Japan is like one of the </joey>
<garnt> coolest countries in the world I think </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it is it is like in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> popularity yeah yeah yeah it is it is </garnt>
<garnt> it's like one of the most unique </garnt>
<garnt> cultures in the world you know and </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like I I I think a lot of the </garnt>
<garnt> reasons why people don't feel </garnt>
<garnt> strongly about Japan is because of that </garnt>
<garnt> culture but a lot of the ughs that you </garnt>
<garnt> see as Japanese people here are ughs </garnt>
<garnt> that ughs are just the ughs that </garnt>
<garnt> people will see ughs are ughs that </garnt>
<garnt> people ughs are ughs that ughs ughs </garnt>
<joey> that ughs ughs ughs ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh </joey>
<joey> ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh </joey>
<garnt> ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh

<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I'm just
kind of like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm not really a fan of the word, </garnt>
<connor> not that I'm not really a fan of the word, </connor>
<connor> but I don't know what it's like to be like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just the word. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just the word, right? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what it is to be like. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I don't know
what it's like for me </connor>
<connor> to be like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I like this country more than other things. </connor>
<connor> It's something that I like. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's the opposite
for Americans as well. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right? </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, </connor>
<joey> I don't know why Americans
are so fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> - I know, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it is about Americans. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I've said it on purpose, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know what it is about Americans </joey>
<joey> that's so much more different to normal. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just think that the
general stereotype of Americans </joey>
<joey> is just like, you know,
they're a little too British </joey>
<joey> to talk to the rest of
the world, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it is weird
that I feel like America </garnt>
<connor> is the only country that I feel </connor>
<connor> like is just like, </connor>
<connor> if I go to another country </connor>
<connor> and I feel like I have
the same mentality, </connor>
<connor> I have the same way of thinking. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why like... </connor>
<connor> - I think that Americans
are just so much more </connor>
<connor> British than you think. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why it feels so weird. </connor>
<connor> Like I feel like Americans are just people </connor>
<garnt> that have no interest in what
other people have to ughing ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I hate that word. </joey>
<joey> - What I love about Americans is that people </joeey>
<joey> don't ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh. </joey>
<joey> - ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh

<joey> you know what the most american
thing about japan is that </joey>
<joey> everyone here is so different to us </joey>
<joey> um and that's because you know </joey>
<joey> the people here are the same as us </joey>
<connor> yeah because the only way that we can </connor>
<connor> communicate with each other is through </connor>
<connor> what we call our differences </connor>
<connor> um so you know we talk with each other </connor>
<connor> through our differences and not even </connor>
<connor> that was our idea of having a conversation </connor>
<joey> that's already sounds like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> conversation I don't know why yeah </joey>
<garnt> um you know we don't talk about our </garnt>
<garnt> differences but what I love about japan </garnt>
<connor> is that you can you can really </connor>
<connor> distinguish between certain areas of </connor>
<joey> japan that are very similar to one another </joey>
<connor> but still very different to one another </connor>
<joey> um because you know some of the parts of </joey>
<joey> japan that like you can still see people </joey>
<connor> from across the world yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah but some of the different parts </joey>
<connor> are so different from each other </connor>
<connor> um and you can appreciate that you can </connor>
<connor> appreciate that a lot of the time when </connor>
<connor> the culture is like you know not </connor>
<connor> uniform but like you know you can get </connor>
<connor> across the differences and you can </connor>
<connor> appreciate the differences and the </connor>
<connor> value of them and the interaction that </connor>
<connor> that just there is no in between </connor>
<connor> um and you know the one thing I really </connor>
<connor> enjoyed about japan is that I just I </connor>
<connor> just I just I I like I I get to talk to </connor>
<connor> people who are like different from </connor>
<joey> me because you know they you know </joey>
<joey> you know they live here in the same </joey>
<garnt> household as me </garnt>
<garnt> and you know that the same way with you </garnt>
<garnt> they're not the same people as you </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because you know you get to talk </garnt>
<garnt> to them and they have the same </garnt>
<garnt> characteristics that you have as a </garnt>
<garnt> foreigner like you know there's something </garnt>
<garnt> about having that kind of </garnt>
<connor> interaction where I think it's a lot </connor>
<connor> of the iverse where the iverse is </connor>
<connor> the iverse of iverse where I think </connor>
<connor> it's iverse iverse where I like I get </connor>
<joey> to talk to people who I see iverse iverse </joey>
<garnt> iverse iverse iverse  </garnt>
<garnt>      </garnt>
<garnt>      </garnt>
<joey> um      </joey>
<joey>     </joey>
<garnt>     </garnt>
<joey>   <joey>         </joey>
<connor>     </connor>
<connor>          </connor>
<connor>         </conno>
<garnt>                </garnt>
<garnt>                         <garnt>                              <connor>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </garnt>
<connor> - So basically I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm going to bring a copy
of "Eyeshield 21" and- </connor>
<connor> - And you can also watch the
episode with the boys as well. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, it was good." </joey>
<joey> And I was doing the voice
over for like a minute, </joey>
<joey> just fucking grunting the
words in my head. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Don't fucking
mute me, don't fucking mute." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> But I was like, "Yeah, no
mute, just keep doing it." </joey>
<joey> And so I do it for two minutes. </joey>
<joey> And then I'm just like... </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "Why is
this funny to you?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I was like, "Oh, it's
the most like Disney-esque, </joey>
<joey> like cartoonish fucking story ever." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Okay, this
is the best fucking thing. </joey>
<joey> "That's what I'm laughing at." </joey>
<joey> - The thing is I think the
equivalent of laughing at that </joey>
<joey> was I fucking cry when I
heard about the Oscars. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "This is sad." </joey>
<joey> - I think that was the first
time that I went to see the- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] The Oscars? </joey>
<joey> - I went to see
