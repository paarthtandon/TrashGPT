<title> the differences between japanese and american people </title>

<connor> is that american people are like </connor>
<connor> you're gonna fuck it up, you're gonna fuck it up </connor>
<connor> and then japanese people are like </connor>
<connor> "oh, you're gonna fuck it up" but we're just </connor>
<garnt> like "yeah, yeah, yeah." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's like the one thing </garnt>
<garnt> I appreciate about japanese people is like </garnt>
<garnt> they're like "you're gonna fuck it up, </garnt>
<connor> so you might as well fuck it up." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - And then you can just move on from there. </connor>
<connor> It's like I can't say I've never seen </connor>
<connor> a japanese person ever like
regret something they did </connor>
<connor> because they were like "oh,
I fucked this up, oh my god, </connor>
<connor> oh my god" and then you're like </connor>
<connor> "oh well, you fucked it up,
just go fuck it up again." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They're like "well, what can be done?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What can be done? </connor>
<connor> - I've never seen a japanese person </connor>
<connor> ever like regret anything </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like
it's just like, "oh well, </connor>
<connor> it's done and it's been done." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's just like "oh well, it's done." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly.
- It's like. </connor>
<connor> - I love that, I love that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what I like about Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is that like it's like
there's a whole culture </connor>
<joey> of just "let's get shit over with." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And just get it over with. </connor>
