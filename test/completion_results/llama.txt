<connor> my God it looks like the shittiest Cafe </connor>
<connor> in all of Japan it's like it's like yeah </connor>
<joey> it has an outside Terrace and it's </joey>
<connor> let me show you a picture okay it's like </connor>
<joey> unfair to even call this a Terrace do </joey>
<joey> they not just think to like walk into </joey>
<connor> like a Starbucks I think I think they </connor>
<joey> didn't want to go to Starbucks and also </joey>
<joey> I think they were also like look at this </joey>

<garnt> beautiful Terrace </garnt>
<garnt> like this is so much better than
Starbucks Terrace is this so much </garnt>
<joey> better so I'm like if it's this bad </joey>
<garnt> then I don't wanna go I'm like let's just </garnt>
<garnt> go to Starbucks let's go to Starbucks </garnt>
<connor> because it's like it's just so nice and </connor>
<connor> it's so good it's like I want to go in </connor>
<connor> I'm like oh this is this is so pretty </connor>
<connor> this is pretty right and it's like </connor>
<connor> this is a perfect example of like </connor>
<connor> like it's like what kind of Japan </connor>
<connor> experience are you looking for right </connor>
<connor> because if you don't mind paying a lot </connor>
<connor> and like having a terrible waiter service </connor>
<connor> and having a bad food experience </connor>
<connor> and being like oh god what is this I've </connor>
<connor> never tasted anything like this before </connor>
<connor> but it's fucking delicious that is </connor>
<connor> the Japanese experience you know right </connor>
<joey> so when we went to Tokyo it was like </joey>
<joey> there was some some very good
experiences but most of </joey>
<joey> the time there was always like these </joey>
<joey> things where like it's like the bad </joey>
<joey> food or the bad service was like so </joey>
<joey> much worse than the good experience </joey>
<joey> that you were having that was like the </joey>
<joey> whole experience of going to Japan yeah </joey>
<connor> I remember when we went to the first </connor>

Line 355

<connor> it's just like it's it's very fun taking </connor>
<connor> them around but after like like multiple </connor>
<connor> days of this I've been getting this same </connor>
<connor> question I'm like I'm gonna lose </connor>
<connor> my mind being asked these questions over </connor>
<connor> and over again but it's been fun they </connor>
<connor> love the bullet trains everyone seems to </connor>
<connor> love bullet trains as well every foreign </connor>
<joey> person I think people from outside Japan </joey>
<joey> just like find that concept so insane </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's like well like I think </joey>

<joey> in Australia we have a train system that </joey>
<connor> is really fast it's like the bullet </connor>
<joey> trains are faster than our high speed </joey>
<joey> trains but it's not like a bullet train </joey>
<garnt> where it goes from point A to point B on </garnt>
<garnt> time that is kind of crazy to me yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like the world is getting smaller </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and I also I have to say it's great </garnt>
<garnt> seeing the way people react to the way </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese people react to other people </garnt>
<garnt> because I can imagine when you go to </garnt>
<garnt> America people are surprised when you say </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese people are kind to us because you </garnt>
<connor> see like you see like on your videos like </connor>
<connor> you know like you saw [ __ ] like you see </connor>
<connor> some of the stuff that you see in the media </connor>
<connor> about America and then you get here and </connor>
<joey> you're like oh </joey>
<joey> no there's some good people in America </joey>
<joey> there's some good people everywhere yeah </joey>
<connor> I mean there's some bad people everywhere </connor>
<connor> but Japan is a country that is almost </connor>
<connor> completely devoid of bad people I feel </connor>
<joey> like it's an anomaly in the </joey>
<connor>  of the world right where I don't </connor>
<connor> really feel like you have to worry about </connor>
<connor> safety or anything like that </connor>
<connor> I mean obviously it's always good to be </connor>

Line 1451

<joey> take for granted in terms of how you </joey>
<joey> know like the way the country functions </joey>
<joey> for sure like you know when you get </joey>
<joey> asked like the littlest thing for every </joey>
<garnt> thing that kind of like adds up and adds </garnt>
<connor> up and adds up yeah every single time </connor>
<joey> yeah they asked me especially if your </joey>
<joey> dad is asking what beer this is </joey>
<joey> um like they had cover charge in one </joey>
<connor> place because current charge is pretty </connor>
<connor> common in Japan yeah yeah 500 to 1000 </connor>
<connor> yen you get a snack or something and my </connor>
<connor> dad was like did I did I get scammed and </connor>
<joey> I was like no no it's </joey>
<connor> it's normal but it uses on guard with </connor>
<joey> everything yeah yeah like an ATM he's </joey>
<joey> like is that ATM safe and I was like </joey>

<garnt> yeah you know I mean they don't </garnt>
<garnt> have a lot of crime in Japan yeah </garnt>
<joey> you know it's a lot of like the </joey>
<joey> people that do crime they're usually </joey>
<joey> foreigners who are the foreigners who are </joey>
<joey> foreigners who are the foreigners who </joey>
<joey> are the foreigners who are foreigners </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah so it's like a lot of it </joey>
<joey> is just like the foreigners who are </joey>
<joey> coming in from like other countries in </joey>
<connor> japan yeah yeah and yeah I'm sure there </connor>
<connor> are Japanese people who do it as well </connor>
<connor> I mean I've seen it happen to Japanese </connor>
<joey> people as well yeah yeah yeah but I </joey>
<connor> don't think it's nearly as common yeah </connor>
<joey> I mean I mean I was like the only </joey>
<joey> foreigner there but I was like the only </joey>
<joey> foreigner there that wasn't like a </joey>
<joey> backpacker yeah yeah so it's like I </joey>
<joey> mean it's like the only foreigner that </joey>
<joey> was like it was like a business </joey>
<connor> professional foreigner </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah so I was like the only </joey>
<joey> foreigner who wasn't like a backpacker </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah so it's like so it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like it's it's a very different </connor>
