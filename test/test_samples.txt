<joey> I think they were also like look at this </joey>

<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> that doesn't even look like a cafe and </joey>
<joey> this is something that I've learned and </joey>
<joey> I know this because I had the same thing </joey>
<joey> myself I said like it is super </joey>
<joey> intimidating in Japan for people who've </joey>
<joey> never gone to Japan or Asia in general </joey>
<joey> to to to imagine having to go into a </joey>
<joey> building without being able to see it </joey>
<joey> immediately what's inside yes yeah so I </joey>
<joey> think for them my parents it was like </joey>
<joey> okay well Terrace equals I can kind of </joey>
<joey> see what's going on and then there's </joey>
<joey> also hundreds of miscommunications they </joey>
