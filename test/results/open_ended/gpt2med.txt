<garnt> - I don't think I've ever been. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, there's no reason for you to. </joey>
<garnt> - I've been to plenty of countries </garnt>
<garnt> where the food was good </garnt>
<garnt> and I just didn't enjoy it. </garnt>
<connor> I think I should go back to the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - I want to go back. </garnt>
<garnt> - I want to go back as well. </garnt>
<joey> I wanted to go back to the UK. </joey>
<joey> - I want to go back. </joey>
<joey> - The food was very good. </joey>
<joey> Like I used to cook a lot in the UK, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like I just can't cook </joey>
<joey> enough to get by. </joey>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> - I don't have the
energy to cook enough </joey>
<joey> to get by. </joey>
<joey> - Do you think I'm the exception? </joey>
<joey> - I think I am. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you think I am? </joey>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<garnt> Because I can't cook enough
to be able to eat that much. </garnt>

<connor> - I am. </connor>
<connor> You can't say anything. </connor>
<joey> - I can't say anything. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you can't say anything. </garnt>
<garnt> You just have to sit there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you can't say anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like if you do that </garnt>
<joey> and you're like, I'm a JoJo fan, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna say that. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I think, you know, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but I mean, </joey>
<joey> - I think you should, you know, </joey>
<joey> - Especially if you're
sitting next to each other. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - Like if you're like, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're sitting next to
each other and you say it, </joey>
<joey> and they're like, oh yeah,
I'm a JoJo fan, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna say it, I'm a JoJo fan. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, well, I'm
not gonna say it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I'm not gonna say it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not saying it, </joey>

<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Did you ever try to join
like the "Trash Taste" </joey>
<joey> or did you just like, you
never joined the "Trash Taste"? </joey>
<joey> - No, I never joined the
Trash Taste at all. </joey>
<joey> I didn't even know it existed. </joey>
<connor> - You didn't know it existed. </connor>
<connor> - You didn't know it existed? </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I've
seen a single episode </joey>
<joey> of "Trash Taste" since "Trash Taste," </joey>
<joey> I was like, why is there this? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And then I started </garnt>
<garnt> going on "Trash Taste" for
the first time on my channel. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was the first
time I watched like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I watched about four episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Four episodes.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I knew it was gonna be good. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I watched it and I
thought it was pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> It was pretty good, and
I was like, this is pretty good, </garnt>

<connor> - I was like, "Why is it so hard, </connor>
<connor> to get into the Olympics?" </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> It's like, "Is it really worth it?" </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I'm
getting old and retired </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I can imagine I've
never been to an Olympics </garnt>
<garnt> other than the Olympics, but
that's because I've been to </garnt>
<garnt> the Olympics before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm like, I don't
really feel like an outsider. </garnt>
<connor> I don't feel like an outsider. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm part of the
team and I need to support </connor>
<connor> and it's like, how can this be? </connor>
<connor> Like, how? </connor>
<connor> Like, how does it not make sense? </connor>
<connor> Like, how does it even feel
like an Olympics to you? </connor>
<connor> Like, I feel like I'm part of
the team and I need to support </connor>

<connor> cause we're just gonna go ham. </connor>
<connor> And we're like, what if we
do this again? What if we, </connor>
<connor> what if we just do this
again and then we just do it </connor>
<joey> and then we're just gonna
get more people to do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And then you know </joey>
<connor> it's in its prime and it's
just gonna continue to grow. </connor>
<connor> But I think the thing that
really, really blew me away </connor>
<connor> about "Trash Taste" was
just how much the "Trash Taste" </connor>
<garnt> have grown over the years, right. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not gonna lie, I've
never thought about it </joey>
<joey> in terms of like "Trash Taste"
like that because it's- </joey>
<garnt> - It's literally just a
show for people who don't watch </garnt>
<garnt> anime and don't watch "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's basically just a show
where we talk about anime </garnt>
<garnt> with people who don't watch anime. </garnt>
