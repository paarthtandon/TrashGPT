seen a single episode </joey>
<joey> of "Trash Taste" since "Trash Taste," </joey>

the first time on my channel. </garnt>

time I watched like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I watched about four episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Four episodes.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I knew it was gonna be good. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I watched it and I
thought it was pretty good. </garnt>

<garnt> I don't know if I'm
getting old and retired </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I can imagine I've
never been to an Olympics </garnt>
<garnt> other than the Olympics, but
that's because I've been to </garnt>
<garnt> the Olympics before. </garnt>

<joey> and then we're just gonna
get more people to do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And then you know </joey>
<connor> it's in its prime and it's
just gonna continue to grow. </connor>
<connor> But I think the thing that
really, really blew me away </connor>
<connor> about "Trash Taste" was
just how much the "Trash Taste" </connor>
<garnt> have grown over the years, right. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not gonna lie, I've
never thought about it </joey>
<joey> in terms of like "Trash Taste"
like that because it's- </joey>
<garnt> - It's literally just a
show for people who don't watch </garnt>
<garnt> anime and don't watch "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's basically just a show
where we talk about anime </garnt>
<garnt> with people who don't watch anime. </garnt>

<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's like an easy game. </connor>
<connor> You just like, when you
want to play the game, </connor>
<connor> and you have free time, </connor>
<connor> you just start playing it, </connor>
<connor> and then you just kind of
turn on your brain, right? </connor>
<connor> You're just like, okay,
I'm having a good time </connor>
<garnt> playing that game now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I could probably be playing, </joey>
<joey> like some kind of challenging game. </joey>
<joey> Like I've recently been
playing some kind of game </joey>
<joey> that's like really challenging, </joey>
<connor> like the Pokemon game. </connor>
<connor> Like I really wanna play that. </connor>
<connor> I want to do that. </connor>
<connor> I want to, like, </connor>
<connor> I want to do that in the long run. </connor>
<connor> But like, </connor>
<connor> how long is the game gonna
take me to get to that point? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, like I have
found a way to be like, </connor>
<connor> I can beat Pokemon in a long time. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know if that's just me, </connor>
<connor> but at least every time
I've beat Pokemon in a long </connor>
<connor> time, I'm just like, okay, </connor>
<connor> well I just know I can beat it. </connor>
<connor> And then I play it, and
then I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I just can't beat it anymore. </connor>
<connor> And then I just kind of
turn on my brain.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's like, I had this
thought the other day, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, what if
I'm just like actually, </connor>
<connor> like getting into the game, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like this
like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like I don't know if
it's just me or my brain, </connor>
<connor> but I guess I just kind of realized, </connor>
<connor> oh, maybe I just do
this for fun.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> Maybe I'm just playing it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean like, </connor>
<connor> you know, I don't really
give a shit about Pokemon, </connor>
<connor> but I feel the Pokemon game
is kind of the same thing. </connor>
<connor> Where the more you get into it, </connor>
<connor> the more you get into the
game and the more you just, </connor>
<connor> you think, I could do this,
and I could do this all day. </connor>
<connor> I can do this all day. </connor>
<connor> But I guess, </connor>
<connor> as a content creator, what's
the game to get invested in? </connor>
<connor>        </connor>
<connor>     </connor>
<connor>   I mean, </connor>
<connor> I think Pokemon is the same
thing, I just don't understand. </connor>

<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't wanna read it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so I just kept reading it </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh, okay." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "So I just want to know
what's going on here?" </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, it's not gonna
be so much of a hassle </garnt>
<garnt> "but I want to know what
the fuck's going on here." </garnt>
<garnt> So I go to Google translate </garnt>
<garnt> and I look up what the
exact page is on Google translate </garnt>
<garnt> and Google translate tells
me exactly what the page is </garnt>
<garnt> on Google translate, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, "Oh." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, "Okay, okay." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh, okay," right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I couldn't get it
done because I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't know what the fuck
is going on here, right?" </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, "I
just want to know what </garnt>
<garnt> "the fuck is going on here." </garnt>
<garnt> So I go to Google translate, </garnt>
<garnt> and it tells me what the
exact page is on Google translate </garnt>
<garnt> and Google translate tells
me exactly what the page is </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "Oh, okay." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I couldn't get it done. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "I don't know
what the fuck is going on here. </garnt>
<garnt> "I just want to know what's going on here." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I go to Google translate, </garnt>
<garnt> and ugh, I was getting it done. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, (coughing). </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, (coughing). </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, (coughing), and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Please, please help me." </garnt>
<garnt> ugh, I was like, "What the fuck" </garnt>
<garnt> and like, I was trying to
look ugh in my ugh ugh in ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, </garnt>

```
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I guess that
means you can leave it </connor>
<connor> for longer if you want. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I guess
that sounds like a cool idea </garnt>
<garnt> to you where you just like
drop the whole thing down </garnt>
<joey> and just leave it to the
people who know, you know, </joey>
<joey> who are familiar with this
and want to keep this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I feel like </connor>
<connor> you should be fine with that, </connor>
<connor> but you know, </connor>
<connor> I feel like you should
just be fine with them </connor>
<connor> having your stuff and
not letting people do it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I mean, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's a little bit weird </connor>
<garnt> if you're doing something
like that with YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like that's
the right way to go about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, that's, that's
what makes it interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's something entirely new, </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, I feel
like being an outsider </garnt>
<garnt> in this kind of like
intervention, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a little bit different
to what you have to do </garnt>
<garnt> to be an outsider. </garnt>
<garnt> But I know that a lot of
YouTubers, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> especially when you are on
the internet, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> have a lot of free time. </garnt>
<connor> - I know a lot of YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who have a lot of free
time where they work </connor>
<connor> on some of the videos </connor>
<connor> and they get to do certain things. </connor>
<connor> And you know, </connor>
<connor> when you have a lot of free time, </connor>
<connor> I feel like, you know, </connor>
<connor> there is a lot of people who are like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I'm just gonna do my own thing. </connor>
<connor> I don't need to worry about this. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna do my own thing. </connor>
<connor> And then there's people, </connor>
<connor> when they're on the internet,
who are like, oh, </connor>
<garnt> this is me, this is my
free time, I'm gonna do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, there's a
lot of people who are like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, I'm just gonna do my own thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna do my own thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, this is what I like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is what I'm like, this
is what I like doing. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - But I feel like, I feel like </connor>
```

```
<joey> - Well, it depends on the song. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think some songs are
just so fucking hard to listen to </joey>
<joey> that it's just like, okay,
this is an album. </joey>
<joey> It is a fucking amazing album. </joey>
<connor> But the problem is is that, you know, </connor>
<connor> you can kind of be like, okay, </connor>
<connor> this is an amazing fucking album </connor>
<connor> but the problem is is that
it just feels like a mediocre </connor>
<connor> album, right? </connor>
<joey> It's like, it's not great. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I think like,
I feel like that's a good </joey>
<joey> place to end it. </joey>
<joey> I like the music a lot but I
feel like it's just a mediocre, </joey>
<joey> like a mediocre album. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, it's
just like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't really like it. </joey>
<joey> It's one of those albums where I know </joey>
<joey> I like the music but I
feel like the lyrics, </joey>
<joey> especially the lyrics to
like "Don't Understand Me" </joey>
<joey> and I feel like it's
probably the best song </joey>
<joey> in like "86" or something. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know what was going on. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, it's the
same way with a lot of, </connor>
<connor> like, you know, </connor>
<joey> you can listen to a
fuckton of songs with lyrics </joey>
<joey> and like, and you can understand
what they're saying, </joey>
<joey> but like, some of the songs
that are just so fucking hard </joey>
<joey> and you can't really
understand them in a way </joey>
<joey> that's so subtle and so
like, unnerving and just like, </joey>
<joey> so depressing, you know,
that they just, you know, </joey>
<joey> it's like there's a sadness
or there's a morbidness </joey>
<joey> that comes out of like the song. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like the reason
I love this album is that </joey>
<joey> the lyrics are so fucking
concisive and just so subtle. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like, I don't
know why I love this song. </joey>
<joey> I love the fact that it
always has the most, </joey>
<joey> it always has the most
concisive lyrics. </joey>
<joey> I love that. </joey>
<joey> I love that. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Oh, he's a teacher." </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Oh, he's an
idiot" or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - I love that. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I love how, like, </joey>
<joey> he just kept using the word
idiot in the same way </joey>
<joey> where it's like, "idiot." </joey>
<joey> And I love how he just
kept using the word like, </joey>
<joey> "And then he goes, "Oh
cool, but then he goes, </joey>
<joeey> "but then he goes, "Oh, what
the fuck is going on here?" </joeey>
```

```
<connor> - It's like the only
time you can do it. </connor>
<joey> - You're the only person
who can do it just like. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the only time
you can do it, but it's like, </joey>
<joey> I think there are other things that you can do </joey>
<joey> that are much more fun
and more relaxing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can do like a climbing
and like a climbing thing. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I like climbing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I do like a climbing. </joey>
<connor> - I can do like a climbing
and climbing special. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I like climbing a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I like climbing as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but like, I don't
really want a climbing thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because you just go up. </joey>
<joey> - I do, I do. </joey>
<joey> - But like, I like climbing
a lot of things, I like, </joey>
<joey> I mean, I did like a climbing thing </joey>
<joey> but it was quite expensive. </joey>
<joey> - I did a climbing thing. </joey>
<joey> - I did a climbing thing </joey>
<joey> and that was the only
time you could do it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's the only
time I could do it. </joey>
<joey> I think I did like maybe like a climbing </joey>
<joey> like a climbing kind of thing </joey>
<joey> but I did it for like a week
and a half and I was like, </joey>
<joey> I need to do a stronger
thing for this one. </joey>
<joey> - I think you need to do
like a really really good </joey>
<joey> and long lasting thing to get
your body used to doing it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not saying that
like a climbing special </joey>
<joey> is the most fun thing ever. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I thought that
like a climbing special </joey>
<joey> was the most fun thing ever. </joey>
<joey> - I thought that when you do it, </joey>
<joey> it does the same thing that
a video game special </joey>
<joey> is the most fun thing ever. </joey>
<joey> - But like a video game
special is just like, </joey>
<joey> you get used to it. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I do for video
games, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can do it for like two weeks. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, normally I would like, </joey>
<joey> even if it wasn't a special, </joey>
<joey> I mean, I would like
do it anyway for video games </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing with it. </joey>
<joey> But like I think the reason why I've like, </joey>
<joey> I can't do a lot of
like video game sports </joey>
<joey> is 'cause I've never been
able to do any in my life. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And just doing that, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I don't wanna
be doing a video game orto </joey>
<garnt> for like orto orto orto orto orto orto orto orto </garnt>

```
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, this is
like the thing that's like, </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] You're gonna have to explain this. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, this is this
like, I don't know, </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, what is this? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, it's like
a Japanese game show thing. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but the concept of it is that, </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but the concept
of it is that, they're like, </garnt>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so this is the concept of it, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "Okay, so this
is a Japanese game show </connor>
<connor> and it's like, "Okay, so
we've got these like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so we've got these
like, weirdos who are like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna do this thing, right." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] What? </connor>
<connor> - Where it's like, </connor>
<connor> - What are you talking
about? </connor>
<connor> - It's like they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so we've got these
like four weirdos who are, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so we've got these
four weirdos who are gonna </connor>
<connor> "do this task and then
the first one to do it </connor>
<garnt> wins a million dollars."
- What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so it's like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I think
it's like a Japanese game show, </connor>
<connor> and then they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so they've got like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know, they've got like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so they've got like, 100
people who are like, "Okay, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna do this task and
then the first one to do it </connor>
<connor> wins a million dollars." </connor>
<connor> And they've got like,
- What? </connor>
<connor> - And they've got like, </connor>
<connor> they've got like, 40, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What? </connor>
<connor> - And I guess it's
like this Japanese game show </connor>
<connor> thing where they've got like
four different tasks </connor>
```

```
<garnt> - I like that, I like the aesthetic. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I like that too.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's just cool. </connor>
<connor> - I think the problem is </connor>
<connor> that it's a lot of times,
it's just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> oh, cool, you're wearing a scarf with your shirt, </connor>
<connor> and it's like, oh, cool, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna wear a scarf
with my shirt now as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It's just, it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's just like, yeah, yeah,
I'm gonna do that as well. </connor>
<connor> - And then you end up having </connor>
<connor> like three scarves on your neck, </connor>
<connor> and you look like a complete idiot, </connor>
<joey> 'cause no one would ever wear three scarves. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, if I was
a rich person, I'd probably wear, </connor>
<connor> I'd probably wear like three scarves. </connor>
<connor> - I'd probably just wear one
scarf that was like, </connor>
<joey> really long and like,
you know, just like, </joey>
<joey> just like have that one scarf
that was like, oh, </joey>
<joey> it's like just like, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're just like, oh,
I'm just gonna wear this. </joey>
<connor> I'm just gonna wear it
until it gets old, </connor>
<connor> and then I'll probably
just have a scarf burning ceremony. </connor>
<connor> - I don't, I just don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know.
- I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I think that's the only
reason why I don't wear one, </joey>
<connor> I think it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how to wear it right. </connor>
<connor> - I know how to wear it
right, I know I know how to wear it, </connor>
<connor> but I know that if I wear
a scarf, I'll end up with, </connor>
<connor> I'll end up looking like a fucking idiot, </connor>
<joey> so I don't want to risk it. </joey>
<joey> - So we didn't, so
we didn't have a scarf, </joey>
```

```
<connor> - Yeah, totally. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's like going to a restaurant </connor>
<connor> and you're like, you know, </connor>
<connor> if you order a steak, </connor>
<connor> you better fucking get steak. </connor>
<connor> And not like a hamburger, </connor>
<connor> you're like, you know, </connor>
<connor> you know, you don't just
get that, you know. </connor>
<connor> And that's like the same
thing with video games. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I think that's </joey>
<garnt> why some people get really
pissed off when the game </garnt>
<garnt> isn't up to par. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you're gonna
promise us, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like, if you promise us </garnt>
<joey> that this is a brand new Nintendo game, </joey>
<joey> then, you know, </joey>
<joey> then that's what you should
be getting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And if, you know, </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying that like,
Nintendo has done this, </joey>
<joey> but, you know, </joey>
<joey> where they've kind of
like misled people into thinking </joey>
<connor> that they're getting a new game, </connor>
<connor> and then it turns out
it's just a remake, </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's just, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I get why some people are mad. </connor>
<connor> But I think a lot of them
are just like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> there's a difference between
like a hype train, and a, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, a, you know,
something that's been, you know, </garnt>
<connor> promised to you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when people are like
hyped up for something, </connor>
<connor> you know, I think that's
a different level of, </connor>
<connor> you know, excitement to, </connor>
<connor> you know, I'm just hyped
because I'm hyped. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was hyped for the
fucking Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. </connor>
<connor> Like, honestly, I was hyped for that, </connor>
<connor> I was hyped for that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was hyped for that, but
I wasn't hyped for it </joey>
<. </joey>
<connor> to the point where I was thinking, </connor>
<connor> "If I don't get this, I'm gonna die." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't like, </connor>
<connor> "If I don't get this, I'm gonna be a." </connor </ </ </ </. </ </ </connor </connor </connor

<connor> That was my first experience of
like, "Oh, you know, </connor>
<joey> you can just have fun with
these two games, you know." </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I think that's
why I really enjoyed Tetris. </garnt>
<garnt> I really enjoyed playing it
as a kid. I think it's just </garnt>
<garnt> because it was just fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's fun. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a game where you don't have to </connor>
<connor> think. You just have to
just do the thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and it was a lot of fun. </connor>
<joey> - I think I learned to
play it first in the arcades </joey>
<joey> and I remember the
only thing I could do. </joey>
<joey> I would just keep going until
I ran out of lives, </joey>
<joey> and then I'd just go
back to the beginning. </joey>
<joey> And then I'd just do that,
just keep doing that, </joey>
<joey> and it was just the most
boring game to play. </joey>
<joey> And then I remember playing it at home, </joey>
<joey> and I remember it was
just so much harder </joey>
<joey> and then that's when I
just got to the point, </joey>
<joey> like, "Wow, you know, this
is actually kind of fun." </joey>
<joey> - I think I remember the
first time I played- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, man, I remember the first
time I played Tetris. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think I was maybe like
eight or nine years old, </joey>
<joey> and I had one of those
souvenir Tetris games. </joey>
<joey> I just remember, I remember
my grandma bought it for me </joey>
<joey> because she was like, </joey>
<connor> "I know I'm going to
spend a lot of time with you, </connor>
<connor> so just give me something to do. </connor>
<connor> You know, </connor>
<connor> Tetris is something you'll
probably enjoy, so buy this." </connor>
<connor> And I remember I was playing it, </connor>
<garnt> and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I got a little bit better at this. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm actually enjoying this." </garnt>

```
<garnt> who are like trying to make it to america. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because when I went to </joey>
<connor> the UK a few years ago, </connor>
<connor> and I remember being like, </connor>
<connor> "What's this thing called?" </connor>
<connor> And then they're so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they're like,
"Oh, we don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> We just want to talk about it." </connor>
<joey> - No, because I remember going on </joey>
<joey> that flight from Japan to America, </joey>
<connor> and I was just like, "Oh, okay, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go to America." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, okay, okay." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Okay, well thanks for
supporting me on my way." </connor>
<connor> And then they're like, "We
have a flight to America." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Yeah, I guess so." </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Oh, fine." </connor>

<connor> and it's just like just the difference </connor>
<garnt> between japanese and american people </garnt>
<joey> right yeah right because like what </joey>
<joey> we're talking about is because </joey>
<joey> we're talking about here's a difference </joey>
<joey> that is so subtle that we don't really </joey>
<connor> know exactly what we're talking about because </connor>
<connor> we're talking about this difference between </connor>
<connor> japanese and american and like what does </connor>
<joey> japanese do to us and what does american do </joey>
<joey> to us and what does american do to us and </joey>
<joey> just like it's kind of like a very </joey>
<joey> different place to live in as well because </joey>
<joey> like this is like like a very different </joey>
<connor> place to live in Japan because </connor>
<connor> like the Japanese people live there </connor>
<connor> but it's kind of like a different </connor>
<connor> place to live in in Japan as well because </connor>
```

```
<joey> that I feel is very much like a separate </joey>
<connor> matter compared to the world of the
other countries that you go </connor>
<garnt> to as well you just go to these places </garnt>
<garnt> because there's a lot of different </garnt>
<garnt> cultures that exist in the world right </garnt>
<garnt> where one of them is like uh oh Japan </garnt>
<garnt> or Japan in general like there's a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> different cultures in every country </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but I feel like the world has </garnt>
<garnt> just become more of like a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> more open and like more open culture </garnt>
<garnt> because we've got so much more
open minded people now </garnt>
<joey> who are like really into japanese </joey>
<joey> culture right because it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like you can speak Japanese </joey>
<joey> but the Japanese people don't
really understand </joey>
<joey> Japanese culture and you're like you're </joey>
```

```
<joey> is that they speak a different language </joey>
<connor> than the Japanese one because </connor>
<connor> everyone speaks the same language and </connor>
<garnt> we can understand each other in the same </garnt>
<garnt> way that we can understand each other in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan and we can understand each other in the </garnt>
<garnt> same way that we can understand the </garnt>
<garnt> English and American we can understand </garnt>
<garnt> each other in the same way as we can </garnt>
<garnt> understand each other in the
same way but we can't </garnt>
<garnt> fully understand each other in the </garnt>
<garnt> same way that we can understand each other in </garnt>
<connor> the same way that we can understand each other </connor>
<connor> in the same way that we can understand each </connor>
<connor> other in the same way that we can understand </connor>
<connor> each other in the same way that we can </connor>
<connor> understand each other in the same manner </connor>

```
<garnt> is that they are like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> different, I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> They're all like different. </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird because
japanese people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you're a different country." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> But in Australia, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> we're like separate. </connor>
<connor> We have different accents, </connor>
<connor> but we all have different language. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And the only time I ever heard </connor>
<connor> that, you know, British
people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you're a different country." </connor>
<joey> - It's true, but yeah, </joey>
<joey> but like it is a lot more
difficult to explain </joey>
<joey> to people who speak the same language. </joey>
<joey> Especially when it comes to
like, when you go back to Japan </joey>

<joey> remember as a kid when I was like </joey>
<joey> just thinking about it and I was like </joey>
<joey> I don't like the way that my grandma </joey>
<joey> speaks because she just goes </joey>
<joey> like you know like me </joey>
<joey> and me and me and me you know what I </joey>

<joey> that's odd I'm like you know I don't </joey>

<joey> - And I remember I had to ask Sydney, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was like, "If
you're asking if you're </joey>
<joey> an american and you're asking
if you're a joey, </joey>
<joey> is it a big deal?" </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "No, no, no, no." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Okay, okay, okay." </joey>
<joey> - I can understand why it's a big deal </joey>
<joey> because I've been
living here for like two months </joey>
<joey> and I think I've seen
this side of America. </joey>
<joey> I can understand why people
would be confused, right? </joey>
<joey> People who are like,
"Oh, oh, I'm an american." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.

<garnt> i think americans are like i think </garnt>
<garnt> americans are like too honest and i think </garnt>
<garnt> that's why they're like so good at </garnt>
<garnt> trying to convince other countries to </garnt>
<garnt> just put americans in the same box because </garnt>
<garnt> they're like they can like make </garnt>
<garnt> them look like you're just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> talking to a [ __ ] brain dead </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> you're you're like [ __ ] like i i just </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to see americans in the same </garnt>

<connor> so there are like different levels </connor>
<joey> and different cultures and different </joey>
<joey> accents so sometimes it's just like </joey>
<joey> it's hard to understand right because </joey>
<joey> for example like in america people </joey>
<joey> have like accents that are very much like </joey>
<joey> you know like i guess they're from </joey>
<joey> like north america or something but it's </joey>
<joey> not like i don't know it's not like </joey>

<joey> oh yeah so basically yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> basically like the the american way of </joey>
<joey> thinking is that you know you have to go </joey>
<joey> home at a certain time yeah and then you </joey>
<joey> can tell when the Japanese are okay </joey>
<joey> because you know in the in the in in the </joey>
<joey> house in the morning and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> you can tell when they're okay because </joey>
<joey> you know it's it's it's kind of like a </joey>
<joey> little like a test for like for me it's </joey>
<joey> to me it kind of like it kind of like </joey>
<joey> a test to see if there's any like </joey>
<connor> differences between the two cultures </connor>
<joey> yeah it kind of it kind of is like a </joey>
<joey> test to see if there's any differences </joey>
<joey> between the two cultures yeah it's like </joey>
<garnt> oh it's the same with you for example </garnt>
<joey> like for example like you know going </joey>
<joey> to the gym and stuff like that you can </joey>
<joey> tell immediately you know when they're </joey>
<joey> having a good time you know in the </joey>
<joey> morning you can tell when they're having </joey>
<joey> like a good time in the morning </joey>
<joey> because like you know when you go to a </joey>
<connor> gym it's usually like the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> everyone's like you know everyone's like </connor>
<connor> you know everyone's like busy it's like </connor>
<connor> I'm not doing anything until I go to the </connor>
<connor> gym and then you get to the room and </connor>
<connor> everyone's like oh he's having a good </connor>
<connor> time right now he makes a good [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> out of it </connor>
<connor> because it's like they're having a </connor>
<connor> good time but like you know when you're </connor>
<connor> watching Japanese TV the the whole </connor>
<joey> episodes are just like oh yeah the </joey>
<joey> american way of thinking is that you </joey>
<joey> have to go home at a certain time yeah </joey>
<joey> and then you get to the room and it's </joey>
<joey> like oh I guess that was that was a </joey>
<joey> really cool way of thinking yeah </joey>
<joey> um but yeah I mean like I don't know a </joey>
<joey> lot about Japan personally but like a </joey>
<joey> lot of the way you're just like talking </joey>
<joey> about Japan and like the way that the </joey>
<joey> we live in Japan and everything like </joey>
<joey> that yeah yeah that's all like that's </joey>
<joey> a lot of it I mean it's just it's a </joey>
<joey> very very very slow way of thinking right </joey>
<joey> because it's a very very very slow way </joey>
<joey> of thinking and people in Japan are way </joey>
<joey> more like you know people are way more </joey>
<joey> open to ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh </joey>
<joey> yeah a lot more so yeah and a lot of ugh </joe ugh ugh
```

```
<garnt> it's like the most insane thing to do </garnt>
<garnt> in the world I mean yeah I think I think </garnt>
<garnt> you know I think the reason why a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the people who are like uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> foreign and uh uh international </garnt>
<garnt> people are like people who are more </garnt>
<garnt> like on the edge of the spectrum yeah </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason </garnt>
<garnt> um it's been like decades since the </garnt>
<garnt> last time ever like a single person is </garnt>
<garnt> like hey hey hey this is the only place </garnt>
<garnt> that you can live in every other country </garnt>
<garnt> you know because it's like you know </garnt>
<joey> it's it's it's it's it's it's it's not just </joey>
<connor> Japan it's not just the Japanese we </connor>
<joey> are Americans as well yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> it's it's like a system that is kind of </joey>
<joey> built for like certain things that </joey>
<garnt> Japan does but it's also like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the times some of the rules that are </garnt>
<garnt> broken yeah because it's it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> like the rules are broken in a way </garnt>
<garnt> where people are just like oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like and it's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> like I I think I I think as well the </garnt>
<garnt> same thing with like the uh </garnt>
<garnt> international community as well </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like I think the one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that I always find fascinating is like </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's like oh yeah Japan is cool </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you know I think it's because </garnt>
<garnt> there's no other country that you can </garnt>
<garnt> compare to Japan in that kind of </garnt>
<garnt> sense right it's like you know you know </garnt>
<garnt> everyone always sees Japan being like </garnt>
<joey> oh I think Japan is cool </joey>
<joey> but it is Japan is like one of the </joey>
<garnt> coolest countries in the world I think </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it is it is like in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> popularity yeah yeah yeah it is it is </garnt>
<garnt> it's like one of the most unique </garnt>
<garnt> cultures in the world you know and </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like I I I think a lot of the </garnt>
<garnt> reasons why people don't feel </garnt>
<garnt> strongly about Japan is because of that </garnt>
<garnt> culture but a lot of the ughs that you </garnt>
<garnt> see as Japanese people here are ughs </garnt>
<garnt> that ughs are just the ughs that </garnt>
<garnt> people will see ughs are ughs that </garnt>
<garnt> people ughs are ughs that ughs ughs </garnt>
<joey> that ughs ughs ughs ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh </joey>
<joey> ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh </joey>
<garnt> ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh

<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I'm just
kind of like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm not really a fan of the word, </garnt>
<connor> not that I'm not really a fan of the word, </connor>
<connor> but I don't know what it's like to be like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just the word. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just the word, right? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what it is to be like. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I don't know
what it's like for me </connor>
<connor> to be like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I like this country more than other things. </connor>
<connor> It's something that I like. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's the opposite
for Americans as well. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right? </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, </connor>
<joey> I don't know why Americans
are so fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> - I know, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it is about Americans. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I've said it on purpose, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know what it is about Americans </joey>
<joey> that's so much more different to normal. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just think that the
general stereotype of Americans </joey>
<joey> is just like, you know,
they're a little too British </joey>
<joey> to talk to the rest of
the world, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it is weird
that I feel like America </garnt>
<connor> is the only country that I feel </connor>
<connor> like is just like, </connor>
<connor> if I go to another country </connor>
<connor> and I feel like I have
the same mentality, </connor>
<connor> I have the same way of thinking. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why like... </connor>
<connor> - I think that Americans
are just so much more </connor>
<connor> British than you think. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why it feels so weird. </connor>
<connor> Like I feel like Americans are just people </connor>
<garnt> that have no interest in what
other people have to ughing ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I hate that word. </joey>
<joey> - What I love about Americans is that people </joeey>
<joey> don't ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh. </joey>
<joey> - ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh
```

```
<joey> you know what the most american
thing about japan is that </joey>
<joey> everyone here is so different to us </joey>
<joey> um and that's because you know </joey>
<joey> the people here are the same as us </joey>
<connor> yeah because the only way that we can </connor>
<connor> communicate with each other is through </connor>
<connor> what we call our differences </connor>
<connor> um so you know we talk with each other </connor>
<connor> through our differences and not even </connor>
<connor> that was our idea of having a conversation </connor>
<joey> that's already sounds like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> conversation I don't know why yeah </joey>
<garnt> um you know we don't talk about our </garnt>
<garnt> differences but what I love about japan </garnt>
<connor> is that you can you can really </connor>
<connor> distinguish between certain areas of </connor>
<joey> japan that are very similar to one another </joey>
<connor> but still very different to one another </connor>
<joey> um because you know some of the parts of </joey>
<joey> japan that like you can still see people </joey>
<connor> from across the world yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah but some of the different parts </joey>
<connor> are so different from each other </connor>
<connor> um and you can appreciate that you can </connor>
<connor> appreciate that a lot of the time when </connor>
<connor> the culture is like you know not </connor>
<connor> uniform but like you know you can get </connor>
<connor> across the differences and you can </connor>
<connor> appreciate the differences and the </connor>
<connor> value of them and the interaction that </connor>
<connor> that just there is no in between </connor>
<connor> um and you know the one thing I really </connor>
<connor> enjoyed about japan is that I just I </connor>
<connor> just I just I I like I I get to talk to </connor>
<connor> people who are like different from </connor>
<joey> me because you know they you know </joey>
<joey> you know they live here in the same </joey>
<garnt> household as me </garnt>
<garnt> and you know that the same way with you </garnt>
<garnt> they're not the same people as you </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because you know you get to talk </garnt>
<garnt> to them and they have the same </garnt>
<garnt> characteristics that you have as a </garnt>
<garnt> foreigner like you know there's something </garnt>
<garnt> about having that kind of </garnt>
<connor> interaction where I think it's a lot </connor>
<connor> of the iverse where the iverse is </connor>
<connor> the iverse of iverse where I think </connor>
<connor> it's iverse iverse where I like I get </connor>
<joey> to talk to people who I see iverse iverse </joey>
<garnt> iverse iverse iverse  </garnt>
<garnt>      </garnt>
<garnt>      </garnt>

<connor> - So basically I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm going to bring a copy
of "Eyeshield 21" and- </connor>
<connor> - And you can also watch the
episode with the boys as well. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, it was good." </joey>
<joey> And I was doing the voice
over for like a minute, </joey>
<joey> just fucking grunting the
words in my head. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Don't fucking
mute me, don't fucking mute." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> But I was like, "Yeah, no
mute, just keep doing it." </joey>
<joey> And so I do it for two minutes. </joey>
<joey> And then I'm just like... </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "Why is
this funny to you?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I was like, "Oh, it's
the most like Disney-esque, </joey>
<joey> like cartoonish fucking story ever." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Okay, this
is the best fucking thing. </joey>
<joey> "That's what I'm laughing at." </joey>
<joey> - The thing is I think the
equivalent of laughing at that </joey>
<joey> was I fucking cry when I
heard about the Oscars. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "This is sad." </joey>
<joey> - I think that was the first
time that I went to see the- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] The Oscars? </joey>
<joey> - I went to see
