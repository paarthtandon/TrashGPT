<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, this is
like the thing that's like, </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] You're gonna have to explain this. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, this is this
like, I don't know, </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, what is this? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, it's like
a Japanese game show thing. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but the concept of it is that, </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but the concept
of it is that, they're like, </garnt>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so this is the concept of it, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "Okay, so this
is a Japanese game show </connor>
<connor> and it's like, "Okay, so
we've got these like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so we've got these
like, weirdos who are like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna do this thing, right." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] What? </connor>
<connor> - Where it's like, </connor>
<connor> - What are you talking
about? </connor>
<connor> - It's like they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so we've got these
like four weirdos who are, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so we've got these
four weirdos who are gonna </connor>
<connor> "do this task and then
the first one to do it </connor>
<garnt> wins a million dollars."
- What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so it's like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I think
it's like a Japanese game show, </connor>
<connor> and then they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so they've got like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know, they've got like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so they've got like, 100
people who are like, "Okay, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna do this task and
then the first one to do it </connor>
<connor> wins a million dollars." </connor>
<connor> And they've got like,
- What? </connor>
<connor> - And they've got like, </connor>
<connor> they've got like, 40, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What? </connor>
<connor> - And I guess it's
like this Japanese game show </connor>
<connor> thing where they've got like
four different tasks </connor>

<garnt> - I like that, I like the aesthetic. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I like that too.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's just cool. </connor>
<connor> - I think the problem is </connor>
<connor> that it's a lot of times,
it's just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> oh, cool, you're wearing a scarf with your shirt, </connor>
<connor> and it's like, oh, cool, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna wear a scarf
with my shirt now as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It's just, it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's just like, yeah, yeah,
I'm gonna do that as well. </connor>
<connor> - And then you end up having </connor>
<connor> like three scarves on your neck, </connor>
<connor> and you look like a complete idiot, </connor>
<joey> 'cause no one would ever wear three scarves. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, if I was
a rich person, I'd probably wear, </connor>
<connor> I'd probably wear like three scarves. </connor>
<connor> - I'd probably just wear one
scarf that was like, </connor>
<joey> really long and like,
you know, just like, </joey>
<joey> just like have that one scarf
that was like, oh, </joey>
<joey> it's like just like, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're just like, oh,
I'm just gonna wear this. </joey>
<connor> I'm just gonna wear it
until it gets old, </connor>
<connor> and then I'll probably
just have a scarf burning ceremony. </connor>
<connor> - I don't, I just don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know.
- I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I think that's the only
reason why I don't wear one, </joey>
<connor> I think it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how to wear it right. </connor>
<connor> - I know how to wear it
right, I know I know how to wear it, </connor>
<connor> but I know that if I wear
a scarf, I'll end up with, </connor>
<connor> I'll end up looking like a fucking idiot, </connor>
<joey> so I don't want to risk it. </joey>
<joey> - So we didn't, so
we didn't have a scarf, </joey>

<connor> - Yeah, totally. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's like going to a restaurant </connor>
<connor> and you're like, you know, </connor>
<connor> if you order a steak, </connor>
<connor> you better fucking get steak. </connor>
<connor> And not like a hamburger, </connor>
<connor> you're like, you know, </connor>
<connor> you know, you don't just
get that, you know. </connor>
<connor> And that's like the same
thing with video games. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I think that's </joey>
<garnt> why some people get really
pissed off when the game </garnt>
<garnt> isn't up to par. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you're gonna
promise us, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like, if you promise us </garnt>
<joey> that this is a brand new Nintendo game, </joey>
<joey> then, you know, </joey>
<joey> then that's what you should
be getting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And if, you know, </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying that like,
Nintendo has done this, </joey>
<joey> but, you know, </joey>
<joey> where they've kind of
like misled people into thinking </joey>
<connor> that they're getting a new game, </connor>
<connor> and then it turns out
it's just a remake, </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's just, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I get why some people are mad. </connor>
<connor> But I think a lot of them
are just like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> there's a difference between
like a hype train, and a, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, a, you know,
something that's been, you know, </garnt>
<connor> promised to you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when people are like
hyped up for something, </connor>
<connor> you know, I think that's
a different level of, </connor>
<connor> you know, excitement to, </connor>
<connor> you know, I'm just hyped
because I'm hyped. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was hyped for the
fucking Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. </connor>
<connor> Like, honestly, I was hyped for that, </connor>
<connor> I was hyped for that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was hyped for that, but
I wasn't hyped for it </joey>
<. </joey>
<connor> to the point where I was thinking, </connor>
<connor> "If I don't get this, I'm gonna die." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't like, </connor>
<connor> "If I don't get this, I'm gonna be a." </connor </ </ </ </. </ </ </connor </connor </connor

<joey> - I'll take that, yeah. </joey>
- Oh, no don't do that. </joey>
<connor> - I'll take that.
(both laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I've gotta stop
saying that, man. </connor>
<connor> I've gotta stop saying that. </connor>
<garnt> - When I'm gonna do that. </garnt>
<connor> - I've gotta stop saying that. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna say that. </connor>
<connor> - I've gotta stop saying that. </connor>
<connor> - Well you can say that,
I'm gonna say it now. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - You're gonna say it now. </connor>

<jo and thn </. 20018 </. </ </. </..... </. </i>

<connor> That was my first experience of
like, "Oh, you know, </connor>
<joey> you can just have fun with
these two games, you know." </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I think that's
why I really enjoyed Tetris. </garnt>
<garnt> I really enjoyed playing it
as a kid. I think it's just </garnt>
<garnt> because it was just fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's fun. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a game where you don't have to </connor>
<connor> think. You just have to
just do the thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and it was a lot of fun. </connor>
<joey> - I think I learned to
play it first in the arcades </joey>
<joey> and I remember the
only thing I could do. </joey>
<joey> I would just keep going until
I ran out of lives, </joey>
<joey> and then I'd just go
back to the beginning. </joey>
<joey> And then I'd just do that,
just keep doing that, </joey>
<joey> and it was just the most
boring game to play. </joey>
<joey> And then I remember playing it at home, </joey>
<joey> and I remember it was
just so much harder </joey>
<joey> and then that's when I
just got to the point, </joey>
<joey> like, "Wow, you know, this
is actually kind of fun." </joey>
<joey> - I think I remember the
first time I played- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, man, I remember the first
time I played Tetris. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think I was maybe like
eight or nine years old, </joey>
<joey> and I had one of those
souvenir Tetris games. </joey>
<joey> I just remember, I remember
my grandma bought it for me </joey>
<joey> because she was like, </joey>
<connor> "I know I'm going to
spend a lot of time with you, </connor>
<connor> so just give me something to do. </connor>
<connor> You know, </connor>
<connor> Tetris is something you'll
probably enjoy, so buy this." </connor>
<connor> And I remember I was playing it, </connor>
<garnt> and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I got a little bit better at this. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm actually enjoying this." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I got to the point
where I realized, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I'm actually good at this. </garnt>, </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ </ g </ </ </ </ </ g </ g </ g </ garn </ garn e </ garn </ garn
