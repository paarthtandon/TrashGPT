<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's like an easy game. </connor>
<connor> You just like, when you
want to play the game, </connor>
<connor> and you have free time, </connor>
<connor> you just start playing it, </connor>
<connor> and then you just kind of
turn on your brain, right? </connor>
<connor> You're just like, okay,
I'm having a good time </connor>
<garnt> playing that game now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I could probably be playing, </joey>
<joey> like some kind of challenging game. </joey>
<joey> Like I've recently been
playing some kind of game </joey>
<joey> that's like really challenging, </joey>
<connor> like the Pokemon game. </connor>
<connor> Like I really wanna play that. </connor>
<connor> I want to do that. </connor>
<connor> I want to, like, </connor>
<connor> I want to do that in the long run. </connor>
<connor> But like, </connor>
<connor> how long is the game gonna
take me to get to that point? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, like I have
found a way to be like, </connor>
<connor> I can beat Pokemon in a long time. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know if that's just me, </connor>
<connor> but at least every time
I've beat Pokemon in a long </connor>
<connor> time, I'm just like, okay, </connor>
<connor> well I just know I can beat it. </connor>
<connor> And then I play it, and
then I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I just can't beat it anymore. </connor>
<connor> And then I just kind of
turn on my brain.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's like, I had this
thought the other day, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, what if
I'm just like actually, </connor>
<connor> like getting into the game, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like this
like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like I don't know if
it's just me or my brain, </connor>
<connor> but I guess I just kind of realized, </connor>
<connor> oh, maybe I just do
this for fun.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> Maybe I'm just playing it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean like, </connor>
<connor> you know, I don't really
give a shit about Pokemon, </connor>
<connor> but I feel the Pokemon game
is kind of the same thing. </connor>
<connor> Where the more you get into it, </connor>
<connor> the more you get into the
game and the more you just, </connor>
<connor> you think, I could do this,
and I could do this all day. </connor>
<connor> I can do this all day. </connor>
<connor> But I guess, </connor>
<connor> as a content creator, what's
the game to get invested in? </connor>
<connor>        </connor>
<connor>     </connor>
<connor>   I mean, </connor>
<connor> I think Pokemon is the same
thing, I just don't understand. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's the same thing. </connor>
<connor> -   </conno>
<connor> -  What     </conno>
<joey>           </joey>
<connor>            </conno>
<joey>             </joey>
<connor>            </conno>
<connor>              </conno>
<joey>                                                                                                                      </                                                                                                                                                                                     </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I just feel like there's
so much to talk about. </joey>
<joey> Just like a lot of things to talk about </joey>
<joey> and a lot of, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - The amount of time </garnt>
<garnt> I've spent on the internet
has just just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's way more than I
thought it would be actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I think that's because of the way </connor>
<connor> you think about it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I think
that's just the way </joey>
<joey> we view our time. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's just the way </connor>
<connor> we view our time on the internet. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, it's so much more. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I feel like there's a
bunch of things that I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you know, </connor>
<connor> you say you're a monkey, but you know, </connor>
<connor> it's like a lot of things,
like, you know, for example, </connor>

<joey> and so I was sitting there
on the desk reading my phone </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Oh, okay, </joey>
<joey> how about we just read the
same thing for each other? </joey>
<joey> Like, just let's do it." </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, "Oh, okay." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Okay, yeah, I
definitely don't need it." </joey>
<joey> But I'm like, I have no
interest in doing it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I just kept, I had no
interest in doing it, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause it was like, (coughing) </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a five page
A4 document, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't wanna read it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so I just kept reading it </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh, okay." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "So I just want to know
what's going on here?" </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, it's not gonna
be so much of a hassle </garnt>
<garnt> "but I want to know what
the fuck's going on here." </garnt>
<garnt> So I go to Google translate </garnt>
<garnt> and I look up what the
exact page is on Google translate </garnt>
<garnt> and Google translate tells
me exactly what the page is </garnt>
<garnt> on Google translate, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, "Oh." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, "Okay, okay." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh, okay," right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I couldn't get it
done because I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't know what the fuck
is going on here, right?" </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, "I
just want to know what </garnt>
<garnt> "the fuck is going on here." </garnt>
<garnt> So I go to Google translate, </garnt>
<garnt> and it tells me what the
exact page is on Google translate </garnt>
<garnt> and Google translate tells
me exactly what the page is </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "Oh, okay." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I couldn't get it done. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "I don't know
what the fuck is going on here. </garnt>
<garnt> "I just want to know what's going on here." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I go to Google translate, </garnt>
<garnt> and ugh, I was getting it done. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, (coughing). </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, (coughing). </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, (coughing), and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Please, please help me." </garnt>
<garnt> ugh, I was like, "What the fuck" </garnt>
<garnt> and like, I was trying to
look ugh in my ugh ugh in ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, </garnt>

<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I guess that
means you can leave it </connor>
<connor> for longer if you want. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I guess
that sounds like a cool idea </garnt>
<garnt> to you where you just like
drop the whole thing down </garnt>
<joey> and just leave it to the
people who know, you know, </joey>
<joey> who are familiar with this
and want to keep this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I feel like </connor>
<connor> you should be fine with that, </connor>
<connor> but you know, </connor>
<connor> I feel like you should
just be fine with them </connor>
<connor> having your stuff and
not letting people do it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I mean, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's a little bit weird </connor>
<garnt> if you're doing something
like that with YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like that's
the right way to go about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, that's, that's
what makes it interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's something entirely new, </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, I feel
like being an outsider </garnt>
<garnt> in this kind of like
intervention, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a little bit different
to what you have to do </garnt>
<garnt> to be an outsider. </garnt>
<garnt> But I know that a lot of
YouTubers, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> especially when you are on
the internet, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> have a lot of free time. </garnt>
<connor> - I know a lot of YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who have a lot of free
time where they work </connor>
<connor> on some of the videos </connor>
<connor> and they get to do certain things. </connor>
<connor> And you know, </connor>
<connor> when you have a lot of free time, </connor>
<connor> I feel like, you know, </connor>
<connor> there is a lot of people who are like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I'm just gonna do my own thing. </connor>
<connor> I don't need to worry about this. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna do my own thing. </connor>
<connor> And then there's people, </connor>
<connor> when they're on the internet,
who are like, oh, </connor>
<garnt> this is me, this is my
free time, I'm gonna do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, there's a
lot of people who are like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, I'm just gonna do my own thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna do my own thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, this is what I like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is what I'm like, this
is what I like doing. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - But I feel like, I feel like </connor>

<joey> - Well, it depends on the song. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think some songs are
just so fucking hard to listen to </joey>
<joey> that it's just like, okay,
this is an album. </joey>
<joey> It is a fucking amazing album. </joey>
<connor> But the problem is is that, you know, </connor>
<connor> you can kind of be like, okay, </connor>
<connor> this is an amazing fucking album </connor>
<connor> but the problem is is that
it just feels like a mediocre </connor>
<connor> album, right? </connor>
<joey> It's like, it's not great. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I think like,
I feel like that's a good </joey>
<joey> place to end it. </joey>
<joey> I like the music a lot but I
feel like it's just a mediocre, </joey>
<joey> like a mediocre album. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, it's
just like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't really like it. </joey>
<joey> It's one of those albums where I know </joey>
<joey> I like the music but I
feel like the lyrics, </joey>
<joey> especially the lyrics to
like "Don't Understand Me" </joey>
<joey> and I feel like it's
probably the best song </joey>
<joey> in like "86" or something. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know what was going on. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, it's the
same way with a lot of, </connor>
<connor> like, you know, </connor>
<joey> you can listen to a
fuckton of songs with lyrics </joey>
<joey> and like, and you can understand
what they're saying, </joey>
<joey> but like, some of the songs
that are just so fucking hard </joey>
<joey> and you can't really
understand them in a way </joey>
<joey> that's so subtle and so
like, unnerving and just like, </joey>
<joey> so depressing, you know,
that they just, you know, </joey>
<joey> it's like there's a sadness
or there's a morbidness </joey>
<joey> that comes out of like the song. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like the reason
I love this album is that </joey>
<joey> the lyrics are so fucking
concisive and just so subtle. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like, I don't
know why I love this song. </joey>
<joey> I love the fact that it
always has the most, </joey>
<joey> it always has the most
concisive lyrics. </joey>
<joey> I love that. </joey>
<joey> I love that. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Oh, he's a teacher." </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Oh, he's an
idiot" or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - I love that. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I love how, like, </joey>
<joey> he just kept using the word
idiot in the same way </joey>
<joey> where it's like, "idiot." </joey>
<joey> And I love how he just
kept using the word like, </joey>
<joey> "And then he goes, "Oh
cool, but then he goes, </joey>
<joeey> "but then he goes, "Oh, what
the fuck is going on here?" </joeey>

<connor> - It's like the only
time you can do it. </connor>
<joey> - You're the only person
who can do it just like. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the only time
you can do it, but it's like, </joey>
<joey> I think there are other things that you can do </joey>
<joey> that are much more fun
and more relaxing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can do like a climbing
and like a climbing thing. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I like climbing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I do like a climbing. </joey>
<connor> - I can do like a climbing
and climbing special. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I like climbing a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I like climbing as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but like, I don't
really want a climbing thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because you just go up. </joey>
<joey> - I do, I do. </joey>
<joey> - But like, I like climbing
a lot of things, I like, </joey>
<joey> I mean, I did like a climbing thing </joey>
<joey> but it was quite expensive. </joey>
<joey> - I did a climbing thing. </joey>
<joey> - I did a climbing thing </joey>
<joey> and that was the only
time you could do it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's the only
time I could do it. </joey>
<joey> I think I did like maybe like a climbing </joey>
<joey> like a climbing kind of thing </joey>
<joey> but I did it for like a week
and a half and I was like, </joey>
<joey> I need to do a stronger
thing for this one. </joey>
<joey> - I think you need to do
like a really really good </joey>
<joey> and long lasting thing to get
your body used to doing it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not saying that
like a climbing special </joey>
<joey> is the most fun thing ever. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I thought that
like a climbing special </joey>
<joey> was the most fun thing ever. </joey>
<joey> - I thought that when you do it, </joey>
<joey> it does the same thing that
a video game special </joey>
<joey> is the most fun thing ever. </joey>
<joey> - But like a video game
special is just like, </joey>
<joey> you get used to it. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I do for video
games, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can do it for like two weeks. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, normally I would like, </joey>
<joey> even if it wasn't a special, </joey>
<joey> I mean, I would like
do it anyway for video games </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing with it. </joey>
<joey> But like I think the reason why I've like, </joey>
<joey> I can't do a lot of
like video game sports </joey>
<joey> is 'cause I've never been
able to do any in my life. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And just doing that, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I don't wanna
be doing a video game orto </joey>
<garnt> for like orto orto orto orto orto orto orto orto </garnt>
