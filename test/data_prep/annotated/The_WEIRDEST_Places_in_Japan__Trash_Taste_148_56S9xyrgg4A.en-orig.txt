<SPEAKER_04> why have there been like already I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like you know my my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I think a lot of people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> travel to Japan especially our age like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they like are already kind of into Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and already have like researched a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um they don't get normally like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dragged here and even like people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like want to visit here will normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like look up stuff to do or we'll look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up something and and so my parents kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like even though they are interested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japan and they they were really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really excited for the trip like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't like research they weren't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my God what's on San educator oh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God how should I well they don't have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and like I realized oh my God I have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I have to explain everything right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas like sometimes when friends come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> over it's like okay I don't have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explain everything and they can get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around well like they didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> anything yeah most people who visited </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of have their own motives already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah they figured stuff out and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they they maybe planned the trains and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff but you know I think everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of sounded overwhelming when I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> told them I was like okay I'll just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> figure it out so like I booked them uh a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taxi from Narita to to take them to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel which is like two hours right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> expensive taxes for me yeah yeah I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paying it why didn't you just throw them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on the narrator Express oh because I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like man they're gonna they're gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> overwhelmed absolutely first time in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Asia of having to figure it out like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also the first time in Asia yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay yeah and I think there's still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like and I realize that everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> has this where you're like I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like English will be okay right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like and it's like yeah no it won't be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay maybe on the Naruto Express yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> okay but like it's like I'm sure like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is not me being like all right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not about I do I think they could figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it out yeah they could figure it out but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's like all right do I really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to put that stress on them right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right away it's like okay I could just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get them a cab and I'll front the cost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then all they have to do is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look for the guy with the name and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently that somehow that [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too because it was like 4am because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were in Hawaii yeah and I was like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know I was making sure that when they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> landed I was like hey did you get in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cab okay is it all good and they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's all good it's all good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I I want I was going to go to sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I knew they got to the hotel and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they could find like you know rest and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I I wouldn't have to worry then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about you know because I booked the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hotel I booked everything everything is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all booked by me and I was like I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't want like a [ __ ] up where maybe I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> put the name wrong or something you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what kind of did actually [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I I remember uh I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because uh his parents it's not it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just his parents that have come along </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we have a friend from England who's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> landed on the same day as your parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two days after two days after all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I remember thinking uh so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember Conor was like mentioning oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I'm gonna come back from Hawaii </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then pick my parents up and I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait a minute I was checking the dates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was having to make sure the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dates of when our friend lands as well I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like wait a minute Connor mentioned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his parents come back on this day yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we fly back on from Hawaii the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> after that was the one thing I did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> annoying I'm like does Connor realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this or I did realize that and I told my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> parents that but then I didn't tell my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friend that so yeah it's kind of like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> miscommunication because there's so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then myself which is already I'm Not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Gonna Keep in track of this yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so I you know I got them a taxi and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the Hawaii hotel room and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like oh we think the taxi driver </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is going the wrong way I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think the taxi driver would go the wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way I gave him the address how would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> your parents know I don't know because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just freaking out right they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just haven't been to it and everything's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> new and the tax driver doesn't speak any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> English because of course I don't speak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> English uh and so they call me up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like I think the taxi director </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> told me well shouldn't my mum calls me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> while she's like I I don't think they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know where to go yeah I replied in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> English I was like Mom I don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they can speak English I don't think you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to speak to me in Welsh </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> they're like yeah we think the taxi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> driver is going the wrong way I'm like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't I think it's fine so they hand the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> phone to the taxi driver and the taxi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> driver is like sounds like a young woman </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she just sounded like terrified that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think my parents just shoved the phone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to her and then some weird guys talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japanese to her and so I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hazel Ransom calling I was like hey uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my parents are just kind of nervous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um do you have the address and she just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounded like utterly panicked by that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> question and I was like all right then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she was like oh she's like freaking out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can imagine how it is yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounded very flushed and very panicked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like all right then and I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like I'll just hand it back she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> handed it back and I was like yeah she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knows where she's going I didn't know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was like I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meanwhile everyone in that cab is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sweating yeah I'm like don't worry about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it I'm sure she knows and of course she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> knew where she was going yeah yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like this is so so stupid but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you know and then I think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proceeded to be like all right let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every little thing where I'm not there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would like worry about it and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like double check with me and so the um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first day we had to do we have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> record trash station no I had to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something I had to do a live stream yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so I was like hey just go here for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lunch walk around and so they're walking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around and they're texting me stuff and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like oh we found like a a cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to drink and they sent me a picture and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my God it looks like the shittiest Cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in all of Japan it's like it's like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it has an outside Terrace and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> let me show you a picture okay it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> unfair to even call this a Terrace do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they not just think to like walk into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like a Starbucks I think I think they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't want to go to Starbucks and also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they were also like look at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that doesn't even look like a cafe and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is something that I've learned and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know this because I had the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> myself I said like it is super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> intimidating in Japan for people who've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> never gone to Japan or Asia in general </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to to to imagine having to go into a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> building without being able to see it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately what's inside yes yeah so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think for them my parents it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay well Terrace equals I can kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see what's going on and then there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also hundreds of miscommunications they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keep telling me about where they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my mom is obsessed with cider as right a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> British woman yeah wants to drink siding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> alcohol excited yeah which just doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exist in Japan no no and in America it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> called hard cider but here it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do they call it Cedar but then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's also normal cider which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you can imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but even this is just assuming because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> she's like oh do you have silent like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes we have cider and they bring up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and so this has been a constant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> frustration right now where I'm always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like every single place we go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm she's like do they have side I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like Mom they don't have cider I'll tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you when they have cider mum which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> never because they won't ever have it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like ironically enough the only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> place in Japan that has cider are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> British pubs yeah exactly yeah that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you probably uh find more chance of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> getting a Cider at a hub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God imagining your parents in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> hole yeah it's really nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean I mean I I get it right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I remember when I first moved to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan right there's there's a big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> barrier you have to get past in terms of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just going into a restaurant and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> committing to opening the door yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right so it's terrifying yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because once you commit now like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still do it but yeah there's that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> millisecond I mean I hated it and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> could speak the language yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're like once you open a door </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like [ __ ] I've committed to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting down at this yeah I don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to be the [ __ ] that immediately turns </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had to become because you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was at some point I've been sharing my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friend come with my parents around at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same time right yeah and it means </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like and they all love drinking so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had to become the vibe Checker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which I mean I have to you just have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walk into a you know a narrow building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like the fifth floor of some really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sketchy looking thing and I have to pop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my head and be like oh no no sorry yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go out and it's really awkward but and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like my dad as well he's um he loves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> beer and every single time when we get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we get a beer he's like what beer is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know I haven't I've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> questioned it in three years it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always comes out tasting Goods so I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've noticed every time he asks me I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I just don't know just drink it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's me it's fine like I every single </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time he likes the beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like it's it's very fun taking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> them around but after like like multiple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> days of this I've been getting this same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> question I'm like I'm gonna lose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my mind being asked these questions over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and over again but it's been fun they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love the bullet trains everyone seems to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love bullet trains as well every foreign </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> person I think people from outside Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just like find that concept so insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because it's like well like I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like China is the only other country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has trains that go that fast yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> think I think no Europe has high speed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> rails does it yeah I don't think it's as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> well connected nearly as well connected </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah or run on time or because I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a million people a day use the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> shinkansen which is like insane amounts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of well I think it's all just also just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I wouldn't say like the marketing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like the prestige because it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like one of the first and one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the most famous right it was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese bullet train yeah like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when this is when like Japan was in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Heights or when you think Japan you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think the bullet train yeah this is when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan was like the height of the center </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of Technology sure you know yeah they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loved it yeah and that that image is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like state because even my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right I was I asked my mom and dad when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they come to Japan what do you want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do my dad's like take me in the bullet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> train I was like that's uh out of where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of everything that's what you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to do okay Dad okay he's just like I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> excited for the bullet train yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> mean it's fun it's not about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> destination it's about the journey yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly that is the destination the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> bullet train is great seeing at the when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the train leaves at 9 57 I can tell them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look at the clock when it turns to 957 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the trains oh that's my favorite thing I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might not watch watch yeah it's gonna </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> are they like generally okay with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> food like is the food palette wide or I </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> place that specialized in raw meats and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fish uh and we realized that after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sitting down and like half the menu was </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> my thing was I wanted them to try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dirt cheap sushi and so you know like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is what it should taste like yeah </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> everything again they loved it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> except for uni uh seochin which they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> none of us like that is a hard bargain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is the Marmite of Japan so I'm slowly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> starting to find out now yeah Eugene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> came with us as well and yeah tried uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> our friend of ours uh did he like uni no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he hated it immediately texted my Lane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying hey I don't like sea urchin and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then Malene responded oh you probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't have Goods here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> aliens like Islam Michelin star yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my weekly slander yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um yeah uh tried um so I also we were in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh okay so I'll tell you what we did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first of all yeah where did you take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> them so uh did like uh I thought let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I I haven't got like super long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like we're still working here like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just got off the bullet train from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bringing them back and I'd come straight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> here to record </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so I wanted to make kind of a densely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> packed like four or five days of no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ghost ball I hope no girl's boss sadly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's only Sydney thing man yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a tough show I also realized that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like maybe because Sydney's family is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably a lot more outgoing than my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> family like they'd probably be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interact themselves whereas for me it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like I had to translate everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't even understand everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 100 of the time right just imagine your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> family at a [ __ ] girls bars the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> funniest thing ever after some really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> weird bars that I was insistent on going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to because I thought it'd be really fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> experience I think they're pretty fun so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the first day we went to a uh it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an Onsen Winery thing I think we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> talked about before so I took them to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there and they loved that that was great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah did they go in the answer they did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like a lot of convincing no no I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of like I kind of like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't tell them anything about anywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were going to I was like you I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tell you but it's not gonna mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anything yeah I told them I was like hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go in the spa do it here we go have fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they I think they they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely shy about it but I think they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoyed it yeah yeah yeah I mean who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't like a hot spring it's nice yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly and then the food has </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> I've never been to you went to Canada </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah why because it's kind of on the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's can on the way so I drove there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's better than Toyama that's for sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah I thought it was like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> two-hour drive and I was like ah Church </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever it's a four hour drive it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> long yeah and I was just like it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a highway the whole time and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> losing my mind just driving straight for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like four hours it sucked but we got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there and then it started like pouring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it down and holy [ __ ] there's so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tourists in kanazawa really so many I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know I know was kind of like one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those hidden tourist places uh I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think he's hidden well hidden in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sense of like when you compare it to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like Tokyo dude it sounds more busy than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh like all soccer for tourism </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really dude it was crazy how many and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the only person I know who's been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to come along I I I'd never been before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'd not heard much and then I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like okay well I should go because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently there's this famous Park and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff yeah yeah and I went there and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought oh it's okay this way this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of boring actually I think we hit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my head now I'm realizing yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the stuff that people talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can do in Japan it's just stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's accessible only by like bullet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trains yeah exactly because like all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good stuff in my mind you have to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either drive to or get a train then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drive yeah like oh genuinely like a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of the really amazing and fun stuff in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan you do have to rent a car or drive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just so annoying I mean I mean I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like that because to me it means </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> less tourists are there yeah I mean I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't disagree but I would say the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like if it's your first time in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're going to be amazed by anyway but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know for people like living in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like us where we've seen a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I guess like normal tourist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff than a more like some of the more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting things you have to get to by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> car well I think that's why my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoyed nigato a lot because it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really quiet it was like no no foreign </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tourists at all yeah it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pleasant really good vibes very quiet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we went to Canada and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really busy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um you know it's nice looking around the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> park and stuff but I I was like I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking around this park and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> damn I think like Shinjuku Park is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> better than this one and I was like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my parents thought that too and I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh [ __ ] came all this way to this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> damn Park and I think Shinjuku is better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah what else what else is there to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's like from the park what is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> famous I've heard I've heard so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I know kanazawa is a really uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> famous tourist attraction for a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese people yeah there's a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um old shopping areas I think yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> styled off the Japanese stuff we didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really go to that and uh that night I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of my parents even though it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> famous for it you know it's you know uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Carlos I was famous for fish typically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right um but I was like well we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should try uh we should try um uh uh eel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was called again we should try on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Aggie and I I wasn't gonna tell them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because my my dad had mentioned like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> few days before he's like I don't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> eel and I was like okay [ __ ] okay well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh I don't think this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so I was gonna not tell them that it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eel yeah so I found this really nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unagi restaurant that happened to be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chain actually they had a few locations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around Japan but it was really good and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good reviews uh and went in there </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> giant Clay Pot oh yeah where they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> put all of you in agony and they put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like three portions in that instead of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing three little boxes that sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good and uh it was super [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and my parents loved it they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah this shit's good did you tell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them afterwards yeah I told them I told </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> who gave it away I just thought it was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fail proof yeah they were like oh it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> tastes like chicken I was like wow okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've done all my life but they loved it </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> think the counter sale was all right I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mean I was kind of like this I was lame </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but I think like for one day I is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just like one of those prefectures you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't really hear a people going to and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like what's like known in that prefix </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like you know Japan always has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that thing of like oh in this prefecture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're famous for this this and this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like you hear about Ishq and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like what are you famous for it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we have kanazawa it's like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> okay but what's this it's like yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mean I I think it's I I feel like I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> traveled enough of Japan now to be a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh be able to like kind of rate some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the places I mean I've got like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ton of places here so I feel like I can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> accurately tell you what's a fun place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and what's not I guess I was okay also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was raining so it was also just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coming okay as well yeah yeah it doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it definitely affects your judgment and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then we went to Kyoto the day after ah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how was that how many tourists yeah oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my god dude because I I've only been to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Kyoto now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during the pandemic and I've been three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times during the pandemic and it's time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was slowly busier than the last it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was never busy yeah like the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went and you can watch this in my um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I did the British town but yeah we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's in Kyoto this British town and we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> filmed at the Kyo mizudera the the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> picture of Japan and every single </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tourist picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and and you can see in that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> video actually like we filmed the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can see in the background </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's nobody there there's no one at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this Temple </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and it was it was like really cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I thought oh this is kind of neat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I went there this time I was like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never want to go to Kidder ever again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] sucks like it's like shoulder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to shoulder yeah the whole thing like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't you can't do anything fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was actually a pretty cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um Craft Beer Stand like right at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bottom of the street right before the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kill music that was kind of cool it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's a good beer it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> standing thing it was kind of fun other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than that but everything else was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay the views were cool I think they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoyed that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um uh yeah we went around temples but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dude I got recognized so much it's kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like all right I felt bad for my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> parents because in the kill music we got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stopped like nine times just walking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around there's nowhere to go as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this is like everywhere shoulder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to shoulder but I think my parents kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of they they kind of got a kick out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing people recognize me they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've done this three times before yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would if my friends were like hey Connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's go to Kyoto let's go look at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Temple I'm like absolutely not like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll I'll come out and drink later yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like have a good time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to get recognized I don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about that it's just a dude it's so busy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for me yeah I just I don't enjoy it even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> even for people who are like okay in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> crowd like just how packed Kyoto gets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially at Nara as well like those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those like I think are like the top two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> places where it's like it's literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like going to an anime convention it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like you're [ __ ] standing like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this and it's like and you can't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> get like a good view because you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] look over the heads of everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like is this is it an age </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing where you just like I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if it is but it has been for me because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I used to be like so up for like going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into big crowds or you know seven age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thing yeah yeah and then the more older </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got the less patience I had for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> big groups of people to the point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now I would do anything to just avoid it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if I can I think it's an age thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think all three of us are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we're just like yeah okay here's if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a giant crowd it needs to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that makes the giant crowd in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my mind worth the sacrifice yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly something about this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like such moving but something about not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> being able to walk the pace I want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> walk just just gets to me and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's such a small thing but if there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] penguin walk right like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah little little tiny baby steps yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if you just penguin walk like uh because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we went to uh Shibuya like last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weekend yeah and you were like uh where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you and uh I was like oh I'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> around the corner 10 minutes later he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> text me again being like where are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I literally was just like penguin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Walking In This Crowd I was literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just around the corner and I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> shibia never again never [ __ ] again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that that's shoulders </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my God and they told me it was too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> busy yeah I was like yeah okay well yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the point yeah like the crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was really busy yeah of course it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um and uh yeah every night we went out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well security we went out and luckily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a friend who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um was from Kyoto who I I hang out with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a few times when I went last time and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd show me a bunch of bars so it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great excite a bunch of bars that I knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that were great yeah they were good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vibes and I like it when they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not on the street and a lot of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bars weren't so it's great because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can actually always get in yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then um which if you cocktail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bars and then I was like okay I got an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> idea I want to take them I just looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my phone I was like is there an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> airsoft Barn nearby and there seems to </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> Nightlife area of Kyoto is like pretty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wild like oh yeah it's very loud and </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> sounds like I was like that's gaming and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did pretty good of course but yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more importantly uh there is such a </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> friend came with us as well and he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] awful at singing and he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> screaming I of course Eugene would be of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> course of course he would be off Pitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he doesn't strike me as a bit of a scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah he was like all off Pitch screaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then this guy was smoking his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cigarettes before we came in in a moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when our friend started singing he was </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> people when they come to Japan like they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel really like intimidated by like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> transporting getting places yeah and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> guess because we've just done it so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goddamn much it's like dude there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always a way yeah you don't need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> worry about it you can figure it out in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the morning yeah and like luckily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because I I knew that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um uh also I can get super close I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah sure there's 30 minutes away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I'm sure there's like commuter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trains and you can get so I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't worry about it and there happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be a train station in like uh that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had this train that went all the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there and it was more of like a it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like a hybrid between a commuter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> train and like a shinkansen where it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all the trains were laid out like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh like shinkansen's where you get like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a seat and table yeah and I found this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> train I don't know why I'm gonna be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a trainer for a second I even though I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't normally care I so we went to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like normal ass train right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we go down to the platform and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like this kiosk on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> platform where you could buy tickets to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the premium car the green car not the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> green car because this is like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different line entirely right right they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had their own branding and [ __ ] and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was like a kiosk it was like if you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go in the premium car you're going to </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> the thing uh bear in mind this whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> journey from uh Kyoto to Osaka it was </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> got to Osaka did that and uh yeah walked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around or soccer took them to like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pokemon Center there thoughts on body </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because they were like they wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> buy stuff for like nephews and stuff and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> dude there was a line of like 200 people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to buy stuff something like this or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something of course there would be yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there was a retro arcade and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should come you should check out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some retro arcade I thought they weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna like it much but my dad was he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just playing Gallagher for like an hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like okay I can still play Metal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Slug until he's done I was I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm chill with this chill out just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crushing it yeah yeah yeah I took him to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> almost like a castle which is probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my favorite touristy thing that I did it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looks like a castle was kind of sick I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the touristy stuff in Japan I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> either haven't done or have done and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought it was kind of meh yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of it's super overrated or super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Rams um but also like a castle actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the view from it was really cool and all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the historical stuff uh was uh really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cool and quite interesting although </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like two floors of the castle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which you weren't allowed to photograph </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't know why that I'm wondering </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the rules are behind this but this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude had the worst job ever he had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> giant no photography sign and whenever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> anyone tried to take a photo or whipped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it out he would scream and run across </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> selling no photo no photo and I can't I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just imagine myself like man what a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> job yeah just every tourist known to man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your job is to figure out what goddamn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> language to shout at them in because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people are gonna take photos yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just gonna do it like is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just how it is and it should make me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think like what is the what is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thought process behind not a lot that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy impact ain't getting paid enough man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude nowhere near enough but also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> polyglot goes to the efforts 12 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> languages and he gets that job you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> got to figure out like you're like damn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I think you just defaults to English </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on everyone yeah I don't understand why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they we couldn't take pictures of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because we should Miniatures of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> castle Yeah I was just in my head I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I don't I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know like people are gonna take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> pictures like crazy of course I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know if I'm just being like a cynical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like maybe you should just let him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> take pictures I mean Japan's rules </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concerning like no photography is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it can be quite agreeing it's confusing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's just only those two floors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but the view from the castle is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing uh if you ever get the chance to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to Osaka I mean I'd recommend it I'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it also that Deal's great yeah yeah I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally I I never do the touristy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> stocks I think it's so lame </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but this one actually was it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably the best view of all soccer as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well you get such a cool panoramic view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole uh whole city also Osaka is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just a really fun city yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um I took them to at night I took them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> body and they were like yeah I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen it at movies before they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of underwhelmed by it they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I guess it's kind of cool I mean I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> guess yeah it is just just lights in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I get it you know one impressed by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the giant [ __ ] crab mechanical thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they have and like one of the crab </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> stores oh we didn't go past that one I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know I just tempted the I we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> walked along the river yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um and uh yeah then then we went out to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> drinking and it was fun I mean also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are pretty fun yeah I think I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> went to the one bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there was just only foreigners by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> accident uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like we went out of this cocktail bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I thought sick dude I found a sick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cocktail bar yeah and so we walk in and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just like one of the tourist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person in there yeah so in the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we're drinking our wandering the entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Place fills with tourists yeah and I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like damn this not not that there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything wrong with that because I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> technically you wanted to give them like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a Japanese I was like I don't even find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> them a cool spot and I thought I found a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool spot yeah but obviously I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> live in Osaka and then of course I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> found the one where it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone every goddamn tourist found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um but then I found this really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cool like if you're looking I I got this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this ad for this part it looks so weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like dude I was like I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know if we should go but our friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Museum was like we should go but I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like I don't know so it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> called a Magic Bar okay that sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a very Eugene thing yeah so then here's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the deal here's the deal so we found it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right I saw it and I was like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah and then his story he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we should go check it out and I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's in like literally on the Alley that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> has just all of the sex stuff yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um it's on like the fifth floor of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really dirty ass building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know and it's like one of like six </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bars on this fifth floor of this tiny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> building so there's like Max five seats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the thing is and this is what had me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> worried was that if you sit down on this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Magic Bar you had to sit there for 70 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes because you're paying for 70 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes of magic regardless oh okay yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so he does a little show for you yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you drink and it's like okay like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bartender is a magician and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 3500 Yen each per person to sit down and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the bartender's a magician yeah now I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was like I this could be either the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing ever or just the weirdest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever yeah and so he's like we should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> check it out I'm fine fine I'll check it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out I'll I'll and again I'm the vibe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> check I have to go in see if they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool with a white guy walking in and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know even I'm talking you know and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll explain to Eugene I'm like listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like QuickTime events the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three sentences matter so much in these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bars you have to nail every interaction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japanese for them to be comfortable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't have communication 100 yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> all the first three questions I'll ask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you all the first three sentences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because otherwise they'll get super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nervous and they'll be like actually no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't sit down sorry we're reserved or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah one of the excuses right so you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need to nail it and I'm like oh God I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hate I hate doing this because like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just annoying because then I I'm like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talk to them and then I'm like here are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my very foreign people with me you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as if it's me and then it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone else speaks Japanese it's kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of easier yeah yeah you know but if I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna be the translator and sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also like this is a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dialect as well yeah I don't understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what they're saying and it's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> awkward but anyway we go in this bar and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no one in here and it looks like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a just a normal ass weird bar yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just like it's just a bar with a </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> day and it's like oh my God it's tough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you forget especially like after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> taking care of people how much you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take for granted in terms of how you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know like the way the country functions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for sure like you know when you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> asked like the littlest thing for every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thing that kind of like adds up and adds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> up and adds up yeah every single time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah they asked me especially if your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dad is asking what beer this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> um like they had cover charge in one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> place because current charge is pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> common in Japan yeah yeah 500 to 1000 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yen you get a snack or something and my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dad was like did I did I get scammed and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like no no it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's normal but it uses on guard with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> everything yeah yeah like an ATM he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like is that ATM safe and I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're all safe every ATM's safe I mean </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> everything's safe here don't worry like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anything it's all good it's all safe no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one's trying to scam you no one's trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do anything Japan's probably well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like one of the countries in Asia where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can feel most at home feeling safe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not getting scammed just stay away from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the back streets of shinjuk and shubia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll be good yeah yeah just don't say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes if someone asks you to come to the </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> while if you're if you've never used it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but credits my parents they they keep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying yeah they don't they don't they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> never like ask for a knife and fork </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> um brought them on knife and fork and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I think your dad was like no I will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not admit defeats and I was like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's going as that all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> damn no well I think that's the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> thing right it's like it's just the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think the one thing I always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciate about whenever I'm taking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people to Japan or you know wherever is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like if if they're just like even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> willing they don't even have to like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fact the fact that they're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> willing to participate in the culture is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like the best thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're trying everything and then that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know appreciating every aspect of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the culture which I'm very fun I knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they would but you know in your head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're always worried you're like oh man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they you know they they don't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> care that much about Japan so yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they wouldn't yeah well the one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think is the hardest and even for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me this is kind of tough is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to resist that urge to let the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> taxi driver pick up your luggage because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes the Dude Looks like he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90. he's like half your size and he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to pick up your heavy ass suitcase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and like ah dude it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's you can obviously pick it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like he's fine to do it and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's sometimes just easier I'm like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let him let him do it trust me it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna be so annoying if you like if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had this problem sometimes when you when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you try to put your luggage in and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like no I want to do it and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like this whole thing of like okay oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've had the opposite happen where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a super super old guy like frail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as [ __ ] trying to pick up my luggage and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he like went to grab it he didn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like try to lift this thing up he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally just grabbed the handle for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about two seconds and then just let go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he looked at me he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's like the like Asian kid in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> me because my parents are like pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old now so I've gotten used to being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no dad for [ __ ] sake you're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your 70s yeah let me carry them I always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> want to do it yeah yeah so I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time I get to the taxi I'm ready </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a little not not a fight but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm ready to fight him to let me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know like give me that [ __ ] okay get in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the taxi okay I'm a young healthy man I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can do this okay don't worry about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I mean I try to do that and if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if it is actually heavy I'm like dude no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah no don't do it yeah it's like light </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like all right it's okay fine yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of course yeah yeah because it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes especially at least for my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parents I told them to do that because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like don't you're not gonna be able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to communicate with them it's gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> awkward just just just let them do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and then also let them cook do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not do not open the doors don't close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the doors don't open the door oh it does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just don't and this is the hardest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to tell people because I feel like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can tell them and they just don't they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't do it because it's like it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something in your brain it's hardwired </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah where you open the door and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> close the door to the taxi yeah but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like do not touch the doors I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to don't do it they will open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it for you so they they're kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting used to it and stuff I don't get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it it's it's tough It's hard traveling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of Japan and unlearning that the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amount of [ __ ] times I've traveled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out and I've just for one second walk </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> like sometimes like you know if I'm say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like at a hotel right and the person in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> front of me is like foreign and then you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> like let's see let's see how they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> resolve this let's see how they passed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this test so it's a case by case I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like you know like there's every now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you know like I it could be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe be like in a Tokyo station or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something and I see like a family that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like clearly struggling to get around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then sometimes if I have time I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like oh you're okay like let me help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you out stuff like that uh yeah but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> depends on my mood really like or if I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't know if you're busy like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> get it you got to go somewhere yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly but sometimes I just kind of sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back and be like I want to see how they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> figure it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a few interactions right there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like one coffee shop and uh it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty big coffee trip actually it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really nice one um but they don't they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> would call out your number obviously in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese yeah yeah and uh this person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ordered after me and I I figured that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were what their number was because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were right after me and uh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they they look like they're having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nightmare time ordering and then I felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bad and then the number got called and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went up to them and I was like oh hey by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the way that's your the shows I'm pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sure oh okay thanks but then they they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> seemed really confused that I came up to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them and told them but yeah they weren't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going up and getting their stuff and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh okay whatever yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's other time um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was checking in it was so bad uh I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> check into the hotel and it was all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going well and the person next to me I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess they started speaking in Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to them uh you know and even though my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese isn't like perfect I could like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hear that the way she was saying things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like not great Japanese like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't sound like natural I guess even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> though like I'm not great anyway but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the pronunciation I guess I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know me I'm the last person should be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> judging </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um she started speaking Japanese then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she started speaking Japanese and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she just immediately was like oh [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know what the [ __ ] happening and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I it was kind of like I was like I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I don't want to help she's trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I was just checking in and it started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just getting more painful and more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> painful right right I was like do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> need do you need help she's like no I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I'm like okay thank God I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it only took me like 30 minutes to check </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in I think it's just taking forever and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like oh cause </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I I live in Japan so I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to show my passport when I check in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I want to see my cards my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> residence card for living here sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't technically they're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> supposed to ask and they're not supposed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to copy it it's just a whole some hotels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ask for some hotels don't you can be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pushy about it and say don't do it but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it like it gets even weirder when </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> again I guess how do you like take my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> word for it like I guess I don't know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> guess I have to do that I'm like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like no you're not Japanese you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> clearly don't look at it like this I am </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just trust you know I've got chatting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with some people who uh have Zaria cards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they really don't like I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just like the principle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't want to show them yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm actually half a shirt [ __ ] you yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like no I'm not sure anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they always photocopy it as well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which I don't get why do they photocopy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> myself I'm like I don't know I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's for like uh like insurance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reasons maybe I guess but it's like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you kind of [ __ ] up a room so hard then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like well we got your info ready a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little bit you know a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> xenophobic to just only get like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> foreign residence I guess it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird yeah so they can actually if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a police officer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did you just say like oh Japanese to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like everyone else that would care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if it's a police officer yeah no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no police officer yeah they can actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you obviously yeah but like checking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> into a hotel I think that if if you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to you don't have to prove that you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I guess yeah it's hard for them as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> well right well then you're a life hack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> next time you're at a hotel just be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in this yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor coming up to the hotel by the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> actually this is it's weird because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> normally whenever I travel for work in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan like we're filming stuff yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if it's I noticed that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um this is such a a expat [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem if you're like booking.com is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still set to a foreign country they'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll 100 ask you for idea when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get there but yeah because I change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because Chris hasn't done it Chris is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still set to like the UK yeah and I told </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him like a million times to change that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] because every time we go to a place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they immediately ask for our passports </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah it's super annoying having to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like do the whole thing uh I set mine to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan now so that when I book it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes they ask sometimes they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but actually trip no one ever asked me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for it oh that's good and no one ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tried to photocopy it and I was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a nice change of pace that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what they should do it every holiday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah I'm like chill nice sick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awesome coming up with the times I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know I just it's just it just saves time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just don't want to dude it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> annoying when you when we were cycling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single day on the cycle we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this 30 minute [ __ ] check-in where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they want to scan all my documents make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sure I'm like legal and it's like oh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god dude like let me just check I need a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shower dude I smell like [ __ ] let me in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know I it's it's weird I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess especially if like I I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually I wonder if it's something to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do with paying afterwards and paying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um before because all the hotels I paid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before uh and when we did uh when we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> traveled uh with Chris or whatever we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always pay after I just also one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hotels Chris did forget to pay oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was an apple Hotel hey Chris forgot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to pay because she straight up forgot to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pay I just left we were late to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream because Chris had to drive back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and go and pay because they called him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up and they're like oh assume I was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh money where the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so Chris would drive back and go and pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's just straight up laughed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how many hotels has that man been in how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you forget this is why when I book it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just pay right there I'm like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> takes away a giant stress yeah yeah uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just so much easier because you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna pay with the same [ __ ] card </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway you don't want to pay up front </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you don't want to [ __ ] around like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as you're leaving you're probably like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rushing to go somewhere or you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever just like at booking.com more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> often not just it gives you like a two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> percent discount anyway yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anyway yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so you know it's so annoying anyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so this is such a person living here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem and even then a more Niche </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem of person living here who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> travels around here a lot probably yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gig of first world problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you ever like you know when uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever you're like living in Australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something or somewhere outside of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan have you ever like had an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opportunity to help a Japanese tourist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> abroad that's like yeah a few times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but I don't know it's it's weird like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> unlike in Japan where there are a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who come to Japan not knowing the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> language whatsoever yeah and are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> clearly struggling yeah a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese people who come to Australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they're deep they're pretty decent at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> English like enough where they can kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of get around because I feel like for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> English mentality yeah I should think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that you'll be accommodated right and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think like especially with like Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people because for the most part a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of Japanese people are like the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> common consensus is like they're very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> afraid to like travel overseas because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like oh you know Japanese doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really work yeah anywhere else outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Japan right so it's like I feel the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who are actually willing to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> travel outside of Japan to different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> countries are the ones that are already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably interested in like learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> English or like learning a different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> language anyway yeah so like I've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had that thing of like I've seen a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clearly Japanese tourist yeah in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Australia struggling because it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well you probably know the bare minimum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> English to get around anyway yeah so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like yeah you'll be all right just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got out I had a moment I was like so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> proud of it was just like it made living </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here in Japan for like four years worth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just for this like one moment just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because uh it was actually when I went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to Thailand at last time yeah and uh uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were at the airport we just got on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off the plane uh and uh our Sydney was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the toilet so I was waiting for her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I could see there there's there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this like older Japanese couple talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to one of the Thai staff members uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I you know I just kind of like zoned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in on like their conversation and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think they were like trying to find kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like the right gate to transfer over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to because they were flying to like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the islands or something now like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said they could speak like a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of English yeah but it wasn't great yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also the person that was uh kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> helping them obviously Thai yeah her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> English wasn't great either yeah I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this so much it was like a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tourist trying to speak English to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese person who also had batting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah it was it was like a car </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crash every time so it was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> confusion on both sides there was a Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> person speaking broken English to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> broken English older Japanese couple who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't also speak English trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best interpret that so I was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I think this is my moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I think I think this is my moment and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I come over and uh I you know I I ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the person I tell the person in Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is everything okay I can speak like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little bit of Japanese and she explains </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me oh you know I'm trying to explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to them the directions of the gate and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the plane that I can get to and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like thank God I can actually my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> language skills are good enough to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> translate this and then and then so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> translate them to uh I say what she says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japanese and they go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like why do you want to yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly exactly and I was and then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like oh why do you speak Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like oh I'm I just literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flew flew from Japan I live in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now uh I had a nice pleasant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> conversation and I was like yeah you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here you go there I hope you have a nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Journey here and I hope you have a nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day in Thailand and it was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was that was I don't know sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the little things of life and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just I was like beaming I was beaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all day just because that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interaction I was like I was like yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so weird because like in Australia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had so many instances where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's that situation but flipped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so it's like I I could be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking around in you know somewhere in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney like somewhere where I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clearly know where I'm going maybe I'm a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit lost you know maybe it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like a suburb I've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been to yeah and I've had people who you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know mistake me for a different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nationality many times right uh I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember one time I was in I forgot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I even was but it was a place I'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never been to before and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking for a particular I think like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant or something to meet up with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like where the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> place and I'm like looking on my phone I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know where it is yeah and this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like dude just he's just like excuse me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he just comes up to me it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like I think he was like Indian or you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know maybe like you know Pakistani </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that yeah and he just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starts speaking to me in Hindi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah he just starts speaking to me in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Hindi and I'm like and I tried to tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> him I was like uh I'm sorry man I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I don't know what you're talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about yeah and he just and he's like oh </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah I speak English I don't speak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever the [ __ ] you just spoke to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and he was like trying it's like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it looked like yeah it's like I thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you were like a like an Indian tourist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like trying to figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you wanted to go and I'm like dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's my fear of like helping who I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think is a Japanese person yeah and they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just speak a completely different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> language yeah oh [ __ ] okay I've had that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many times where I thought they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese and they were like Korean yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and I'm just like oh sorry I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought I've had that so many times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I've uh gone to a place thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were Thai and uh it turns out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're Vietnamese organization I </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> but I thought it felt great bro it felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my third eye was had to open </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> ever been in my life where I had not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> used my first language I I had used my I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guess my second language and now my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> third language and I'm just like yo is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this the power of a trilingual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> validation yeah yeah yeah yeah have I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have I unlocked the trilingual power now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God this it feels incredible yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but uh yeah hopefully hopefully that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of like little moments like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I'm just like oh I should I should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> study more Japanese now yeah that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reignited my passion for yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing stories like that makes me want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to learn a third language but I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what yeah this isn't it Hindi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to counteract I can't do this it's got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be handy bro yeah I started speaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Hindi I'm like well funny you say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that actually uh well imagine how big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your fan base would get if you knew him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wouldn't be huge you would quadruple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your viewership right bro it would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> game changing extra one billion fans all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right then and there dude not gonna lie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> dude I'm gonna say it I'm [ __ ] sick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of getting the hunger jokes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like seven years oh just you know what I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always thought there was a part of me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like it's super endearing it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's very humbling you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I look clearly not Japanese and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know Japanese people are like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it validates that oh my Japanese hasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fallen off a cliff you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> considering that I don't actively study </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it as much as I used to because I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't have as much time anymore yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's it's gone to the point now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like I was in Harajuku a few days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> ago with Aki and we were just doing some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shopping or whatever and I think I got </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> immediately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to me and it's just like I I know </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> like what do you see the lights what are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the lights had changed four minutes ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and we haven't moved sir genuinely he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just whipped it out I couldn't believe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it I've noticed taxi drivers in Japan by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I would not have any Tokyo no I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know because I I a lot of taxi drivers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've like been with they've they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always had okay they always have of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clipboards right do you know what I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because okay I figured it out okay what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is that well I think they keep track of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone that's got in their taxi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or something even though the meter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> already does this yeah yeah I think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they I'm not sure what they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clocking but a lot of the taxi drivers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if not all of them they you know even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though you're doing you get paid this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amount for the journey all of them are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like employed right by a company most of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> them I think I'm again I'm not 100 sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of them are and so that that's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their pay what you're paying now yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're your salary so I think they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like keeping track of something keeping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> track of something I don't know yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> always thought they were like racially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> profiles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> secret police every time she's a secret </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> police officer just tracking your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movements </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in case the police come being like did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you see a white male in his 30s getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your taxis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no because what always confused me is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I I assume they would keep in track </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like the fair or something but they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never ever do it off after you finish </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your journey it's always always it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always mid light sometimes the lives go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're still [ __ ] writing and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their hands are off the uh steering wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and they just [ __ ] go they're like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to finish this racial profile I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna sit next time and start writing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff too I'm anxious and then I close </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the book to death now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're sitting in the front seat just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> grab just stop playing Tic-Tac-Toe yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but no like uh like I guess it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the hunger josu is kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the time just like conversation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> starter do Japanese people find it as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> endearing when we just start speaking I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> always do I always win Eagle jewels to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> do them as well yeah oh really yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh and I've said I do now I've started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing it everywhere yeah do Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> people find it as endearing when we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> speak broken ass Japanese be like ah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think so bearded ah oh dude Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they love that [ __ ] even if they don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like I think they just prefer it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right like yeah yeah I think I think in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a lot of minds of Japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like stereotypically I guess like yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think the the general consensus is oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to the effort to try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> speak to me in the local language and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think that in and of itself is worth I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess like the praise or the respect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because you know it's so easy to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just be like yeah you know what this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weird Japanese language I'm not gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learn it my natural language is better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just deal with it kind of thing right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like I think it's the idea of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh you know I can only speak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese yeah and you're participating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in speaking Japanese no matter how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> broken it is hey you know what new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hunger [ __ ] Josie dog let's go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think because there's a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people online are always like man it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so disrespectful to go to a country and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and not know any of the language it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like well I mean a lot of Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people don't expect you to no that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like whether you should or shouldn't it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't really matter it's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> expectations that I think a lot of Asian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> countries are like okay okay well here's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing when you go to like uh when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you when you travel around how much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> research do you do you do to a place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> before you like travel there I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> research is in like in in the language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in anything you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um like very little you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> language-wise I'll probably learn how to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> order that's and then yeah yeah I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because I normally you know I'll maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> learn like basic readings like Hello </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thank you yeah yeah stuff like that but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I'm not gonna learn like Just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Enough full sentence hopefully not be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> nuisance yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but then obviously when you check </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> into hotels and stuff you'd like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> please have hopefully please have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> English yeah yeah because because I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had this when I went to Vietnam because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's been like quite a while since I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just traveled to a new country that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> had just never been to before and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a quick weekend trip so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't actually do that much research uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I uh after I got off the plane and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like oh [ __ ] uh do they is is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> English as common here as it is in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thailand [ __ ] I don't actually know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't I didn't bother learning any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Vietnamese phrases because I'm just here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the weekend [ __ ] uh so like it's it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like that kind of realization </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just oh I'm that dumb tourist now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I I am actually that dumb tourist now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's it's a feeling that I I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've forgotten for a while because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the time when I travel it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] America or like other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> English-speaking countries you know so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think like the the mentality I go into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is like say like you know a couple of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> months ago I went to Korea for the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time right where it's like you know mo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Korea most people can speak English </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah at least did you know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> beforehand though or uh I had heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about it okay but you know they say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about a lot of countries yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> true right so you know I went in there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ex you know being like all right well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I'm probably not gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bother like you know learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a lot of like extensive phrases </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything in Korean but I'll just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learn the basics and then when I get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there I'll try and learn as much of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I can like I'm much rather in the in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this head space of like it's better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to even to be that dumb tourist at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to show that you want to kind of learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the language and I think that is just as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh appreciated by the locals then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already knowing it right so like there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were so many times where if I knew that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know the I'd go to a random </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food stall in in Seoul and the guy would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be speaking to me in English I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just be like how do you say this in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Korean yeah and the guy was very happy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to like teach me how to say it and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know when I would reflect back on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he'd be like yeah there you go you got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah so I think like just showing no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> matter what you know the you know no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> matter how it is just showing that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are interested in it I think is what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> will get the locals to be like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cool you know what I respect that and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> think the only reason why that doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work as much in in Japan as it does in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> say Korea is because a lot of Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people are a little bit afraid of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reserved and reserved to talk to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> foreigners and tourists whereas in Korea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're a lot more open about it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> being like yeah you know you're you're a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tourist yeah I see Taurus all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] time well you know I'll teach </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you some words yeah yeah did you find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out like when you went on your Euro trip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this is like pre-pandemic did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you went to like a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different countries yeah you know like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very very short period of time but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> guess you had like a guide right well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we went to like six or yeah six </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different European countries all for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> first time but yeah we because it was me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Aki's first time in Europe so we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like I'd rather go to a country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I have like a friend living there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like show me around so like I had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my local friend with me there but also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know I did the same thing where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I would be served something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I would ask the store clerk or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever to be like how do you say this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in French or Italian or you know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever country I'm in and I think for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most part it they seem to appreciate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it right yeah yeah I guess yeah being do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember any of them no you remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for that one trip sometimes sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you just fly somewhere you're like maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just you quickly Google so when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was in Finland I learned so much [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finish I couldn't tell you a single </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] finish phrase right now is when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a tourist it's like as long as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not being a dick yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't really matter I think I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's nothing wrong with being the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dumb tourist I think the problem lies in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being the Arrogant done tourist of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not open-minded enough to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> involve yourself in the culture that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you kind of get the stink eye but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if if you're like you can be the dumb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tourist just be like the Curious dumb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Taurus I think it's just looking up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe like what the general kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> etiquette is on certain places before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you turn up is probably just yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can watch a [ __ ] top 10 list of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things to do and don't do yeah like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know in Japan and every other country on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Earth probably but yeah it just tells </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you hey this is this is a cool thing to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do this is definitely not cool thing to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do like I think that's just you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that helps yeah I look into that for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sure because the last thing I want to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is be the dumb tourist that also offends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the country I mean you know yeah I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as long as you're you know polite I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think yeah whatever yeah yeah I mean you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know we dunk on tourists yeah we're done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for tourists a lot even though we a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of times we are tourists yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you know ultimately there's nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> wrong with being a tourist of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because you [ __ ] have to be yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um everyone's a tourist yeah but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know I think it's just hey if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> chill who cares okay as an Australian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so in England I don't know if this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just uh I don't know if this is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a British thing but one thing I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> noticed is you know as a Brit every time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I see like a broad like making a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fool of themselves which I've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terrible so many times I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> England's got the worst tourist in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world and then I was like I was talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to Sydney and she's like no Americans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are the worst tourists in the world and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I you know I one time I like met a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> french guy and he thinks they're the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worst stories in the world as an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Australian do you think you are like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worst tourist in the world yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like it depends on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> location with Australians right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think Australians in like say Tokyo or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Osaka uh for the most part pretty all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah but say Australian tourists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at ski resorts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like you know I worked with them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I can 100 say they're the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like it's it's I think it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Australian I think a lot of Australian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tourists because you know for the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> part we're very very Multicultural </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country so we're just living in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Australia unless you're living in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the butt [ __ ] middle of nowhere you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most likely going to run into different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cultures right whether you like it or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not so I think for the most part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Australians who live in cities are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> naturally inclined to understand that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there are cultural differences wherever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go right not just language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> differences but I don't know what it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the the atmosphere of a ski resort </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan that just makes Australians go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah [ __ ] the culture I'm here to rip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Snow Dogs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah kind of like hotels are kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a dorm in a way yeah yeah it feels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know a lot of these like ski </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> lodges they do kind of like uh have more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like a western feel of like just come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in it's casual you know hang out with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the people in the lounge area oh they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all Australians as well you guys will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get along fine go you know rip it in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snow whatever yeah yeah but then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take that energy to the nearby Village </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and the nearby cities and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I because I remember when I worked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in hakuba I would you know frequently go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into uh like Nagano and like nigata to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do some work and you'll see those exact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> same like ski bro Australians in these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cities yeah oh wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the the two main ski resorts and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd go into the cities and you would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see the the ski Bros there and they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just some of the most loudest most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obnoxious tourists I've ever met I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just like bro we're not in the ski </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lodges anymore we're in a city with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hundreds of terrified Japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> calm down keep it in the launch yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> mean I I guess I just noticed as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally when when I make when I meet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like British people in Japan they can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come into Japan most of them all are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty chill right all of them shelves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason I I I I every time I see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh especially English tourists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in like southeast Asia in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thailand I I'm I saw it as a reputation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh I saw so many in when I went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Vietnam and every time I heard the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> English accent I'm like I do not know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this I I am I am not my man I am Thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for the rest of this trip actually that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> poor taxi driver who thought English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people were Gentlemans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah I mean I think there's certain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> destinations that yeah let's say uh more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> bang for your bark money yeah I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> attract a certain type of British </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tourist yeah and probably other European </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> tourists too but mainly British ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there like like what's like the main </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I guess party country or Party </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> location for like Bruce it's like Ibiza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of like the Spanish Islands some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the Greek Islands because in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Australia that's Bali so when you go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've personally never been to Bali </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before but I've heard stories of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the most obnoxious Australians in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Bali just like [ __ ] trying to make it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an extremely cheap transport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a cheap accommodation and with like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> party atmosphere yeah extremely cheap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> alcohol yeah yeah it's just like I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like Vietnam and Thailand that are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty cheap yeah and drinking oh I saw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw so many people from Essex in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Vietnam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was this one girl who was uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clearly from Essex </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> one thing one thing I'll say about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> American tourists The Stereotype is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> American tourists are the loudest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tourists yeah and I don't know if that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> necessarily true but for some reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America like every time I see an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> American Tourist abroad whatever country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's in for some reason they always have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most recognizable voice in any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> establishment have you noticed this I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know why every American I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japan has been super polite yeah no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they have yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very easy to hear them out yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah for some reason it could be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the loudest like bar you've ever been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you'll just hear that one American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> accent that will pierce through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> everything being said this cocktail's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] delicious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's because like we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just consume so much American Media yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's an instantly recognizable kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we hear so much American accents that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when we hear in real life we're like oh </SPEAKER_00>
