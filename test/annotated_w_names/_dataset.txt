<connor> 20 something years of not stretching </connor>
<joey> yeah before exercising pretty much oh my </joey>
<joey> God and now it's finally caught up to me </joey>
<joey> and I'm like oh maybe I should maybe the </joey>
<joey> stretches in the morning actually mean </joey>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<garnt> yeah maybe the doctor's advice was </garnt>
<joey> actually uh was actually useful and the </joey>
<joey> the doctor had a point and uh yeah it </joey>
<joey> was just like talking [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> but yeah how have you guys been in the </joey>
<garnt> past few days Connor you've been uh </garnt>
<garnt> taking care of your parents right I have </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's first time right yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that's what that first time in Japan </connor>
<connor> well everyone I'm Connor's Dad </connor>
<connor> why are you talking like you're in a </connor>
<connor> conference I don't know family's coming </connor>
<connor> in I'm showing Ned though hi everybody </connor>
<connor> we're in Japan at the moment visiting </connor>
<joey> Connor hi </joey>
<joey> every time anything happened I was like </joey>
<connor> I'll tell that on the podcast and </connor>
<connor> they're all like </connor>
<connor> don't don't say that </connor>
<joey> why have there been like already I mean </joey>
<connor> it's just like you know my my parents </connor>
<connor> because like I think a lot of people who </connor>
<connor> travel to Japan especially our age like </connor>
<connor> they like are already kind of into Japan </connor>
<connor> and already have like researched a bunch </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> um they don't get normally like just </connor>
<connor> dragged here and even like people who </connor>
<garnt> like want to visit here will normally </garnt>
<garnt> like look up stuff to do or we'll look </garnt>
<garnt> up something and and so my parents kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like even though they are interested </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan and they they were really </garnt>
<garnt> really excited for the trip like they </garnt>
<garnt> didn't like research they weren't like </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God what's on San educator oh my </garnt>
<garnt> God how should I well they don't have to </garnt>
<garnt> because yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> and like I realized oh my God I have to </joey>
<joey> like I have to explain everything right </joey>
<joey> whereas like sometimes when friends come </joey>
<connor> over it's like okay I don't have to </connor>
<connor> explain everything and they can get </connor>
<connor> around well like they didn't know </connor>
<joey> anything yeah most people who visited </joey>
<joey> kind of have their own motives already </joey>
<connor> right yeah they figured stuff out and </connor>
<connor> they they maybe planned the trains and </connor>
<connor> stuff but you know I think everything </connor>
<connor> kind of sounded overwhelming when I like </connor>
<connor> told them I was like okay I'll just </connor>
<joey> figure it out so like I booked them uh a </joey>
<joey> taxi from Narita to to take them to the </joey>
<connor> hotel which is like two hours right </connor>
<joey> expensive taxes for me yeah yeah I'm </joey>
<joey> paying it why didn't you just throw them </joey>
<connor> on the narrator Express oh because I was </connor>
<connor> like man they're gonna they're gonna be </connor>
<garnt> overwhelmed absolutely first time in </garnt>
<joey> Asia of having to figure it out like </joey>
<joey> also the first time in Asia yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah okay yeah and I think there's still </connor>
<connor> that like and I realize that everyone </connor>
<joey> has this where you're like I don't know </joey>
<connor> it's like English will be okay right </connor>
<joey> like and it's like yeah no it won't be </joey>
<joey> okay maybe on the Naruto Express yeah </joey>
<connor> okay but like it's like I'm sure like </connor>
<joey> this is not me being like all right it's </joey>
<joey> not about I do I think they could figure </joey>
<joey> it out yeah they could figure it out but </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like all right do I really </joey>
<joey> want to put that stress on them right </joey>
<joey> right away it's like okay I could just </joey>
<joey> get them a cab and I'll front the cost </joey>
<joey> and then all they have to do is just </joey>
<joey> look for the guy with the name and then </joey>
<joey> apparently that somehow that [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> too because it was like 4am because we </joey>
<joey> were in Hawaii yeah and I was like you </joey>
<joey> know I was making sure that when they </joey>
<connor> landed I was like hey did you get in the </connor>
<connor> cab okay is it all good and they're like </connor>
<connor> yeah it's all good it's all good </connor>
<connor> and I I want I was going to go to sleep </connor>
<connor> when I knew they got to the hotel and </connor>
<connor> they could find like you know rest and </connor>
<connor> then I I wouldn't have to worry then </connor>
<garnt> about you know because I booked the </garnt>
<garnt> hotel I booked everything everything is </garnt>
<garnt> all booked by me and I was like I just </garnt>
<garnt> didn't want like a [ __ ] up where maybe I </garnt>
<connor> put the name wrong or something you know </connor>
<garnt> what kind of did actually [ __ ] up </garnt>
<joey> because I I remember uh I remember </joey>
<joey> because uh his parents it's not it's not </joey>
<joey> just his parents that have come along </joey>
<joey> but we have a friend from England who's </joey>
<connor> flowing all the way here that I think </connor>
<connor> landed on the same day as your parents </connor>
<connor> two days after two days after all right </connor>
<connor> but like I remember thinking uh so I </connor>
<connor> remember Conor was like mentioning oh </connor>
<connor> yeah I'm gonna come back from Hawaii </connor>
<connor> then pick my parents up and I was like </connor>
<connor> wait a minute I was checking the dates </connor>
<connor> because I was having to make sure the </connor>
<connor> dates of when our friend lands as well I </connor>
<connor> was like wait a minute Connor mentioned </connor>
<connor> his parents come back on this day yeah </connor>
<connor> but we fly back on from Hawaii the day </connor>
<garnt> after that was the one thing I did </garnt>
<connor> annoying I'm like does Connor realize </connor>
<connor> this or I did realize that and I told my </connor>
<connor> parents that but then I didn't tell my </connor>
<connor> friend that so yeah it's kind of like a </connor>
<joey> miscommunication because there's so many </joey>
<joey> things </joey>
<connor> and then myself which is already I'm Not </connor>
<joey> Gonna Keep in track of this yeah yeah so </joey>
<connor> so I you know I got them a taxi and I'm </connor>
<connor> in the Hawaii hotel room and then </connor>
<joey> they're like oh we think the taxi driver </joey>
<joey> is going the wrong way I'm like I don't </joey>
<joey> think the taxi driver would go the wrong </joey>
<joey> way I gave him the address how would </joey>
<connor> your parents know I don't know because </connor>
<connor> they're just freaking out right they </connor>
<connor> just haven't been to it and everything's </connor>
<connor> new and the tax driver doesn't speak any </connor>
<connor> English because of course I don't speak </connor>
<connor> English uh and so they call me up and </connor>
<connor> they're like I think the taxi director </connor>
<connor> told me well shouldn't my mum calls me </connor>
<connor> while she's like I I don't think they </connor>
<connor> know where to go yeah I replied in </connor>
<connor> English I was like Mom I don't think </connor>
<connor> they can speak English I don't think you </connor>
<connor> need to speak to me in Welsh </connor>
<joey> um your mom's trying to be like the </joey>
<connor> screen </connor>
<connor> yeah you don't need to worry about it </connor>
<connor> and even if they did speak English they </connor>
<connor> wouldn't understand like British English </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you did yeah um so they hand </connor>
<joey> me the phone I'm like okay fine okay </joey>
<joey> they're like yeah we think the taxi </joey>
<joey> driver is going the wrong way I'm like I </joey>
<joey> don't I think it's fine so they hand the </joey>
<joey> phone to the taxi driver and the taxi </joey>
<joey> driver is like sounds like a young woman </joey>
<joey> and she just sounded like terrified that </joey>
<joey> I think my parents just shoved the phone </joey>
<joey> to her and then some weird guys talking </joey>
<joey> in Japanese to her and so I was like </joey>
<joey> hazel Ransom calling I was like hey uh </joey>
<joey> my parents are just kind of nervous </joey>
<joey> um do you have the address and she just </joey>
<joey> sounded like utterly panicked by that </joey>
<joey> question and I was like all right then </joey>
<joey> she was like oh she's like freaking out </joey>
<joey> you can imagine how it is yeah it </joey>
<joey> sounded very flushed and very panicked </joey>
<joey> and I was like all right then and I know </joey>
<connor> I was like I'll just hand it back she </connor>
<connor> handed it back and I was like yeah she </connor>
<connor> knows where she's going I didn't know I </connor>
<joey> was like I was like </joey>
<joey> meanwhile everyone in that cab is </joey>
<connor> sweating yeah I'm like don't worry about </connor>
<joey> it I'm sure she knows and of course she </joey>
<connor> knew where she was going yeah yeah um </connor>
<joey> and I was like this is so so stupid but </joey>
<joey> then you know and then I think it </joey>
<joey> proceeded to be like all right let's </joey>
<joey> every little thing where I'm not there </joey>
<joey> they would like worry about it and then </joey>
<joey> like double check with me and so the um </joey>
<joey> the first day we had to do we have to </joey>
<joey> record trash station no I had to do </joey>
<joey> something I had to do a live stream yeah </joey>
<joey> and so I was like hey just go here for </joey>
<connor> lunch walk around and so they're walking </connor>
<connor> around and they're texting me stuff and </connor>
<connor> they're like oh we found like a a cafe </connor>
<connor> to drink and they sent me a picture and </connor>
<connor> my God it looks like the shittiest Cafe </connor>
<connor> in all of Japan it's like it's like yeah </connor>
<joey> it has an outside Terrace and it's </joey>
<connor> let me show you a picture okay it's like </connor>
<joey> unfair to even call this a Terrace do </joey>
<joey> they not just think to like walk into </joey>
<connor> like a Starbucks I think I think they </connor>
<joey> didn't want to go to Starbucks and also </joey>
<joey> I think they were also like look at this </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> that doesn't even look like a cafe and </joey>
<joey> this is something that I've learned and </joey>
<joey> I know this because I had the same thing </joey>
<joey> myself I said like it is super </joey>
<joey> intimidating in Japan for people who've </joey>
<joey> never gone to Japan or Asia in general </joey>
<joey> to to to imagine having to go into a </joey>
<joey> building without being able to see it </joey>
<joey> immediately what's inside yes yeah so I </joey>
<joey> think for them my parents it was like </joey>
<joey> okay well Terrace equals I can kind of </joey>
<joey> see what's going on and then there's </joey>
<joey> also hundreds of miscommunications they </joey>
<joey> keep telling me about where they're like </joey>
<joey> my mom is obsessed with cider as right a </joey>
<joey> British woman yeah wants to drink siding </joey>
<joey> alcohol excited yeah which just doesn't </joey>
<joey> exist in Japan no no and in America it's </joey>
<connor> called hard cider but here it's like </connor>
<connor> what do they call it Cedar but then </connor>
<joey> there's also normal cider which is </joey>
<connor> yeah you can imagine </connor>
<connor> but even this is just assuming because </connor>
<joey> she's like oh do you have silent like </joey>
<joey> yes we have cider and they bring up </joey>
<connor> and so this has been a constant </connor>
<connor> frustration right now where I'm always </connor>
<connor> just like every single place we go to </connor>
<connor> I'm she's like do they have side I'm </connor>
<connor> like Mom they don't have cider I'll tell </connor>
<connor> you when they have cider mum which is </connor>
<joey> never because they won't ever have it </joey>
<joey> yeah like ironically enough the only </joey>
<joey> place in Japan that has cider are </joey>
<garnt> British pubs yeah exactly yeah that you </garnt>
<garnt> you probably uh find more chance of </garnt>
<joey> getting a Cider at a hub </joey>
<joey> oh my God imagining your parents in a </joey>
<connor> hole yeah it's really nice </connor>
<garnt> but I mean I mean I I get it right </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember when I first moved to </garnt>
<garnt> Japan right there's there's a big </garnt>
<garnt> barrier you have to get past in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> like just going into a restaurant and </garnt>
<garnt> committing to opening the door yeah oh </garnt>
<connor> right so it's terrifying yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because once you commit now like you </connor>
<connor> still do it but yeah there's that </connor>
<joey> millisecond I mean I hated it and I </joey>
<garnt> could speak the language yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because you're like once you open a door </garnt>
<garnt> you're like [ __ ] I've committed to like </garnt>
<garnt> sitting down at this yeah I don't want </garnt>
<joey> to be the [ __ ] that immediately turns </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> I've had to become because you know I </connor>
<connor> was at some point I've been sharing my </connor>
<connor> friend come with my parents around at </connor>
<connor> the same time right yeah and it means </connor>
<connor> that like and they all love drinking so </connor>
<connor> I've had to become the vibe Checker </connor>
<joey> which I mean I have to you just have to </joey>
<joey> walk into a you know a narrow building </joey>
<joey> on like the fifth floor of some really </joey>
<joey> sketchy looking thing and I have to pop </joey>
<joey> my head and be like oh no no sorry yeah </joey>
<joey> go out and it's really awkward but and </joey>
<joey> like my dad as well he's um he loves </joey>
<joey> beer and every single time when we get </joey>
<joey> we get a beer he's like what beer is it </joey>
<joey> I'm like </joey>
<connor> I don't know I haven't I've never </connor>
<connor> questioned it in three years it just </connor>
<connor> always comes out tasting Goods so I just </connor>
<connor> I've noticed every time he asks me I was </connor>
<connor> like I just don't know just drink it </connor>
<connor> it's me it's fine like I every single </connor>
<connor> time he likes the beer </connor>
<connor> it's just like it's it's very fun taking </connor>
<connor> them around but after like like multiple </connor>
<connor> days of this I've been getting this same </connor>
<connor> question I'm like I'm gonna lose </connor>
<connor> my mind being asked these questions over </connor>
<connor> and over again but it's been fun they </connor>
<connor> love the bullet trains everyone seems to </connor>
<connor> love bullet trains as well every foreign </connor>
<joey> person I think people from outside Japan </joey>
<joey> just like find that concept so insane </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's like well like I think </joey>
<joey> like China is the only other country </joey>
<joey> that has trains that go that fast yeah I </joey>
<connor> think I think no Europe has high speed </connor>
<joey> rails does it yeah I don't think it's as </joey>
<garnt> well connected nearly as well connected </garnt>
<joey> yeah or run on time or because I think </joey>
<connor> like a million people a day use the </connor>
<garnt> shinkansen which is like insane amounts </garnt>
<garnt> of well I think it's all just also just </garnt>
<garnt> like I wouldn't say like the marketing </garnt>
<garnt> but like the prestige because it was </garnt>
<garnt> actually like one of the first and one </garnt>
<garnt> of the most famous right it was the </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese bullet train yeah like this is </garnt>
<garnt> when this is when like Japan was in the </garnt>
<joey> Heights or when you think Japan you </joey>
<joey> think the bullet train yeah this is when </joey>
<garnt> Japan was like the height of the center </garnt>
<garnt> of Technology sure you know yeah they </garnt>
<garnt> loved it yeah and that that image is </garnt>
<connor> just like state because even my parents </connor>
<connor> right I was I asked my mom and dad when </connor>
<connor> they come to Japan what do you want to </connor>
<joey> do my dad's like take me in the bullet </joey>
<joey> train I was like that's uh out of where </joey>
<joey> out of everything that's what you want </joey>
<garnt> to do okay Dad okay he's just like I'm </garnt>
<garnt> excited for the bullet train yeah yeah I </garnt>
<joey> mean it's fun it's not about the </joey>
<garnt> destination it's about the journey yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly that is the destination the </garnt>
<joey> bullet train is great seeing at the when </joey>
<joey> the train leaves at 9 57 I can tell them </joey>
<joey> look at the clock when it turns to 957 </joey>
<joey> the trains oh that's my favorite thing I </joey>
<joey> might not watch watch yeah it's gonna </joey>
<joey> come ride like literally the doors oh </joey>
<joey> close and go 1987 I'm like that's sick </joey>
<joey> that's awesome </joey>
<joey> um I mean they love that my dad is </joey>
<joey> fascinated by it he loved all that they </joey>
<connor> I mean they like it so far like in uh </connor>
<connor> most of the food they like I've made </connor>
<joey> them try pretty much everything yeah and </joey>
<joey> are they like generally okay with like </joey>
<joey> food like is the food palette wide or I </joey>
<connor> thought it was like non-existent right I </connor>
<joey> thought they weren't going to eat </joey>
<joey> anything right but then they've eaten </joey>
<joey> everything </joey>
<joey> we're gonna have dinner and uh yeah </joey>
<garnt> there's one place I only serve like raw </garnt>
<garnt> meat yeah it was it was basically a a </garnt>
<garnt> place that specialized in raw meats and </garnt>
<joey> fish uh and we realized that after </joey>
<joey> sitting down and like half the menu was </joey>
<garnt> just like raw horse meat raw beef oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah baby shrimp and every every kind of </joey>
<connor> raw meats yeah this is a little baby </connor>
<connor> looking squid thing that's common in </connor>
<joey> spring in Japan and uh that was the </joey>
<joey> appetizer that came out and it just </joey>
<joey> looks like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah shrunken down yeah yeah that was </joey>
<joey> like the first thing my parents had it </joey>
<joey> was kind of different </joey>
<connor> um they were like I was like try it like </connor>
<joey> Dark Souls yeah those are their credit </joey>
<connor> they they ate one of them they didn't no </connor>
<garnt> they they tried at least they tried it I </garnt>
<garnt> was impressed I thought no shots </garnt>
<joey> eat it and swallow it they didn't spit a </joey>
<joey> single thing out oh that's good I took </joey>
<garnt> them to a sushiro as well because I was </garnt>
<joey> like I was like because I'm gonna take </joey>
<joey> them to a nice the finest job yeah so so </joey>
<joey> my thing was I wanted them to try </joey>
<joey> dirt cheap sushi and so you know like </joey>
<joey> this is what it should taste like yeah </joey>
<joey> like this is like compared to the UK </joey>
<joey> have you ever had UK Sushi before yeah </joey>
<joey> they have they have did they like it I </joey>
<joey> think they liked it yeah but I mean </joey>
<joey> again they'll never eat it again yes </joey>
<joey> yeah and like it was very westernized </joey>
<joey> but I couldn't you know I mean I when I </joey>
<garnt> go to sushi or something I don't try </garnt>
<connor> anything [ __ ] crazy stuff I just get </connor>
<connor> the standard oh no no no no I'll get </connor>
<garnt> like I'm not having the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> hamburger Sushi [ __ ] that [ __ ] yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> and so like you know they were like yeah </joey>
<connor> it's nice yeah I don't think they like </connor>
<joey> loved it yeah they pretty much enjoyed </joey>
<joey> it but they recognized that it's like </joey>
<connor> even the yeah the minimum here is better </connor>
<connor> than anything again kept saying uh oh </connor>
<connor> it's not it doesn't smell fishy I'm like </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah I think so yeah yeah </joey>

<connor> everything again they loved it all </connor>
<connor> except for uni uh seochin which they </connor>
<joey> none of us like that is a hard bargain </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it is the Marmite of Japan so I'm slowly </garnt>
<connor> starting to find out now yeah Eugene </connor>
<garnt> came with us as well and yeah tried uh </garnt>
<joey> our friend of ours uh did he like uni no </joey>
<joey> he hated it immediately texted my Lane </joey>
<joey> saying hey I don't like sea urchin and </joey>
<connor> then Malene responded oh you probably </connor>
<connor> didn't have Goods here </connor>
<joey> aliens like Islam Michelin star yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> this is my weekly slander yeah </joey>
<garnt> um yeah uh tried um so I also we were in </garnt>
<garnt> uh okay so I'll tell you what we did </garnt>
<garnt> first of all yeah where did you take </garnt>
<joey> them so uh did like uh I thought let's </joey>
<connor> because I I haven't got like super long </connor>
<connor> it's like we're still working here like </connor>
<connor> I just got off the bullet train from </connor>
<connor> bringing them back and I'd come straight </connor>
<garnt> here to record </garnt>
<garnt> um so I wanted to make kind of a densely </garnt>
<garnt> packed like four or five days of no </garnt>
<joey> ghost ball I hope no girl's boss sadly </joey>
<joey> that's only Sydney thing man yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> that's a tough show I also realized that </joey>
<connor> like maybe because Sydney's family is </connor>
<connor> probably a lot more outgoing than my </connor>
<connor> family like they'd probably be able to </connor>
<connor> interact themselves whereas for me it </connor>
<connor> was like I had to translate everything </connor>
<connor> and I don't even understand everything </connor>
<joey> 100 of the time right just imagine your </joey>
<joey> family at a [ __ ] girls bars the </joey>
<connor> funniest thing ever after some really </connor>
<joey> weird bars that I was insistent on going </joey>
<joey> to because I thought it'd be really fun </joey>
<joey> experience I think they're pretty fun so </joey>
<joey> the first day we went to a uh it's like </joey>
<joey> an Onsen Winery thing I think we've </joey>
<joey> talked about before so I took them to </joey>
<joey> there and they loved that that was great </joey>
<joey> yeah did they go in the answer they did </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like a lot of convincing no no I </garnt>
<connor> just kind of like I kind of like just </connor>
<joey> didn't tell them anything about anywhere </joey>
<joey> we were going to I was like you I could </joey>
<connor> tell you but it's not gonna mean </connor>
<joey> anything yeah I told them I was like hey </joey>
<connor> go in the spa do it here we go have fun </connor>
<joey> and they I think they they were </joey>
<joey> definitely shy about it but I think they </joey>
<joey> enjoyed it yeah yeah yeah I mean who </joey>
<garnt> doesn't like a hot spring it's nice yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly and then the food has </garnt>

<connor> I've never been to you went to Canada </connor>
<joey> yeah why because it's kind of on the way </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's can on the way so I drove there </joey>
<joey> it's better than Toyama that's for sure </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah I thought it was like a </joey>
<joey> two-hour drive and I was like ah Church </joey>
<joey> whatever it's a four hour drive it's </joey>
<joey> long yeah and I was just like it's just </joey>
<joey> a highway the whole time and I was </joey>
<joey> losing my mind just driving straight for </joey>
<joey> like four hours it sucked but we got </joey>
<joey> there and then it started like pouring </joey>
<connor> it down and holy [ __ ] there's so many </connor>
<connor> tourists in kanazawa really so many I </connor>
<connor> know I know was kind of like one of </connor>
<connor> those hidden tourist places uh I don't </connor>
<connor> think he's hidden well hidden in the </connor>
<joey> sense of like when you compare it to </joey>
<joey> like Tokyo dude it sounds more busy than </joey>
<connor> like uh like all soccer for tourism </connor>
<joey> really dude it was crazy how many and </joey>
<joey> you're the only person I know who's been </joey>
<joey> to come along I I I'd never been before </joey>
<joey> because I'd not heard much and then I </joey>
<joey> was like okay well I should go because </joey>
<joey> apparently there's this famous Park and </joey>
<joey> stuff yeah yeah and I went there and I </joey>
<joey> thought oh it's okay this way this is </joey>
<joey> kind of boring actually I think we hit </joey>
<garnt> my head now I'm realizing yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> all the stuff that people talk about </garnt>
<garnt> that you can do in Japan it's just stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that's accessible only by like bullet </garnt>
<garnt> trains yeah exactly because like all the </garnt>
<connor> good stuff in my mind you have to like </connor>
<connor> either drive to or get a train then </connor>
<connor> drive yeah like oh genuinely like a lot </connor>
<joey> of the really amazing and fun stuff in </joey>
<garnt> Japan you do have to rent a car or drive </garnt>
<joey> it's just so annoying I mean I mean I </joey>
<connor> kind of like that because to me it means </connor>
<garnt> less tourists are there yeah I mean I I </garnt>
<connor> I wouldn't disagree but I would say the </connor>
<joey> like if it's your first time in Japan </joey>
<connor> you're going to be amazed by anyway but </connor>
<joey> you know for people like living in Japan </joey>
<garnt> like us where we've seen a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> the more I guess like normal tourist </garnt>
<garnt> stuff than a more like some of the more </garnt>
<garnt> interesting things you have to get to by </garnt>
<connor> car well I think that's why my parents </connor>
<joey> enjoyed nigato a lot because it was like </joey>
<joey> really quiet it was like no no foreign </joey>
<joey> tourists at all yeah it's really </joey>
<joey> Pleasant really good vibes very quiet </joey>
<joey> and then we went to Canada and it's like </joey>
<joey> really busy </joey>
<joey> um you know it's nice looking around the </joey>
<joey> park and stuff but I I was like I was </joey>
<joey> walking around this park and I was like </joey>
<joey> damn I think like Shinjuku Park is </joey>
<garnt> better than this one and I was like and </garnt>
<garnt> my parents thought that too and I was </garnt>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] came all this way to this </connor>
<connor> damn Park and I think Shinjuku is better </connor>
<garnt> yeah what else what else is there to do </garnt>
<connor> that it's like from the park what is it </connor>
<joey> famous I've heard I've heard so many </joey>
<joey> like I know kanazawa is a really uh </joey>
<joey> famous tourist attraction for a lot of </joey>
<connor> Japanese people yeah there's a lot of </connor>
<joey> um old shopping areas I think yeah </joey>
<joey> styled off the Japanese stuff we didn't </joey>
<joey> really go to that and uh that night I I </joey>
<joey> one of my parents even though it's not </joey>
<joey> famous for it you know it's you know uh </joey>
<joey> Carlos I was famous for fish typically </joey>
<joey> yeah right um but I was like well we </joey>
<joey> should try uh we should try um uh uh eel </joey>
<joey> I was called again we should try on </joey>
<joey> Aggie and I I wasn't gonna tell them </joey>
<joey> because my my dad had mentioned like a </joey>
<joey> few days before he's like I don't like </joey>
<joey> eel and I was like okay [ __ ] okay well </joey>
<connor> oh I don't think this is </connor>
<joey> so I was gonna not tell them that it was </joey>
<joey> eel yeah so I found this really nice </joey>
<joey> unagi restaurant that happened to be a </joey>
<joey> chain actually they had a few locations </joey>
<joey> around Japan but it was really good and </joey>
<joey> really good reviews uh and went in there </joey>
<joey> and I was like okay cool I'm not gonna </joey>
<joey> tell them it's you I'm just gonna order </joey>
<connor> a bunch of stuff sure enough we sit down </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] everything has eels on it like </connor>
<connor> like theming wise like the Chopsticks </connor>
<connor> have a giant eel the menu is one giant </connor>
<connor> eel Scrolls and I was like all right </connor>
<joey> what do they feel parents are like and </joey>
<connor> it's all in [ __ ] kanji yeah but I </connor>
<joey> know like what to order because I've </joey>
<connor> been to an Aggie restaurant since yeah I </connor>
<joey> got this so it's not a Neal it's a mod </joey>
<connor> fish </connor>
<garnt> it's basically one of those giant like </garnt>
<garnt> in the cooking special where we cook </garnt>
<joey> that where you can't decision right </joey>
<garnt> giant Clay Pot oh yeah where they just </garnt>
<joey> put all of you in agony and they put </joey>
<joey> like three portions in that instead of </joey>
<joey> doing three little boxes that sounds </joey>
<joey> good and uh it was super [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> yeah and my parents loved it they were </joey>
<joey> like yeah this shit's good did you tell </joey>
<joey> them afterwards yeah I told them I told </joey>
<connor> them I was ill and they were like oh </connor>
<connor> yeah we kind of figured out </connor>
<connor> who gave it away I just thought it was a </connor>
<connor> fail proof yeah they were like oh it </connor>
<connor> tastes like chicken I was like wow okay </connor>
<connor> I've done all my life but they loved it </connor>
<joey> they had a great time uh and they I </joey>
<joey> think the counter sale was all right I </joey>
<connor> mean I was kind of like this I was lame </connor>
<joey> yeah but I think like for one day I is </joey>
<joey> just like one of those prefectures you </joey>
<joey> don't really hear a people going to and </joey>
<joey> be like what's like known in that prefix </joey>
<joey> because like you know Japan always has </joey>
<joey> that thing of like oh in this prefecture </joey>
<joey> we're famous for this this and this </joey>
<joey> where it's like you hear about Ishq and </joey>
<joey> it's like what are you famous for it's </joey>
<joey> like we have kanazawa it's like yeah </joey>
<connor> okay but what's this it's like yeah I </connor>
<joey> mean I I think it's I I feel like I've </joey>
<joey> traveled enough of Japan now to be a bit </joey>
<joey> uh be able to like kind of rate some of </joey>
<joey> the places I mean I've got like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> ton of places here so I feel like I can </joey>
<garnt> accurately tell you what's a fun place </garnt>
<garnt> and what's not I guess I was okay also </garnt>
<garnt> it was raining so it was also just </garnt>
<garnt> coming okay as well yeah yeah it doesn't </garnt>
<joey> it definitely affects your judgment and </joey>
<garnt> then we went to Kyoto the day after ah </garnt>
<connor> how was that how many tourists yeah oh </connor>
<connor> my god dude because I I've only been to </connor>
<connor> Kyoto now </connor>
<connor> during the pandemic and I've been three </connor>
<connor> times during the pandemic and it's time </connor>
<connor> it was slowly busier than the last it </connor>
<connor> was never busy yeah like the first time </connor>
<connor> I went and you can watch this in my um </connor>
<connor> when I did the British town but yeah we </connor>
<joey> it's in Kyoto this British town and we </joey>
<joey> filmed at the Kyo mizudera the the the </joey>
<joey> picture of Japan and every single </joey>
<joey> tourist picture </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and and you can see in that </joey>
<joey> video actually like we filmed the thing </joey>
<joey> and you can see in the background </joey>
<joey> there's nobody there there's no one at </joey>
<joey> this Temple </joey>
<joey> um and it was it was like really cool </joey>
<joey> and I thought oh this is kind of neat </joey>
<joey> and I went there this time I was like I </joey>
<joey> never want to go to Kidder ever again </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] sucks like it's like shoulder </joey>
<joey> to shoulder yeah the whole thing like </joey>
<connor> you can't you can't do anything fun </connor>
<connor> there was actually a pretty cool </connor>
<connor> um Craft Beer Stand like right at the </connor>
<connor> bottom of the street right before the </connor>
<connor> kill music that was kind of cool it was </connor>
<connor> and it's a good beer it was like </connor>
<connor> standing thing it was kind of fun other </connor>
<connor> than that but everything else was like </connor>
<connor> okay the views were cool I think they </connor>
<connor> enjoyed that </connor>
<connor> um uh yeah we went around temples but </connor>
<connor> dude I got recognized so much it's kind </connor>
<connor> of like all right I felt bad for my </connor>
<garnt> parents because in the kill music we got </garnt>
<garnt> stopped like nine times just walking </garnt>
<garnt> around there's nowhere to go as well </garnt>
<garnt> because this is like everywhere shoulder </garnt>
<garnt> to shoulder but I think my parents kind </garnt>
<connor> of they they kind of got a kick out of </connor>
<connor> seeing people recognize me they're like </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> I've done this three times before yeah I </connor>
<joey> would if my friends were like hey Connor </joey>
<joey> let's go to Kyoto let's go look at </joey>
<joey> Temple I'm like absolutely not like I </joey>
<garnt> I'll I'll come out and drink later yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like have a good time </garnt>
<connor> to get recognized I don't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> about that it's just a dude it's so busy </connor>
<joey> for me yeah I just I don't enjoy it even </joey>
<joey> even for people who are like okay in a </joey>
<connor> crowd like just how packed Kyoto gets </connor>
<joey> especially at Nara as well like those </joey>
<joey> those like I think are like the top two </joey>
<joey> places where it's like it's literally </joey>
<joey> like going to an anime convention it's </joey>
<joey> just like you're [ __ ] standing like </joey>
<joey> this and it's like and you can't even </joey>
<garnt> get like a good view because you have to </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] look over the heads of everyone </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like is this is it an age </garnt>
<garnt> thing where you just like I don't know </garnt>
<connor> if it is but it has been for me because </connor>
<connor> I used to be like so up for like going </connor>
<joey> into big crowds or you know seven age </joey>
<joey> thing yeah yeah and then the more older </joey>
<joey> I got the less patience I had for like </joey>
<joey> big groups of people to the point where </joey>
<garnt> now I would do anything to just avoid it </garnt>
<joey> if I can I think it's an age thing </joey>
<garnt> because I think all three of us are </garnt>
<garnt> there </garnt>
<connor> we're just like yeah okay here's if </connor>
<connor> there's a giant crowd it needs to be </connor>
<connor> something that makes the giant crowd in </connor>
<garnt> my mind worth the sacrifice yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly something about this is </garnt>
<joey> like such moving but something about not </joey>
<joey> being able to walk the pace I want to </joey>
<joey> walk just just gets to me and it's just </joey>
<joey> it's such a small thing but if there's a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] penguin walk right like yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah little little tiny baby steps yeah </joey>
<joey> if you just penguin walk like uh because </joey>
<joey> when we went to uh Shibuya like last </joey>
<joey> weekend yeah and you were like uh where </joey>
<joey> are you and uh I was like oh I'm just </joey>
<joey> around the corner 10 minutes later he </joey>
<joey> text me again being like where are you </joey>
<joey> and I literally was just like penguin </joey>
<joey> Walking In This Crowd I was literally </joey>
<joey> just around the corner and I'm like </joey>
<garnt> shibia never again never [ __ ] again </garnt>
<connor> that that's shoulders </connor>
<garnt> oh my God and they told me it was too </garnt>
<garnt> busy yeah I was like yeah okay well yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's the point yeah like the crossing </joey>
<connor> was really busy yeah of course it is </connor>
<joey> um and uh yeah every night we went out </joey>
<joey> as well security we went out and luckily </joey>
<joey> I had a friend who </joey>
<joey> um was from Kyoto who I I hang out with </joey>
<joey> a few times when I went last time and </joey>
<joey> they'd show me a bunch of bars so it was </joey>
<joey> great excite a bunch of bars that I knew </joey>
<joey> that were great yeah they were good </joey>
<joey> vibes and I like it when they're like </joey>
<garnt> not on the street and a lot of these </garnt>
<joey> bars weren't so it's great because you </joey>
<joey> can actually always get in yeah </joey>
<joey> um and then um which if you cocktail </joey>
<joey> bars and then I was like okay I got an </joey>
<joey> idea I want to take them I just looked </joey>
<joey> on my phone I was like is there an </joey>
<joey> airsoft Barn nearby and there seems to </joey>
<joey> be an airsoft bar in like every city </joey>
<joey> yeah it was fun yeah and so we I found </joey>
<connor> an airsoft bot it looks super Jank they </connor>
<connor> did like tacos and shisha and Airsoft </connor>
<connor> it's just like a weird combination it </connor>
<connor> was in Kyoto about it it's really </connor>
<joey> peaceful like Kyoto apparently The </joey>
<joey> Nightlife area of Kyoto is like pretty </joey>
<joey> wild like oh yeah it's very loud and </joey>
<joey> touristy can't say I think in general is </joey>
<joey> like very loud so I was like yeah I </joey>
<joey> found this bar and I was like [ __ ] it </joey>
<joey> let's go so I took my parents to the </joey>
<joey> shooting bar and I'm like yeah pick a </joey>
<joey> gun we'll go shoot we'll shoot it in the </joey>
<joey> shooting range so I'm like you have a </joey>

<joey> like all right let me show you how it </joey>
<joey> sounds like I was like that's gaming and </joey>
<joey> I did pretty good of course but yeah but </joey>
<joey> more importantly uh there is such a </joey>
<joey> weird bar and then after that I was like </joey>
<joey> we've got to find some weird ass salary </joey>
<joey> Man karaoke bar that isn't on the street </joey>
<joey> right it's gonna be on like the fourth </joey>
<joey> floor yeah and I found this bar with it </joey>
<joey> was this is a weird karaoke bar </joey>
<joey> um that was like a mismatch of like </joey>
<connor> there was like a tatami area with like </connor>
<connor> game consoles and there was like lawn </connor>
<connor> chairs in this other Corner because my </connor>
<connor> parents wanted to do karaoke and at </connor>
<connor> first they were like no no I don't want </connor>
<connor> to do any songs and I was like yeah I'll </connor>
<connor> sing I'll sing so sang and then </connor>
<connor> eventually they were kind of like I </connor>
<connor> guess we'll do one song and then they </connor>
<connor> got two into it and I was like all right </connor>
<connor> we're gonna go now stop stop queuing </connor>
<connor> songs and she's like yeah we'll go we'll </connor>

<connor> mom's putting in another [ __ ] song I </connor>
<connor> mean mom we gotta go </connor>
<connor> please yeah yeah and they just love </connor>
<garnt> karaoke and the I think the Japanese uh </garnt>
<joey> bar owner was like what the [ __ ] is </joey>
<joey> going what the [ __ ] is this because our </joey>
<connor> friend came with us as well and he was </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] awful at singing and he was </joey>
<garnt> screaming I of course Eugene would be of </garnt>
<joey> course of course he would be off Pitch </joey>
<joey> he doesn't strike me as a bit of a scene </joey>
<connor> yeah he was like all off Pitch screaming </connor>
<connor> and then this guy was smoking his </connor>
<joey> cigarettes before we came in in a moment </joey>
<joey> when our friend started singing he was </joey>
<connor> like all right I'm out see ya I just </connor>
<connor> laughed </connor>
<connor> and I went in the toilet and it was I </connor>
<joey> posted on Twitter of the tiny ass uh </joey>
<joey> toilet and I'm taking a piss and just a </joey>
<joey> cockroach just walks over my foot and I </joey>
<connor> was like yeah that seems about right </connor>
<joey> yeah I was like oh God you're all right </joey>
<garnt> at home oh God you know I kind of love </garnt>
<joey> the vibe of those bars you find it no I </joey>
<joey> do I love them because you know there </joey>
<joey> are so many bars nowadays where you know </joey>
<joey> people think about oh what's the concept </joey>
<joey> of this bar what's the selling point of </joey>
<joey> this bar and then you find places like </joey>
<garnt> the airsoft shisha place and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like some guy drunk at 3M being like </garnt>
<connor> dude they were like just Bros yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> super chill they were like what do you </garnt>
<garnt> want to do yeah I was like I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> opening up ball what should we have that </garnt>
<connor> ball [ __ ] Airsoft </connor>
<connor> it was like a weird mural on the wall of </connor>
<connor> like attack helicopters and juice it was </connor>
<joey> really weird it was clearly everything </joey>
<connor> but Japanese yeah it was just the </connor>
<joey> weirdest [ __ ] bar when I think it's </joey>
<joey> Japan I think of Airsoft tacos and [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> well it's like that's what I'm saying </joey>
<joey> like I'm like let's go to the weird bars </joey>
<joey> like I think they really enjoyed that </joey>
<joey> yeah some like really nice ones really </joey>
<joey> like good sit-down ones but also a bunch </joey>
<joey> of weird ones yeah and the next day we </joey>
<joey> uh oh dude like I was pretty shocked I </joey>
<joey> my parents like how are we getting to </joey>
<joey> All Star Girls I don't know I'll figure </joey>
<joey> it out in the morning it can't be and I </joey>
<joey> took this for granted like I think </joey>
<joey> people when they come to Japan like they </joey>
<joey> feel really like intimidated by like </joey>
<joey> transporting getting places yeah and I </joey>
<connor> guess because we've just done it so </connor>
<connor> goddamn much it's like dude there's </connor>
<connor> always a way yeah you don't need to </connor>
<joey> worry about it you can figure it out in </joey>
<joey> the morning yeah and like luckily </joey>
<joey> because I I knew that </joey>
<joey> um uh also I can get super close I was </joey>
<joey> like yeah sure there's 30 minutes away </joey>
<joey> yeah I'm sure there's like commuter </joey>
<joey> trains and you can get so I was like </joey>
<joey> don't worry about it and there happened </joey>
<joey> to be a train station in like uh that </joey>
<joey> had this train that went all the way </joey>
<joey> there and it was more of like a it was </joey>
<joey> kind of like a hybrid between a commuter </joey>
<joey> train and like a shinkansen where it was </joey>
<joey> like all the trains were laid out like </joey>
<joey> uh like shinkansen's where you get like </joey>
<joey> a seat and table yeah and I found this </joey>
<joey> train I don't know why I'm gonna be like </joey>
<joey> a trainer for a second I even though I </joey>
<joey> don't normally care I so we went to this </joey>
<joey> like normal ass train right </joey>
<joey> and then we go down to the platform and </joey>
<joey> there was like this kiosk on the </joey>
<joey> platform where you could buy tickets to </joey>
<joey> the premium car the green car not the </joey>
<joey> green car because this is like a </joey>
<joey> different line entirely right right they </joey>
<joey> had their own branding and [ __ ] and it </joey>
<joey> was like a kiosk it was like if you want </joey>
<joey> to go in the premium car you're going to </joey>
<joey> pay to upgrade here and I thought okay </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] it let's see what it is so go up to </joey>
<joey> the thing uh bear in mind this whole </joey>
<joey> journey from uh Kyoto to Osaka it was </joey>
<joey> like 300 Yen yeah uh because it's like a </joey>
<connor> normal ass Transportation train super </connor>
<connor> close </connor>
<connor> um and so I thought okay well how much </connor>
<connor> could it be like so I go to this thing </connor>
<connor> and it's it's 500 yen to upgrade to this </connor>
<connor> like luxury train I thought oh let's do </connor>
<connor> it sure let's see what it is we get in </connor>
<connor> dude it's like the nicest thing ever </connor>
<connor> it's like this train is immaculate these </connor>
<connor> seats are incredible and had like a </connor>
<connor> chauffeur in the [ __ ] seat I couldn't </connor>
<connor> believe this thing wow I was like 500 </connor>
<connor> yen in the UK this would cost like 400 </connor>
<connor> quid yeah just to upgrade to this I was </connor>
<connor> like holy [ __ ] dude it was so cool I </connor>
<joey> just and I just got such a like that </joey>
<joey> made me so happy just finding that out </joey>
<joey> and that we just got on that thing and </joey>
<joey> it was super nice and not the first </joey>
<joey> class of commuter trains it's just </joey>
<joey> randomly found this premium s and I </joey>
<joey> wouldn't have found it unless I just </joey>
<joey> happened to walk past that section of </joey>
<joey> the car because they had these two </joey>
<joey> things so you could just pay with your </joey>
<joey> suitcase upgrade it I thought dude </joey>
<joey> that's sick and then the moment you walk </joey>
<joey> onto the premium car there's like </joey>
<connor> someone is like immediately like shove </connor>
<connor> your tickets to enter the premium car </connor>
<connor> he's all dressed up like a like really </connor>
<connor> fancy yeah yeah this is sick this is so </connor>
<connor> sick oh yeah character and uh sorry I </connor>
<joey> got to Osaka did that and uh yeah walked </joey>
<joey> around or soccer took them to like the </joey>
<joey> Pokemon Center there thoughts on body </joey>
<joey> because they were like they wanted to </joey>
<joey> buy stuff for like nephews and stuff and </joey>
<connor> dude there was a line of like 200 people </connor>
<garnt> to buy stuff something like this or </garnt>
<garnt> something of course there would be yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> there was a retro arcade and I was like </connor>
<connor> you should come you should check out </connor>
<connor> some retro arcade I thought they weren't </connor>
<joey> gonna like it much but my dad was he was </joey>
<joey> just playing Gallagher for like an hour </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like okay I can still play Metal </garnt>
<garnt> Slug until he's done I was I was like </garnt>
<connor> I'm chill with this chill out just </connor>
<connor> crushing it yeah yeah yeah I took him to </connor>
<connor> almost like a castle which is probably </connor>
<connor> my favorite touristy thing that I did it </connor>
<connor> looks like a castle was kind of sick I I </connor>
<connor> a lot of the touristy stuff in Japan I </connor>
<joey> either haven't done or have done and </joey>
<joey> thought it was kind of meh yeah because </joey>
<joey> a lot of it's super overrated or super </joey>
<joey> Rams um but also like a castle actually </joey>
<joey> the view from it was really cool and all </joey>
<joey> the historical stuff uh was uh really </joey>
<joey> cool and quite interesting although </joey>
<joey> there was like two floors of the castle </joey>
<joey> which you weren't allowed to photograph </joey>
<joey> and I don't know why that I'm wondering </joey>
<joey> what the rules are behind this but this </joey>
<joey> dude had the worst job ever he had a </joey>
<joey> giant no photography sign and whenever </joey>
<connor> anyone tried to take a photo or whipped </connor>
<connor> it out he would scream and run across </connor>
<connor> selling no photo no photo and I can't I </connor>
<connor> just imagine myself like man what a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> job yeah just every tourist known to man </connor>
<connor> your job is to figure out what goddamn </connor>
<connor> language to shout at them in because </connor>
<connor> people are gonna take photos yeah </connor>
<connor> they're just gonna do it like is this </connor>
<connor> just how it is and it should make me </connor>
<connor> think like what is the what is the </connor>
<garnt> thought process behind not a lot that </garnt>
<garnt> guy impact ain't getting paid enough man </garnt>
<garnt> dude nowhere near enough but also </garnt>
<joey> polyglot goes to the efforts 12 </joey>
<connor> languages and he gets that job you've </connor>
<connor> got to figure out like you're like damn </connor>
<connor> I I think you just defaults to English </connor>
<connor> on everyone yeah I don't understand why </connor>
<connor> they we couldn't take pictures of it </connor>
<connor> because we should Miniatures of the </connor>
<connor> castle Yeah I was just in my head I'm </connor>
<garnt> like I don't I </garnt>
<connor> I don't know like people are gonna take </connor>
<garnt> pictures like crazy of course I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know if I'm just being like a cynical </garnt>
<connor> I'm like maybe you should just let him </connor>
<joey> take pictures I mean Japan's rules </joey>
<joey> concerning like no photography is like </joey>
<joey> it can be quite agreeing it's confusing </joey>
<connor> because it's just only those two floors </connor>
<connor> yeah but the view from the castle is </connor>
<joey> amazing uh if you ever get the chance to </joey>
<joey> go to Osaka I mean I'd recommend it I'd </joey>
<joey> it also that Deal's great yeah yeah I I </joey>
<joey> normally I I never do the touristy </joey>
<connor> stocks I think it's so lame </connor>
<connor> um but this one actually was it's </connor>
<connor> probably the best view of all soccer as </connor>
<connor> well you get such a cool panoramic view </connor>
<garnt> the whole uh whole city also Osaka is </garnt>
<connor> just a really fun city yeah yeah so </connor>
<joey> um I took them to at night I took them </joey>
<joey> body and they were like yeah I guess </joey>
<joey> I've seen it at movies before they were </joey>
<joey> kind of underwhelmed by it they're like </joey>
<joey> yeah I guess it's kind of cool I mean I </joey>
<joey> guess yeah it is just just lights in it </joey>
<joey> yeah I get it you know one impressed by </joey>
<joey> the giant [ __ ] crab mechanical thing </joey>
<joey> that they have and like one of the crab </joey>
<connor> stores oh we didn't go past that one I </connor>
<joey> didn't know I just tempted the I we </joey>
<joey> walked along the river yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> um and uh yeah then then we went out to </garnt>
<connor> drinking and it was fun I mean also </connor>
<connor> people are pretty fun yeah I think I </connor>
<joey> went to the one bar </joey>
<connor> there was just only foreigners by </connor>
<connor> accident uh </connor>
<connor> like we went out of this cocktail bar </connor>
<connor> and I thought sick dude I found a sick </connor>
<connor> cocktail bar yeah and so we walk in and </connor>
<connor> there's just like one of the tourist </connor>
<connor> person in there yeah so in the time </connor>
<joey> we're drinking our wandering the entire </joey>
<joey> Place fills with tourists yeah and I was </joey>
<joey> like damn this not not that there's </joey>
<joey> anything wrong with that because I mean </joey>
<joey> technically you wanted to give them like </joey>
<joey> a Japanese I was like I don't even find </joey>
<joey> them a cool spot and I thought I found a </joey>
<joey> cool spot yeah but obviously I don't </joey>
<joey> live in Osaka and then of course I just </joey>
<joey> found the one where it's [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> everyone every goddamn tourist found </connor>
<joey> yeah um but then I found this really </joey>
<connor> cool like if you're looking I I got this </connor>
<connor> this ad for this part it looks so weird </connor>
<connor> and I was like dude I was like I don't </connor>
<connor> know if we should go but our friend </connor>
<connor> Museum was like we should go but I was </connor>
<connor> kind of like I don't know so it was </connor>
<garnt> called a Magic Bar okay that sounds like </garnt>
<garnt> a very Eugene thing yeah so then here's </garnt>
<joey> the deal here's the deal so we found it </joey>
<joey> right I saw it and I was like I don't </joey>
<joey> know yeah and then his story he's like </joey>
<joey> we should go check it out and I'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's in like literally on the Alley that </joey>
<joey> has just all of the sex stuff yeah right </joey>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<joey> um it's on like the fifth floor of a </joey>
<joey> really dirty ass building </joey>
<joey> you know and it's like one of like six </joey>
<joey> bars on this fifth floor of this tiny </joey>
<joey> building so there's like Max five seats </joey>
<joey> and the thing is and this is what had me </joey>
<connor> worried was that if you sit down on this </connor>
<connor> Magic Bar you had to sit there for 70 </connor>
<joey> minutes because you're paying for 70 </joey>
<joey> minutes of magic regardless oh okay yeah </joey>
<connor> so he does a little show for you yeah </connor>
<joey> you drink and it's like okay like the </joey>
<joey> bartender is a magician and it was like </joey>
<connor> 3500 Yen each per person to sit down and </connor>
<joey> the bartender's a magician yeah now I I </joey>
<joey> was like I this could be either the best </joey>
<joey> thing ever or just the weirdest thing </joey>
<joey> ever yeah and so he's like we should </joey>
<joey> check it out I'm fine fine I'll check it </joey>
<joey> out I'll I'll and again I'm the vibe </joey>
<joey> check I have to go in see if they're </joey>
<joey> cool with a white guy walking in and you </joey>
<joey> know even I'm talking you know and I was </joey>
<joey> I'll explain to Eugene I'm like listen </joey>
<connor> there's like QuickTime events the first </connor>
<connor> three sentences matter so much in these </connor>
<connor> bars you have to nail every interaction </connor>
<joey> in Japanese for them to be comfortable </joey>
<joey> if you don't have communication 100 yeah </joey>
<connor> all the first three questions I'll ask </connor>
<joey> you all the first three sentences </joey>
<joey> because otherwise they'll get super </joey>
<joey> nervous and they'll be like actually no </joey>
<joey> don't sit down sorry we're reserved or </joey>
<joey> yeah one of the excuses right so you </joey>
<joey> need to nail it and I'm like oh God I </joey>
<connor> hate I hate doing this because like it's </connor>
<connor> just annoying because then I I'm like I </connor>
<connor> talk to them and then I'm like here are </connor>
<connor> my very foreign people with me you know </connor>
<connor> as if it's me and then it's like </connor>
<connor> everyone else speaks Japanese it's kind </connor>
<connor> of easier yeah yeah you know but if I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna be the translator and sometimes </connor>
<connor> and also like this is a different </connor>
<connor> dialect as well yeah I don't understand </connor>
<connor> what they're saying and it's kind of </connor>
<joey> awkward but anyway we go in this bar and </joey>
<joey> there's no one in here and it looks like </joey>
<joey> a just a normal ass weird bar yeah it </joey>
<joey> was just like it's just a bar with a </joey>
<joey> bunch of random stuff in it sure and uh </joey>
<connor> he seems kind of interesting this guy </connor>
<connor> and he was called like oh [ __ ] I had the </connor>
<connor> business card oh he has a magic name he </connor>
<connor> has a magic name but it's his name but </connor>
<joey> magic in front of it so it's his surname </joey>
<joey> white Magic Mike </joey>
<joey> Magic Mike and we walk in and the guy's </joey>
<joey> like kind of friendly yeah uh a little </joey>
<joey> bit precarious at first but then he kind </joey>
<connor> of warms up and he's like okay cool like </connor>
<connor> you're okay with the he was he explained </connor>
<connor> the rule again that we read on the </connor>
<connor> Google that was like yeah are you cool </connor>
<connor> with the 3 500 yeah I don't wanna like </connor>
<connor> you know yeah it's fine yeah </connor>
<connor> and so he's kind of getting ready he </connor>
<connor> makes his a drink and then he he like </connor>
<joey> he's like here play with this thing and </joey>
<joey> he puts like this thing the useless box </joey>
<connor> have you seen this thing before that's </connor>
<joey> where you push it and then the thing </joey>
<garnt> comes out and just pushes it back yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah it's like this and I was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> God this is it is this like the vibe </garnt>
<garnt> while he's getting ready just gives us </garnt>
<connor> this and he tells my mum to just push it </connor>
<connor> forward and I'm like okay man Push It </connor>
<connor> Forward I should just presses it </connor>
<connor> downwards and obviously nothing happens </connor>
<connor> because you should push forward yeah </connor>
<connor> like mum Push It Forward how do you [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> up the one thing you have to sorry </connor>
<joey> anyway so he's doing that and then he's </joey>
<joey> still preparing some stuff and then he </joey>
<joey> comes back out takes his useless box </joey>
<joey> puts his other thing and it's like a </joey>
<connor> coffin and you press the button and then </connor>
<connor> just this eye opens and the little thing </connor>
<connor> goes </connor>
<connor> I'm like what the [ __ ] is this bar dude </connor>
<joey> what is the concept for the Magic Bar </joey>
<joey> was like you walk in it's like all right </joey>
<connor> poof your money </connor>

<connor> yourself you know dude this man is </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] shutting the ball low </connor>
<joey> yeah this is this is weird like and then </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> he like he goes back because he's like a </joey>
<joey> little curtain in the bar separating </joey>
<joey> like one third of the bar where I guess </joey>
<joey> all his shit's in there yeah so it goes </joey>
<connor> in this curtain and my my mom is like </connor>
<connor> looking terrified she's like can we go </connor>
<connor> or something I'm like no we've paid now </connor>

<joey> seeing how the show is turning out </joey>
<connor> he just he just goes back in and then </connor>
<connor> he's like silently walks in like a mime </connor>
<connor> and then he just smiles and in his teeth </connor>
<connor> are just glow up teeth </connor>
<joey> it's just and he just starts making </joey>
<joey> noises and I came out with the grills </joey>

<connor> they always look sketchable they always </connor>
<connor> charge a massive fee for yeah and then </connor>
<connor> I'm always like I don't know and then he </connor>
<joey> did those tricks dude it was so he was </joey>
<joey> actually [ __ ] nuts then he started </joey>
<joey> doing like the whole </joey>
<joey> um the classic where you have like a </joey>
<joey> ring and then he keeps somehow getting </joey>
<joey> it on and off his finger with like </joey>
<joey> sleight of hands yeah yeah and then he </joey>
<joey> brought out like a rope and then a wand </joey>
<joey> and then he would somehow like you'd </joey>
<connor> have to like I don't know it was maybe </connor>
<connor> it was like basic magic but he was </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] good how intoxicated were </connor>
<garnt> you I was not that interesting that's </garnt>
<connor> the important question he was he was to </connor>
<connor> his credit his acting charge was pretty </connor>
<connor> good and he was putting on a show he was </connor>
<joey> pretty funny all right and then uh at </joey>
<joey> the end he did like uh yeah yeah he did </joey>
<joey> a few tricks that were really [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> cool I thought like he did one way like </joey>
<joey> put the like a full-on nail like a giant </joey>
<joey> nail up his nose oh yes you like hammer </joey>
<joey> it and stuff and then it appeared and </joey>
<joey> then like okay is this your card and </joey>
<joey> then it you know it wouldn't be the card </joey>
<joey> and to his credit like he his acting was </joey>
<connor> really [ __ ] good because I thought </connor>
<connor> he'd [ __ ] up and then he just didn't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up and then somehow he he he's like </connor>
<connor> no no this is mistake this is a mistake </connor>
<connor> I have to uh a banish card and then he </connor>
<connor> starts eating the card right and then he </connor>

<joey> fun it was great my parents loved it and </joey>
<joey> then uh yeah that was a fun night out in </joey>
<joey> Osaka I didn't go crazy because you know </joey>
<joey> if I took him to like a girls bar or bar </joey>
<connor> we have to talk more Japanese people it </connor>
<joey> would just be me translating for like </joey>
<connor> three people and yeah yeah like it's a </connor>
<joey> lot it's exhausting first time </joey>
<connor> it's like [ __ ] I just wanted a drink of </connor>
<garnt> course yeah no because you've got to </garnt>
<garnt> play caretaker because you dude I did </garnt>
<connor> but I was like how do I make experiences </connor>
<joey> they don't rely on me translating </joey>
<joey> because you want to have fun as well </joey>
<joey> yeah I want to not be exhausted yeah you </joey>
<garnt> know everyone knows I'm driving showing </garnt>
<garnt> them around and I'm just translating all </garnt>
<garnt> day and it's like oh my God it's tough </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you forget especially like after </garnt>
<joey> taking care of people how much you just </joey>
<joey> take for granted in terms of how you </joey>
<joey> know like the way the country functions </joey>
<joey> for sure like you know when you get </joey>
<joey> asked like the littlest thing for every </joey>
<garnt> thing that kind of like adds up and adds </garnt>
<connor> up and adds up yeah every single time </connor>
<joey> yeah they asked me especially if your </joey>
<joey> dad is asking what beer this is </joey>
<joey> um like they had cover charge in one </joey>
<connor> place because current charge is pretty </connor>
<connor> common in Japan yeah yeah 500 to 1000 </connor>
<connor> yen you get a snack or something and my </connor>
<connor> dad was like did I did I get scammed and </connor>
<joey> I was like no no it's </joey>
<connor> it's normal but it uses on guard with </connor>
<joey> everything yeah yeah like an ATM he's </joey>
<joey> like is that ATM safe and I was like </joey>
<joey> they're all safe every ATM's safe I mean </joey>
<joey> I get where it's concerned because it's </joey>
<joey> not all safe yeah I told him I'm like </joey>
<garnt> everything's safe here don't worry like </garnt>
<connor> anything it's all good it's all safe no </connor>
<garnt> one's trying to scam you no one's trying </garnt>
<garnt> to do anything Japan's probably well </garnt>
<garnt> like one of the countries in Asia where </garnt>
<garnt> you can feel most at home feeling safe </garnt>
<joey> not getting scammed just stay away from </joey>
<garnt> the back streets of shinjuk and shubia </garnt>
<garnt> you'll be good yeah yeah just don't say </garnt>
<garnt> yes if someone asks you to come to the </garnt>
<joey> bar and you're probably like safe yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah I told them to go to saksa as well </connor>
<joey> I didn't want to go with them because I </joey>
<joey> was like this oh I was really busy </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah I took Sid's parents there </garnt>
<joey> yeah that's it yeah I mean it's like </joey>
<garnt> Kyoto and just like one one little area </garnt>
<connor> in Tokyo it's kind of tough because I </connor>
<connor> don't think they have much interest in </connor>
<joey> temples or stuff like that they </joey>
<joey> appreciate it but they're not like </joey>
<joey> they're not they don't really they're </joey>
<joey> not seeking it yeah I think you should </joey>

<connor> Australia everyone's blowing smoke on </connor>
<connor> themselves like what are you what I was </connor>

<joey> the incense in the thing and then they </joey>
<joey> yeah you know yeah they kept asking me </joey>
<joey> what all the when we went to Kyoto they </joey>
<joey> were like what is all this stuff with </joey>
<joey> they're trying to why why they always </joey>
<joey> want money I was like I said I guess God </joey>
<joey> needs money I don't know I don't know </joey>

<connor> like this is why I didn't want my </connor>
<connor> fortune top I always get bad fortunes </connor>
<connor> and I was like no it's fun it's fun to </connor>
<garnt> find it you remind me because we I did </garnt>
<joey> the same thing with like Sid's parents </joey>
<joey> as well same thing mom mom got the bad </joey>
<joey> fortune and she was like I can't believe </joey>
<joey> it of course my fortune is bad and I'm </joey>
<joey> like we need to just tie it up then she </joey>
<joey> so she starts tying it up and she's like </joey>

<joey> that part of the game and it's just I </joey>
<joey> want to be double blessed actually yeah </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like Mom you're a true </joey>
<joey> gacha gamer that right now you've </joey>

<joey> already so familiar with her my dad's </joey>
<joey> come to Japan like [ __ ] 30 times in </joey>
<garnt> his lifetime so I'm just like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> have that like immediate you know thing </garnt>
<garnt> of like let me show you the wonders of </garnt>
<garnt> this country that I love kind of deal </garnt>
<garnt> right because it's like I've done it </garnt>
<garnt> with my you know friends who have never </garnt>
<garnt> come to Japan and stuff like that but </garnt>
<garnt> it's different right yeah it's different </garnt>
<garnt> but oh but I will say it is it never </garnt>
<garnt> gets old seeing someone who's never been </garnt>
<garnt> to Japan or never been to Asia and just </garnt>
<garnt> seen Japan and just like blowing their </garnt>
<garnt> minds at the most [ __ ] like senseless </garnt>
<garnt> things ever yeah for no apparent reason </garnt>
<garnt> you know like when I took like my </garnt>
<garnt> University friends to Kyoto for instance </garnt>
<garnt> like my my friend just like one time we </garnt>
<connor> were on our way to Human and he just </connor>
<connor> stopped at a [ __ ] like a vending </connor>
<connor> machine but it wasn't just one vending </connor>
<connor> machine it was like six vending machines </connor>
<connor> all in a row and he was like taking </connor>
<connor> photos of this I'm like it's a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> video machine that we walked past like </joey>
<joey> 20 of them and he was like yeah but the </joey>
<joey> six of them I'm like </joey>
<joey> why am I taking you all the way they </joey>
<connor> were impressed uh so if you have a drive </connor>
<connor> in Japan you stop at one of the service </connor>
<connor> stations they were impressed by the </connor>
<connor> giant you've seen these right the giant </connor>
<connor> coffee machines oh yeah yeah they have </connor>
<connor> these massive coffee machines that make </connor>
<joey> like like kind of fresh coffee uh in </joey>
<joey> like a cup and it's all like timed and </joey>
<joey> this one has a screen showing you the </joey>
<joey> coffee </joey>
<joey> just a cup it was just like okay but </joey>
<joey> they were kind of impressed by that </joey>
<joey> they're like this is pretty good </joey>
<connor> um parents also not very good with </connor>
<connor> chopsticks </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<garnt> he's better than my mom he'll probably </garnt>
<garnt> want that three sets oh they tried they </garnt>
<connor> tried it was tough it was tough we had </connor>
<joey> um with some gyoza yeah that was kind of </joey>
<joey> tough oh there's a slippery bug yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah because I was like we </connor>
<connor> should try all that because my favorite </connor>
<joey> girls are placed as um </joey>
<joey> they they do uh they do the yucky girls </joey>
<joey> are the normal type but then they also </joey>
<joey> do the if you want to try they can do </joey>
<joey> the deep fried uh boiled and the normal </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah so they would mum was it was </joey>
<garnt> like watching like the Looney Tunes like </garnt>
<garnt> moment when I'm trying to pick up the </garnt>
<garnt> The Boiled gyoza </garnt>
<joey> slipping us splashing in the soy sauce </joey>
<joey> and I felt so bad and I could see my mom </joey>
<joey> was getting more stressed out I'm sorry </joey>
<joey> she's like how do you get good at this </joey>
<joey> I'm like I don't remember ever being </joey>
<joey> good I don't remember ever being like </joey>
<joey> not able to do this yeah I don't know I </joey>
<joey> and I realized now that not having </joey>
<joey> Chopsticks enough not you know learning </joey>
<joey> Chopsticks does kind of I mean take a </joey>
<joey> while if you're if you've never used it </joey>
<joey> um but credits my parents they they keep </joey>
<joey> trying yeah they don't they don't they </joey>
<connor> never like ask for a knife and fork </connor>
<garnt> would be like where is it yeah I </garnt>
<joey> remember the first place we went to this </joey>
<connor> um brought them on knife and fork and </connor>
<joey> like I think your dad was like no I will </joey>
<garnt> not admit defeats and I was like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's going as that all right </garnt>
<joey> damn no well I think that's the best </joey>
<garnt> thing right it's like it's just the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that I think the one thing I always </garnt>
<joey> appreciate about whenever I'm taking </joey>
<joey> people to Japan or you know wherever is </joey>
<joey> that like if if they're just like even </joey>
<joey> willing they don't even have to like it </joey>
<joey> the fact the fact that they're just </joey>
<joey> willing to participate in the culture is </joey>
<connor> like the best thing </connor>
<connor> they're trying everything and then that </connor>
<connor> you know appreciating every aspect of </connor>
<joey> the culture which I'm very fun I knew </joey>
<connor> they would but you know in your head </connor>
<joey> you're always worried you're like oh man </joey>
<joey> they you know they they don't really </joey>
<connor> care that much about Japan so yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> they wouldn't yeah well the one thing </connor>
<connor> that I think is the hardest and even for </connor>
<connor> me this is kind of tough is that </connor>
<connor> you have to resist that urge to let the </connor>
<joey> taxi driver pick up your luggage because </joey>
<joey> sometimes the Dude Looks like he's like </joey>
<joey> 90. he's like half your size and he's </joey>
<joey> going to pick up your heavy ass suitcase </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and like ah dude it's like </joey>
<joey> it's it's you can obviously pick it up </joey>
<joey> like he's fine to do it and it's like </joey>
<joey> it's sometimes just easier I'm like just </joey>
<joey> let him let him do it trust me it's </joey>
<joey> gonna be so annoying if you like if you </joey>
<joey> had this problem sometimes when you when </joey>
<joey> you try to put your luggage in and </joey>
<connor> they're like no I want to do it and it's </connor>
<joey> like this whole thing of like okay oh </joey>
<joey> I've had the opposite happen where like </joey>
<joey> it was a super super old guy like frail </joey>
<joey> as [ __ ] trying to pick up my luggage and </joey>
<joey> he like went to grab it he didn't even </joey>
<joey> like try to lift this thing up he </joey>
<joey> literally just grabbed the handle for </joey>
<connor> about two seconds and then just let go </connor>
<connor> he looked at me he's like </connor>
<garnt> I think it's like the like Asian kid in </garnt>
<joey> me because my parents are like pretty </joey>
<joey> old now so I've gotten used to being </joey>
<joey> like no dad for [ __ ] sake you're in </joey>
<joey> your 70s yeah let me carry them I always </joey>
<connor> want to do it yeah yeah so I'm like </connor>
<connor> every time I get to the taxi I'm ready </connor>
<joey> for like a little not not a fight but </joey>
<joey> like I'm ready to fight him to let me </joey>
<joey> know like give me that [ __ ] okay get in </joey>
<garnt> the taxi okay I'm a young healthy man I </garnt>
<connor> can do this okay don't worry about it </connor>
<connor> yeah I mean I try to do that and if it's </connor>
<joey> if it is actually heavy I'm like dude no </joey>
<joey> yeah no don't do it yeah it's like light </joey>
<joey> I'm like all right it's okay fine yeah </joey>
<garnt> of course yeah yeah because it's like </garnt>
<joey> sometimes especially at least for my </joey>
<joey> parents I told them to do that because I </joey>
<connor> was like don't you're not gonna be able </connor>
<connor> to communicate with them it's gonna be </connor>
<joey> awkward just just just let them do it </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and then also let them cook do </joey>
<joey> not do not open the doors don't close </joey>
<joey> the doors don't open the door oh it does </joey>
<joey> just don't and this is the hardest thing </joey>
<joey> to tell people because I feel like you </joey>
<joey> can tell them and they just don't they </joey>
<joey> don't do it because it's like it's it's </joey>
<joey> something in your brain it's hardwired </joey>
<joey> yeah where you open the door and you </joey>
<joey> close the door to the taxi yeah but like </joey>
<joey> I was like do not touch the doors I know </joey>
<connor> you want to don't do it they will open </connor>
<connor> it for you so they they're kind of </connor>
<connor> getting used to it and stuff I don't get </connor>
<joey> it it's it's tough It's hard traveling </joey>
<joey> outside of Japan and unlearning that the </joey>
<joey> amount of [ __ ] times I've traveled </joey>
<joey> out and I've just for one second walk </joey>
<joey> straight out of an Uber and just not </joey>
<garnt> looked back yeah it's just it it happens </garnt>
<garnt> every single time I like I've had the </garnt>
<joey> opposite where like I walk up to the </joey>
<joey> Uber I'm just standing in front of it </joey>
<joey> just waiting for it to open I'm just </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah yeah right yeah yeah yeah </joey>

<joey> of panic from where the moment they look </joey>
<joey> at my face and they're just like oh God </joey>
<garnt> yeah cause you've got a beard you know </garnt>
<joey> as soon as he as soon as this </joey>

<connor> can play on normal videos you know it's </connor>
<connor> just always that panic when I walk into </connor>
<joey> a bar and there's like five seconds of </joey>
<joey> panic on their face and yeah to be like </joey>
<joey> immediately after you talk more than I </joey>
<joey> normally would yeah yeah my first </joey>
<joey> Japanese would be no questions asked but </joey>
<connor> immediately just start being like Oh </connor>
<joey> you're on me yeah yeah yeah yeah I have </joey>
<joey> to do this thing now where like because </joey>
<joey> there's that 0.5 seconds a panic from </joey>
<joey> seeing my face the moment </joey>
<joey> immediately just start talking yeah I </joey>
<joey> don't even give them a shadow of a Down </joey>
<garnt> this is the Strat by the way if you do </garnt>
<garnt> if you are a foreign person uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> and you do know a little bit of Japanese </garnt>

<joey> bars where they might be a bit like no </joey>
<joey> you just have to immediately </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> oh okay </connor>
<joey> I've noticed ever since like I've grown </joey>
<joey> like a little stubble I've I've I guess </joey>
<joey> I've like stopped being like mistaken </joey>
<joey> for Asian in Asian countries I don't </joey>
<joey> know what it is about the beard before </joey>
<joey> it was kind of like 50 50 you know I had </joey>
<joey> the tan skin but sometimes you know </joey>
<joey> maybe I'll be mistaken for a local like </joey>
<joey> even in it's actually no especially in </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] Thailand yeah like I remember I </joey>
<joey> remember this one time I was </joey>
<joey> um I was at a restaurant and you know </joey>

<joey> that so often yeah man it's not even </joey>
<joey> funny like the mo like the you know I </joey>
<connor> understand like the initial reaction </connor>
<joey> they see my face they're like oh you're </joey>
<connor> not Japanese looking so I'll start </connor>
<connor> speaking in just the most broken English </connor>
<joey> possible yeah start explaining [ __ ] and </joey>
<joey> then I respond back being like awesome </joey>
<connor> on this there yeah and then they're like </connor>
<joey> yes so anyway </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] I just spoke Japanese I understand </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] I am one of you yeah and I refuse </joey>
<garnt> to leave this place until I'm treated </garnt>
<connor> that way it is fun seeing the like </connor>
<garnt> relieved look when you're like oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's like nature is like healing it's </connor>
<connor> carrying all back oh my God </connor>
<connor> amazing okay question uh Jerry because </connor>
<connor> you've been in the situation forever </connor>
<connor> when you see when you're like checking </connor>
<joey> into a hotel maybe you're out somewhere </joey>
<joey> and you see like somebody who's like </joey>
<joey> English speaking having like a lot of </joey>
<joey> difficulty uh with whatever they're </joey>
<connor> doing do you ever like help or you like </connor>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> it's uh it's probably 50 50. okay but </joey>
<joey> like sometimes like you know if I'm say </joey>
<connor> like at a hotel right and the person in </connor>
<connor> front of me is like foreign and then you </connor>
<connor> know kind of struggling then it's like </connor>
<connor> well I want to get checked in so I'll </connor>
<connor> help him out they've seen him in front </connor>
<joey> of you yeah but if they're like another </joey>
<joey> person yeah off to the side I'm just </joey>
<joey> like couldn't be me </joey>
<joey> I was just like I just came back to be </joey>
<joey> like let's see let's see how they </joey>
<joey> resolve this let's see how they passed </joey>
<joey> this test so it's a case by case I think </joey>
<joey> but like you know like there's every now </joey>
<connor> and then you know like I it could be </connor>
<connor> maybe be like in a Tokyo station or </connor>
<connor> something and I see like a family that's </connor>
<joey> like clearly struggling to get around </joey>
<joey> and then sometimes if I have time I'll </joey>
<joey> be like oh you're okay like let me help </joey>
<joey> you out stuff like that uh yeah but it </joey>
<joey> depends on my mood really like or if I'm </joey>
<connor> like I don't know if you're busy like I </connor>
<joey> get it you got to go somewhere yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly but sometimes I just kind of sit </joey>
<joey> back and be like I want to see how they </joey>
<connor> figure it out </connor>
<connor> I had a few interactions right there was </connor>
<connor> like one coffee shop and uh it was </connor>
<connor> pretty big coffee trip actually it was </connor>
<connor> really nice one um but they don't they </connor>
<garnt> would call out your number obviously in </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese yeah yeah and uh this person </garnt>
<joey> ordered after me and I I figured that </joey>
<joey> they were what their number was because </joey>
<joey> they were right after me and uh yeah </joey>
<joey> they they look like they're having </joey>
<joey> nightmare time ordering and then I felt </joey>
<connor> bad and then the number got called and I </connor>
<connor> went up to them and I was like oh hey by </connor>
<connor> the way that's your the shows I'm pretty </connor>
<connor> sure oh okay thanks but then they they </connor>
<joey> seemed really confused that I came up to </joey>
<joey> them and told them but yeah they weren't </joey>
<joey> going up and getting their stuff and I </joey>
<joey> was like oh okay whatever yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> there's other time um </joey>
<joey> I was checking in it was so bad uh I'll </joey>
<joey> check into the hotel and it was all </joey>
<joey> going well and the person next to me I </joey>
<joey> guess they started speaking in Japanese </joey>
<joey> to them uh you know and even though my </joey>
<joey> Japanese isn't like perfect I could like </joey>
<joey> hear that the way she was saying things </joey>
<garnt> was like not great Japanese like it </garnt>
<garnt> didn't sound like natural I guess even </garnt>
<joey> though like I'm not great anyway but </joey>
<joey> like the pronunciation I guess I don't </joey>
<joey> know me I'm the last person should be </joey>
<joey> judging </joey>
<joey> um she started speaking Japanese then </joey>
<joey> she started speaking Japanese and then </joey>
<joey> she just immediately was like oh [ __ ] I </joey>
<joey> don't know what the [ __ ] happening and </joey>
<joey> I I it was kind of like I was like I was </joey>
<joey> like I don't want to help she's trying </joey>
<joey> so I was just checking in and it started </joey>
<joey> just getting more painful and more </joey>
<joey> painful right right I was like do you </joey>
<connor> need do you need help she's like no I'm </connor>
<connor> okay I'm like okay thank God I was like </connor>
<joey> it only took me like 30 minutes to check </joey>
<joey> in I think it's just taking forever and </joey>
<joey> it was like oh cause </joey>
<joey> because I I live in Japan so I don't </joey>
<joey> have to show my passport when I check in </joey>
<joey> sometimes I want to see my cards my </joey>
<joey> residence card for living here sometimes </joey>
<joey> they don't technically they're not </joey>
<joey> supposed to ask and they're not supposed </joey>
<joey> to copy it it's just a whole some hotels </joey>
<connor> ask for some hotels don't you can be </connor>
<connor> pushy about it and say don't do it but </connor>
<connor> then it like it gets even weirder when </connor>
<connor> you're traveling with people who do need </connor>
<connor> to show their passports and it was </connor>
<connor> always like hey we wanted to offer a </connor>
<connor> great service where we take the bags to </connor>
<connor> the room they'd be like hey so before we </connor>
<connor> check in can we see everyone's passports </connor>
<connor> I'm like oh but passports are in the </connor>
<connor> bags that you took took yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> they were like oh oh well could you </connor>
<joey> could you like come back later and scan </joey>
<joey> them right I was like all right just </joey>
<joey> never did yeah and I was like it's weird </joey>
<joey> why do they it's like I have I have like </joey>
<connor> a different problem every time I go into </connor>
<joey> a hotel where it's like you know usually </joey>
<joey> other people right they're like oh can </joey>
<garnt> we see your passports or if you live in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan can we at least see also do you </garnt>
<garnt> cut all your resume yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and it's so awkward every time like </garnt>
<joey> everyone's you know giving like this </joey>
<joey> happened and so much on journey across </joey>
<joey> Japan everyone's giving those I do cards </joey>
<joey> right and then the cloaks just like you </joey>
<joey> know looks over at me being like Zodi </joey>
<joey> card [ __ ] and I and it's so awkward me </joey>
<joey> having to be like yeah so I don't have </joey>
<joey> one uh I'm Japanese I can see them </joey>
<joey> pressing X like it's a doubt they're </joey>
<joey> like you sure about that [ __ ] oh </joey>
<joey> you knew horns </joey>
<connor> interaction on the year then like what's </connor>
<joey> up how does this interaction normally go </joey>
<joey> oh no I mean for the most part it's </joey>
<joey> usually I just say oh I'm Japanese in </joey>
<joey> Japanese and they're like yeah okay I'm </joey>
<connor> gonna [ __ ] try that yeah I'm gonna </connor>
<connor> say it see if they stop asking me for my </connor>
<joey> document yes but then every now and then </joey>
<connor> when it's like especially in like if </connor>
<joey> it's like a big city for example with </joey>
<joey> lots of foreigners they they're kind of </joey>
<joey> just like what do you mean by that like </joey>
<joey> what do you mean you're Japanese </joey>
<joey> research music and I'm like uh so I just </joey>
<connor> don't I don't have a anxiety you can't I </connor>
<connor> live here I have yeah well I think I </connor>
<connor> actually did like I I don't I'm not 100 </connor>
<connor> sure on this but I'm pretty sure even if </connor>
<connor> you live here that you're like they're </connor>
<connor> not required to have your ID no but </connor>
<connor> again I guess how do you like take my </connor>
<connor> word for it like I guess I don't know I </connor>
<joey> guess I have to do that I'm like yeah </joey>
<joey> they're like no you're not Japanese you </joey>
<connor> clearly don't look at it like this I am </connor>
<joey> just trust you know I've got chatting </joey>
<joey> with some people who uh have Zaria cards </joey>
<joey> and they really don't like I guess </joey>
<joey> because it's just like the principle </joey>
<joey> they don't want to show them yeah like </joey>
<joey> I'm actually half a shirt [ __ ] you yeah </joey>
<joey> they're like no I'm not sure anymore </joey>
<connor> they always photocopy it as well yeah </connor>
<joey> which I don't get why do they photocopy </joey>
<joey> myself I'm like I don't know I guess </joey>
<joey> maybe it's for like uh like insurance </joey>
<joey> reasons maybe I guess but it's like if </joey>
<joey> you kind of [ __ ] up a room so hard then </joey>
<connor> it's like well we got your info ready a </connor>
<connor> little bit you know a little bit </connor>
<connor> xenophobic to just only get like the </connor>
<joey> foreign residence I guess it's kind of </joey>
<joey> weird yeah so they can actually if it's </joey>
<connor> a police officer </connor>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> did you just say like oh Japanese to it </joey>
<joey> but like everyone else that would care </joey>
<joey> but if it's a police officer yeah no no </joey>
<connor> no police officer yeah they can actually </connor>
<joey> you obviously yeah but like checking </joey>
<joey> into a hotel I think that if if you want </joey>
<connor> to you don't have to prove that you're </connor>
<joey> but I guess yeah it's hard for them as </joey>
<joey> well right well then you're a life hack </joey>
<connor> next time you're at a hotel just be like </connor>
<garnt> in this yeah </garnt>
<connor> Connor coming up to the hotel by the way </connor>
<connor> actually this is it's weird because like </connor>
<joey> normally whenever I travel for work in </joey>
<joey> Japan like we're filming stuff yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it's I noticed that </joey>
<joey> um this is such a a expat [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> problem if you're like booking.com is </joey>
<joey> still set to a foreign country they'll </joey>
<joey> they'll 100 ask you for idea when you </joey>
<joey> get there but yeah because I change </joey>
<joey> because Chris hasn't done it Chris is </joey>
<joey> still set to like the UK yeah and I told </joey>
<joey> him like a million times to change that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] because every time we go to a place </joey>
<joey> they immediately ask for our passports </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it's super annoying having to </joey>
<joey> like do the whole thing uh I set mine to </joey>
<joey> Japan now so that when I book it </joey>
<joey> sometimes they ask sometimes they don't </joey>
<joey> but actually trip no one ever asked me </joey>
<joey> for it oh that's good and no one ever </joey>
<connor> tried to photocopy it and I was like oh </connor>
<joey> this is a nice change of pace that's </joey>
<joey> what they should do it every holiday </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah I'm like chill nice sick </connor>
<connor> awesome coming up with the times I don't </connor>
<connor> know I just it's just it just saves time </connor>
<connor> I just don't want to dude it's so </connor>
<connor> annoying when you when we were cycling </connor>
<connor> every single day on the cycle we have </connor>
<connor> this 30 minute [ __ ] check-in where </connor>
<connor> they want to scan all my documents make </connor>
<connor> sure I'm like legal and it's like oh my </connor>
<connor> god dude like let me just check I need a </connor>
<connor> shower dude I smell like [ __ ] let me in </connor>
<connor> the room </connor>
<connor> like I don't know I it's it's weird I </connor>
<connor> guess especially if like I I don't </connor>
<connor> actually I wonder if it's something to </connor>
<connor> do with paying afterwards and paying </connor>
<connor> um before because all the hotels I paid </connor>
<connor> before uh and when we did uh when we </connor>
<joey> traveled uh with Chris or whatever we </joey>
<joey> always pay after I just also one of the </joey>
<joey> hotels Chris did forget to pay oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it was an apple Hotel hey Chris forgot </joey>
<joey> to pay because she straight up forgot to </joey>
<joey> pay I just left we were late to the </joey>
<joey> stream because Chris had to drive back </joey>
<joey> and go and pay because they called him </joey>
<joey> up and they're like oh assume I was in </joey>
<joey> uh money where the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> so Chris would drive back and go and pay </connor>
<joey> because he's just straight up laughed </joey>
<joey> how many hotels has that man been in how </joey>
<joey> do you forget this is why when I book it </joey>
<connor> I just pay right there I'm like this </connor>
<connor> takes away a giant stress yeah yeah uh </connor>
<connor> it's just so much easier because you're </connor>
<connor> gonna pay with the same [ __ ] card </connor>
<connor> anyway you don't want to pay up front </connor>
<connor> yeah you don't want to [ __ ] around like </connor>
<connor> as you're leaving you're probably like </connor>
<connor> rushing to go somewhere or you know </connor>
<connor> whatever just like at booking.com more </connor>
<connor> often not just it gives you like a two </connor>
<joey> percent discount anyway yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> anyway yeah </connor>
<connor> um so you know it's so annoying anyway </connor>
<connor> so this is such a person living here </connor>
<connor> problem and even then a more Niche </connor>
<connor> problem of person living here who </connor>
<connor> travels around here a lot probably yeah </connor>
<garnt> gig of first world problem </garnt>
<garnt> have you ever like you know when uh </garnt>
<joey> whenever you're like living in Australia </joey>
<joey> or something or somewhere outside of </joey>
<joey> Japan have you ever like had an </joey>
<joey> opportunity to help a Japanese tourist </joey>
<joey> abroad that's like yeah a few times </joey>
<joey> um but I don't know it's it's weird like </joey>
<connor> unlike in Japan where there are a lot of </connor>
<connor> people who come to Japan not knowing the </connor>
<connor> language whatsoever yeah and are like </connor>
<connor> clearly struggling yeah a lot of </connor>
<connor> Japanese people who come to Australia </connor>
<joey> they're deep they're pretty decent at </joey>
<joey> English like enough where they can kind </joey>
<joey> of get around because I feel like for </joey>
<connor> English mentality yeah I should think </connor>
<joey> that you'll be accommodated right and I </joey>
<joey> think like especially with like Japanese </joey>
<joey> people because for the most part a lot </joey>
<joey> of Japanese people are like the the </joey>
<joey> common consensus is like they're very </joey>
<joey> afraid to like travel overseas because </joey>
<joey> it's like oh you know Japanese doesn't </joey>
<joey> really work yeah anywhere else outside </joey>
<joey> of Japan right so it's like I feel the </joey>
<joey> people who are actually willing to </joey>
<joey> travel outside of Japan to different </joey>
<garnt> countries are the ones that are already </garnt>
<garnt> probably interested in like learning </garnt>
<garnt> English or like learning a different </garnt>
<garnt> language anyway yeah so like I've never </garnt>
<garnt> had that thing of like I've seen a </garnt>
<garnt> clearly Japanese tourist yeah in </garnt>
<garnt> Australia struggling because it's like </garnt>
<garnt> well you probably know the bare minimum </garnt>
<joey> English to get around anyway yeah so </joey>
<garnt> it's like yeah you'll be all right just </garnt>
<garnt> got out I had a moment I was like so </garnt>
<joey> proud of it was just like it made living </joey>
<joey> here in Japan for like four years worth </joey>
<joey> it just for this like one moment just </joey>
<joey> because uh it was actually when I went </joey>
<joey> to Thailand at last time yeah and uh uh </joey>
<joey> we were at the airport we just got on </joey>
<joey> off the plane uh and uh our Sydney was </joey>
<joey> in the toilet so I was waiting for her </joey>
<joey> and I could see there there's there was </joey>
<joey> this like older Japanese couple talking </joey>
<joey> to one of the Thai staff members uh and </joey>
<joey> I I you know I just kind of like zoned </joey>
<connor> in on like their conversation and I </connor>
<connor> think they were like trying to find kind </connor>
<connor> of like the right gate to transfer over </connor>
<connor> to because they were flying to like one </connor>
<connor> of the islands or something now like you </connor>
<connor> said they could speak like a little bit </connor>
<connor> of English yeah but it wasn't great yeah </connor>
<connor> but also the person that was uh kind of </connor>
<connor> helping them obviously Thai yeah her </connor>
<connor> English wasn't great either yeah I saw </connor>
<connor> this so much it was like a different </connor>
<joey> tourist trying to speak English to a </joey>
<garnt> Japanese person who also had batting </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it was it was like a car </garnt>
<garnt> crash every time so it was just like </garnt>
<joey> confusion on both sides there was a Thai </joey>
<connor> person speaking broken English to a </connor>
<joey> broken English older Japanese couple who </joey>
<joey> couldn't also speak English trying to </joey>
<joey> best interpret that so I was just like </joey>
<joey> you know what I think this is my moment </joey>
<joey> I I think I think this is my moment and </joey>
<joey> so I come over and uh I you know I I ask </joey>
<joey> to the person I tell the person in Thai </joey>
<joey> is everything okay I can speak like a </joey>
<joey> little bit of Japanese and she explains </joey>
<joey> to me oh you know I'm trying to explain </joey>
<joey> to them the directions of the gate and </joey>
<joey> the plane that I can get to and I was </joey>
<joey> like thank God I can actually my </joey>
<joey> language skills are good enough to like </joey>
<joey> translate this and then and then so I </joey>
<joey> translate them to uh I say what she says </joey>
<joey> in Japanese and they go </joey>
<joey> it's like why do you want to yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly exactly and I was and then they </joey>
<joey> were like oh why do you speak Japanese </joey>
<joey> and I was like oh I'm I just literally </joey>
<joey> flew flew from Japan I live in Japan </joey>
<joey> right now uh I had a nice pleasant </joey>
<joey> conversation and I was like yeah you go </joey>

<garnt> all day just because that one </garnt>
<garnt> interaction I was like I was like yes </garnt>
<joey> it's so weird because like in Australia </joey>
<garnt> I've had so many instances where it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's that situation but flipped </garnt>
<joey> yeah so it's like I I could be like </joey>
<joey> walking around in you know somewhere in </joey>
<joey> Sydney like somewhere where I'm like </joey>
<joey> clearly know where I'm going maybe I'm a </joey>
<garnt> little bit lost you know maybe it's </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like a suburb I've never </garnt>
<garnt> been to yeah and I've had people who you </garnt>
<garnt> know mistake me for a different </garnt>
<joey> nationality many times right uh I </joey>
<joey> remember one time I was in I forgot </joey>
<joey> where I even was but it was a place I'd </joey>
<joey> never been to before and I was like </joey>

<connor> just speak a completely different </connor>
<joey> language yeah oh [ __ ] okay I've had that </joey>
<joey> so many times where I thought they were </joey>
<joey> Japanese and they were like Korean yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah and I'm just like oh sorry I </garnt>
<garnt> thought I've had that so many times </garnt>
<joey> where I've uh gone to a place thought </joey>
<joey> they were Thai and uh it turns out </joey>
<joey> they're Vietnamese organization I </joey>
<joey> literally when we were when we were oh </joey>
<joey> no America tool I think we were in like </joey>
<joey> New Jersey or something it was like our </joey>
<joey> day off and now you guys have got to get </joey>

<joey> because this was the first situation I'd </joey>
<joey> ever been in my life where I had not </joey>
<joey> used my first language I I had used my I </joey>
<joey> guess my second language and now my </joey>
<joey> third language and I'm just like yo is </joey>

<joey> validation yeah yeah yeah yeah have I </joey>
<joey> have I unlocked the trilingual power now </joey>
<joey> oh my God this it feels incredible yeah </joey>
<joey> but uh yeah hopefully hopefully that </joey>
<joey> that kind of like little moments like </joey>
<joey> that I'm just like oh I should I should </joey>
<garnt> study more Japanese now yeah that's like </garnt>
<garnt> reignited my passion for yeah like </garnt>
<connor> hearing stories like that makes me want </connor>
<garnt> to learn a third language but I just </garnt>
<connor> don't know what yeah this isn't it Hindi </connor>
<joey> to counteract I can't do this it's got </joey>
<joey> to be handy bro yeah I started speaking </joey>
<joey> in Hindi I'm like well funny you say </joey>
<connor> that actually uh well imagine how big </connor>
<connor> your fan base would get if you knew him </connor>
<connor> you wouldn't be huge you would quadruple </connor>
<connor> your viewership right bro it would be </connor>
<connor> game changing extra one billion fans all </connor>
<connor> right then and there dude not gonna lie </connor>
<joey> dude I'm gonna say it I'm [ __ ] sick </joey>
<joey> of getting the hunger jokes </joey>
<connor> like seven years oh just you know what I </connor>
<connor> always thought there was a part of me </connor>
<connor> that was like it's super endearing it's </connor>
<joey> you know it's very humbling you know </joey>
<joey> that I look clearly not Japanese and you </joey>
<joey> know Japanese people are like you know </joey>
<joey> it validates that oh my Japanese hasn't </joey>
<joey> fallen off a cliff you know like </joey>
<joey> considering that I don't actively study </joey>
<joey> it as much as I used to because I just </joey>
<joey> don't have as much time anymore yeah but </joey>
<joey> like it's it's gone to the point now </joey>
<joey> where like I was in Harajuku a few days </joey>
<joey> ago with Aki and we were just doing some </joey>
<joey> shopping or whatever and I think I got </joey>
<joey> every single store we stopped at </joey>
<joey> immediately </joey>
<garnt> to me and it's just like I I know </garnt>
<garnt> exactly why they're asking that yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> and like I don't blame them for it but </garnt>
<connor> it's this now you've just started this </connor>
<connor> conversation of well why are you so </connor>
<garnt> nihongo josu right yeah tell me why yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's like so so like how did </garnt>
<garnt> you study it did you you know how long </garnt>
<joey> have you lived in Japan yeah there's a </joey>
<joey> myriad of questions that it can go yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and I've just gotten so sick </joey>
<joey> of just having to do the same [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dialogue options over and over it's like </joey>
<garnt> yeah so in my mum's Japanese I lived </garnt>
<garnt> here for a while I studied NPC now yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's it's gone but now after all of the </joey>
<joey> times that I've been in hongo Jose I </joey>
<garnt> figured out the most optimal like </garnt>
<joey> conversation Ender right I just go </joey>
<connor> thanks </connor>
<connor> no more that's that's all the info </connor>
<connor> you're getting because I used to have to </connor>

<joey> yeah now if I just say that's </joey>
<joey> it they're like oh okay clearly this </joey>

<joey> invitation to kind of speak Japanese and </joey>
<joey> practice a little bit yeah I'm kind of </joey>
<joey> chill with it but obviously you don't </joey>
<joey> need it </joey>
<connor> depends if they're nice or not if </connor>
<joey> they're annoying or no no like granted </joey>
<joey> like every like especially like store </joey>

<garnt> like genuinely impressed but it's like </garnt>
<joey> now I'm just kind of like I've done my </joey>
<connor> shopping yeah I mean it's certain people </connor>
<joey> when they say it and it starts </joey>
<joey> conversation I'm like oh God yeah </joey>
<connor> like mainly taxi drivers taxi drivers </connor>

<joey> there either like like really talkative </joey>
<connor> really talkative or just completely </connor>
<joey> silent yeah you cannot get a word out of </joey>
<joey> them I don't know maybe I'm just like </joey>
<joey> getting really lucky or I don't catch a </joey>
<joey> Taxis as often as you guys but like I </joey>
<joey> always get the taxi drivers that are </joey>
<joey> just two word answers I got in the cab </joey>
<joey> today with my parents you know it's </joey>
<joey> always awkward because you know I if </joey>
<joey> when there's like four of you and you </joey>
<joey> know some of the taxi drivers they don't </joey>
<joey> want people to sit in the front it's </joey>
<joey> just like a preference thing but it's </joey>
<joey> like hey there's four of us we gotta sit </joey>

<connor> then afterwards in English he was just </connor>
<connor> like oh you're Japanese very good I love </connor>
<connor> that and then and then and then he was </connor>
<joey> like where are you from and I was like </joey>
<joey> okay if I say yeah if I say Japan things </joey>
<connor> are just gonna get complicated so I was </connor>
<connor> like I'm from Australia in the most </connor>
<connor> Australian accent possible and he </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] goes and you know when </connor>
<connor> foreigners think of Australia right lots </connor>
<connor> of different things kangaroo boomerangs </connor>

<joey> [ __ ] a Japanese person can feel this </joey>
<joey> dude legit goes ah woman basketball </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> it's not the first thing I think of when </joey>
<connor> I think of Australia's running through </connor>
<joey> my mind yeah I did not think it was good </joey>
<joey> I was throwing it back being like are we </joey>
<garnt> yeah I guess we're known for women's </garnt>
<garnt> basketball yeah and I was like yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> woman's basketball all right yeah </joey>
<garnt> I did not see that coming the old man in </garnt>
<joey> this Taxi </joey>

<connor> but dude this man was we got a stoplight </connor>
<connor> red lights not even kidding yeah man </connor>
<connor> pulled out the full newspaper at the </connor>
<connor> stoplight started reading the newspaper </connor>
<connor> God damn the whole windshield reading </connor>
<joey> the newspaper I was like oh you're gonna </joey>
<joey> help hold it you're like you're good </joey>
<joey> like what do you see the lights what are </joey>
<connor> you doing </connor>
<connor> the lights had changed four minutes ago </connor>
<connor> and we haven't moved sir genuinely he </connor>
<garnt> just whipped it out I couldn't believe </garnt>
<garnt> it I've noticed taxi drivers in Japan by </garnt>
<garnt> the way </garnt>
<connor> I would not have any Tokyo no I don't </connor>
<garnt> know because I I a lot of taxi drivers </garnt>
<garnt> I've like been with they've they've </garnt>
<garnt> always had okay they always have of the </garnt>
<garnt> clipboards right do you know what I'm </garnt>
<connor> talking about oh yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because okay I figured it out okay what </connor>
<garnt> is that well I think they keep track of </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone that's got in their taxi </garnt>
<connor> or something even though the meter </connor>
<garnt> already does this yeah yeah I think it's </garnt>
<garnt> like they I'm not sure what they're </garnt>
<garnt> clocking but a lot of the taxi drivers </garnt>
<joey> if not all of them they you know even </joey>
<joey> though you're doing you get paid this </joey>
<joey> amount for the journey all of them are </joey>
<joey> like employed right by a company most of </joey>
<joey> them I think I'm again I'm not 100 sure </joey>
<joey> a lot of them are and so that that's not </joey>
<joey> their pay what you're paying now yeah </joey>
<joey> they're your salary so I think they're </joey>
<garnt> like keeping track of something keeping </garnt>
<garnt> track of something I don't know yeah I </garnt>
<joey> always thought they were like racially </joey>
<garnt> profiles </garnt>
<joey> secret police every time she's a secret </joey>
<garnt> police officer just tracking your </garnt>
<garnt> movements </garnt>
<joey> in case the police come being like did </joey>
<garnt> you see a white male in his 30s getting </garnt>
<garnt> your taxis </garnt>
<garnt> no because what always confused me is </garnt>
<joey> that I I assume they would keep in track </joey>
<joey> of like the fair or something but they </joey>
<joey> never ever do it off after you finish </joey>
<joey> your journey it's always always it's </joey>
<joey> always mid light sometimes the lives go </joey>
<joey> and they're still [ __ ] writing and </joey>
<joey> their hands are off the uh steering wall </joey>
<garnt> and they just [ __ ] go they're like no </garnt>
<garnt> I need to finish this racial profile I'm </garnt>
<joey> gonna sit next time and start writing </joey>
<connor> stuff too I'm anxious and then I close </connor>
<joey> the book to death now </joey>
<joey> if you're sitting in the front seat just </joey>
<garnt> grab just stop playing Tic-Tac-Toe yeah </garnt>
<garnt> your move </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but no like uh like I guess it was </garnt>
<garnt> like the hunger josu is kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> most of the time just like conversation </garnt>
<garnt> starter do Japanese people find it as </garnt>
<garnt> endearing when we just start speaking I </garnt>
<connor> always do I always win Eagle jewels to </connor>
<garnt> do them as well yeah oh really yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> oh and I've said I do now I've started </connor>
<connor> doing it everywhere yeah do Japanese </connor>
<garnt> people find it as endearing when we </garnt>
<joey> speak broken ass Japanese be like ah I </joey>
<joey> think so bearded ah oh dude Japanese </joey>
<garnt> people </garnt>
<connor> they love that [ __ ] even if they don't </connor>
<connor> it's like I think they just prefer it </connor>
<joey> right like yeah yeah I think I think in </joey>
<joey> in a lot of minds of Japanese people </joey>
<joey> like stereotypically I guess like yeah I </joey>
<joey> think the the general consensus is oh </joey>
<joey> you're going to the effort to try and </joey>
<joey> speak to me in the local language and I </joey>
<joey> think that in and of itself is worth I </joey>
<joey> guess like the praise or the respect </joey>
<joey> right because you know it's so easy to </joey>
<joey> just be like yeah you know what this </joey>
<connor> weird Japanese language I'm not gonna </connor>
<connor> learn it my natural language is better </connor>
<connor> just deal with it kind of thing right </connor>
<joey> but it's like I think it's the idea of </joey>
<joey> like oh you know I can only speak </joey>
<joey> Japanese yeah and you're participating </joey>
<joey> in speaking Japanese no matter how </joey>
<joey> broken it is hey you know what new </joey>
<joey> Hunger [ __ ] Josie dog let's go </joey>
<connor> because I think because there's a lot of </connor>
<connor> people online are always like man it's </connor>
<connor> so disrespectful to go to a country and </connor>
<connor> and not know any of the language it's </connor>
<connor> like well I mean a lot of Japanese </connor>
<connor> people don't expect you to no that's </connor>
<connor> like whether you should or shouldn't it </connor>
<connor> doesn't really matter it's the </connor>
<joey> expectations that I think a lot of Asian </joey>
<garnt> countries are like okay okay well here's </garnt>
<garnt> the thing when you go to like uh when </garnt>
<garnt> you when you travel around how much </garnt>
<garnt> research do you do you do to a place </garnt>
<connor> before you like travel there I mean </connor>
<connor> research is in like in in the language </connor>
<connor> in anything you know </connor>
<connor> um like very little you know </connor>
<joey> language-wise I'll probably learn how to </joey>
<connor> order that's and then yeah yeah I don't </connor>
<joey> because I normally you know I'll maybe </joey>
<connor> learn like basic readings like Hello </connor>
<connor> thank you yeah yeah stuff like that but </connor>
<joey> yeah I'm not gonna learn like Just </joey>
<connor> Enough full sentence hopefully not be a </connor>
<joey> nuisance yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> um but then obviously when you check </joey>
<connor> into hotels and stuff you'd like okay </connor>
<connor> please have hopefully please have </connor>
<garnt> English yeah yeah because because I I </garnt>
<garnt> had this when I went to Vietnam because </garnt>
<garnt> it's been like quite a while since I had </garnt>
<garnt> just traveled to a new country that I </garnt>
<joey> had just never been to before and it was </joey>
<joey> just like a quick weekend trip so I </joey>
<joey> didn't actually do that much research uh </joey>
<joey> after I uh after I got off the plane and </joey>
<joey> I was like oh [ __ ] uh do they is is </joey>
<joey> English as common here as it is in </joey>
<joey> Thailand [ __ ] I don't actually know I </joey>
<joey> didn't I didn't bother learning any </joey>
<garnt> Vietnamese phrases because I'm just here </garnt>
<garnt> for the weekend [ __ ] uh so like it's it </garnt>
<garnt> was just like that kind of realization </garnt>
<garnt> of just oh I'm that dumb tourist now </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> I I am actually that dumb tourist now </garnt>
<garnt> right it's it's a feeling that I I guess </garnt>
<garnt> like I've forgotten for a while because </garnt>
<garnt> most of the time when I travel it's like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] America or like other </garnt>
<joey> English-speaking countries you know so I </joey>
<joey> think like the the mentality I go into </joey>
<joey> it is like say like you know a couple of </joey>
<joey> months ago I went to Korea for the first </joey>
<joey> time right where it's like you know mo </joey>
<joey> in Korea most people can speak English </joey>
<garnt> yeah at least did you know that </garnt>
<joey> beforehand though or uh I had heard </joey>
<garnt> about it okay but you know they say that </garnt>
<joey> about a lot of countries yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> true right so you know I went in there </joey>
<joey> ex you know being like all right well </joey>
<joey> you know what I'm probably not gonna </joey>
<joey> bother like you know learning </joey>
<joey> you know a lot of like extensive phrases </joey>
<joey> or anything in Korean but I'll just </joey>
<joey> learn the basics and then when I get </joey>
<joey> there I'll try and learn as much of it </joey>
<joey> as I can like I'm much rather in the in </joey>
<joey> in this head space of like it's better </joey>
<joey> to even to be that dumb tourist at least </joey>
<joey> to show that you want to kind of learn </joey>
<joey> the language and I think that is just as </joey>
<joey> uh appreciated by the locals then you </joey>
<joey> already knowing it right so like there </joey>
<joey> were so many times where if I knew that </joey>
<joey> like you know the I'd go to a random </joey>
<joey> food stall in in Seoul and the guy would </joey>
<joey> be speaking to me in English I would </joey>
<joey> just be like how do you say this in </joey>
<joey> Korean yeah and the guy was very happy </joey>
<connor> to like teach me how to say it and you </connor>
<connor> know when I would reflect back on it </connor>
<connor> he'd be like yeah there you go you got </connor>
<joey> it yeah so I think like just showing no </joey>
<joey> matter what you know the you know no </joey>
<connor> matter how it is just showing that you </connor>
<connor> are interested in it I think is what </connor>
<joey> will get the locals to be like all right </joey>
<connor> cool you know what I respect that and I </connor>
<joey> think the only reason why that doesn't </joey>
<joey> work as much in in Japan as it does in </joey>
<garnt> say Korea is because a lot of Japanese </garnt>
<joey> people are a little bit afraid of </joey>
<garnt> reserved and reserved to talk to </garnt>
<garnt> foreigners and tourists whereas in Korea </garnt>
<connor> they're a lot more open about it yeah </connor>
<garnt> being like yeah you know you're you're a </garnt>
<garnt> tourist yeah I see Taurus all the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] time well you know I'll teach </joey>
<garnt> you some words yeah yeah did you find </garnt>
<garnt> out like when you went on your Euro trip </garnt>
<garnt> like this is like pre-pandemic did you </garnt>
<garnt> because you went to like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> different countries yeah you know like a </garnt>
<garnt> very very short period of time but I </garnt>
<joey> guess you had like a guide right well </joey>
<joey> yeah we went to like six or yeah six </joey>
<joey> different European countries all for the </joey>
<connor> first time but yeah we because it was me </connor>
<connor> and Aki's first time in Europe so we </connor>
<connor> were like I'd rather go to a country </connor>
<connor> where I have like a friend living there </connor>
<connor> like like show me around so like I had </connor>
<connor> my local friend with me there but also </connor>
<connor> you know I did the same thing where like </connor>
<connor> whenever I would be served something </connor>
<connor> yeah I would ask the store clerk or </connor>
<joey> whatever to be like how do you say this </joey>
<joey> in French or Italian or you know what </joey>
<joey> whatever country I'm in and I think for </joey>
<joey> the most part it they seem to appreciate </joey>
<garnt> it right yeah yeah I guess yeah being do </garnt>
<joey> I remember any of them no you remember </joey>
<joey> for that one trip sometimes sometimes </joey>
<garnt> you just fly somewhere you're like maybe </garnt>
<garnt> I'll just you quickly Google so when I </garnt>
<joey> was in Finland I learned so much [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> finish I couldn't tell you a single </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] finish phrase right now is when </connor>
<joey> you're a tourist it's like as long as </joey>
<connor> you're not being a dick yeah yeah it </connor>
<joey> doesn't really matter I think I think </joey>
<joey> there's nothing wrong with being the </joey>
<garnt> dumb tourist I think the problem lies in </garnt>
<garnt> being the Arrogant done tourist of like </garnt>
<garnt> you're not open-minded enough to like </garnt>
<garnt> involve yourself in the culture that's </garnt>
<joey> when you kind of get the stink eye but </joey>
<joey> if if you're like you can be the dumb </joey>
<joey> tourist just be like the Curious dumb </joey>
<connor> Taurus I think it's just looking up </connor>
<connor> maybe like what the general kind of </connor>
<connor> etiquette is on certain places before </connor>
<connor> you turn up is probably just yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> you can watch a [ __ ] top 10 list of </garnt>
<garnt> things to do and don't do yeah like you </garnt>
<joey> know in Japan and every other country on </joey>
<garnt> Earth probably but yeah it just tells </garnt>
<joey> you hey this is this is a cool thing to </joey>
<connor> do this is definitely not cool thing to </connor>
<connor> do like I think that's just you know </connor>
<joey> that helps yeah I look into that for </joey>
<connor> sure because the last thing I want to do </connor>
<joey> is be the dumb tourist that also offends </joey>
<connor> the country I mean you know yeah I think </connor>
<joey> as long as you're you know polite I </joey>
<joey> think yeah whatever yeah yeah I mean you </joey>
<connor> know we dunk on tourists yeah we're done </connor>
<garnt> for tourists a lot even though we a lot </garnt>
<connor> of times we are tourists yeah yeah it's </connor>
<connor> uh you know ultimately there's nothing </connor>
<joey> wrong with being a tourist of course </joey>
<joey> yeah because you [ __ ] have to be yeah </joey>
<joey> um everyone's a tourist yeah but you </joey>
<connor> know I think it's just hey if you're </connor>
<garnt> chill who cares okay as an Australian </garnt>
<garnt> right so in England I don't know if this </garnt>
<garnt> is just uh I don't know if this is just </garnt>
<joey> like a British thing but one thing I've </joey>
<joey> noticed is you know as a Brit every time </joey>
<joey> I see like a broad like making a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> fool of themselves which I've seen </joey>
<joey> terrible so many times I'm like </joey>
<joey> England's got the worst tourist in the </joey>
<joey> world and then I was like I was talking </joey>
<joey> to Sydney and she's like no Americans </joey>
<joey> are the worst tourists in the world and </joey>
<joey> then I you know I one time I like met a </joey>
<joey> french guy and he thinks they're the </joey>
<joey> worst stories in the world as an </joey>
<joey> Australian do you think you are like the </joey>
<joey> worst tourist in the world yeah </joey>
<joey> because it's like it depends on the </joey>
<joey> location with Australians right because </joey>
<joey> I think Australians in like say Tokyo or </joey>
<joey> Osaka uh for the most part pretty all </joey>
<joey> right yeah but say Australian tourists </joey>
<joey> at ski resorts </joey>
<joey> yeah like you know I worked with them </joey>
<connor> and I can 100 say they're the worst </connor>
<connor> because like it's it's I think it's like </connor>
<connor> Australian I think a lot of Australian </connor>
<connor> tourists because you know for the most </connor>
<joey> part we're very very Multicultural </joey>
<joey> country so we're just living in </joey>
<joey> Australia unless you're living in like </joey>
<joey> the butt [ __ ] middle of nowhere you're </joey>
<joey> most likely going to run into different </joey>
<joey> cultures right whether you like it or </joey>
<joey> not so I think for the most part </joey>
<garnt> Australians who live in cities are </garnt>
<garnt> naturally inclined to understand that </garnt>
<garnt> there are cultural differences wherever </garnt>
<garnt> you go right not just language </garnt>
<garnt> differences but I don't know what it is </garnt>
<garnt> about the the atmosphere of a ski resort </garnt>
<joey> in Japan that just makes Australians go </joey>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] the culture I'm here to rip </joey>
<joey> the Snow Dogs </joey>
<connor> yeah kind of like hotels are kind of </connor>
<connor> like a dorm in a way yeah yeah it feels </connor>
<joey> like you know a lot of these like ski </joey>
<joey> lodges they do kind of like uh have more </joey>
<joey> of like a western feel of like just come </joey>
<joey> in it's casual you know hang out with </joey>
<joey> the people in the lounge area oh they're </joey>
<joey> all Australians as well you guys will </joey>
<joey> get along fine go you know rip it in the </joey>
<joey> snow whatever yeah yeah but then they </joey>
<joey> take that energy to the nearby Village </joey>
<joey> yeah and the nearby cities and it's just </joey>
<joey> like I because I remember when I worked </joey>
<joey> in hakuba I would you know frequently go </joey>
<joey> into uh like Nagano and like nigata to </joey>
<joey> do some work and you'll see those exact </joey>
<connor> same like ski bro Australians in these </connor>
<joey> cities yeah oh wow </joey>
<joey> because the the two main ski resorts and </joey>
<joey> you'd go into the cities and you would </joey>
<joey> see the the ski Bros there and they're </joey>
<joey> just some of the most loudest most </joey>
<joey> obnoxious tourists I've ever met I'm </joey>
<joey> just like bro we're not in the ski </joey>
<joey> lodges anymore we're in a city with </joey>
<joey> hundreds of terrified Japanese people </joey>
<joey> calm down keep it in the launch yeah I </joey>
<garnt> mean I I guess I just noticed as well </garnt>
<garnt> normally when when I make when I meet </garnt>
<joey> like British people in Japan they can </joey>
<joey> come into Japan most of them all are </joey>
<joey> pretty chill right all of them shelves </joey>
<joey> for some reason I I I I every time I see </joey>
<connor> uh especially English tourists </connor>
<connor> especially in like southeast Asia in </connor>
<connor> Thailand I I'm I saw it as a reputation </connor>
<connor> oh I saw so many in when I went to </connor>
<joey> Vietnam and every time I heard the </joey>
<connor> English accent I'm like I do not know </connor>
<garnt> this I I am I am not my man I am Thai </garnt>
<connor> for the rest of this trip actually that </connor>
<connor> poor taxi driver who thought English </connor>
<joey> people were Gentlemans </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah I mean I think there's certain </connor>
<joey> destinations that yeah let's say uh more </joey>
<garnt> bang for your bark money yeah I think </garnt>
<joey> attract a certain type of British </joey>
<connor> tourist yeah and probably other European </connor>
<joey> tourists too but mainly British ones </joey>
<joey> there like like what's like the main </joey>
<joey> like I guess party country or Party </joey>
<garnt> location for like Bruce it's like Ibiza </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of like the Spanish Islands some </garnt>
<garnt> of the Greek Islands because in </garnt>
<joey> Australia that's Bali so when you go to </joey>
<garnt> I've personally never been to Bali </garnt>
<garnt> before but I've heard stories of just </garnt>
<garnt> like the most obnoxious Australians in </garnt>
<joey> Bali just like [ __ ] trying to make it </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> an extremely cheap transport </connor>
<joey> a cheap accommodation and with like the </joey>
<joey> party atmosphere yeah extremely cheap </joey>
<garnt> alcohol yeah yeah it's just like I guess </garnt>
<connor> like Vietnam and Thailand that are </connor>
<garnt> pretty cheap yeah and drinking oh I saw </garnt>
<garnt> I saw so many people from Essex in </garnt>
<garnt> Vietnam </garnt>
<joey> there was this one girl who was uh </joey>
<joey> clearly from Essex </joey>
<joey> um like having having an argument with </joey>
<joey> like one of like the Vietnamese </joey>
<joey> bartenders like over like the price of </joey>
<joey> this beer or something which the price </joey>
<joey> of this beer was about one dollar and </joey>
<joey> she was like no no no like I I got two </joey>
<joey> for one two for one and she was like </joey>
<joey> shouting at this waiter and then I I I </joey>
<joey> don't know I was like standing up like </joey>
<joey> five minutes and the waiter just comes </joey>
<joey> up to me and just goes I [ __ ] hate </joey>

<garnt> American tourists The Stereotype is that </garnt>
<garnt> American tourists are the loudest </garnt>
<garnt> tourists yeah and I don't know if that's </garnt>
<garnt> necessarily true but for some reason </garnt>
<garnt> America like every time I see an </garnt>
<garnt> American Tourist abroad whatever country </garnt>
<garnt> it's in for some reason they always have </garnt>
<garnt> the most recognizable voice in any </garnt>
<connor> establishment have you noticed this I </connor>
<garnt> don't know why every American I've seen </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan has been super polite yeah no </garnt>
<connor> they have yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's very easy to hear them out yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah for some reason it could be like </garnt>
<garnt> the loudest like bar you've ever been to </garnt>
<garnt> and you'll just hear that one American </garnt>
<garnt> accent that will pierce through </garnt>
<joey> everything being said this cocktail's </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] delicious </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's because like we </connor>
<connor> just consume so much American Media yeah </connor>
<connor> but it's an instantly recognizable kind </connor>
<connor> of </connor>
<connor> we hear so much American accents that </connor>
<joey> when we hear in real life we're like oh </joey>
<connor> I can immediately hear that yeah I don't </connor>
<joey> know I I can't put my hand on do you </joey>
<joey> have that like level of I don't know if </joey>
<joey> you guys have it for like for British </joey>
<joey> tourists but like do you have that like </joey>
<joey> split moment where you hear that British </joey>
<joey> accent you just like like </joey>
<garnt> kinfolks I have that with Australia yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah most definitely most definitely </joey>
<joey> except if it's in Southeast Asian in </joey>
<connor> which case it's probably I should avoid </connor>
<joey> them they hate my man's I'm tired for </joey>
<connor> the day I only speak Thai you don't see </connor>
<connor> a lot of British people in Japan though </connor>
