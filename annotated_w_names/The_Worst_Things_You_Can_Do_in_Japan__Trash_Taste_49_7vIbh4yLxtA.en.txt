<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's oh we do okay we used to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we used it once and it's just this huge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brick of a thing that's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting in the kitchen i'm like okay why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is this here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's always that one draw in every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kitchen right that is just the unused </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appliance drawer right where it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these appliances that people give you as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gifts or that you think is going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool when you host like that dinner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> party that never happens and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's just these like random </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appliances that just get put into this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drawer and you forget you even have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we have like forks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> use my hands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah well i i uh i got um this kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cleaning service thing because okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one thing okay we're immediately going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go on to this is one thing i hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about japan throwing away trash right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay and especially the big trash yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because like in australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just pick myself but um because like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know about in the uk but in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia we have like this thing i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it happens once every two or three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> months uh it's called like council clean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up day so basically what we do is we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take huge appliances like couches beds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know drawers all that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and we literally just throw it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of the street like just onto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the street </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and basically it's you know you throw it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um people can kind of walk around and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just you know grab stuff if they want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if they think oh you know i can i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think two to three months it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every two to three months or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never seen this really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in australia yeah it happens i i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if maybe that's just like the area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah in the uk in the uk i don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's enough space to just throw oh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> think japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we just throw stuff out and then big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> garbage truck basically comes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> collects all the stuff that doesn't get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> picked up after like a week i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right um japan doesn't work like that so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we had to throw away our bed which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like a queen size bed yeah uh a couch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like a couple of tables and like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sofa and stuff like that a lot of big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff but like you can't just throw it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out with the rest of the trash you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to either you have to go to your like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> local council and be like i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> throw this stuff away and they give you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these like tickets that you have to pay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for yeah to basically be like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm throwing this out on this day and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you throw it out onto this you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to book it and tell them you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> book it i need to tell the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> measurements of the thing so yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plan out or what i found out is you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just there's just services out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can just call up and be like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to throw all this crap away how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much is it to get rid of yeah yeah a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little more expensive than like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whole council thing but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so much easier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it's it's not a price for me it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like we talked about last week it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just getting the paperwork done yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that like [ __ ] i'm scared of yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly and like i'm not even finished </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with the [ __ ] paperwork too because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to do more after we move yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because japan is just like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> never-ending sea of paperwork </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like i was like okay i'm getting rid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of this giant bed i'm getting rid of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this couch this table all these like big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appliances yeah and i'm like okay well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> these are the big things gone so you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 30 of my belongings probably gone it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> more like three percent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like in like your bedroom or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> office there's so many little things you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just never think about especially my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> office yeah and my office is so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little things i'm just like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm well first of all i'm looking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forward to like the moving company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming in and seeing like all of like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] skateboards and [ __ ] like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just being like whoa they'll be like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that is that a rem eight one eighth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scale </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giving them a tour of your house you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah so this is this is the joker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a free office store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually to be fair when the moving guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first came in to like check to see what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we had he walked into my office and he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whoa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> otaku's dream he's like wow jesus this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> guy's gonna [ __ ] collect like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> opposite happen where like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i i only use my tatami room to filming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i only use it so i have a big tatami </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> room that i normally do the cosplay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos in yeah yeah pretty bad so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never clean them up after i just leave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the cosplays there until i do the next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video and then i clean it up uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then one time they didn't tell me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they were doing this but there was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh they were checking like the fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alarms in the building right and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah sure come in come in and he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going around my house he goes into my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> office you know he looks he's like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like yeah i like jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he just looked at me like i was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird and i was like all right thanks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buddy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then and then as he went to like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tatami room i was like oh [ __ ] i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remembered that all my [ __ ] was in there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so like i i go in to check that he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there and this man is just standing in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the middle of like my cosplay everywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this this stuff reached holding up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something to the fire alarm just looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like look down don't look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't look at anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then after this guy left really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> awkwardly an hour later someone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> came along from the same company in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> building and did the exact same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah and i was like wait why am i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being checked twice oh he's like a spot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man i don't know i was really just gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make sure my friend got it right you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know he's like yo i heard this free </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cosplay wasn't that okay and then i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact same interaction again where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like oh yeah sorry about the mess in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this room by the way i like jojo by the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> way i also like jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] weirdo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but luckily like we yeah like as i said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm pretty sure i mentioned in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> previous podcast episode we gotta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> service that where they just do all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> packing yeah yeah my god i cannot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine if i had to do that all myself i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of realized what i'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to go through when we move um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because my room's gonna be fine um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but then i got sydney's room yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which the amount of [ __ ] [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] in sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so be careful that's the [ __ ] of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> round </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that looks expensive so i remember i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember this one time we we had to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like our doorbell fix right so we we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought we thought our house was pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clean basically whenever someone needs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to come in to check our house at all we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just make sure like sydney's room is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] locked off it's it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a quarantine section you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you put the [ __ ] biohazard sign on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the door just to make sure no one gets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in right but radioactive yeah yeah so so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how we learned our lesson was we had our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> door we had our doorbell fixed and of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> course sydney's room was like cordoned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off but we forget that sometimes sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just has [ __ ] lying about the house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and i guess we've just become so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> desensitized to some of the stuff she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reviews my my fiance reviews a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lewd stuff that's that's that's her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> channel so we just had like a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> figures that were just left in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living room with just like their tits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> out right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> living room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so so this guy this guy just comes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and um the the doorbell's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right next to the kitchen and also we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a shelf right next to the kitchen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which just has two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lewd completely naked figures just right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next to where the doorbell is he takes a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look at looks at the figures looks at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sydney and just doesn't make eye contact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with sydney ever again is it he's got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like hentai here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like he's covering his eyes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sweating </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hour he had to like enjoy his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life when he was just finished i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how he immediately looked at sydney like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> the case is good now and then and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they go back up again when they let go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of restrictions and then this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happening like the wall the fourth time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> now yeah so we're just doing the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] over and over again but this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lockdown is the shortest ever it's only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two weeks or something yeah i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like what's gonna change in two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> weeks i think they literally just wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like oh golden week's happening uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> let's let's let's have it not happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> meanwhile i'll explain everybody to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the viewers who don't know yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> golden week is this week uh during the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first week of may uh we're as we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recording this we're in the middle of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now where it's basically just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bunch of public holidays back to back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back to back-to-back so i think yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically people just get a week off do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know how i remember golden week it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was the one week of the year aside from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like new year's where manga mangakaz </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would take a break from that weekend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm just like oh one piece is on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> break what the [ __ ] golden week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thank god finally everything's on fire i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't get one piece this week that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only reason i knew of golden week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before moving to japan yeah exactly well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because like i think you know japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> needs golden week because yeah japan's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the few countries that works on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like christmas is just like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think everywhere else christmas is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a public holiday or at least like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australia yeah well yeah like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australia like you know it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> second half of december until maybe the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first week of january like three weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just full on holiday christmas here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just valentine's day 2.0 yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> basically it is it really is [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but they were just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't have a cup i don't have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> partner finna work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's either you're on a date or you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> working on something yeah exactly so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess like you know to japan they need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> golden week because it's the one time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they're almost forced to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take the week off yeah because otherwise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they get i mean you know people still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are just like no [ __ ] it it's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> working week for me but yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my whole favorite thing of uh all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese governments lockdowns is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during the whole pandemic the government </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought of this amazing idea called go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to travel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she's just like oh yeah this is just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> funniest this is the funniest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing so japanese government they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> losing a lot of money obviously from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tourism that they wouldn't they weren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting so in the middle of like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pandemic this is like months ago it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> before this is last year it was during </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first lockdown wasn't it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like guys we're losing too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much money in our travel economy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we put some money back into it what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna do is guys we're gonna give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you 30 off everything and we're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pay you money to go travel we'll give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you 200 bucks to spend depending on how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> much you spend and uh yeah you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coupons at your yeah yeah yeah so yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like oh yes so like it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lockdown but also if you travel thirty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> percent discount </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey there's some money to spend go treat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself king but don't leave the house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> though but don't leave like yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> then like they realized it was like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> colossal mistake like a month later when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the cases went up i [ __ ] up because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's of course everyone's gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> travel exactly you're paying me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> travel and you don't want me to travel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you went to like a five-star </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hotel that's like a thousand bucks it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would go down to like 600 and then you'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be given like 300 bucks to spend and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like who isn't gonna do that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have disposable income it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone is gonna do that it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dangling a carrot in front of a horse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and telling the horse not to run he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like don't don't i'm finna try to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> responsible yeah japanese governor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making me act up you know what i mean i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i want you know i was like well [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> going hokkaido and of course everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone abused the [ __ ] out of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> system right everyone went traveling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because it was like why wouldn't i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i went to like four different places so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like i'm obviously not because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally everybody is going right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's like what's the point what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point of not going it was the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> confusing period ever because they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like don't travel but please travel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please please travel we need it for you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then and then they shut it down like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> after like a month yeah yeah of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it was a colossal mistake yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean if i went to hokkaido because i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i didn't interact with anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was because it was because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys kept talking about hokkaido and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like okay i think it's my time to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hokkaido as well waited for lockdown to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end and i'm just like damn this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they they weren't joking around [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hokkaido exactly exactly in the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of [ __ ] nowhere no one's there it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like great yeah it's peaceful it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fantastic it was just the dumbest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever because if they just kept like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is the whole thing that the japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> governments are doing where they just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of haven't really committed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything yeah they haven't really told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you not to do anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i very wish you were i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing every every restriction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they've given it seems very half-assed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like from my perspective no it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not it's not been like we've never been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fully open but we've also never been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fully closed either like they've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said you can't travel around they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're the worst thing or if anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they reward you for it yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then no and then they they also said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh yeah you know restaurants please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> close at eight you know like suddenly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason people are just you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> magically stop getting infected before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean this new lockdown there were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurants can't serve alcohol anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah and i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so i'm still allowed to go to the right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but i just can't drink beer like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's generous to even call it like half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> measures it's like you know like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> quarter of measures yeah is what they do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i don't really care about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole politics at all but i wish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they would just decide what they wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well that's the problem isn't it is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like unlike a lot of countries the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese japanese law </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they can't force establishments to close </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down yeah like a lot of other countries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so they're like they're like okay so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we can't force you to close down but we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we we advise you to not serve alcohol to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not to close after eight but there's but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's also like from what i heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a penalty for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> establishments that don't follow those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> rules but if you get you've got to find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] ton of money yeah the restaurants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that make so much money well that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing i would just pay the bills the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> penalty is so low that there are a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of restaurants out there especially in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in a tokyo that are just like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> paid for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of like the biggest restaurants i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think just pay the fine yeah they pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the finances they make more off of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> money that they yeah yeah yeah and also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like the biggest that was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not even the fine it was like we'll put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you on a list of companies that stayed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> open and obviously just a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese people that's like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty like [ __ ] we've got [ __ ] we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be on the list yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then for some of them they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll [ __ ] give a [ __ ] about it it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like getting on the naughty list on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> santa right yeah yeah yeah it's like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no that's so so dumb yeah so dumb that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing it would have this would have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> been at least australia and new zealand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like totally locked down yeah like new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> zealand were like nah yeah yeah in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia no one could do anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia locked down for like nine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> months yeah yeah and like people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't go outside for more than an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hour a day and like yeah all restaurants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were closed all that kind of stuff and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah and then when in sydney at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> least we got one case and the entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> city went into lockdown for like a month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meanwhile japan is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a thousand cases don't drink at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like cool thanks yeah but i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it'll be interesting to see what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happens in this next year because every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> every other country seems to be getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their vaccines and we are still like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're probably not going to be able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get our vaccines this year if we stay in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan it's right looking more and more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> likely but i mean you know there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i know of a few of my american friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are here who are just probably just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to like bite the bullet and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> go back to america this sometime this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> year to just go get the whole thing yeah </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> i'm sorry i crave it i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a more depressing sight than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just beans and toast by itself i'm sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a separate other brand tastes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good as a brit like seeing the sight of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like beans on toast as like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] breakfast dinner whatever that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fantastic see i feel that way but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two or three times a year i just wake up </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> fantastic make me fall like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] but who cares still good </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> like you're being cleansed </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> american friends have you know a choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to do that right yeah go back it's you </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> australia apparently made it illegal to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> return if you're from india right if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're yeah oh really i think a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> legal like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> well that's the problem right is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like i can't do the same for australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we're in no rush to get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vaccine because no one's had covert for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the past four months yeah so like not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even my grandma who's like 92 this year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> has gotten it yet yeah it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> late maybe like you got you guys are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isolated as [ __ ] it's hard enough to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in your country as it is exactly yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean it makes sense right but like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know that's why australia's done so well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and same with new zealand but that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what like the whole world goes through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the [ __ ] apocalypse australia is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gonna be australian new zealand are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be like two remaining countries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly right nothing goes in nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes out man seeing the whole like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the whole joe rogan controversy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about all the like vaccines and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's it's so frustrating that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally been the only thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone can talk about for the past like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> year and a half is covered in all this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] yeah but it's also like saying that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't talk about because everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] turned it into a political thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah where it's just like i just i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> want to eat baked beans i just don't </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> it's become like a thing like that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even now talking about it i feel like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> passionate yeah i i feel like people in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> britain weren't taking like the pandemic </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] of the world </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> school or work whatever whatever what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a political agenda </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> to be the us of the uk with how they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going yeah i might assume whether they </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> yeah when they shoot is a different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> question but i mean from what i've heard </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> this thing called like the omni charge i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't remember the full name but that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was it looked like a [ __ ] battle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> station i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but like it was way bigger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than any of the portable chargers i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ever seen and also like what sold me was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it had its own plug so you can plug </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like so you can you can plus the adapter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes you can plug an actual like power </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adapter to it right so i was like i want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like that for a camping trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so i said oh what's this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called so he calls he says it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> omnicharger so i google it on amazon and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately they're not selling on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazon anymore so i go to like the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> link that's recommended for like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> search </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the thing about amazon is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you see a charger right there's nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like quantify how how big this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> charger is right just from the image </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah that's not with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dimensions but i mean you might not look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at them yeah sometimes it's like buried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a wall of like text yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> buried in a wall of text so i just see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this block right and i'm just like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> probably around the same i mean it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> recommended from me searching the omni </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> charger so he's probably about the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> size right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's probably around the same size </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like thinking back like being like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> electronic an electrical ex-electronic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and electrical engineer we've got a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> masters i should have seen like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of like charge it holds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i didn't look about the amount of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> charge it holds i just i just i was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like on like um [ __ ] autopilot mode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like yeah that looks good buy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that okay so wait a few days from all my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> camping equipment that i bought um and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this [ __ ] massive package like um i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wish you brought it with you today </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> don't it everything's like boxed up so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know what everything is so the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first thing i pick up it's [ __ ] heavy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's this [ __ ] brick and my first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought was oh no have i bought like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sleeping bag that's just like 10 times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> heavier than i needed it you're right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so i start unboxing it and i see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this [ __ ] brick just in my hands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm just like what the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what i've i don't remember buying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything this heavy yeah turn it around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's the [ __ ] charger and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like no wait this must be how big is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this must be a mistake um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so joey joey has a photo it's on screen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now the photo of this brick that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got i turn it around i look at like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> appliances that i can power and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like okay so this can power phones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it can you know charge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tablets and then it says you can charge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laptops it can power a [ __ ] mini </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm just like you can power a mini </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fridge a microwave and i'm just like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] what the [ __ ] have i bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this this thing he bought it literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is like oh i found it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so this is like a [ __ ] brick that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bought two routers strapped together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and i'm just like what the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] mac mini </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know what i'm gonna be able to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do with this because like i can't take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that on a plane because like if i take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it on a plane the tsa probably thinks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm gonna bomb the [ __ ] plane get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] arrested like i'm probably gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> be on the [ __ ] isis list if i take us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from a plane jesus christ so i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even so i'm just thinking to myself all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've made guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've made a mistake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's okay because at least i can use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it on this camping trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like i like this massive [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brick in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suitcase or in my bag sorry which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> probably like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like by itself the heaviest single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> object in my bag for a camping trip yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and so we get to this campsite and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know we get we get a lot and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start unpacking everything and i see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this metal box right i see these metal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> box and i was just like what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that metal box my first thought was oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably like a safe they provided </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because you know i hear about some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> american campsites something like bear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> safes or something so i was thinking i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might be a safe or something um and so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like navi what's that and he's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just way gone let me show you he opens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it up and it's a [ __ ] power outlet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's two power hours sticking out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like that i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes camping with my power up yeah right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm just like so wait there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally no [ __ ] reason for me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> buy this [ __ ] brick and lug this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around i can't take it anywhere can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> take it on the plane and apparently it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> useful and it's apparently it's useless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a camping trip what the [ __ ] do i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> need this for you literally i looked at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that thing and i'm like that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people use for like emergencies like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when like your house is flooded and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have no electricity and like this is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> thing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like if japan syncs ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happens i'm [ __ ] sorted man you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like the top of the hierarchy like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people have been fighting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first night he like charged his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well he was like i might as well use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this [ __ ] thing yeah so he charged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> his phone right it was like a hundred </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> percent next morning phone is fully </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> charged 97 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's three percent of his charge his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> power is fine i'm like this thing could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> last you like literally like two months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i literally insane i literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bought it just so i could recharge my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> phone during during the duration </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like ventilation like yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> knew he was like [ __ ] way too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> overkill when i opened it up had a vent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that had like a fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> turned on he turned it on and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> literally started going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like this way yeah so three percent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> power of the [ __ ] fan probably yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but he charged your [ __ ] phone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was so funny yeah but like i've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> camping quite a bit in australia like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dad and i used to go having all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i don't want to [ __ ] counter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a power outlet with the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly but like i i realized okay japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does not know how to go through camping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like it really is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it really is baby mode on mario so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we we saw someone like so like we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some relatively small tents right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> neighbors yeah we had neighbors yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's the thing that really put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> me off because i thought we it was but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was one lot of part b so there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> social distancing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was one lot of part it was social </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> distancing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably one thing i one thing i learned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about ten is that it's just not noise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> proof at all i can hear [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything literally i remember we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleeping and i just i could hear like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the other tent [ __ ] farting in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> background and i'm just like okay who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was that was that you nabi okay whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like some of these tents that these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people bought they weren't [ __ ] tense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so some of our neighbors right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um one one lots like like two lots down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from us they they start unpacking this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ten right and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they this tent has [ __ ] compartments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and then not only that you you i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember walking past they had an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entrance right they had an entrance that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had lights on the entrance okay and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fairy lights and this tent had like two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] bedrooms a living room oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my parents didn't like that yeah and has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that even a tent though yeah it's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> family time it's just a pop-up apartment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but it's like a family tent i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just i'm just like this isn't a ten this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is a two ldk bro though like jesus tents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are a [ __ ] nightmare yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well but that's the thing right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i get it if it was a family but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was a couple this is a couple yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's ridiculous yeah yeah unlike that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> test that's because you're a japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> couple so naturally you're not gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep in the same bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of course i was i was getting to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because this this like this tent had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> carpet had shelves and i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might as well just like bring a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> caravan at this point we'd take that but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we stayed for like three weeks that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> makes sense if it's three weeks they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stayed for a single night and like of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> course okay so here's like the single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> night yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they they came with us and they left </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them so so here's the premium japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couple experience that i saw right so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> walked past this tent right and of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> course this japanese couple you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously very intimate japanese couple </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be going on a camping trip by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> themselves together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very intimate so the peak japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couple experience was seeing the guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next to his car on a [ __ ] gamer chair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or something and then seeing the girl on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other side of this massive tent on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hammock both of them by themselves not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interacting premium japanese couple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't that love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> knowing when to ignore each other yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's love no i i mean i say it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> free room japanese couple experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the amount of times like we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gone to like onsens or ryokans or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something and like it's just like us the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boys and we're just surrounded by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese couples they don't talk to each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> other not talking to them just not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> interacting with each other couples that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> social distance together stay together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just social distancing yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but like one one part i couldn't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believe was um with wood fire right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so you had to like go to oh i mean they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had the option to go to like the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reception quote unquote where you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pre-cut wood fire yeah that's normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how it is right yeah like so off yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cause they don't want you just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> picking [ __ ] up around the area right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but like but like the thing is i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what we can that's what we did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because each bundle was like 500 yen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right like maybe for like a bundle it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't it wasn't about the price it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't about the price </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because like this wood because it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pre-cut and clean and dry yeah this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing burns through like so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly i'm like we're here for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> entire day we want this fire to keep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going the entire day right yeah this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thing is not going to last us the entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day yeah so i just said [ __ ] it and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like went out into the bush and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just grabbed some wood and then nabi had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a hatchet and i'm like give me that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] started like deforesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't cut down any trees yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to emphasize we didn't cut off any trees </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we just cut off like some some branches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that had fallen down we cut the logs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into like sizeable pieces yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brought them back to our campsite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that that to me is the camping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> experience right we're out in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wilderness we're like yeah you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out here in like like a [ __ ] swimming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pool treating it like bear grylls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing it's like i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we wanted to make the most out of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly because it's like otherwise we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would have to spend like 100 bucks for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> firewood i'm like [ __ ] that i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it's not about a hundred bucks of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> firewood because it's just not about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> money joey it's about the experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's about the experience exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had so i the most amount of fun i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was going out into the bush picking up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some like dead trees and just bringing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it back and just chopping the [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of it that was the most fun i'd be so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] bored if i turned up and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should like i got like 10 neighbors we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got a power outlet yeah and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pre-packages like here you go here's all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the things you need go go have fun go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] micro transactions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with your camping experience man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably like bring your food if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to i know i know some camping trips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> actually bring you meat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like on the grill if you want if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> want to have food i like to stay at a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel the best part about camping right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is when you all turn up right and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your one mate is like voice i brought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bacon and everyone's like yes let's go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly perishable foods what an idiot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i mean in the uk you can just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a little place you can just kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of ask them you're like hey can i camp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on your land they were like yeah sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah stuff like that there's a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of places where you can camp like i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> australia there's like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> designated camping areas but like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> first come first so if something if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> full then [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that in japan or is it all just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> regulated it's all regulated yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's i mean it was fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the experience it was but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely preferred the camping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience i had in other countries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it just it just kind of didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like camping you know i mean there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was that other couple next to us that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> brought a [ __ ] tv </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> guess so yeah i guess i'll bring the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 50-inch yeah i guess like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like you think that these guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have been like permanently living there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with how much [ __ ] they have too far i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd be tempted to bring like you can get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those like really shitty uh like 19-inch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> battery-powered uh monitors yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there is nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing is is like because i've you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know because i've had a pretty [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stressful week because of the whole move </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing but so it's just so nice to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just sit down and look at a fire for 12 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hours and literally drink and talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing yeah it was the best [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> experience i've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is the best part yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because like because who set up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah did you really did you all did you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really yeah we all did we all did really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because most of the time it's we all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't it's like i watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> our tents really weren't that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complicated really right because it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> r10 was literally just like a triangle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of one of those [ __ ] yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't it wasn't a [ __ ] inflatable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> apartment it wasn't it wasn't a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> two-bedroom apartment yeah when i was uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i was like 15 i had the ones where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you like you [ __ ] throw it in the air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah yeah like like nabi had one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> those as well but like our past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> though yeah yeah ours was a bit more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complicated and we still somehow [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it up um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because so our 10 was like it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like not pre i mean it kind of is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pre-built but we kind of have to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> strengthen the uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the supports what what about the support </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> beams that come with them right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so what are they called like the </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> holes just [ __ ] poles it's not it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't a pole because it was like part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the tent right so this tent came with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like support beams that like supported </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the structure right and it was almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] poles it's baby mode like i said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> baby mo baby moten mode we did we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally didn't have to do anything we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just had to like [ __ ] we well we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought we didn't have to do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because it all kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfolded and we like put it up we just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we all we had to do is like put the pegs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down we thought great job done uh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't know it was job done because when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were trying to sleep when we when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we were when me and joey were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to sleep just kept caving in </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> ten just caving in and i just have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like bring the support pole up again i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like oh that's a [ __ ] sake and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i could hear joey was like having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trouble sleeping as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was not sleep at all and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only when we were packing up that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> took the cover off and i was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the top of the support beam there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this label that said push i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why does this label say push and i push </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it down and i just hear click and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> everything is like a solid aspect </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> the support beams like the manual or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clearly clearly we should have i mean it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was a tense i'll just give it a click </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly well because like i'm not used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to tense like that i'm used to the ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you have to like kind of connect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the poles together and do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself right so i'd so i was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cool this is who bought the tents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh naby dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i was like oh i've never seen this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of tent but it seems easy enough it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just some reason whenever you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] do your friend's tent it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest piece of [ __ ] ever it's like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> picked the images that make it like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> least legible and like the least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understandable to like figure out how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like build this sounds like you you took </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the monkey brain on the trip yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't need to come there was already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monkey bro gant was very monkey brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around that fire like he was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i i i feed him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was single-handedly fueling that fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like 12 hours this this fire went on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like 12 hours and i was the one like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fueling it every time yeah it's like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't have to do anything i'm just god's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like assistant right here just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fueling up we need to look for like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actual place where we can camp with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> legit like legit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> outlets i don't know if we'll be able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> find that in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what was your camping experience like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> england in england i didn't really go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much in england i went around like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> france mainly a lot of the time in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> france though like it was like campsites </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that did you count with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my family for the most part but then uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously because we're in wales so it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really easy to just camp for a weekend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and it was normally you were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like in a in a farmer's land </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in like some [ __ ] random field oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like land that someone owns yeah oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you could because they they'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> always know someone you could just be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh can we camp and it maybe it'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a 10 or a night okay because they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really want anything they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like don't just leave a mess just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> clean everything out because you can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do that in australia it needs to be in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like a national reserve no you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do whatever you want on the land </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so and normally you're right next to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> woods and stuff so yeah obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no power outlets or anything and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're probably a decent walk away from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the car that you came in yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so yeah it was just good fun though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean you just normally just set up the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tent if you can get a fire going go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ahead but it might be raining a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time and you might have to start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drinking beers in the tent like if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> squished in this tent like how you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right nice someone want to ball the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kettle uh get some pot noodles going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know uh whatever whatever you do we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh duke of edinburgh as well we did that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah that was good fun as well yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because in japan you can't even like put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a fire on the ground </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you need this like fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because sometimes in some places you'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> clean up after yourself and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easier to just bring something that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could wrap the like all the ash in right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah which is like i think we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did that a few times because it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you have to clean it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes it's an absolute pain in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ass getting rid of all this ash well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because in australia all you did was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just dig a hole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then once it was once you were done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with the ash you just fill up that hole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> again i mean it's good for the land but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean sometimes you can't do that in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean it's whatever i just kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was never more than like two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nights it was always like a night yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put the tent up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of get drunk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah eat a lot of bacon in the morning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and baking sandwiches yeah yeah two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> nights i feel is like the optimal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> camping time yeah i'd say so two nights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is about right it depends because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> need something to do the second day yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> cause the first night you you're setting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up you're having a few drinks what do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do during the whole second day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before you start drinking you can't you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't immediately get like start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drinking beers at like 11. i mean that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what we did that's kind of what we did i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess but then there's someone like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> driving right no i don't know i mean i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of want to do something i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah well that's when you can bring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tv and connect it to the power </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> outlet yeah well because it's sorry if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you could who's got the switch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with british people you know and there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like four of you like a 24 pack sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smash so much that a 24 pack won't last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like more than a night that's true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like how much beer are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bringing along for this thing right you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't do day drinking that's like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> need like 40 beers at least for that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whole experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i mean that's why i like doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh that's why i like i mean we have we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brought like a pack of cards and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that kind of stuff i mean we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never cracked them open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we just left them there for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> decorations i was just having too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] fun with the fire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was on fire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> enthusiastic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is fire burning like 24 7. yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well you're twenty four seven it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bernie for like a good like 14 hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jesus christ just because we [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> adventured out and got all the wood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right that's half that was half the fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like what did you do the second day when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you said you you slept in the tent the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first night no no no no we didn't we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't sleep in the first night because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we we got there like super super early </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the second day um because we the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first day was raining like crazy the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first day we missed the day of camping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we did what anyone do and just had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nice day at an onsen yeah and slept at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a nice roof over our heads um </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> they have on rookie things yeah like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stickers yeah it's the first year when </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> front and back it's like a provisional </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of sticker i don't like it </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> bring my stickers got to put them on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i i guess the only thing i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like i am not looking forward to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing more paperwork which is uh what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm going to be doing a lot of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan as you know japan is like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> neverending cesspool of paperwork get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the paper done paperwork done when it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not stressful so that when you work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's a that that doesn't happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's a tricky question if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're if you you got [ __ ] happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're busy the last thing you want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do is lose a day like if you have the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time to lose a day do it now when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> can right like that's why i did it all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of you to assume that we just have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> date i don't have a date but i had a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where like it wasn't that bad if i lost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it right like you know when i eventually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> move at the end of the year you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna be [ __ ] hell yeah and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not gonna want to lose a day because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a [ __ ] game it's gonna be more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than a yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not about losing a date it's about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> losing a day to paperwork like i i it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's hard never gonna be good so just i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know i mean it's it's just finding </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> leisurely activities uh you guys went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> snowboarding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't think we talked about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on the podcast don't think we have no it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was uh i couldn't go to that one yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was my very first experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboarding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was okay so this this we obviously we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i went before like we remembered that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reason i wanted to try out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snowboarding was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> purely because of sss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and snowboard kids on the n64 but uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah the choice between going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> snowboarding and going skiing and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like 100 snowboarding i want that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ssx tricky though yeah because everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> told me that it's like way harder to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start snowboarding like yeah it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beginners find it easier to ski but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like harder to master yeah whereas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snowboarding is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> harder to get into but easier to master </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from what i understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think that's true yeah yeah and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess like so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my first experience snowboarding was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that it was okay i didn't realize how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much i took for granted friction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my life okay like i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm so gone how so so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i remember the first time um so we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> got all dressed up i put on all the kit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything uh put on put on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snowboard on like one shoe or one foot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or however like you lock yourself in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then so my first mission was to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walk from where i put my snowboard on to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ski lift yeah i remember trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take trying to take my first step </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately slip and i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a bit of a challenge in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait so you're telling me i'm gonna have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go down a [ __ ] hill when i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even take a single step </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's the type of movement you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never do otherwise it just seems it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so unnatural yeah right and um so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] waddle my way over to the ski </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lift did you have your snowboard on or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is it like like you're carrying a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboard i had my snowboard on i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had the one one boot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> begin a ski lift and uh i was with uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sydney and maelyn and malin's partner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a good time yeah milan wasn't having a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> good time either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so only one of us knew how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> snowboard and so only one of us was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> showing us how it was done and melin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> melen knows how to ski but this was her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> first time trying to snowboard either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right as well so we we were i at least i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had like a fellow novice with me right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not the only one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so we waddle over to this uh ski </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lift right and so to go to go through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the gates we have to like you know scan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ourselves in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and i'd like the problem with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like having this big snowboard on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you is that once i start like taking a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> step sometimes i don't know how to stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so there was this [ __ ] kid in front </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of me right there was this kid [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pro snowboarder like easily goes through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gate i like go through the gate take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my first step and i swear to god i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> always i almost fall on this kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i almost took out this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> five-year-old in front of me yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> frankly had it come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming luckily like luckily mackie just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like grabbed me before like i fell on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this kid i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> god i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at this point i hadn't even got onto the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ski lift yeah um and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the first step that's that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> first step </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was on my way and i was texting how's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it going how's it going like it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hard yeah it's really hard it's hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really difficult to full face first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up with skis yeah because you how the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] you gonna do that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboard is very easy oh yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost guaranteed you're gonna fall face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay so i i i what are my my waddle my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> way to the ski lift </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i've never obviously this is my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first time on the ski lift i've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know what the right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> technique is or like how to like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you don't think about this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> walking easy one one foot forward next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> foot forward it was like it was like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a baby trying to figure out how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walk again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm i'm like it's taking like all of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my mental energy just to figure out how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to stay on two feet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i so the person tells me to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like go to this point here where the ski </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> lift is going to go and like take you up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm just thinking this is this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is like i i've never like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> panicked before trying to figure out how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to waddle like literally one meter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> forward yeah that was probably a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mean of him to make you get on a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ski lift yeah first thing you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have just gone like walked up the hill a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> little bit and just tried to go down or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least get on the ski lift holding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> your snowboard right yeah can you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah you can do that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but clearly no one told you that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> could do that millions husband was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nah trial by fire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> will be the option yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i didn't yeah i literally didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know that it wasn't normally normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you are supposed to when you with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like beginners on snowboard what you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make them do is you just kind of make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> them walk up a hill yeah like a very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very like not steep hill yeah yeah just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of make them like go down yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> straight like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like horizontal horizontal yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perpendicular sorry to the slope uh but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was very much uh wow okay mike was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] that on the skillet right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i was i was kind of like um i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like like a [ __ ] animal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking over the edge being like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta go gotta go no don't wanna go okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's go now and uh so i'm like i say a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> waddle um this was like me for trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] ice skate over to to like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meter ahead of me and just stay still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough for the ski lift to like lift my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> butt up and go up so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> managed to do that luckily without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> without any big massive incidents but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then comes the next step but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and how about you get down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i was having a great time i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay you know what this [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] slaps look at this view look at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this like i'm having a great [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time it's like being it's like being on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a being on a roller coaster you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you when you're growing up you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just enjoying the view it's peaceful i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just like okay i can get into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboarding um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is pretty cool um and then i get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um where the exit is and it's it's it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets closer and closer and then it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> slowly dawns on me how do i get off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how do i how do i exit this seat that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm currently sitting on right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i see i see the kid in front of me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gets off no problem at all and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that looks easy that looks easy i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just i just you know i just use the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> momentum that the seat is carrying me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through and i just slide it just and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just slide off right and i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cool i'm like i'm like i'm like shadow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> boxing right because i'm just i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like visualizing this in my head i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like how hard can this possibly be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right right how hard can this possibly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like in the shower </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i was literally psyching myself up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was just like sure i can do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if if a five-year-old kid can do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i can do it yeah and so literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing that happens is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the lift goes up it starts slowing down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like brilliant i'm not i'm not even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna need to do this at full speed it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> going at like naught point we're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] launch you off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i have no idea right i i i thought you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just had to use the momentum just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i had no [ __ ] clue but honestly i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think i would have preferred that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because now i had zero momentum and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like [ __ ] how do i position my feet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and by the time i get to the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i need to get off i hadn't figured </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out how i was gonna do this so literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing that happens is i'm i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i put both feet down i literally tried </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> huh horizontal like that yeah like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so i was just like i was like okay so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was like first mistake i was i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> put both feet down twist and then put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one of my first one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on on the snowboard and just slightly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just breezily just like slide down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um so that so obviously obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that didn't work out right first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i did was i put first two feet down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stood up immediate face plan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's this thing behind you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's pushing you forward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you got to like shiv to the side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this yeah you got to shoot me like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that and then kind of go down like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it would be nice if someone was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there to teach me how it was done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would not have done that to you if i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was there have told you how they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> done it but the thing is here's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thing right we apparently went on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> beginner slope right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that was that that was like there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was no way that this was the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beginner slide and we found out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> afterwards um on the second day because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me and melin um we we we weren't having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a great time trying to go down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and apparently we found the next day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that there was a slope that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dedicated to like people's first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying snowboarding right right no we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't go on that one we went we went on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] beginner slope which was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who had already been experienced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> enough to go downhill right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so it was me maelyn sydney and marky on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the top of this hill maki just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bolts it down already yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and screaming at us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're getting like legitimately like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> frustrated oh my god they were like bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah and my good just get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good like what do you mean just just go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down yeah just go down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just go straight it's not hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and maki goes down first and tries to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like goad the rest of us into going down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like you know what guys i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just i'm just i'm just i'm gonna go i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna do a pro gamer move and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna go down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately start tumbling [ __ ] down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i i i must like front flip five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm just like ah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> damn snow just like in my mind i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> snow is going to cushion the fall and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like man this hurts way more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than i thought it was going to do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does cushion but like 30 yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because all of the snow that you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like snowboarding on it's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like plowed yeah it's compact it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jumping off your bed onto a very flat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pillow yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll cushion you but to what extent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i'm just like i'm just like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i had this image in my mind that i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like oh it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tumbling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like falling on clouds and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because and because of that i like when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i first went down i i did not hold back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well i just like [ __ ] went as fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as i can not realizing that jesus christ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not realizing that i i didn't know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so and so quickly i kind of before i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before i learned how to break um i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly realized that the easiest way to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> break was just to fall down oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean that's what they teach you at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> first right it's like to fall down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably there's a reason why like when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you if you start young particularly in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> skiing and snowboarding you're going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be really [ __ ] like you're going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be so much better than somebody learned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> later on just because like when you're a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> kid you're fearless yeah exactly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> kids don't [ __ ] know danger like when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was a kid i was i was going way too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fast and i would just go straight down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i was [ __ ] stupid that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i was just like this is fun i love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going like a hundred miles per hour yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a good idea yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's how people die there's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> danger here yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> holy [ __ ] this hurts yeah i'm not doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so melian and sydney see me [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tumbling down this hill and then i look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> up and making's like all right your turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now and they're just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no i don't think i will and so they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start like getting on their butts and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like sliding it just like slowly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sliding down and mark is like no come on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> guys come on get up just get good get up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a slide i have to go obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because i learned young and i was very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fortunate very lucky very privileged to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be able to learn you know how to ski at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snowboard at a young age yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one thing that kind of like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mind doing it because i'd rather go with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my friends than not but like it does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suck have enough weight like 30 40 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes you go down a slope takes you 30 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seconds yeah you've got to wait 40 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes for your friends to come down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're like right let's go on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> beginner one again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are literally psyching themselves up on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this hill for like a good like 40 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes to an hour right mainland that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were they were on this beginner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hill like this which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was probably like that okay all i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knew was that i i stood up for a second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i started going way faster than i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was comfortable with that was that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was that's called the hill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because at the ski resort we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at one of the like the black diamond one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of them was like only 30 degrees oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not even that bad wasn't that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so realistic it was probably like five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> degrees it was i mean okay i get it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because you could get a lot you can go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty fast it it feels like especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're not used to that when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> can see the bottom it looks way worse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than it is percent hundred percent come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on i don't know man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well i'll give you the benefit yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay it was the first time for you so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the beginning of the hill was like quite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> steep but then you got around to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> middle part which is the actual which i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel was the actual beginner's slope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right because this this hill obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't even in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's what's what's the word i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> looking for altitude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> slow slope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> angle gradient gradient that's that's it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't equal in great work so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the best part to learn on this beginner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hill was like right in like the middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of this course where he went like a in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like around like that like it did like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> loop-de-loop yeah yeah yeah yeah so the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> best part to learn was actually in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle part which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how i learned how to like control my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speed and turn yeah and turn because i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had two like going down this hill for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time i had two speeds it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go and tumble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the two speeds that i had so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while waiting for sydney and naylan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when on youtube and stuff like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm looking at some tutorials about how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to show boys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i want to be that guy who like slowly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who like slides past you and i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what's this guy doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because the the thing about maki is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that he's a good snowboarder but i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think he knows how to explain how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboard because i was asking maki maki </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the right what's the like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right technique yeah he's very much just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'll just do it just go yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very much just oh you just go like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this and like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know that clip of like that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australian surfer or not australian but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just that stuff who's just like and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was kind of like appeared it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beautiful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's kind of what i heard when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i when maki was trying to explain to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how to snowball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh you just go like this and then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turn like this and then you control your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> speed like this and i'm just like maki </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just like showing me like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different angles here it means this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> means nothing it sucks because it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to learn to like put your body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the place where your body doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> want to naturally be right because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have to put all your weight in your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> front foot which means you're going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be leaning into the hill which yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lean into it you don't want to do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just naturally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't do that yeah and then you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to like throw your body from side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to side with your back leg yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it is a weird move if you haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> done it before it feels really unnatural </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like initially because it's like and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why the first time like after you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> finish the next day or you [ __ ] feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that because you're using all these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> muscles you've never used yeah i i we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually had the snowboard thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> snowboarding trip for like two days but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i could only go one day oh yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the second day you're [ __ ] right oh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was i i never felt more [ __ ] in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> life yeah i feel that yeah on this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> beginner slope i don't know which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] sick [ __ ] decided to do this but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like that's funny but also my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on this beginner slope right it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this very narrow kind of like uh like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hill going down like winding yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and at the bottom of this this wind the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the exit to it someone had put poles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a big x and the and it was open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right so you could go on it but the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way that you could avoid these polls was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to jump over them in the middle and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or go under them or go under them which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you weren't going to do because yeah the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gap okay so the gap to jump over was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like this yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but when you're a beginner or you even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even if you're like your board is not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> coming off the scene yeah it's hard to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get if you're not experienced doing any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of jump on a snowboard yeah lifting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your board up for considerable amount of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time is unnatural and hard to do yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's heavy yeah it's like this right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no way you'll get maybe like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this right yeah like this it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that off the ground yeah and so i i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right just jump over it gone so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i went i jumped over it and my board </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just clipped it a little bit yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like oh [ __ ] turn around god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] jumps just [ __ ] jumps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Applause] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i went with the philosophy of just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just gonna fall down and hopefully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll like learn something new every time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like there's only so many ways you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can fall down before you figure out a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way to not fall down right of course um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so i remember seeing like i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing these crosses in the middle of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this course that i was going down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with the corner i was and i was like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fell down before and i was like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what do we do what why do they have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these here what is this yeah what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like i don't know just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] jump over it i'll go under it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no because like there were two options </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you could either like jump over it or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could like crouch super slow and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like or sleep super low and just go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> under it right it was yeah it's like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't really crouch yeah yeah you'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to like lift them up and stop it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i don't know why they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there no one explained why they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they shouldn't have been there i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really sure i guess someone just forgot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to put it away i think so it was really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird but i was like sick free jump test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> let's do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i was like by the time by the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you encounter going now i was getting i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was getting confident with myself i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like going a bit faster than i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> before you know test limit testing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> myself yeah and just as i did like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] sick turn i was like [ __ ] yes </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> didn't [ __ ] i was [ __ ] i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> realize how tired i was because we we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went down the slope like a bunch of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times i was there all day yeah took </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of tumbles on the first day and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was i was so ready for the second day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i'm just like by the end of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first day i was just at the point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was when i was getting the hang of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah so i was like [ __ ] yes day two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's go yeah i opened my eyes on day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two and it was like i felt like i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] got punched by mike tyson or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that right i like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't realize that the thing that hurt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most was my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> neck right because you've been hitting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> your neck a bunch yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because whiplash yeah i didn't realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that whiplash was a thing with when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tumble that much but now i know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> whiplash is definitely a thing you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should have got a helmet as well they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh that's [ __ ] dangerous jesus christ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they didn't give us helmets i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think oh yeah when i saw them without </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> helmets i was like this is a terrible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i could i could i could go a whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day without a helmet but like if i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing like hard stuff i would be very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah i would probably i would i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would not go down like i mean if i went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> again because the last time i went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboarding was like [ __ ] like six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> years ago i would definitely get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> helmet just because like my body's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> used to it right yeah i didn't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> give [ __ ] i was with these guys on like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the green slopes and blue slopes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like yeah [ __ ] that's fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then like if i went down like i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> took uh you went down to like a black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> diamond well yeah so i took mackie down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i was like oh okay so everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone had left and then it was mackie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who's the one calling them a coward and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like all right it's time let's go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just let's go and do a real one and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a double black diamond which i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to do but to clarify like black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> diamond is like the hardest type of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> course it's just like double black </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> diamond which is like the most extreme </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i couldn't convince him to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that because i think he was like oh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like i'm good but i'm not like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like okay i love how like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something about snowboarding just turns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> every guy into a dude bro you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean like yeah i can just imagine like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when god did that clean turn and kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when i'm bringing my friends my biggest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> worry is that they will hate it from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> falling over too much and they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to do it yeah yeah because then i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what i can't bring my friends again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah i can't go we can't go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alps you know we can't go to italy drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> espressos then hit the slopes yeah have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a few bevies in germany and hit the apps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know they can't do that's what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to do so and then i was like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just the boys now it's just me and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mackie i'm gonna take him down to black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so i meant i found one where that i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> like a saturday ah yeah it must have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been it was it was like a public holiday </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> almost empty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conditions as well there's like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ton of snow and it was like perfectly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> clear oh no sun was out it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect yeah it's nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i i so i get up to the beginning of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slope on the second day everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> aching as [ __ ] and i'm just like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fine all i need to do is like tumble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once and i'll just like fight through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the pain and you know get it get it over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with so like i go down right uh i go i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start going down this beginning he'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get further than i did yesterday because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i got more used to it yeah and then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tumble and i was like all right i i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know i expected this but like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tumbled and i landed with my head like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> downhill so like so like i was i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like downhill like this yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i i quickly realized oh </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> like that i was not only like lift i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was lifting it not only like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even even when i was like perfectly flat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was hard enough to lift my neck up no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i was going against the hill as well to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lift my neck up so i quickly realized i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't lift my neck up and i quickly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how heavy my gear that i was wearing </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> body around like shimmy if you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> be faster you can just [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah stamp it into this yeah i i i did </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> load my dad ever shot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> back to the [ __ ] video i kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realized quickly i was in a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a little bit of a pickle because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't know how i was going to get up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with all this heavy gear so um what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tried doing is just like slowly shimming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like shimmering shimmying like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> body to be like horizontal or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where i can get up um that took for that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> took ages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i must have been there for like 40 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes right because no one helped you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no that's that's that's the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why i was there for like a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 minutes and i'd gotten around like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd say about 20 degrees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because if i saw someone upside down i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would go overboard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about so after about uh so after about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh 20 degrees like someone someone skis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down and says are you okay do you need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any help and i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no i'm okay i think i got this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so he goes okay um and he offers me a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hand and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i get up and uh i you know he helps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me sit back up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and so i see i sit back up he goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back over and i'm like okay i got this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i try shimmering a bit more slip like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my body slips a bit and i'm like back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back in my back right and i never i i'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never known how it felt to be like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you know when you see like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tortoise on their back yeah they can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get back up that's exactly how i felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so after another 20 minutes i finally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get to the point where my feet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like my feet first down the hill and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] this i take off the snowboard and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> walk and i walk the rest of the way down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there i am not going through that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> experience again i would do like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever it takes to not take the board </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off i'm like i would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly that's what that's what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought but i'm just like it took me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 40 minutes i hate admitting defeat until </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah there's nothing sadder than just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like walking down while everyone's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shooting past you right yeah it was a it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was a depressing but you have to if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have to do it yeah it's crazy like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone snowboards in japan it's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> weird in europe everyone skis yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah japan yeah for some reason no one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wears helmets no no one wears helmets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's scary yeah it's and like the rental </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place didn't even offer it no that's i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's like an option you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to ask for it's nuts and i was like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't offer helmets you know yeah cause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i got like the rental pack which was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like apparently like the all-inclusive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pack and they just yeah clearly not all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know even like professionals wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> helmets you know what i mean like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you never know what could happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because uh [ __ ] uh what was it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> michael schumacher fell and hit a rock </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't he and then he's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he's in a like vegetative state now i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think is he and he's like a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experienced skier yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and he just hit a rock yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess i guess no yeah i guess nobody </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> told me and i i wish i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned up and i'm like oh god they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have helmets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i wish i had worn a helmet so i could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go the second day without feeling like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would help with your neck as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because yeah you'd have you wouldn't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i wouldn't be like [ __ ] would it or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would it just be like extra weight on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your hands oh god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i feel like that extra like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> distance you go that the helmet off like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cushions oh that's true it definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> helps yeah also though dude skiing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then being able to get like a fat ramen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a curry no damn that's good oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like that onsen you go to after a full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> day of snowboarding is the best [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling yeah it is the best sleeping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> onsen in this place was just like a view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like an outdoor onset </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you just viewed the mountains nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i like refurbished it all as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah [ __ ] could feel like the snow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> take me back man take me back no this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old hopefully i'll i'll be able to join </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys this year yeah yeah hell yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i do i want to ski so god damn much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like seasons i haven't done nearly as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much as i wanted to when i came here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i [ __ ] did again like i haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gone snowboarding or skiing in like five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> years yeah and it's supposed to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the best skiing in the world in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> japan yeah some of the slopes i worked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on is [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would i would just want an experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i'm not on my ass for literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ninety percent of the day that's that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would that would be a cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> experience yeah like also just after you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> after you're all like sore you know you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all go to the onsen then you go for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> meal and you get a bunch of beers oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's so good yeah yeah after ski beer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or snowboarding it's just like 100 yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's like i feel like how long did it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> take you to learn snowboarding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i always did skiings my my parents uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> took me um they do like the whole like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> package holidays i [ __ ] i hated uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> skiing with because you'd ski in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> groups with like we did like bulgaria </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like dirt cheap to like do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh you'd have been a group of other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like families and i didn't really enjoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it because i was always like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rebellious kid so i wanted to do my own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing but to like go and like follow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> along and and so i i i'd say it took me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like before i got like good enough to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on any slope skiing it's like three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then i taught myself how to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh yeah because once you've gotten the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grasp of skiing it's very easy to kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of because you you're already used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the laughter it was still really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's still hard it like didn't make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sense in my head like not nothing can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prepare you for just how snowboarding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> works because it really goes against </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything your mind has trained you for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean especially the difference between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like skiing and snowboarding right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like in skiing it's like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're facing down the hill then you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna go and if you're not then you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stopped it's the literal opposite with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboarding right you need to be facing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the side to go and this way you stop but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the thing that made me want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> change really badly was that i [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sure anyone who skis will know this the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shoes are just [ __ ] the worst the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worst you know and because because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were concrete blocks because we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing because we were doing like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i'm really really grateful that my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parents took me on these like they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the cheapest skiing holidays you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could get right so we often stayed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really really far away from the places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have to put your ski shoes on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like you know kind of looks like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of look like clown shoes yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you put these shoes on like 10 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before you'd like 10 minute walk from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the bus so you have to walk i'm like 13 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with my skis yeah i'm not that strong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah walking ten minutes with my skis in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> these horrible things click clock click </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you have to wait on the bus for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 minutes i need to walk another like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five minutes and it's just like i hated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it yeah and then i was like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i hate these shoes so goddamn much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so painful wearing them it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everything about these suck they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely destroy your anger yes and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like i don't care what it takes i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna learn to snowboard for those god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you just get boots yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> first time i was snowboarding boots i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can walk normally you know when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at the restaurant you know you see these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people with their trays like clocking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> know it's like you just get so much more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> freedom and so much chiller like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you haven't got poles to carry and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that's why i wanted to learn it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] sucked first three days i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kept falling over oh yeah so yeah me my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little brother did it at the same time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and my little brother sprained his ankle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like first day yeah gave up and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like nah i'm determined i'd say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboarding the first week that i did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it i was pretty [ __ ] i could go down a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> black slope by the end but i was doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it really badly i was just like going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like this you know yeah really slowly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but i went down it um and then i'd say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like it took me like maybe two or three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> more weeks before i felt like i could i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was actually doing it good but yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> self-taught </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean it's it's just about like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know just getting your body used to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those weird movements that you're going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fast yeah but also it's just like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just have to commit yeah some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these like you just have to be like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know this is not what i'm supposed to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i have to do this yeah and it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scary dude like leaning forward on a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hill like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not built for that you know your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your brain's not built to be like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know this thing you're going down fast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta lean forward yeah yeah into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the danger i always felt when i'm skiing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go fast when you're skiing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost feel like it it's like safer than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going slower like yeah weirdly yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt safer because like the way that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know how it worked but when i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going snowboarding when i started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> getting speed it did not feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> secure at all it's wobbling and anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that hits the board underneath you feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it [ __ ] tell me you're going really fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's [ __ ] terrifying yeah i know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you've tumbled when you're going like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really fast oh my god you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and also and also like tumbling with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just these massive things on your feet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just never it never feels natural you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's it's like having two concrete </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bricks just like yeah glued together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like the green army </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just kind of learn like just kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like do this and then yeah hopefully </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you feel good just don't don't put your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hands out that's the yeah part is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learning when you fall naturally you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to put your hands out but that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how you sprain your uh your ankles uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ankles are your wrists you can get like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the wrist guards but they don't help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that much i mean what i got taught </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like i got taught by like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ex-professional like snowboarder and he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> said like when you fall like you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fall with your fists yeah because if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fall like this just don't do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he did that and broke both of his wrists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the same time so he's like don't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that that [ __ ] hurts i can tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> firsthand i just put my arms like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you just [ __ ] do this then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're good yeah just don't fall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> straight forward just just get good why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would i fall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> literally what i what i found from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snowboarding is that it's literally the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get good of sports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like when i started getting used to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was nothing that could prepare my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mind like you know i watch youtube when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i watch the youtube tutorials i tried to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> follow what they were saying but nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could really prepare me for just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting the feel of the snowboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's it's like you got to shut </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off a part of your brain um and relearn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like another skill set yeah when you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like snowboarding and stuff yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also like just where you're where you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting pressure on your like toes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> your like at the exact point can can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> determine so much on how you're steering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get so much more control once you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> realize like okay if i just have faith </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if i put pressure here it'll turn where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want it to but you kind of gotta like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not panic to learn that yeah panicking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is what [ __ ] you yeah yeah it's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> though i mean you get the chance to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> go but obviously honestly yeah i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like it is a very privileged sport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we've been talking about a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> privileged activities haven't we like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kayaking and snowboarding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember when i was at the ski resort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and um i found my mom said to tell her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i was like snowboarding and she was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh you rich now are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like they read like to us like to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to me like snowboarding and skiing has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> always been like the rich man sport yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always been like the white man's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> floor that's that's that's how i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's how like i was raised like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboarding and skiing because you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i go on holiday you know i you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> visit back where's the back home and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything like i go to like a nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cheap beach or whatever in thailand or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever um snowboarding and skiing like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only reason i've never gone before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was because there seems to be like so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many steps and so many like so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equipment that you need in order just to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go down a slope it's kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> golfing yeah i was about to say there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two types of rich white man sports it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you either go skiing and snowboarding or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you play golf well i think i saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something i don't know if this is true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or not but i saw something and it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was like based on like sports or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> accidents in general what sense of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were like white people and it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whitest accident you can have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is is uh on a [ __ ] jet ski it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was like a hundred i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember where it was it was like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 99.5 of accidents on jet skis for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> white people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the next one was skiing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snowballing yeah of course like 97. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's nothing more white i was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna say when you put it like that i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't yeah i don't think there is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything wider than owning a gesture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the wisest have you ever been on a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> jet ski no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have you thought about going on a jet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ski </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i like to that's not going to jet ski i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know i don't live in like florida </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything like that i've been on a jet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ski it's fine as [ __ ] yeah because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mean in thailand obviously with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> beach and everything there's some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> services where you can like rent out jet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ski for like uh half an hour or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um i mean it's basically just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> motorbike on water it says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no i mean it's just it's just a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun i can see how people get injured on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that though you go pretty fast and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think that it's water so it doesn't hurt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concrete yeah exactly exactly yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> think that you're falling off at full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> speed it doesn't hurt but it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hurts oh yeah um but it's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] fun um i mean i haven't done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> much on it i mean i've only had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like half an hour on a jet ski on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beach in thailand once but uh that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty much it i feel like that's all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd need i'll be like you know what now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm done yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've i've fulfilled the white man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> experience yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> american like culture right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds so bizarre a japanese ski </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> resort inspired by america it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird it was it was like kind of what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine yeah what kind of what i imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a ferry would be like you know it had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of different things for like 1950s </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> weird in japan in japan whereabouts did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys go hokkaido oh hokkaido yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but there was some areas of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hotel that were like totally normal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chill but there's a big area that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like kids theme park yeah carnival theme </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> chucky cheese [ __ ] right but i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they had bought these animatronics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know when they had bought these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animatronics because we were just um me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and sydney were just sitting there like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'd play these like songs right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd have these like animatronic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concerts like in in this like children's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> area where you can buy [ __ ] burgers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and fries it was like an eating area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's full on chuck e cheese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah basically and these poor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> employees had to listen these [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> things sing all day yeah and so so me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sydney were just enjoying like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nice burger and everything like that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then this [ __ ] this [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] animatronic dog or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just starts just starts bigging up the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> confederacy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i was just like i had me in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> city have to double take to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> did we just hear that correctly like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what is what is going on right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i walked past them and i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like don't mind my own thing i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why they're wearing confederate soldier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uniforms oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> jesus christ so after we heard that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> took like a closer look at these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animatronics right to be like what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going on when did they buy these and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where did they buy these from and we saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the bears </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not very tasteful 1920s like black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cartoon uh character oh no yes yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the lips were like massive you know and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it had the stereotypical cartoon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> black man accent of like 1920s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like the whole like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally if you go i know if you go and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch like a disney cartoon from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 1920s or a black person with that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like stereotypical accent they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gave them and character yeah and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just that and it's like it was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no oh no oh no oh no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why and uh yeah these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> these things you can't make that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these poor japanese tourists or these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these poor japanese toys are just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ah american culture yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kids are just like running around being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like mama what's the confederacy i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yes man it's gonna [ __ ] show it to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing weirder than that thing standing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next to a miku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like is that a miku thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh that's oh that is a really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> result though it's very cheap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really good result really good resort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that fantastic jesus christ yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it is one of those things you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is great what is going on here why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this a thing why is this here yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you know you have that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your 90 year old aunt who has that one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> piece of memorabilia like auntie you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should probably throw that away probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not talk about that yeah probably get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rid of that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean to give it to give them the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> benefit of the doubt i don't think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone there knew yeah it's just a case </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of they don't know yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's the matter of like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when tourism comes back in right like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's been there for decades well clearly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know how has no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like tourists come up and being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what that is right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably not a good idea yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to think of like you know because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously in the past like you know five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> six years it's been a very hot hot topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's only now where we've really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> started to be like we should probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get rid of all that [ __ ] yeah yeah not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good idea so i wonder i i i i wonder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though i wonder is that anybody anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> send them an email letting them know hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh love the animatronics they're great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're really great dog is cute but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe we should kind of change up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> theme a little bit yeah you know we got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got a bunch of miku's probably lying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> around we've probably resurfaced that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> swear off this place i thought it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i'm sure i'm sure you know it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very good there has to be a reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> behind it it was it was a nice place and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i just i i really did feel like they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just like ignorant you know what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mean yeah i mean it it like it kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt like they had just like brought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some memorabilia from america they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't know what they were buying well i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean this is all right a lot of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ski resorts are in the middle of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nowhere yeah it's in the middle of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] nowhere they they have no idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about anything like that what's going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it makes sense but it's still it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just super [ __ ] weird because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> walk into this really bizarre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you walk into the last thing you expect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan yeah because we had to like we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had to go on a coach that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lasted about two three hours in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> middle of [ __ ] hokkaido yeah right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were going in the middle of nowhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we walk in and it's just like old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> american memorabilia everywhere it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so [ __ ] bizarre as well the hotel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part was really fancy as well it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entrance this hotel was like marble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like pure marble with like pillars and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so fancy you can get you can get a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> helicopter from the airport to the hotel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] hell yeah yeah yeah but then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have this whole thing that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then also i mean completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unrelated but i was really offended when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i bought a what was it advertised as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coffee and i paid three dollars for it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> it's already uh it's it's okay yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's normally no coffee usually there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't right so so all of us when we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> walked in we saw that and the guy was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah so for people who are staying </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> no no make me pay please there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing scarier than something that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fulfilling because i i i was gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i sleep that's fine yeah i was i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like it's a it's a machine that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> serves coffee and you press the button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you could hear beans grinding so i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like surely surely there must be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> some quality to this if i can hear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something whirring in the machine it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not just a pod or something like that so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i get this coffee i drink it and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like man i never thought i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ask for a refund for a free coffee but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm kind of considering it now how is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so bad though it was like grounded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> coffee beans i mean i don't know if it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was grounded coffee there might have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just been like beans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in a container pretty sure they just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> grounded dirt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they sold it as coffee because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's pretty sure it was the things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that were being grown about right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from from the dirt that they don't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some vacuums have like speakers in them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to to have like sounds play when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pick up stuff like to make it sound more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was not fresh coffee um it was it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of it was beans those beans have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> been there since those animatronics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once you uh grind the beans they go bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like within like uh oh god i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how long maybe like a few weeks well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> clearly the people at the hotel didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know they're like well i mean once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're in the machine they're good to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go aren't they yeah they they get pretty </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> you're supposed to like grind them when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you drink them yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but clearly they didn't think about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like well there you go </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> right if they could do it i could do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no that's great that's a great mentality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's talking about you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> privilege </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because money's like a taboo subject </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you can't say that you want to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of it not like i i mean i i just </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> people are always like if i had that but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're never like i'm gonna go for it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> what was that i saw a thing that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like most people uh have the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> impactful years in your life are like 40 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years old you like the people who do the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most the important things the ceos of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the company all that stuff it's when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're 40. so just [ __ ] up try and do a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bunch of [ __ ] yeah exactly honestly go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for gold when you're like 20. why the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] no take some risks while you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> young </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah honestly like i what i try to tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people is like especially those in their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mid-20s because i feel like everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hits like their mid-20s or like 23-24 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they realize oh i'm just going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be working for the rest of my life you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know and you know everyone gets their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first job you get excited getting your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first job you're like damn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm actually getting paid for once i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not i'm not a peasant anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because wait let's be honest being a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> student is what they want that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the system wants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> being a student is just like man you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just gotten used to living like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> peasant right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so yes this is normal yeah you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i i remember like i remember like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere in my mid-20s when i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realized man how the [ __ ] did i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> live off cup ramen for a good like five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years of my life that's not normal yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i've just like entered i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> internalize that to be like dude dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> night out versus cup ramen night out any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of course got to get your priorities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but then you realize well i have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> job with a disposable income i can have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a decent living and that's what you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> would hope that most people would have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if they went through university if they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went if they got an education um it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot harder now yeah absolutely like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's i've you know i was lucky enough to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get even my first job after i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> graduated from uni which a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a hard time have a hard time doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now but i will say if you are able to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in a position where you can give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself a safety net then by all means </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] up in your 20s [ __ ] because your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 20s are the best point where you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] up in that in life and still it not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be the end of the world yeah you still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have enough time to recoup right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know get back to ground zero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's why i was just i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] it yeah i'll try youtubing it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> probably a terrible idea to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lose two or three years of my possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> long engineering career to this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm gonna try it like why wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i try it like it'd be so cool not to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it you know yeah go for gold but i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it does get to a point where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um because i i mean if i went down like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the engineering path i'm sure you too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know eventually in your 40s you'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> probably have a very cushy wage you'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you'd be very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very nice you know you'd be able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afford very fine things in life when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get becoming a chartered engineer the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pay you get is very good yeah and when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you work in certain places where the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> engineering gets you know more difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever like you can start getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nutty money yeah yeah um but i was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah [ __ ] that i'd rather take 20k </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah doing something that i like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also has the chance to make way more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down the line you know and that's what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was always like though i i always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought why settle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i i would rather risk losing at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all trying to make a million dollars and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then just settle for like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comfortable yeah because to me it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i i can do that at any point in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my life i i can settle down and and do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> things you know because you never know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like without career right like it could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start happening tomorrow for all we know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like if you can become the biggest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] youtuber on the planet next week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dude you're set for life you know what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean so it's like but i i don't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think of it like that it's not like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i see youtube anyway but i just i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would rather risk and do something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kind of like oh that's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could lose it all he xd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could like just become homeless tomorrow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better start camping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right but like i mean it's i'd rather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> try it like yeah of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i think it's important to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recognize that some people are just not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the position to be able to drive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true yeah because that's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> true because like i was very very lucky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i i'd built up the savings and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> also had a really good family that set </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me up exactly exactly because like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> will say this right now like my i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never brought up like my family weren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the best of financial positions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at all but like i was lucky enough to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like a mom and dad who's like work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their [ __ ] asses off to like get me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through and give me a better opportunity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> than they ever had and that's why like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now i'm trying to like most of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like most of everything i earn i like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like spend on them i spend more on them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than they do on me because i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's my way of like paying back the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opportunity that they gave me yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because good boy yeah i mean it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such a good song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean dude like yeah i mean my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like especially my dad he came up from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] poverty almost in [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thailand and like somehow found found </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his way to england and worked his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ass off had a much harder life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than i ever went through so of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like [ __ ] dead is that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bad ass though like you know he had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dream move to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> england and then his son's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> engineering degree and then now he talks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about titties </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that was that part that part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> story he probably doesn't tell that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> his family gatherings but now he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] proud now he's like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's badass dude yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because because i i feel like it's you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's it's a fallacy where you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know you think money solves every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem that you have when money money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> does not solve it it makes life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> significantly easier yeah it sounds so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty privileged when you say that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no not like as someone who you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has been poor in their life money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't solve every problem but there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a point in your life where money is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ninety percent of your problems right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right and just and and once you get your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> money is your problem you don't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have time to think about anything other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than money exactly and like my mentality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when i was a kid was just i just want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get by and have and be like comfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because i'm saying and you know i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like that was that was my big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> driving force to like really try to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> successful to take risks is just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was just tired of just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not like knowing what my life situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would be like five years down the line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like how am i how the [ __ ] am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i going to take care of my parents when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they get old like that that was that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a big [ __ ] thing for me there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely a time when i was like 16 to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 18 where i thought i really love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> video games i don't really care what job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i get i just want to be able to play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games after work right that's what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuinely i thought i wanted for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah yeah and then when i went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to university it like very much kicked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in i was like i don't think i can do an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eight-hour job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think i can't do that i did a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> three-month internship to know that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't want to do this for the rest of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life yeah i was like i mean more proud </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of people who love that that line of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work i just yeah i was i was jealous i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was at the time i was so jealous of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people that loved my course and what we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> were doing because i felt like they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just so op with school yeah yeah they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like got through it they got all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good opportunities because they enjoyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it like i just didn't enjoy it i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't try because i just didn't care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i have so much respect for people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know can go to their you know nine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to five job and be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at the time when i didn't know what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i was doing i was so jealous i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] man i wish i knew what the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i was yeah right you know and i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for every person like you know i got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> very lucky and i found something that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loved and that luckily makes money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my mom just believes that it did for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> very long time yeah sometimes i think a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of parents did yeah somehow it makes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money right and you know i'm sure for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every you know one of me that got very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lucky there was probably 10 people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never really found what they liked and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just had to like kind of just be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all right well i got to get a job yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can't i can't do nothing on my life yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly that sucks i think one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've realized more as i've grown older </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is that as a kid we were sold this idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that there's only really one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one way your career path can go right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like education university get a job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do with your degree and your career </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> progresses from there and that's like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had this i had that mentality for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the longest time of my life and now like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the older i've got the audio i've gotten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more people i've met who have had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the weirdest [ __ ] career paths </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we've had a lot of those people on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the podcast i feel like in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> entertainment industry you do meet the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who kind of are just bouncing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from things to things just trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out what they want right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not even enjoy life not even in insane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like living in japan as well like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i like meeting like teachers who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like found opportunities just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> randomly like like sometimes like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm trying to say is that as a kid i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i you know we got put this pressure on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that by the time you go to university or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the time you finish high school you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to know what you want to do for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rest of your life i wish they didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] sell me that long yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is the biggest lie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the [ __ ] world i feel especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when you're young adults the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest lie of the [ __ ] world is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking that once you start a career </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> path that you're going to have to stick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this for like the majority of your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life and that's such a [ __ ] lie and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like another big lie is thinking that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to go to [ __ ] university or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> college to have to have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> decent career that's also a [ __ ] lie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are so many different career paths </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um that are available to you that is not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just higher education because as an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asian i was taught that if i don't do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> higher education i'm a [ __ ] failure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if i don't get that a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i fail doesn't it no i'm not i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm not even talking about being a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> youtuber because obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we we are very lucky to be able to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube absolutely you know like i'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even talking about like oh we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtubers that's a different different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> career path i've found no i've met like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so many other people who have like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> found random jobs i mean [ __ ] melin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> found her [ __ ] job through craigslist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it is about just trying and looking and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just yeah at the right place at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right time and making sure you take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every opportunity that comes your way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly i just say yes to everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and that's why i miss every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opportunity you don't take yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know and if you which is in the uk which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is something that i just did really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't enjoy it was like the culture of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to work you go to the pub and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's it like you never try and do any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> self-improvement you never try and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look for any other opportunities like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking for another job is like oh wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what's wrong with you yeah and like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> that by the time you hit 18 it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the expectation where it's just like you </SPEAKER_00>
