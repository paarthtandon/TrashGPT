<garnt> the amount of blisters i've gotten from </garnt>
<garnt> mario party man </garnt>
<garnt> yeah my god whoever designed the </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah like he just hated humanity </garnt>
<garnt> he woke up and he chose violence </garnt>
<garnt> gamers welcome to this very special </garnt>
<garnt> episode of trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> i'm your host for today gamer and with </garnt>
<garnt> me is gamers </garnt>
<connor> and gamers how are you doing gamers </connor>
<connor> it wasn't that funny god says gamer man </connor>
<garnt> that was just the most forceful gamers </garnt>
<joey> i was like oh [ __ ] as a gamer i was not </joey>
<connor> prepared for that's the game when you're </connor>
<garnt> not prepared </garnt>
<garnt> so we all play video games yeah gamers </garnt>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> i thought today that we could talk about </garnt>
<garnt> our tastes in gaming because i think we </garnt>
<joey> spoke about what we like to play and all </joey>
<joey> that but we haven't actually sat down </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<connor> reviewed each other's gaming properly or </connor>
<garnt> at least tell each other our gaming </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so we've had like the anime episode </garnt>
<garnt> where we've probably </garnt>
<garnt> broken down our anime tastes even though </garnt>
<garnt> we've talked about anime before and </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna be doing something similar </garnt>
<joey> today so we have made </joey>
<joey> three three by threes for our games we </joey>
<joey> don't unfortunately we don't have a my </joey>
<joey> gaming list </joey>
<joey> which probably would have made it not a </joey>
<joey> thing i don't know that should be a </joey>
<joey> thing oh i'm sure there's like </joey>
<joey> i'm sure there's a thing of that but </joey>
<garnt> it's just not i don't know it's just not </garnt>
<garnt> as prevalent in the gaming community i </garnt>
<garnt> feel </garnt>
<joey> like i guess it's because it takes </joey>
<joey> longer to finish a game yeah </joey>
<garnt> and it i'm going to be honest it made </garnt>
<connor> this a lot harder </connor>
<connor> because i couldn't remember like most of </connor>
<connor> the games i played </connor>
<joey> literally it's just proven </joey>
<joey> like i'm not looking forward to this </joey>
<garnt> episode because i'm probably going to </garnt>
<garnt> have the most boring gaming taste well </garnt>
<connor> i've got godzilla's just going to be </connor>
<connor> like the top top selling games of all </connor>
<joey> time </joey>
<joey> that's that's it we sports nine times </joey>
<connor> tetris </connor>
<joey> we sport like for me like the </joey>
<garnt> we were making our three by threes at </garnt>
<garnt> the same time these two finished within </garnt>
<garnt> 10 minutes and i after about half an </garnt>
<connor> hour i </connor>
<garnt> made six and i'm just like are there </garnt>
<connor> nine games i really care about i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> i know i finished nine years nine games </connor>
<connor> that you care about </connor>
<connor> what are you gonna have a personal </connor>
<garnt> retirement home like no </garnt>
<joey> it's more than nine games no i i have </joey>
<joey> games that i played </joey>
<joey> that i enjoyed but like games that like </joey>
<connor> really meant something to me or games </connor>
<connor> like i think back and have like a </connor>
<connor> positive </connor>
<connor> right just like you just think yeah i </connor>
<connor> hated it </connor>
<connor> every game of time now i didn't enjoy </connor>
<connor> there were just so many games where i'm </connor>
<joey> just like yeah it was a game i played </joey>
<joey> you know like my father please stop </joey>
<connor> giving me shitty games </connor>
<garnt> i don't want to play any shitty games i </garnt>
<connor> enjoyed my time with it i don't know </connor>
<connor> i'm excited for this one because i feel </connor>
<connor> that you know with anime you guys are </connor>
<connor> like definitely the resident experts </connor>
<connor> right i feel like gaming </connor>
<connor> this is like this is yeah they're like </connor>
<garnt> the reverse the the roles have been </garnt>
<joey> reversed i mean look if there's anything </joey>
<joey> we know about the gaming communities </joey>
<connor> that they </connor>
<connor> love to [ __ ] on other people's opinions </connor>
<connor> right it's like </connor>
<connor> i i feel like regardless of what we put </connor>
<joey> on here there's going to be at least one </joey>
<joey> person being like </joey>
<garnt> an amateur [ __ ] normies right here oh </garnt>
<garnt> definitely definitely i'm independence </garnt>
<joey> you know i mean i'm fully prepared for </joey>
<joey> i'm fully </joey>
<joey> i fully realize i'm a normie when it </joey>
<joey> comes to games so i'm okay with that to </joey>
<garnt> be nice </garnt>
<garnt> you think you're a normie i think i am </garnt>
<connor> the most normie gamer </connor>
<joey> of your time considering the the list of </joey>
<connor> games that i've actually completed </connor>
<connor> is like i can probably count on my hand </connor>
<joey> wait why why do you not complete games </joey>
<joey> i don't i find it super super hard to </joey>
<joey> complete games </joey>
<joey> it needs to be like really good no </joey>
<joey> that's the thing that's the thing most </joey>
<joey> of the get like </joey>
<joey> because i tried to find the criteria of </joey>
<joey> like what i would put on my list right </joey>
<joey> and for anime it was </joey>
<joey> anime that i have at least re-watched </joey>
<garnt> once for gaming i was just like </garnt>
<garnt> um if i complete that if i complete the </garnt>
<garnt> game then that's like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> s-tier game in my eyes because if if </garnt>
<garnt> it's if if i get to the end of the game </garnt>
<connor> it must be a truly special imagine if </connor>
<connor> people did this for like movies they're </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> it's a good movie if i get to the end </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> because like for me for me like the most </garnt>
<garnt> most of most games i get to that 70 </garnt>
<garnt> mark of completion right and at the 70 </garnt>
<garnt> mark it's like you've you've discovered </garnt>
<garnt> most of the things the game can do for </garnt>
<garnt> you right and like you've unlocked most </garnt>
<connor> of the abilities </connor>
<connor> like they literally don't end until they </connor>
<garnt> end like like which games </garnt>
<garnt> on your list or just some of my games </garnt>
<joey> talking about like like online games </joey>
<joey> well if you're doing story games you </joey>
<joey> know obviously you can't just quit 70 </joey>
<garnt> percent of the way and be like i've seen </garnt>
<connor> the story i mean like </connor>
<garnt> you'd be surprised that's not a story </garnt>
<connor> that's that's a [ __ ] dictionary </connor>
<connor> you know unusual knowledge yeah and </connor>
<garnt> that's why i think for me </garnt>
<garnt> um story's a massive thing because if it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't have a good story </garnt>
<garnt> i ain't finishing the game no i agree </garnt>
<connor> with that if i don't have good gameplay </connor>
<connor> i ain't even starting the game and i </connor>
<connor> i'm like i realize i'm such a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> picky gamer </connor>
<connor> wait if there's if there is just one </connor>
<joey> aspect </joey>
<connor> of a game that just doesn't mesh with me </connor>
<garnt> immediately then i just end up not </garnt>
<joey> playing it </joey>
<joey> is anything that annoys me more than a </joey>
<joey> picky eater it's a picky game </joey>
<joey> your game especially especially now when </joey>
<connor> i just don't have time to play games if </connor>
<joey> i'm playing a game i play like </joey>
<joey> i think i play one or two games a year </joey>
<garnt> right new games like it's hard not to </garnt>
<garnt> just go back to my comfort food and play </garnt>
<garnt> games i've </garnt>
<joey> played before i have such a bad habit on </joey>
<connor> that where if there's </connor>
<connor> ever like a new game that just comes out </connor>
<connor> i think </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter if i just started a </connor>
<connor> new game three days prior </connor>
<connor> let's be like i don't want to play with </connor>
<connor> you anymore and then i just play that </connor>
<connor> new like </connor>
<connor> so just three days ago as i was </connor>
<garnt> recording this the monster hunter game </garnt>
<garnt> came out right </garnt>
<garnt> and i was like well i was gonna play </garnt>
<garnt> that anyway so it's fine but i was </garnt>
<garnt> really busy up until these last three </garnt>
<connor> days so i only just picked it up </connor>
<connor> yesterday right but before that </connor>
<connor> like right before monster hunter came </connor>
<connor> out i had got the new super mario </connor>
<connor> game as well so i had played that new </connor>
<connor> super mario game for like literally four </connor>
<joey> days </joey>
<joey> and then i was like monster hunters out </joey>
<joey> alright ceo </joey>
<connor> i just immediately started a new game i </connor>
<connor> mean if it's like a really </connor>
<connor> you know a highly anticipated game that </connor>
<joey> you're waiting for yeah i get it oh no </joey>
<joey> but i'm like that with anything right </joey>
<joey> like if there's like a new game on like </joey>
<joey> steam that's like oh it's 20 </joey>
<joey> off i guess i'll give it a go like i </joey>
<joey> feel like i'm one of those like if if </joey>
<joey> we're comparing it to like people who </joey>
<joey> eat food right yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm definitely one of those people who </connor>
<connor> just takes little bits off of the buffet </connor>
<connor> but doesn't actually finish what's on </connor>
<connor> their plate yeah before they go into it </connor>
<connor> whereas there are some people who are </connor>
<connor> like no </connor>
<connor> i'm getting one thing and i'm not gonna </connor>
<joey> move on to the next meal until i </joey>
<connor> finished it </connor>
<connor> okay so you know when it was like </connor>
<garnt> christmas or your birthday </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you ever asked for more than one </garnt>
<connor> video game did you ever do that no </connor>
<connor> you never asked more than one video no i </connor>
<connor> i did but it was like a hail mary i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<garnt> maybe maybe this is the year that all </garnt>
<connor> happened maybe santa really loves me </connor>
<joey> this year and then if you get like </joey>
<joey> two or three games in one you know </joey>
<joey> birthday or christmas it's like yeah </joey>
<joey> how do you whoa whoa yeah where who do i </joey>
<joey> begin with how do i split this time </joey>
<joey> evenly like that sounds like </joey>
<joey> i think my seven-year-old life peaked </joey>
<joey> when i got an entire game console for </joey>
<joey> christmas i got an n64 </joey>
<garnt> and that was like man my career's peaked </garnt>
<garnt> i am </garnt>
<garnt> life is never gonna peak after this what </garnt>
<garnt> am i what am i even living for man yeah </garnt>
<joey> i was i was like that when i got the </joey>
<connor> game boy advance when i was like five i </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<joey> there's so much power in my hands every </joey>
<joey> other every other thing i've ever done </joey>
<garnt> out the window because like one of the </garnt>
<garnt> big problems i had when making my 3x3 </garnt>
<garnt> was that </garnt>
<garnt> i there were games that i knew i loved </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid but then i don't remember [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> about them </garnt>
<connor> well there's there's some there's </connor>
<connor> somewhere if you ask me to play them now </connor>
<connor> i'm sure i could be like i don't </connor>
<connor> remember exactly what happened all i </connor>
<connor> know is that i put way too many hours </connor>
<connor> and yes like </connor>
<connor> so uh yeah i mean should we just get </connor>
<connor> into that then we can talk about other </connor>
<connor> gaming stuff after </connor>
<connor> yeah sure sure should we get trashcan i </connor>
<garnt> think our names are still on the boat </garnt>
<joey> all right </joey>
<joey> are they all great let's figure it out </joey>
<connor> okay they are </connor>
<connor> let's find out who's going to be roasted </connor>
<joey> and the first one is oh it's gone it's </joey>
<garnt> gone oh it's me </garnt>
<connor> okay i guess we're moving okay start </connor>
<connor> starting things off easy i see i can't </connor>
<connor> wait this is going to be fun </connor>
<garnt> is there anything you boys expect on </garnt>
<connor> this gaming list i have a film that </connor>
<connor> league is going to be on there </connor>
<joey> i have a few yeah uh as far as anything </joey>
<connor> else goes </connor>
<connor> league i expect to be on there right um </connor>
<connor> i don't know what other games you've </connor>
<garnt> played you never talk about video games </garnt>
<connor> i don't talk about video games often do </connor>
<garnt> i you're like you're like hentai </garnt>
<garnt> anime hentai anime video games what </garnt>
<connor> video games do i </connor>
<connor> i swear to god if fate is on here i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna be sure i'm gonna be so </connor>
<garnt> angry if fake grand order is on </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i didn't put fate on here because </garnt>
<connor> i mean i i play i </connor>
<connor> don't think about putting i did put i </connor>
<connor> don't know i did think </connor>
<connor> about putting not fate but uh genjin </connor>
<joey> impact on there </joey>
<connor> okay yeah i was really really [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> into it </garnt>
<joey> in your life okay well then you want to </joey>
<joey> go through the nine games you have all </joey>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> starting at the top mass effect 3 tales </garnt>
<garnt> of symphonia </garnt>
<garnt> persona 5 zelda wind waker liga legends </garnt>
<garnt> super mario sunshine metal gear solid 3 </garnt>
<garnt> subnautica gears of war 2. i look at </garnt>
<garnt> this and i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> this is the most random [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> game not expecting like half of the </joey>
<garnt> games you put on here i honestly i </garnt>
<joey> expected myself to put more anime games </joey>
<joey> on and i'm just realizing </joey>
<joey> what i haven't really finished any games </joey>
<joey> i mean the only real anime games on here </joey>
<joey> is probably </joey>
<joey> symphonia and persona right yeah and </joey>
<garnt> those are the only like i'm thinking </garnt>
<garnt> what other anime type game series are </garnt>
<garnt> there </garnt>
<joey> uh that are famous because when i think </joey>
<joey> of anime video games i'm just like tail </joey>
<garnt> series persona series yeah </garnt>
<garnt> uh those are the only anime video games </garnt>
<connor> yeah i got like 20 something hours in </connor>
<joey> and i was like wow </joey>
<joey> 20 hours into a jlpg yeah that's </joey>
<connor> impressive i was like this is </connor>
<connor> so boring literally like </connor>
<joey> all the fights of the [ __ ] stuff yeah </joey>
<garnt> welcome to jrpg </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i'm completely okay so here's </garnt>
<garnt> the thing for the longest time </garnt>
<garnt> i've really really tried to get into </garnt>
<garnt> jrpgs like as a kid the reason the </garnt>
<garnt> reason tales is on here </garnt>
<connor> is that as a kid i like i knew i would </connor>
<connor> love jrpgs and like the </connor>
<connor> aesthetic and the story and everything </connor>
<connor> because i love anime yeah the problem is </connor>
<connor> i hated turn-based battles like </connor>
<connor> i i couldn't [ __ ] stand turn-based </connor>
<connor> battles and that would like put me off </connor>
<connor> getting more than </connor>
<connor> say five hours into any jrpg because i </connor>
<connor> would just get turned off by the </connor>
<garnt> turn-based battles </garnt>
<garnt> and so i was like as a kid i was waiting </garnt>
<garnt> for a game that was an anime game </garnt>
<garnt> that just did not have a turn-based </garnt>
<garnt> battle system and also random encounters </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] hate random encounters as well </connor>
<connor> okay right </connor>
<joey> wait wait okay you say that though but </joey>
<garnt> persona 5 is literally that i know okay </garnt>
<garnt> persona 5 </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't have random encounters but </garnt>
<garnt> persona 5 is literally the game </garnt>
<connor> that broke jrpgs for me because i mean </connor>
<connor> even as someone who hasn't played it or </connor>
<connor> plays jrpgs it's still that grpg that i </connor>
<joey> look at and i'm like </joey>
<joey> i know that's a good game like i don't </joey>
<joey> need to play it to know that's a good </joey>
<joey> thing yeah yeah you just look at it </joey>
<joey> i won't play it but yeah yeah like i can </joey>
<joey> see everything about it that this is a </joey>
<joey> banger of a game </joey>
<joey> i'm not gonna play it because i don't </joey>
<garnt> own a console that can play it and </garnt>
<connor> honestly do i want to get into that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> no but it's like a [ __ ] good game </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> with persona 5 um i don't know it was </garnt>
<garnt> it's the only turn-based battle game </garnt>
<garnt> where i just didn't get bored of the </garnt>
<garnt> battle system and i don't know why it's </garnt>
<garnt> something i think it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's the theme man it's it's it's it's a </garnt>
<garnt> bit of everything right because it just </garnt>
<garnt> it's really good at tricking your mind </garnt>
<garnt> into thinking that this isn't turn-based </garnt>
<garnt> battle </garnt>
<connor> that's that's the best way i can </connor>
<connor> describe which is like the sexiest </connor>
<connor> animations alive </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it's just got like so </garnt>
<garnt> many colors the music [ __ ] slaps </garnt>
<garnt> um you can like you get different </garnt>
<joey> abilities as you go on and i don't know </joey>
<joey> like it's it's something it's it's </joey>
<joey> really good at tricking your mind into </joey>
<joey> thinking man this is this just </joey>
<joey> it just feels almost like a rhythm game </joey>
<joey> a point right right you know it's it </joey>
<joey> it's i i can't put my words on why </joey>
<joey> that battle system out of everything </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<connor> trumped any other jrpg battle system um </connor>
<connor> because i can't </connor>
<connor> i can't think of any other jrpg i enjoy </connor>
<connor> even though i even i </connor>
<garnt> i say i'm a jrpg enjoyer right </garnt>
<joey> i have the most basics so then why did </joey>
<garnt> you put tales of symphonia there </garnt>
<garnt> specifically </garnt>
<garnt> tales of symphonia okay so because for </garnt>
<joey> me if i would have put a tails gate </joey>
<joey> because i've played </joey>
<joey> most of the tales games i played one </joey>
<connor> tales game i don't know what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> was happening so if you want to explain </connor>
<connor> to me what it's about because i </connor>
<connor> legitimately don't know anything i'm </connor>
<connor> sure the viewers who haven't played it </connor>
<joey> because if i were to put a tales game on </joey>
<joey> there personally i would have put </joey>
<joey> zysteria on there </joey>
<joey> yeah which one's exterior again series </joey>
<joey> the one after symphonia </joey>
<connor> okay i would have put uh the only one i </connor>
<connor> can think of is vesperia </connor>
<connor> yeah which is which is like i'm just i'm </connor>
<garnt> just throwing out words for connor here </garnt>
<connor> they all sound so similar already </connor>
<connor> mysterious </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's like final fantasy one </garnt>
<garnt> two three four i can follow </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i mean the best way i can </garnt>
<garnt> describe it it's just basically uh </garnt>
<garnt> it's just basically anime as anime the </garnt>
<garnt> video game like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's really that simple jrpgs are </garnt>
<connor> just to me </connor>
<connor> i i know i can get into most grpgs if i </connor>
<connor> like the combat and battle system </connor>
<connor> because it's just anime the video game </connor>
<connor> right and i like anime i'm a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> weeb </connor>
<connor> therefore equation equals you like the </connor>
<connor> tail series yeah yeah right </connor>
<connor> and um the reason tells of symphonia one </connor>
<connor> there was it was my </connor>
<connor> first experience with just realizing </connor>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> whoa you can play a video game and it </garnt>
<garnt> feels like you're watching an anime </garnt>
<garnt> well this is this is amazing what's up </garnt>
<garnt> like i can't i can't believe i've just </garnt>
<garnt> discovered this in my life and i was so </garnt>
<garnt> obsessed with this right because it's um </garnt>
<joey> these are two of the only jrpgs i've </joey>
<joey> ever finished but i was so obsessed with </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> that i got to the 80 point as i do with </joey>
<joey> most video games and then i just </joey>
<joey> stopped playing it and i didn't stop </joey>
<connor> playing it because i got bored </connor>
<connor> i stopped playing it because i didn't </connor>
<connor> want that experience to end </connor>
<connor> i didn't i didn't want to see the end </connor>
<connor> credits and know that that experience </connor>
<connor> is over yeah so like i stopped playing </connor>
<connor> it for about </connor>
<connor> i i held on to that for about two </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] years </connor>
<connor> of my life just just just so just so i </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> that i have i have the ending of tales </connor>
<connor> of symphonia </connor>
<garnt> to look forward to in my life like that </garnt>
<garnt> that was that was like the peak of life </garnt>
<connor> right right </connor>
<connor> off after this you must go to hold a nut </connor>
<joey> you literally blue ball </joey>
<garnt> that's that monk controller kicking in </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> the funny thing is so i'm just like </connor>
<connor> after after about two years i'm like </connor>
<joey> okay i think it's time to complete tales </joey>
<joey> of some phonemes </joey>
<joey> start playing it's time to not yeah i </joey>
<joey> think it's time to finally not start </joey>
<joey> playing </joey>
<connor> start playing it again and then i </connor>
<connor> realize [ __ ] i don't know </connor>
<connor> anything i can't remember anything </connor>
<connor> that's going on yeah so what did i do </connor>
<connor> i just replayed it from the beginning </connor>
<connor> and i was like 80 hours in already </connor>
<connor> um so i put like a good 150 160 hours </connor>
<connor> into this game yeah </connor>
<joey> um persona 5 i actually haven't replayed </joey>
<joey> okay because it's quite long it's quite </joey>
<joey> a long time it's quite a long game and </joey>
<garnt> compared to tales when i was a kid i had </garnt>
<garnt> plenty of time to [ __ ] replay games </garnt>
<connor> back then because i assume persona is </connor>
<connor> probably on your list as well </connor>
<joey> because you yeah oh i've played persona </joey>
<joey> 5 </joey>
<joey> four times you've played it more than me </joey>
<garnt> yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> i remember the reason persona's on there </garnt>
<garnt> is that out of like a lot of games in my </garnt>
<garnt> adult life </garnt>
<garnt> it like for the first time in a long </garnt>
<garnt> time you know </garnt>
<garnt> it felt like i was a kid again and i was </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> uh how how can i how can i put this into </garnt>
<garnt> words when i experienced persona 5 i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> that i could feel this way just just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> being really excited about just being </garnt>
<garnt> really excited about a game and just </garnt>
<garnt> discovering in </garnt>
<garnt> this new world and uh god i i killed my </garnt>
<joey> feelings when i was an adult </joey>
<garnt> and the person five reminded me it </garnt>
<garnt> really did it </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know it was i was just like yo </garnt>
<garnt> this is anime and it's a video game i'm </garnt>
<garnt> enjoying it again it's it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like discovering anime for the first </garnt>
<connor> time again </connor>
<connor> right right and yeah like i i i always i </connor>
<connor> always </connor>
<connor> everyone always told me you know you're </connor>
<connor> like the soda series you're like sony </connor>
<connor> series and i'm just like not a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> word it's got turn-based battles in </connor>
<garnt> there why the [ __ ] would i like that </garnt>
<connor> it's got turn-based battles and then </connor>
<garnt> they are like the worst system of any </garnt>
<connor> combat system in any game </connor>
<connor> like it's like far and beyond one of the </connor>
<connor> few things i can agree on donkey with </connor>
<connor> right you know and that's that's like </connor>
<connor> the big reason why i haven't you know i </connor>
<connor> i couldn't get into a lot of the final </connor>
<garnt> fantasies never played final fantasy 7. </garnt>
<garnt> um i'll probably start playing final </garnt>
<garnt> fantasy 7 remake because that doesn't </garnt>
<connor> have turn-based battles </connor>
<connor> i mean i was telling myself i was going </connor>
<connor> to play final fantasy 7 for like the </connor>
<connor> past 10 years </connor>
<connor> because it's one of those games like i'm </connor>
<joey> going to play it yeah of course i'm </joey>
<joey> going to play it </joey>
<joey> well i mean yeah the time passed yeah </joey>
<joey> but i mean i remember i did boot up </joey>
<connor> final fantasy 7 and the first time i'm </connor>
<connor> on steam and i was like oh the place is </connor>
<joey> the original one yeah i'm like yeah oh </joey>
<connor> it's hideous yeah it looks like </connor>
<connor> absolute [ __ ] i can't do this like cloud </connor>
<joey> with like the egg beat of hands </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah it looks [ __ ] horrible now </connor>
<garnt> yeah because i </garnt>
<garnt> you talked about you know when a new </garnt>
<garnt> hype game comes out then you just drop </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you're playing </garnt>
<garnt> and just start playing that i have like </garnt>
<garnt> the opposite problem i have </garnt>
<garnt> i i don't know what i don't know if </garnt>
<joey> there's an actual term for it i think i </joey>
<joey> i think i'm gonna i'm just gonna coin a </joey>
<joey> term now yeah i get hype fatigue </joey>
<joey> right so so like there are times when i </joey>
<joey> see the </joey>
<joey> i see a new game like announced at e3 or </joey>
<joey> something yeah i see all </joey>
<joey> i i see all like the you know the </joey>
<joey> gameplay and like </joey>
<joey> the developers showing off gameplay </joey>
<joey> footage and trailers and i'm like i like </joey>
<joey> follow through </joey>
<joey> that i'm like super super hyped for this </joey>
<connor> game because i think i'm really really </connor>
<connor> gonna like this game </connor>
<connor> and i get so hype that i kind of hype </connor>
<connor> myself </connor>
<connor> out of it once the game actually comes </connor>
<connor> out like i used all your hype </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's so </connor>
<connor> weird like i was like that with the </connor>
<connor> final fantasy 7 remake </connor>
<connor> because i'm like dude i can finally </connor>
<connor> enjoy final fantasy 7 </connor>
<connor> because it's removed the shitty part </connor>
<connor> that i hate about final fantasy the </connor>
<connor> turn-based combat and the random </connor>
<garnt> encounters </garnt>
<garnt> so in theory i should love this game </garnt>
<garnt> because this is one of the greatest </garnt>
<garnt> jrpgs of all time everyone always talks </garnt>
<garnt> about it </garnt>
<garnt> i was hyped for it to come out i was </garnt>
<garnt> hyped for it for years </garnt>
<connor> and then it came out and then i just was </connor>
<connor> just like maybe i'll play it </connor>
<connor> that's a really good point i think that </connor>
<connor> league of legends killed my ability </connor>
<connor> to get hyped for games yeah because i </connor>
<connor> knew that at the end of the day most of </connor>
<joey> the time i would just return to league </joey>
<joey> of legends </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah so it didn't matter what game </joey>
<joey> came out anyway because i would play it </joey>
<connor> for a week and i'd be like </connor>
<connor> all right back to league yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> and so now </connor>
<connor> even though i don't really play league </connor>
<connor> anymore even when a game that i probably </connor>
<connor> am excited for </connor>
<connor> like is announced or whatever i'm just </connor>
<connor> like while someone's on twitter going </connor>
<connor> through you know like the [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm just like </connor>
<joey> i mean yeah it's like you know when it </joey>
<connor> comes it's kind of like that you know </connor>
<connor> whole thing of like oh like a new </connor>
<connor> restaurant just opened up that </connor>
<connor> everyone's [ __ ] knives about i'll go </connor>
<connor> check it out but then you go have a meal </connor>
<connor> there it might be the best [ __ ] meal </connor>
<connor> of your life but then you know you'll be </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> all right i'm going to mcdonald's </connor>
<connor> tomorrow it's just it's just comfort </connor>
<connor> food right or comfort game yeah it's </connor>
<connor> just like there's always that like </connor>
<connor> fallback of </connor>
<connor> yeah you know this is a cool game and </connor>
<connor> all yeah like i'm sure i'll love it if i </connor>
<connor> just kept going on with it yeah </connor>
<joey> but at the same time it's like i'll i'll </joey>
<connor> just replay this thing </connor>
<connor> i wonder as well if you're into story </connor>
<connor> games more which i think the people who </connor>
<connor> are chasing like the hype are more into </connor>
<connor> story games because when you're a </connor>
<connor> multiplayer gamer </connor>
<connor> yeah mainly like me it's like well i'm </connor>
<connor> just gonna keep playing the same [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<connor> so like why would i get hyped over </connor>
<connor> anything when if there's a new game i'll </connor>
<connor> probably end up switching to it if it's </connor>
<connor> a new multiplayer game yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> so it's kind of hard for me to get </garnt>
<garnt> hacked about because it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> catch-22 for me right because i i really </garnt>
<garnt> value good stories </garnt>
<garnt> in video games but also like especially </garnt>
<garnt> now as an adult i think i just have </garnt>
<connor> commitment issues with games </connor>
<connor> like unless i know that i'm going to be </connor>
<connor> committed to this game for the next week </connor>
<connor> of my life which </connor>
<connor> finding heart finding time to commit to </connor>
<connor> a game for the next week of my life </connor>
<connor> is like a big [ __ ] commitment now it </connor>
<connor> is it is so hard </connor>
<connor> that sometimes i just go back to my </connor>
<connor> comfort food of just like maybe </connor>
<connor> replaying massive </connor>
<connor> like when when cyberpunk got released i </connor>
<garnt> was super super hyped about cyberpunk </garnt>
<garnt> and then it got released and then i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like i don't really feel like </garnt>
<garnt> playing cyberphone i </garnt>
<garnt> and i just started playing mass effect </garnt>
<connor> again </connor>
<connor> because like you might choose your dick </connor>
<garnt> size in mass effect </garnt>
<garnt> because i know the story of mass effect </garnt>
<garnt> i know i'm going to enjoy the story of </garnt>
<garnt> mass effect and </garnt>
<garnt> i know but i i think over like </garnt>
<garnt> pre-overexposure in terms of like gaming </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> is a big thing for me because a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> people hype up games to know to no end </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think that people i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> in anime at least this is as big of a </garnt>
<garnt> problem </garnt>
<garnt> or as big of like a thing where people </garnt>
<garnt> do you know people get hyped about </garnt>
<garnt> anime as it's airing people rarely get </garnt>
<garnt> hyped about anime or super super hyped </garnt>
<garnt> about anime before it starts airing but </garnt>
<garnt> with video games </garnt>
<garnt> you have years and years to like pump </garnt>
<connor> yourself up </connor>
<connor> for this game cyberpunk hyping up right </connor>
<connor> it was ridiculous </connor>
<connor> i am surprised though that i wasn't </connor>
<connor> expecting </connor>
<connor> i thought i was gonna be the only </connor>
<connor> nintendo simp on this </connor>
<connor> at this table so i'm glad that you have </connor>
<joey> at least like a couple of nintendo games </joey>
<connor> here okay okay okay </connor>
<connor> so let me ask you this was wind wake </connor>
<garnt> your first zelda </garnt>
<garnt> it was the first zelda that i finished </garnt>
<connor> that's normally how it goes yeah that's </connor>
<connor> usually </connor>
<joey> cause my favorite was like twilight </joey>
<joey> princess and i know that it's not the </joey>
<connor> best one because i think breath of the </connor>
<joey> wild is better than twilight princess </joey>
<joey> yeah but twilight prince is still </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> so yeah but i saw a game but it's only </connor>
<joey> because i like i think that was the </joey>
<joey> first one that i finished </joey>
<joey> like when you finish a zelda game </joey>
<joey> there's something about it that feels </joey>
<connor> like so </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah you're a kid yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i i it was like really hard for me </garnt>
<garnt> to pick between </garnt>
<garnt> wind waker and uh breath of the wild i </garnt>
<connor> was [ __ ] obsessed with breath of the </connor>
<connor> wild when i when it came out because i </connor>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> when i started getting into breath of </connor>
<connor> the wild um was </connor>
<connor> the first time that i came to japan with </connor>
<connor> sydney the first time </connor>
<connor> the first time i met you um and i </connor>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> like i had a great time in japan first </connor>
<connor> time in japan of course you can have a </connor>
<connor> great [ __ ] time but i remember no </connor>
<joey> matter how many times </joey>
<joey> no matter how many times i went to </joey>
<joey> archibald no matter how many times we </joey>
<joey> hung out and everything </joey>
<joey> at the back of my mind i was just like i </joey>
<joey> kind of just want to go </joey>
<connor> i could be playing breath of the wild </connor>
<connor> right now </connor>
<joey> like i'm just like you know [ __ ] joey </joey>
<joey> man like oh come on come on joey </joey>
<garnt> you're good but are you breath of the </garnt>
<joey> wild dude i don't know about that </joey>
<joey> you could have said that to my face i </joey>
<joey> would have been like you know what i </joey>
<connor> ain't mad i kind of agree </connor>
<connor> i don't have to agree with you there to </connor>
<garnt> be fair though i wasn't expecting </garnt>
<garnt> sunshine for some reason </garnt>
<garnt> okay out of all you don't seem like a </garnt>
<garnt> sunshine player why don't i seem like a </garnt>
<joey> sunshine no i don't know you just don't </joey>
<joey> you two don't seem like nintendo game i </joey>
<joey> know i know you're not but </joey>
<joey> you definitely don't seem like that </joey>
<garnt> because i think </garnt>
<connor> uh the only re the the only nintendo </connor>
<connor> games out on here are like my childhood </connor>
<joey> nintendo games </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah because i was definitely a </connor>
<connor> nintendo kid i i was such nintendo simp </connor>
<connor> when i was a kid </connor>
<connor> yeah i i was like i i didn't i never </connor>
<connor> owned </connor>
<connor> any other console apart from the nes </connor>
<connor> super nest </connor>
<connor> n64 gamecube and it was only after </connor>
<connor> gamecube that i finally ventured out </connor>
<connor> which i </connor>
<connor> which is why i just didn't own a wii </connor>
<connor> right and i think since then the switch </connor>
<connor> is the first nintendo console i actually </connor>
<connor> owned right and so </connor>
<connor> i still i still like out of all the </connor>
<garnt> nintendo games </garnt>
<garnt> these two pop outs me as the ones that i </garnt>
<joey> think they're </joey>
<joey> like the most popular honestly </joey>
<joey> it's like most popular 3d mario and most </joey>
<connor> popular 3d zelda </connor>
<connor> i mean i think wind waker is great i </connor>
<connor> think </connor>
<connor> ah you could you could pick wind waker </connor>
<connor> or breath the wild as number one and i </connor>
<connor> i'd be i you know i can't hate on both </connor>
<connor> right because i mean at the end of the </connor>
<garnt> day but like </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of people who grew up my age </garnt>
<garnt> they put ocarina of time and </garnt>
<joey> i you know i i'm not gonna lie i don't </joey>
<joey> understand the hype </joey>
<garnt> no i played okay okay i thought no i i </garnt>
<garnt> kind of got bored of ocarina of time </garnt>
<connor> like i kind of did it </connor>
<connor> it's like how like i think wind waker </connor>
<connor> again it's like the art style right when </connor>
<connor> wicket aged [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> fantastically mm-hmm ocarina did not age </connor>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> like you played that [ __ ] now it is like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] impossible to play </joey>
<joey> like i've always said like ocarina of </joey>
<joey> time for the zelda franchise is a lot </joey>
<connor> like final fantasy 7 for the final </connor>
<connor> fantasy franchise where it's like </connor>
<connor> because it was the first 3d game yeah </connor>
<connor> after a long succession of 2d games </connor>
<connor> obviously when the 3d like [ __ ] was </connor>
<connor> starting right it was impressive right </connor>
<garnt> so people immediately were like it's in </garnt>
<joey> 3d yeah </joey>
<connor> automatically 10 out of 10. i also </connor>
<connor> didn't grow up with it so </connor>
<joey> you know i i ended up playing it later </joey>
<joey> oh yeah </joey>
<joey> even like now right to me when i you </joey>
<connor> know who i've played all the games </connor>
<connor> from wind waker onwards i just think </connor>
<connor> like when i'm looking at </connor>
<connor> ocarina of time like you know majora's </connor>
<joey> mess looks so much more interesting oh </joey>
<joey> yeah in like every single way this game </joey>
<connor> looks [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> weird i agree yeah it's so cool but like </joey>
<connor> have you ever played majora's mask </connor>
<connor> i did like about two hours and then i </connor>
<connor> was like [ __ ] this is so hard </connor>
<joey> mcdonald's lasts as hard as [ __ ] it's </joey>
<connor> really hard no i would 100 prefer </connor>
<connor> playing majora's mask over ocarina of </connor>
<connor> time just because like </connor>
<joey> again like it's well i mean for for one </joey>
<joey> both are hard as [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah it's not like playing it on the </connor>
<connor> emulator i don't know why someone feels </connor>
<connor> wrong about playing nintendo 64. yeah </connor>
<joey> because i have majora's mask </joey>
<connor> on like because i have like a proper </connor>
<connor> ncaa yeah i know you and i have majora's </connor>
<connor> mask </connor>
<connor> yeah and it's like i don't know the </connor>
<connor> feeling is kind of the same to me </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know maybe it's like yeah i </connor>
<connor> want to go back and play them </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but again like i don't </connor>
<connor> understand people who are like ocarina </connor>
<connor> of time is the greatest zelda game i'm </connor>
<connor> like i'm sorry </connor>
<connor> it's not it's not it hasn't i'm going to </connor>
<connor> get a whole lot </connor>
<garnt> about this but it's the look i've i've </garnt>
<joey> publicly said </joey>
<joey> that yeah i'm sorry but final fantasy </joey>
<connor> vii is not the best </connor>
<connor> again it's what combo bebop is to </connor>
<connor> animate right it's like it's the one </connor>
<connor> that's what it is that's what it is it's </connor>
<connor> like it's the one you probably watched </connor>
<garnt> first it's the one that probably got </garnt>
<garnt> you into the franchise or yeah to the </garnt>
<joey> medium right yeah but that doesn't mean </joey>
<garnt> it's the best yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i agree because these might be </garnt>
<garnt> the ones from my childhood that </garnt>
<garnt> you know i have the fondest memories of </garnt>
<garnt> but they weren't the first zelda or </garnt>
<garnt> mario that i played in my life </garnt>
<joey> i'm surprised you didn't have uh super </joey>
<joey> mario 64 on there because </joey>
<connor> you're such a boomer these aren't boomer </connor>
<garnt> pics </garnt>
<connor> where are your boomer pigs these are way </connor>
<joey> too neat because the thing is i'm not </joey>
<connor> i'm not like a </connor>
<connor> super massive mario fan i i did you know </connor>
<connor> i have i have completed </connor>
<connor> 64 completed sunshine completed what's </connor>
<connor> the most recent mario game </connor>
<connor> honestly honestly i mean i completed </connor>
<connor> them not got all the shiny </connor>
<connor> shines or you know but i got to the end </connor>
<connor> game beat bowser the final time </connor>
<connor> yeah um so you know i have completed </connor>
<garnt> them but </garnt>
<garnt> out of all the marios that i've played </garnt>
<garnt> i just think there's something about </garnt>
<garnt> sunshine you know you know when you </garnt>
<garnt> think back to a game and it just it just </garnt>
<garnt> vibes with you like like look the </garnt>
<connor> feeling just vibes yeah </connor>
<connor> that's sunshine i feel like sunshine is </connor>
<connor> just clean okay </connor>
<connor> it's literally in the name sunshine okay </connor>
<connor> if you couldn't tell i'm a bit of a </connor>
<connor> summer kid right </connor>
<connor> i mean we've had many arguments about </connor>
<garnt> this where like i </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] does that does that mean </joey>
<joey> anything though it does just because i </joey>
<joey> like the winter i'm not gonna go get </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> mario at the [ __ ] winter olympics all </joey>
<connor> right he's playing he's playing [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> mario 64 gets to the snow level turns it </connor>
<garnt> off </garnt>
<garnt> no no that is exactly what happens </garnt>
<joey> you guys call me </joey>
<connor> you know you know there are some levels </connor>
<connor> out there where you you hit you hit her </connor>
<garnt> and you're just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's this level again like every </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] water level in any [ __ ] video </garnt>
<joey> game of all time but i'm not like oh </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] you know what's one thing i </joey>
<joey> hate about the stage the weather i've </joey>
<garnt> never been like literally like that </garnt>
<garnt> like what's wrong with you no like when </garnt>
<garnt> i played mario sunshine </garnt>
<garnt> and like i i loved it because every </garnt>
<joey> level is like </joey>
<joey> every level gives off that summer </joey>
<joey> feeling and that summer vibe </joey>
<joey> which i [ __ ] love yeah and it's like </joey>
<joey> the the ones i hated the levels that i </joey>
<joey> hated the most </joey>
<joey> in mario sunshine were like the boo </joey>
<joey> levels something where it's like dark </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> scary level [ __ ] yeah the pachinko </joey>
<joey> level is the [ __ ] one </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but like for the most part </joey>
<joey> it's it gives off a very summery vibe </joey>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> i think back to that i'm just like yeah </connor>
<connor> i [ __ ] with this i'm </connor>
<joey> it just makes me happy it gives me the </joey>
<joey> good feeling oh i get that i get that </joey>

<connor> uh i mean i'll i'm not i'll happily say </connor>
<garnt> that this is super vanilla um </garnt>
<joey> i mean it's also just interesting </joey>
<joey> because it's like i think it's because </joey>
<joey> we just </joey>
<joey> never [ __ ] talk about the games that </joey>
<joey> we're into so like i never expected like </joey>
<connor> subnautica </connor>
<joey> like gears war to be there yeah what the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] why okay i love [ __ ] gears of </connor>
<garnt> war </garnt>
<garnt> why is it on your list okay so i </garnt>
<garnt> i had a hard choice putting my not yeah </garnt>
<garnt> my last three </garnt>
<garnt> um so gears of war is on there because </garnt>
<garnt> it is the first multiplayer game that's </garnt>
<garnt> it was the game </garnt>
<garnt> that is on there because that's how i </garnt>
<garnt> discovered online gaming </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like matt gears of war was </garnt>
<garnt> a good [ __ ] online game no dude it </garnt>
<connor> was clean </connor>
<garnt> yeah and honestly gears of war 2 was </garnt>
<garnt> really the first game where i was like </garnt>
<connor> whoa video games can like make me sad </connor>
<connor> wait what oh the story is okay no i </connor>
<connor> didn't give a [ __ ] about the story the </connor>
<connor> story's so </connor>
<connor> good i don't even think i finished that </connor>
<connor> why am i what are we swapping </connor>
<connor> bro this story is so good i literally </connor>
<garnt> put this on here because </garnt>
<garnt> like i had such a hard time because i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like i didn't give a [ __ ] about the </garnt>
<garnt> story i didn't understand there's one </garnt>
<joey> thing i remember about geez award too </joey>
<connor> it's the story the story is so </connor>
<garnt> i remember this again it doesn't count </garnt>
<garnt> as spoilers anymore it's so [ __ ] old </garnt>
<garnt> yeah what's the story again um the </garnt>
<connor> locusts are taking over the earth and </connor>
<connor> they're basically stopping them etc etc </connor>
<garnt> i mean that's basically like the wow no </garnt>
<connor> no </connor>
<garnt> because there was like the there were </garnt>
<connor> the two duo who you're following which </connor>
<connor> is uh </connor>
<garnt> i just remember one guy trying to look </garnt>
<joey> for his wife or something that was the </joey>
<connor> sad part </connor>
<joey> and then he like finds it but then he </joey>
<joey> didn't find it it was like an illusion </joey>
<joey> and then i'm like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i was like i was like 13. i was like i'm </joey>
<joey> like what this is </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] massive lead hit of a </joey>
<joey> character just like breaks down in the </joey>
<garnt> battlefield i'm just like oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> i was just like this is the first game </garnt>
<garnt> when i'm just like oh chainsaw </garnt>
<connor> that's how it gets you in right so giza </connor>
<garnt> will get you in with the chainsaw go </garnt>
<garnt> bruh </garnt>
<connor> super manly men and then 10 minutes in </connor>
<connor> you're [ __ ] crying and you're like </connor>
<garnt> whoa what's happening </garnt>
<garnt> no no for me the one memory i hold for </garnt>
<connor> gears of war two the multiplayer </connor>
<connor> is just the sound you the sound it makes </connor>
<joey> when you pop a guy's head off with a </joey>
<connor> sniper like </connor>
<joey> yeah i played two yeah like that was i </joey>
<garnt> think that soul </garnt>
<garnt> sound and i don't know why it was so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] satisfying because it was </garnt>
<connor> it was like literally cracking an egg </connor>
<connor> well i mean those those those shotguns </connor>
<connor> are like still there's like no </connor>
<connor> multiplayer experience like the online </connor>
<garnt> and gears of war </garnt>
<connor> it's just shotguns yeah yeah yeah like </connor>
<connor> that's like the meta it's like you have </connor>
<connor> to run up to people and shotgun each </connor>
<garnt> other yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> okay the shotgun was also really </garnt>
<garnt> satisfying when you got like a point </garnt>
<connor> blank and </connor>
<connor> the body just explodes yeah my god like </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> like you're the monkey brain but that </connor>
<garnt> was like the first time i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> okay i i i enjoy this now this is fun uh </garnt>
<connor> it was really sex i think uh gears of </connor>
<connor> war got plagued by the fact that there </connor>
<connor> was just like a </connor>
<connor> like uh there would always be like uh </connor>
<connor> two really [ __ ] god tier </connor>
<garnt> players in the game that could just </garnt>
<garnt> dominate the whole lobby yeah so it just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of became </garnt>
<garnt> not fun after a while if you weren't </garnt>
<connor> like a pro yeah you just get [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> destroyed by the like good players i def </joey>
<connor> i didn't play on i didn't play online </connor>
<garnt> gears of war two a lot because </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't know what console was it on </garnt>
<connor> again 360. three years because i didn't </connor>
<connor> own a 360 because yeah i played at my </connor>
<connor> friend's place a lot just like land </connor>
<connor> multiplayer and that was like really </connor>
<connor> really fun but yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i probably from the sounds of it i </joey>
<joey> probably wouldn't enjoy it online </joey>
<garnt> no you probably wouldn't now i mean it </garnt>
<joey> was me discovering </joey>
<joey> what multiplayer meant and before i </joey>
<garnt> started hating okay </garnt>
<garnt> gears of war started my love for </garnt>
<garnt> multiplayer games league of legends </garnt>
<connor> killed it </connor>
<garnt> okay league of legends </garnt>
<garnt> is in the middle because i think out of </garnt>
<garnt> out out of all these games </garnt>
<garnt> i have probably played league of legends </garnt>
<garnt> the most right not proud to admit it </garnt>
<garnt> um but the reason it's on there is </garnt>
<garnt> because i think </garnt>
<garnt> the honeymoon period of league of </garnt>
<garnt> legends for me was probably </garnt>
<garnt> the best gaming experience of my life </garnt>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> really long for me as well i'm just like </connor>
<joey> like two years long that's a long </joey>
<joey> honeymoon </joey>
<garnt> dude when you get into that game and </garnt>
<connor> it's going well it feels so fun yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's great it's so fun to get into </garnt>
<garnt> it's just it's hard yeah because the </garnt>
<garnt> problem is now i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> multiplayer games just aren't fun unless </garnt>
<garnt> you are getting into it </garnt>
<garnt> immediately as it's released right </garnt>
<garnt> because the problem the problem with </garnt>
<garnt> multiplayer games i found now </garnt>
<garnt> is that you have a new game and that's </garnt>
<connor> when a new game just gets released </connor>
<connor> that's the fun part because nobody </connor>
<connor> nobody really knows how to be good at </connor>
<connor> the game </connor>
<connor> everyone's just kind of like really </connor>
<connor> discovering what </connor>
<connor> works and what doesn't everyone's just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] having fun yeah and then you get </connor>
<connor> to a point in multiplayer </connor>
<garnt> where people just realize how to </garnt>
<garnt> optimize the fun out of the game the </garnt>
<connor> sweaty boys </connor>
<joey> that's what happened with like fortnight </joey>
<joey> honestly like honestly like </joey>
<joey> me all memes aside fortnight was so fun </joey>
<connor> when it first came out yeah </connor>
<connor> it blew up and then when i got to the </connor>
<connor> point where everyone would like build a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] mortgage right in front of your </joey>
<joey> eyes within 10 seconds and you couldn't </joey>
<connor> do anything it's like well this is just </connor>
<connor> not fun anymore </connor>
<garnt> i don't have the dexterity of like a </garnt>
<connor> chimp on cr on like coke right like </connor>
<garnt> how am i supposed to do this yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember like i really really </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] enjoyed overwatch when it first </connor>
<connor> came out yeah me too like i i i never </connor>
<connor> wrote i i didn't make the same mistake </connor>
<connor> of trying to do ranked um </connor>
<connor> because because i'd learned from league </connor>
<connor> of legends but even just playing </connor>
<connor> casually i really really [ __ ] enjoyed </connor>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<garnt> and then they got to a point when even </garnt>
<garnt> in casual games </garnt>
<garnt> you weren't allowed to have fun anymore </garnt>
<connor> you got this the same the same </connor>
<connor> uh the same heroes exchange of hanzo </connor>
<garnt> i mean i i i would fully admit i was </garnt>
<connor> like a genji main because i was a dirty </connor>
<connor> leaf </connor>
<connor> and the reason i played genji was </connor>
<connor> because i [ __ ] sucked at genji </connor>
<connor> but like the one the one time out of ten </connor>
<connor> where i i didn't alt and it actually </connor>
<connor> worked out that was the reason </connor>
<connor> i played genji like nine out of ten </connor>
<connor> times i would completely flunk it i </connor>
<connor> would fail i would get killed straight </connor>
<connor> away </connor>
<connor> but that one time that one time when it </connor>
<connor> worked out i that </connor>
<connor> that that's what i lived for man and </connor>
<connor> because of that i was one of the most </connor>
<connor> talked </connor>
<connor> i wasn't the most toxic ones but i was i </connor>
<connor> was that one genji on your team </connor>
<connor> that probably threw you the magic i was </connor>
<connor> that i was that person did you talk [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> to your teammates </connor>
<connor> i didn't talk i'm not a toxic gamer </connor>
<connor> funnily enough i'm just like </connor>
<connor> oh come on guys we can do it if we are </connor>
<connor> all put together </connor>
<garnt> we can win with the power of friendship </garnt>
<connor> come on guys oh my god </connor>
<connor> and ranked you had to get to start like </connor>
<connor> shouting at people get them to shut up </connor>
<connor> i'm just like i'm just like that guy who </connor>
<connor> just goes mutual and just does my own </connor>
<connor> thing </connor>
<connor> yeah i do that sometimes too i mean i i </connor>
<connor> play it as closely as </connor>
<connor> a single-player game as i can because um </connor>
<garnt> like playing online game just makes me </garnt>
<garnt> makes you realize how [ __ ] how much i </garnt>
<garnt> hate people </garnt>
<connor> people are the worst especially in </connor>
<connor> competitive ones right that's why like </connor>
<connor> but in japan it's so weird because like </connor>
<joey> people just don't smack talk </joey>
<joey> at all they don't know how to yeah they </joey>
<garnt> should like </garnt>
<garnt> and most you'll get passive aggression </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i'd probably i'd probably </garnt>
<connor> enjoy japanese comparison </connor>
<garnt> no one talks unless you talk to them </garnt>
<garnt> because i play in the league servers in </garnt>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<garnt> and like ninety percent of them are just </garnt>
<garnt> chinese smurfs yeah so of course they're </garnt>
<connor> like toxic as [ __ ] you know </connor>
<garnt> yeah so i don't really play anymore </garnt>
<garnt> because it's just like you can't [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> have fun in league of legends </connor>
<connor> it's just like a korean chinese </connor>
<connor> playground but they're like oh let's go </connor>
<connor> and [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] with the japanese players who </connor>
<garnt> are suck at this game yeah it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> literally just </garnt>
<garnt> it's literally it's just the playground </garnt>
<garnt> where the school bullies go to to just </garnt>
<garnt> like bully like this </garnt>
<garnt> they're just like lebron james coming </garnt>
<garnt> down to the elementary match </garnt>
<connor> to start dunking you know you feel like </connor>
<connor> you suck </connor>
<joey> metal gear whatever i mean that's good </joey>
<connor> you can't what can i say </connor>
<joey> yeah no one can complain about that i </joey>
<garnt> mean you could put any metal gear in </garnt>
<garnt> there it would have been good </garnt>
<garnt> i mean for me like do you know do you </garnt>
<garnt> know the reason i enjoyed metal gear </garnt>
<garnt> why because i i've played all metal </garnt>
<joey> gears it's in </joey>
<joey> except for metal gear five really </joey>
<joey> apparently the best one in terms of </joey>
<joey> gameplay </joey>
<joey> it is the best one i have really no </joey>
<joey> kind of once to play it exclusive the </joey>
<connor> hype fatigue </connor>
<garnt> no no no no okay i get it you feel like </garnt>
<connor> you had your film no i i didn't have my </connor>
<connor> feel like i was hype as [ __ ] for it and </connor>
<connor> then what is it </connor>
<connor> and then i found out that the story was </connor>
<connor> kind of like incomplete and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like okay </connor>
<connor> well that that that just takes the </connor>
<garnt> reason absolutely middle gear absolutely </garnt>
<connor> more incomplete by not playing it yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah that doesn't make any sense </joey>
<connor> it's it's not finished and i haven't </connor>
<connor> finished it so i'm not gonna do any more </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't deserve my time okay like how </garnt>
<garnt> how do you feel about this connor </garnt>
<garnt> like when you play have you ever played </garnt>
<connor> metal gear uh </connor>
<connor> no okay none of them uh no because i it </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> i don't know why but like i never really </connor>
<connor> saw it in like the shops </connor>
<connor> probably because it was also on </connor>
<connor> playstation as well right i had </connor>
<connor> playstation 2 growing up </connor>
<connor> right but yeah for some reason i was </connor>
<connor> probably playing like shrek and spyro </connor>
<connor> and damn [ __ ] like that </connor>
<connor> good choice i was really like yeah when </connor>
<connor> i was uh when i was younger i wasn't </connor>
<connor> attracted at all to like the </connor>
<connor> fps art or like the like military </connor>
<connor> looking stuff </connor>
<connor> right i always went for the childish </connor>
<connor> cartoonish </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah even when i was like 14 15 i </connor>
<connor> would still like to prefer the cartoon </connor>
<connor> anime style over </connor>
<connor> yeah so i i normally avoided those so i </connor>
<joey> was playing like [ __ ] theme park </joey>
<joey> games and [ __ ] when i was like 15. like </joey>
<joey> rollercoaster tycooning </joey>
<joey> well playstation had its like uh its own </joey>
<connor> brand of like these theme park games </connor>
<connor> yeah and i think they're still quite </connor>
<connor> popular on youtube occasionally </connor>
<connor> and you could like you could build the </connor>
<connor> rides and ride them from </connor>
<connor> like pov first person oh wow it was </connor>
<connor> really cool [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> do you know what i'm on about no no i i </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just getting a flashback of memories </garnt>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<garnt> maybe i should have put that on there </garnt>
<garnt> because i've spent far too much time on </garnt>
<garnt> theme park or </garnt>
<connor> yeah theme park and theme hospital yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i i think you know roller coaster </connor>
<connor> tycoon is </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yeah i'm just like [ __ ] man maybe i </garnt>
<garnt> should have put that on my list but uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah in terms of like i never got got </garnt>
<garnt> into the roller coaster tycoon because </garnt>
<garnt> uh theme park had like the voiced person </garnt>
<garnt> telling you what to do </garnt>
<garnt> and i don't know something about having </garnt>
<garnt> someone voiced telling you what to do </garnt>
<connor> was was a big selling point for me was </connor>
<connor> that the one the playstation 2 that i'm </connor>
<garnt> on about </garnt>
<connor> maybe i don't know i don't know i don't </connor>
<garnt> know when we have a break </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but it definitely had a pov option </garnt>
<garnt> where you could build the rides and then </garnt>
<connor> yeah because you could ride it yeah you </connor>
<connor> could and there's like racing games in </connor>
<connor> it so when you built like the racing </connor>
<connor> track you built the track yourself and </connor>
<connor> then you could race around it oh that </connor>
<connor> sounds cool </connor>
<joey> yeah dude it was awesome why am i never </joey>
<joey> heard of this and then like </joey>
<garnt> you could [ __ ] i want to play it now </garnt>
<connor> there was like </connor>
<connor> there was like the the normal park there </connor>
<connor> was like an alien park </connor>
<connor> yeah you remember this and each each </connor>
<connor> world had like </connor>
<connor> different ride things that you could </connor>
<connor> ride and like you you couldn't progress </connor>
<connor> to the next world unless your theme park </connor>
<joey> was x successful </joey>
<joey> that just sounds like rollercoaster </joey>
<joey> tycoon it is like tycoon but like better </joey>
<joey> because like rollercoaster tycoon is </joey>
<connor> pure like top down yeah it's just like </connor>
<connor> you get in there you can walk around </connor>
<connor> your path </connor>
<connor> yeah this is the box art i'm going to </connor>
<connor> find it </connor>
<connor> i know what the box art looks like i </connor>
<connor> think they released other types of games </connor>
<connor> as well but this is the one that like i </connor>
<connor> literally </connor>
<garnt> played to death in the ps2 no i you you </garnt>
<garnt> are you are reminding me now and i'm </garnt>
<connor> just like [ __ ] i didn't play on ps2 i </connor>
<connor> played it on pc </connor>
<connor> it was on pc as well yeah yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> was on pc um [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> nostalgia no because i i [ __ ] loved </connor>
<connor> simulator games like that i can i could </connor>
<connor> never get to the sims but i [ __ ] love </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> sim city theme hospital um </connor>
<connor> rollercoaster tycoon not very close to </connor>
<connor> tycoon uh theme park as you said yeah </connor>
<garnt> god i put so much just hit him with that </garnt>
<garnt> nostalgia oh this is yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so that's why i like i never really </garnt>
<connor> played military games because i would </connor>
<joey> always see like the like the bright </joey>
<connor> light boxes and i think i'm like you </connor>
<connor> know being a [ __ ] 14 15 year old </connor>
<connor> you're like </connor>
<joey> no i was exactly the same when like uh </joey>
<connor> when like heavy rain came </connor>
<connor> out yeah and i looked at the box and i'm </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is that yeah </connor>
<connor> and now i regret not playing it back in </connor>
<joey> the day because much many years later </joey>
<connor> i was like this game's [ __ ] fantastic </connor>
<connor> because like i loved like crash </connor>
<joey> bandicoot </joey>
<joey> so much on the ps2 yeah and like that </joey>
<connor> was the kind of art style that i </connor>
<joey> normally gravitated towards so wow </joey>
<connor> right right like there's so many games </connor>
<connor> you've like yeah even all the spin-offs </connor>
<connor> are crash bandicoot yeah like crash </connor>
<connor> racing </connor>
<connor> uh they had like the mario party s kind </connor>
<joey> of game called like crash bash which i </joey>
<connor> really liked as well i've heard of that </connor>
<connor> even though it's a terrible game right </connor>
<joey> now but i used to play it a bunch and </joey>
<joey> then </joey>
<joey> crash one two and you know </joey>
<connor> the only racing game that could legit </connor>
<joey> compete against mario kart </joey>
<garnt> no no no no no uh what was the uh </garnt>
<connor> did he congratulations diddy kong racing </connor>
<garnt> is up there </garnt>
<garnt> come on really it is up </garnt>
<garnt> the n64 version because that was when it </garnt>
<garnt> could actually compete with </garnt>
<connor> well it was made by rare right yeah you </connor>
<joey> know i could see </joey>
<joey> i remember like 10 year old me going to </joey>
<joey> my friend's place and he had diddy kong </joey>
<garnt> racing on near n64 and i'm like </garnt>
<joey> wait you can ride on aeroplanes yeah and </joey>
<garnt> like boats what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like for me i was really close </garnt>
<connor> putting banjo-kazooie on here </connor>
<connor> oh my god </connor>
<connor> it's good it's good what can i say and </connor>
<connor> uh yeah i don't know like </connor>
<connor> okay so part like a big reason why that </connor>
<connor> i had so few games to pick up </connor>
<connor> to pick from right is because when i </connor>
<connor> really get into game </connor>
<connor> i really get into a game i i </connor>
<connor> wring out as much content as i can out </connor>
<garnt> of that game </garnt>
<garnt> every side quest every little piece of </garnt>
<garnt> dialogue i play it to death so i can get </garnt>
<garnt> everything like with let's say so with </garnt>
<garnt> metal gear </garnt>
<garnt> right so there would be times where you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> are you familiar with the codec calls </garnt>
<connor> they would like call you up and be like </connor>
<garnt> yeah snake </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah exactly so so one one of the </garnt>
<garnt> big criticisms of metal gear when you </garnt>
<garnt> know i was playing it and you know when </garnt>
<garnt> it was like really really big was </garnt>
<garnt> people hated the cut scenes how long the </garnt>
<garnt> cut scenes were people hated </garnt>
<garnt> the fact that you had to go through all </garnt>
<garnt> these codec calls </garnt>
<garnt> i [ __ ] love that [ __ ] man i'm like </garnt>
<connor> i'm like holy [ __ ] there's an hour cut </connor>
<garnt> scene be right back getting the popcorn </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> this is the most epic gameplay i could </garnt>
<connor> ever hope for was metal gears </connor>
<connor> three the one with like psycho mantis is </connor>
<garnt> that the one it was that was the first </garnt>
<garnt> one that was a photo </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the first one was like the top down </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> nes one i don't know i mean that's metal </connor>
<connor> gear that's metal gear not metal gear </connor>
<connor> solid </connor>
<connor> solid yeah yeah yeah because like every </connor>
<garnt> time i watch because i've watched tons </garnt>
<garnt> of </garnt>
<connor> videos about metal gear and every time i </connor>
<connor> watch it i'm like [ __ ] i wish i got this </connor>
<connor> when i was a kid because </connor>
<garnt> it looks badass it was [ __ ] badass </garnt>
<connor> and but the thing the thing is like okay </connor>
<connor> so there's metal gear and there's tails </connor>
<garnt> as well tails has </garnt>
<garnt> this feature right i mean you play the </garnt>
<garnt> tails game yeah how did you think about </garnt>
<garnt> the skits feature </garnt>
<garnt> or skits what was that </garnt>
<connor> okay oh wait is this what you talk with </connor>
<connor> the character and like the fire emblem </connor>
<connor> thing </connor>
<connor> what wait what where you interact with </connor>
<garnt> characters no am i crazy </garnt>
<garnt> kind of so in intel's games they have </garnt>
<garnt> this thing called </garnt>
<garnt> skits right where you'll be walking </garnt>
<garnt> around and then you press like the </garnt>
<connor> select button when they give you a </connor>
<connor> prompt right </connor>
<connor> and it would just be characters talking </connor>
<connor> to each other </connor>
<connor> oh yeah i'd never i'd always see this i </connor>
<connor> didn't do it </connor>
<connor> so like i was probably the one [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> person </connor>
<connor> who just hit every skit button like i i </connor>
<connor> don't care what </connor>
<connor> what time i'm in what like at which </connor>
<connor> point of the story </connor>
<joey> i would just like i literally played </joey>
<joey> tails and i literally like </joey>
<joey> there are some skits that are only that </joey>
<joey> that only happen </joey>
<joey> at certain areas of the map which are </joey>
<joey> like some areas of the map you literally </joey>
<joey> have to walk </joey>
<joey> on the other side of the map and there </joey>
<joey> was no like quick well this is a big </joey>
<joey> boulder huh </joey>
<joey> yeah it sure is it literally doesn't </joey>
<joey> mean [ __ ] yeah and it literally doesn't </joey>
<connor> mean [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i [ __ ] love that feature i don't know </connor>
<connor> man i </connor>
<connor> like because here's the if i love the </connor>
<joey> characters and i love the world i'm </joey>
<joey> i'm getting every kind of like i'm </joey>
<joey> getting kind of interacting with </joey>
<joey> same thing with mass effect when people </joey>
<joey> talk about how much they love mass </joey>
<joey> effect </joey>
<connor> they talk about oh you know the </connor>
<connor> character writing and </connor>
<connor> you know the well not so much the </connor>
<connor> gameplay anymore but like the world </connor>
<connor> and the characters that uh of mass </connor>
<connor> effect </connor>
<connor> um i was probably i like i remember </connor>
<connor> there's there was one mass effect </connor>
<connor> game play session i had where i </connor>
<connor> literally wasted an hour or two </connor>
<connor> because in mass effects they have this </connor>
<connor> it's not a codec function but like a </connor>
<connor> database function where </connor>
<garnt> they literally have a database of like </garnt>
<garnt> every </garnt>
<garnt> like the history and law of like every </garnt>
<garnt> alien every world </garnt>
<garnt> that you go to so i literally i </garnt>
<garnt> literally spent </garnt>
<garnt> an hour or two of mass effect going </garnt>
<garnt> through the entire database </garnt>
<garnt> and just and just reading the whole law </garnt>
<connor> of mass effect i'd rather not i'd rather </connor>
<connor> not you know </connor>
<garnt> and i [ __ ] loved it i i absolutely </garnt>
<joey> loved it um i can't even shake my head </joey>
<joey> because i used to do that </joey>
<connor> exact same thing without you guys </connor>
<connor> because i want to play a game read a </connor>
<joey> book or some [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] i did i did that recently </joey>
<connor> actually when i played xenoblade 2 for </connor>
<connor> the first time </connor>
<connor> and there's this like there's this part </connor>
<connor> where like every monster you encounter </connor>
<connor> has like a full page about like </connor>
<garnt> how it lives and [ __ ] yeah i read </garnt>
<garnt> through all of them i'm like oh okay </garnt>
<joey> so like the zafaros only lives in the </joey>
<garnt> swamps </garnt>
<garnt> like to to me that's that's what really </garnt>
<garnt> makes a video game </garnt>
<garnt> like it's especially because if if i'm </garnt>
<joey> like really into a video game </joey>
<garnt> i'm going to find out everything i can </garnt>
<garnt> about that video game and that's what </garnt>
<joey> like but the thing there's a difference </joey>
<connor> right because i like </connor>
<connor> when it's just fed to me in video games </connor>
<connor> like people </connor>
<connor> have talked about you know the law of </connor>
<connor> dark souls and everything like that </connor>
<connor> and people have like figured stuff out </connor>
<connor> through the subtle hints that you get </connor>
<connor> through playing the game </connor>
<connor> i'm just like just tell me it just just </connor>
<connor> yeah just just give me exposition this </connor>
<garnt> is the one time where i actually want </garnt>
<connor> exposition </connor>
<connor> you say that all i think about is the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] um the silent hill person </connor>
<joey> who's like um no no sorry so there's </joey>
<connor> like on on silent hill forums </connor>
<joey> there's like where they discuss like </joey>
<connor> what the game's about and stuff yeah it </connor>
<connor> was like a really big </connor>
<connor> thing and a big like like controversial </connor>
<connor> like drama because </connor>
<connor> one of like the main admins who had like </connor>
<connor> some of the most posts on it was like </connor>
<connor> convinced </connor>
<connor> that the main character was circumcised </connor>
<connor> and that was the reason for his like </connor>
<connor> trauma </connor>
<connor> and that he was like gay or something </connor>
<connor> yeah and then he was gay because of it </connor>
<connor> or something like that </connor>
<connor> and so there's this whole like dude like </connor>
<connor> wang made like a 20 minute video about </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> and it's like this whole thing where it </connor>
<connor> was like a massive deal on the forum so </connor>
<connor> they're discussing </connor>
<connor> you know is and then the guy was like </connor>
<connor> you know he was on like a crusade being </connor>
<connor> like no one should be circumcised it </connor>
<joey> causes trauma and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> and it turns like a whole thing and i'm </joey>
<joey> just like this is what people do </joey>
<joey> in my mind i'm like that's people who </joey>
<joey> read story that's what they do </joey>
<joey> they go on forums talk about why the </joey>
<joey> main character is gay and his </joey>
<connor> circumcision was trauma </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah what's wrong with these people </connor>
<connor> play a [ __ ] video game why why are </connor>
<joey> you typing about it </joey>
<joey> i'm not even surprised by that </joey>
<connor> yeah i i that's so like when you when </connor>
<connor> i'm relieved and you like it being </connor>
<joey> like the story being told to you yeah </joey>
<connor> you're like i want to figure it out is </connor>
<joey> my character actually like gay or </joey>
<connor> something </connor>
<connor> let me see circumstance i need to yeah i </connor>
<joey> need to figure it out </joey>
<joey> hideo </joey>
<garnt> which is funny like i'm more than happy </garnt>
<joey> to watch anime where i'm just like oh </joey>
<joey> what's the subtle </joey>
<joey> what's the subject what is the author </joey>
<garnt> trying to say but with gaming i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like nah no patience </garnt>
<joey> just just give me well because you're </joey>
<garnt> already focused on like actually playing </garnt>
<garnt> the game yeah yeah yeah yeah whereas </garnt>
<garnt> like no no i don't need to like i don't </garnt>
<joey> want to like sit here and [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> guess what the story is what i'm trying </joey>
<garnt> to do this convoluted input right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and there's there's also another thing </garnt>
<garnt> that uh also </garnt>
<joey> like it it's gonna be it's gonna sound </joey>
<joey> super weird but sometimes </joey>
<joey> i hate choice in video games i just want </joey>
<joey> a linear game which is which is funny </joey>
<joey> that massive yeah </joey>
<joey> literally the [ __ ] mass effect </joey>
<joey> literally mass effect persona five but </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah mass effect and persona five </joey>
<joey> which are the two like let's say </joey>
<connor> the two uh most choice heavy games yeah </connor>
<joey> two of the most choice every games and </joey>
<joey> the two </joey>
<joey> exceptions the two exceptions to that </joey>
<joey> rule but i have i have this thing i </joey>
<joey> i don't know if i'm the only person who </joey>
<joey> has like gaming fomo where i'm given a </joey>
<joey> choice </joey>
<joey> and and i know that like by by making </joey>
<joey> this choice i'm going to miss out on a </joey>
<joey> certain </joey>
<joey> piece of content oh yeah yeah i hate </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> i hate that so much right because that </joey>
<garnt> means that means </garnt>
<garnt> in the back of my mind i'm just like but </garnt>
<garnt> what if i pick the other choice </garnt>
<connor> and and well that's literally the reason </connor>
<connor> why i replayed persona 5 four times </connor>
<connor> because i was like well there's four </connor>
<connor> choices </connor>
<connor> yeah and i want to see all of them so </connor>
<joey> i'm gonna play it four times to get all </joey>
<connor> the choices </connor>
<connor> i i think it's unfortunate that i i like </connor>
<joey> swore off jrpgs after playing blue </joey>
<joey> dragon </joey>
<joey> not really which i mean i think i've </joey>
<joey> mentioned this before yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah the one that was like i think the </joey>
<joey> main selling point that comments were </joey>
<connor> saying is that it was uh the art was </connor>
<joey> made by the dragon ball uh guy oh yeah </joey>
<joey> toriyama here yeah and like </joey>
<connor> i never encountered this before in a </connor>
<connor> video game and this is what really </connor>
<connor> pissed me off </connor>
<connor> because at this point i was an </connor>
<connor> achievement hunter guy so i would always </connor>
<connor> go in like 100 </connor>
<connor> i would get all all the achievements no </connor>
<connor> matter what yeah this is the first time </connor>
<connor> i encountered the thing where i'm like </connor>
<connor> okay so this story's two hours long or </connor>
<connor> some dumb [ __ ] like that it's </connor>
<connor> ridiculously long </connor>
<connor> yeah and i did it and then i'm like all </connor>
<connor> right how do i get these last few </connor>
<connor> achievements and it'd be like </connor>
<connor> this achievement is on the forum would </connor>
<connor> say this like this achievement is only </connor>
<connor> unlockable by doing this one option in </connor>
<joey> this one mission yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> you can never get this achievement yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah like what </connor>
<connor> what say suck </connor>
<joey> that that's such a jrpg movie and that's </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> that they would do that like what kind </joey>
<joey> of sick [ __ ] does that </joey>
<joey> they're like i don't want anyone to be </joey>
<joey> able to get this achievement make them </joey>
<connor> play the whole [ __ ] like 200 hour </connor>
<connor> game again </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] [ __ ] there's no need to do </connor>
<connor> that why would you do that as a game </connor>
<connor> designer </connor>
<joey> i don't know forget you it's to get you </joey>
<connor> to replay the game right </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean i.e [ __ ] [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> everything i mean </garnt>
<garnt> like the the reason i hate it is because </garnt>
<garnt> it takes it takes enough energy for me </garnt>
<garnt> to finish a game once </garnt>
<garnt> so i'm thinking [ __ ] if i need to replay </garnt>
<garnt> this game i'm just not going to see this </garnt>
<connor> contest </connor>
<connor> right yeah yeah dude if you want to see </connor>
<connor> the shitty turn based combat you should </connor>
<connor> play blue dragon man </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] every time you [ __ ] start a </connor>
<connor> battle the [ __ ] the mute the main </connor>
<connor> song starts playing yeah it's a guy </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] singing it sounds like the </joey>
<joey> pokemon intro </joey>
<joey> and then it takes like 20 seconds of </joey>
<joey> animations where they all like </joey>
<joey> summon their things which is like it's </joey>
<joey> like 20 seconds long before you can even </joey>
<joey> start the [ __ ] turn </joey>
<joey> don't tempt me don't tempt me like that </joey>
<joey> dude i'm excited oh it's [ __ ] garbage </joey>
<joey> and it's toriyama dude that </joey>
<connor> is like right up my alley garbage i also </connor>
<connor> hate in jrpgs that like </connor>
<connor> they give you these characters and like </connor>
<connor> what if you hate the characters that you </connor>
<connor> have to use </connor>
<connor> like in pokemon at least i can swap out </connor>
<joey> you know bulbasaur but like most jrpgs </joey>
<joey> like it's you know like especially with </joey>
<joey> the turn-based ones right it's like you </joey>
<joey> can only have four in the party so </joey>
<joey> just pick your four favorite characters </joey>
<connor> right well this one it was like you only </connor>
<connor> have these guys and they were [ __ ] and </connor>
<connor> annoying characters </connor>
<joey> yeah so it was like what am i supposed </joey>
<joey> to [ __ ] do this game sucks oh that's </joey>
<joey> not a good jlpg </joey>
<joey> and then like one of the main enemies </joey>
<joey> just a snake coiled in like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and the whole joke was that it was a </joey>
<connor> piece of [ __ ] and i'm like yeah </connor>
<joey> that sounds hilarious what it's a piece </joey>
<connor> of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's a metaphor for the game </connor>
<connor> i'm still annoyed about it i completed </connor>
<connor> it and i loved playing it but i </connor>
<connor> literally only played it because </connor>
<joey> it was like i bought this game my mum </joey>
<joey> won't buy me another one so i have to </joey>
<joey> completely </joey>
<connor> i need to play this now i want you to </connor>
<garnt> play just so you can like </garnt>
<garnt> how did you get that game again so what </garnt>
<connor> it was is like you know i don't know if </connor>
<connor> your game stores had this but in the uk </connor>
<connor> they had a </connor>
<garnt> three for 20 pounds pre-owned games oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> so i would basically just go to the </joey>
<joey> thing and buy three games that looked </joey>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and then i would just be </connor>
<connor> forced to play them most of the time </connor>
<joey> they were all like super easy and you </joey>
<joey> had an absolute gold like blue dragon </joey>
<connor> there was like there was like one of </connor>
<connor> each game and there's a whole [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> shelf of blue dragons just like take him </joey>
<connor> take him honestly like for free </connor>
<joey> honestly it comes with the badge was it </joey>
<joey> like a was it like a </joey>
<joey> well-received game at all or like it was </joey>
<connor> very mid-tier like </connor>
<connor> like five out of ten six hours this was </connor>
<connor> my first time ever having to swap discs </connor>
<connor> to progress with the story and that [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> pissed me off holy [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i remember that i just remembered </garnt>
<connor> something all right um </connor>
<connor> okay i get rid of </connor>
<connor> gears of war no that was a good pace </connor>
<connor> that's a good pick no no no </connor>
<connor> subnautica okay i'll get rid of </connor>
<connor> subnautica yeah </connor>
<connor> um i just remembered something uh put </connor>
<connor> fifa09 </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] i just [ __ ] remembered </connor>
<connor> i was [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> i got i was i had a period in my life </garnt>
<garnt> where i was obsessed with fifa </garnt>
<connor> i i am i am not joking also smoking </connor>
<connor> cigarettes on a corner </connor>
<garnt> and flying footy okay this is this is </garnt>
<garnt> during the university </garnt>
<garnt> you know you're you're in a british </garnt>
<connor> university everyone plays are you </connor>
<connor> refused and be like no </connor>
<connor> no i'm gonna play anything else [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> this game </garnt>
<garnt> i just remembered something i i i was </garnt>
<garnt> one of the top 200 players </garnt>
<garnt> of fifa at a point yeah yeah yeah i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not joking </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not joking there's like oh this is </garnt>
<joey> like just giving me flashbacks this is </joey>
<joey> like conor coming out that it used to be </joey>
<joey> like a chord pro </joey>
<garnt> it's like god used to be a female 09 </garnt>
<connor> person so how are you how are you the </connor>
<connor> top 200 how did it work </connor>
<garnt> like rankings yeah it's it's like </garnt>
<garnt> ranking it's it's it's a literal ranking </garnt>
<garnt> system </garnt>
<joey> and i it got to the point where i was </joey>
<joey> just i just got myself on the </joey>
<joey> leaderboards </joey>
<joey> of of fifa that's how i did it </joey>
<joey> because i was just obsessed with the </joey>
<garnt> game and like everyone started playing </garnt>
<garnt> it so i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh i i guess i'll play fifa did you </garnt>
<connor> demolish everyone </connor>
<connor> in like your unidorm yeah pretty much </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> because here's the thing because uh like </garnt>
<joey> my my group of mates um </joey>
<joey> and my unidorm uh they were like super </joey>
<joey> super competitive over fifa right </joey>
<joey> it was like they were like that in mind </joey>
<joey> and this is how you get bragging rights </joey>
<joey> there was two games it was cod and fifa </joey>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> i was just to me it was just like fifa </connor>
<connor> was not like watching football at all </connor>
<connor> fifa was just like </connor>
<connor> the ball goes yeah and um </connor>
<connor> and yeah i don't know i just got really </connor>
<joey> good at it and i don't know how because </joey>
<joey> um yeah i mean just the british in you </joey>
<garnt> yes well yeah there was two games </garnt>
<garnt> because i [ __ ] i i </garnt>
<garnt> i i feel like it was one game where i </garnt>
<garnt> got good at really unintentionally </garnt>
<garnt> and it was probably the only game i've </garnt>
<garnt> ever played in my life that i got good </garnt>
<garnt> at unintentionally </garnt>
<garnt> and i don't really like football that </garnt>
<garnt> much what's wrong with you </garnt>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is wrong with you i don't </joey>
<joey> know 200 in the world </joey>
<joey> like i hate this game </joey>
<garnt> the fact is like i had completely </garnt>
<connor> blanked that from my memory until it was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> just now yeah full time i'm just like </connor>
<connor> how the [ __ ] did that happen how the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] would i get top 200 in </connor>
<connor> in the um yeah i top 200 in fifa and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<garnt> yeah i just played it and i just kept </garnt>
<garnt> ranking up and then i just got really </garnt>
<garnt> bored </garnt>
<garnt> and i stopped playing because and the </garnt>
<garnt> reason i stopped playing was because </garnt>
<garnt> i finished uni and i didn't have a </garnt>
<garnt> reason to play it anymore </garnt>
<garnt> wow no because i remember now how it </garnt>
<joey> started because i got the game literally </joey>
<connor> just to blend in with the normies so i i </connor>
<joey> literally got the game so </joey>
<connor> i could have something to talk to people </connor>
<joey> about at parties right </joey>
<joey> and so i'm one of them he literally </joey>
<joey> bought fifa as a social gimmick </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah so i started playing it </joey>
<joey> so i could like keep up my mates and </joey>
<joey> everything </joey>
<joey> and then i just kind of figured out a </joey>
<joey> meta </joey>
<joey> i guess because you know it's football </joey>
<connor> everyone wants to score goals and then i </connor>
<connor> quickly realized </connor>
<connor> if you just learned how to defend </connor>
<connor> correctly and if you just </connor>
<connor> could defend goods you are better than </connor>
<connor> 90 </connor>
<connor> of players that ever played that game </connor>
<connor> because everyone only wants to score </connor>
<connor> goals and then so after that so i've </connor>
<connor> so after that then i figured out the </connor>
<connor> broken teams and the broken team was </connor>
<connor> barcelona </connor>
<connor> because they were the best team in the </connor>
<connor> world at the time but then so most </connor>
<connor> people were picking barcelona </connor>
<connor> and then i realized that there was a </connor>
<connor> counter to barcelona which was into </connor>
<connor> milan </connor>
<garnt> because inter milan had uh zlatan </garnt>
<garnt> ibrahimovic </garnt>
<garnt> and um he just completely destroyed the </garnt>
<garnt> barcelona defense because </garnt>
<garnt> he couldn't be shaken off the ball </garnt>
<joey> that's the swedish guy right yeah that's </joey>
<garnt> the swedish guy </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah he in the game he was </garnt>
<garnt> completely [ __ ] broken so </garnt>
<garnt> your life here was completely broken so </garnt>
<garnt> then once i realized that i just thought </garnt>
<garnt> i just started like just started beating </garnt>
<garnt> all my mates and then i was just like </garnt>
<connor> you know what let's just let me let's </connor>
<connor> just limit test myself how far i can </connor>
<connor> how far can i get up with this and you </connor>
<connor> know i said top 200 earlier i'm not sure </connor>
<connor> if it's top 200 it's up 300 but like </connor>
<connor> one of the one of the top still </connor>
<connor> impressive yeah yeah one one of the top </connor>
<connor> few hundreds in </connor>
<connor> uh in the game at the time um and i just </connor>
<connor> kept i just kept playing until </connor>
<connor> i stopped climbing and yeah that's </connor>
<connor> that's how far i climbed and then </connor>
<connor> like i just casually told one of my one </connor>
<connor> of my mates that and he's just like have </connor>
<connor> you ever thought about entering </connor>
<connor> competitions or stuff like that and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> no no i don't think i will because </connor>
<connor> because uh yeah i just wanted to make </connor>
<connor> anime reviews and watch anime at the </connor>
<connor> time so i just like </connor>
<garnt> had no interest in playing that game in </garnt>
<connor> my own in my own time takes off adidas </connor>
<connor> tracksuit </connor>
<connor> and uh yeah i just i just remember that </connor>
<garnt> now so uh i don't know what reminds me </garnt>
<connor> of that </connor>
<connor> topic that was like pre the before the </connor>
<connor> uh fifa ultimate team </connor>
<garnt> nonsense yeah that was before fifa </garnt>
<garnt> ultimate i don't know what the [ __ ] is </garnt>
<connor> going on right now </connor>
<connor> yeah so like right now like i think if </connor>
<connor> you want to have </connor>
<connor> a legitimate competitive team in fifa </connor>
<connor> you need a team </connor>
<connor> of a value of around 27 000 real </connor>
<connor> money like dollars jesus that's how much </connor>
<connor> you on average have to spend </connor>
<connor> to have an actual like top competitive </connor>
<connor> team why so all the pros have spent like </connor>
<connor> thirty thousand dollars plus </connor>
<garnt> so okay [ __ ] hell okay just just to </garnt>
<connor> compete this is this is gonna sound so </connor>
<garnt> weird </garnt>
<garnt> after everything i've i've just said um </garnt>
<connor> what's fifa ultimate </connor>
<connor> basically they you know again this is a </connor>
<connor> hundred percent like and imagine an </connor>
<connor> alien describing how humans converge </connor>
<connor> i've never played this myself but </connor>
<connor> obviously i'm a gamer </connor>
<connor> so i like to keep up with games yeah um </connor>
<connor> but yes so essentially one of those is </connor>
<connor> micro transactions like imagine anime </connor>
<connor> like you know </connor>
<connor> because fate you can you go against each </connor>
<connor> other in fate like no p </connor>
<connor> no no so imagine a pvp fate where you </connor>
<connor> can build a team </connor>
<joey> just so happens instead of like you know </joey>
<joey> two or three characters it's like a team </joey>
<joey> of like 11 </joey>
<joey> or whatever it is i think so it's </joey>
<joey> literally fifa gotcha well yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> they're the ones who like this this is </joey>
<joey> the reason why it started like it got so </joey>
<joey> bad like because </joey>
<joey> so it's literally pay to win it's 100 </joey>
<joey> pay to win and so like to even </joey>
<joey> so to be like to be able to compete </joey>
<joey> competitively </joey>
<joey> you have to have it the stacked team to </joey>
<joey> get the stacked team you spend on </joey>
<joey> average like 30 </joey>
<joey> to even have a chance of getting the </joey>
<joey> stacked team dude that's that's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's so [ __ ] and like you you hear </joey>
<joey> even the pros </joey>
<joey> talk about it like there's interviews </joey>
<joey> with them where they're like yeah it's </joey>
<joey> not fun at all </joey>
<joey> like you have to spend this amount of </joey>
<joey> money and everyone's playing the same </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] because everyone has the same </joey>
<joey> broken [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<garnt> everyone yeah yeah it's so [ __ ] like </garnt>
<connor> you know we we sit here and complain </connor>
<connor> about gacha and it's like yeah okay you </connor>
<garnt> know at </garnt>
<garnt> the end of the day it is 90 of the time </garnt>
<garnt> you're not </garnt>
<connor> you're not playing against other people </connor>
<garnt> and that's where it starts to get real </garnt>
<garnt> when when when you start playing against </garnt>
<connor> other people that's right well that's </connor>
<garnt> where i draw them </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because because because you're like </garnt>
<garnt> oh i i you know i could beat this person </garnt>
<connor> or i could i could have won this event </connor>
<connor> if i just had that extra broken gap </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> because the way i see it is that with </garnt>
<garnt> gacha you with the gacha games i play </garnt>
<garnt> you're playing against a computer or </garnt>
<garnt> you're playing through to get content </garnt>
<connor> um if you come if it becomes pvp then </connor>
<connor> you are </connor>
<connor> kind of making someone else's day worse </connor>
<connor> by paying more you know </connor>
<connor> definitely you're making someone else's </connor>
<garnt> gaming experience worse </garnt>
<garnt> because you played more and that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's where i draw the line yeah </garnt>
<connor> because i used to i don't know which </connor>
<garnt> game i played i think i </garnt>
<connor> found it on like mini clip or something </connor>
<garnt> this is like when i first started </garnt>
<connor> earning my own money </connor>
<connor> and there was like a game where it was </connor>
<connor> kind of like one of those like you </connor>
<connor> kind of like what's that clash of clans </connor>
<connor> like the really popular mobile game </connor>
<connor> one where you build your own fort on </connor>
<connor> your square the map yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but it takes like days for </connor>
<connor> their army to arrive </connor>
<connor> so this is like before even that was out </connor>
<connor> i was playing a game similar to that on </connor>
<connor> like mini clip or some [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> and then like i remember i was playing </connor>
<connor> this game and i thought i was doing </connor>
<connor> pretty well i </connor>
<connor> i only spent like 20 bucks and i was </connor>
<connor> like oh this is i'm doing pretty good </connor>
<connor> for myself hey </connor>
<connor> and then literally like a guy who had </connor>
<connor> like the [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> just perfect like putin's palace worth </connor>
<connor> of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> just came in and just one shot my entire </connor>
<connor> thing that i'd spent months building </connor>
<connor> yeah just because he clearly was like he </connor>
<connor> had like just oil money </connor>
<connor> or something this man had everything in </connor>
<connor> the game which must have been like 50k </connor>
<connor> worth of stuff and just killed me and i </connor>
<joey> was like i was like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] imagine peter winning a </joey>
<connor> mini club game </connor>
<garnt> i was like i felt bad that i spent 20 </garnt>
<garnt> bucks on it because i was like i was </garnt>
<garnt> like 18. and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of money and i was like this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> wiped out not only the hours that i put </connor>
<connor> in but the 20 bucks that i put in were </connor>
<connor> wiped out and i couldn't [ __ ] do </connor>
<connor> anything </connor>
<garnt> yeah i had to sit there and watch his </garnt>
<garnt> army coming for five days </garnt>
<garnt> and then you can drop down the menu see </garnt>
<connor> this man's army the man had sent like </connor>
<connor> the equivalent of like everything they </connor>
<connor> thought in 300 against me and i'm </connor>
<joey> literally like it's like the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> persian </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm literally there with like my </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like stick men </connor>
<connor> like ready and i'm seeing this army come </connor>
<joey> like four weeks ahead and i'm like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] okay like mom get the credit card </joey>
<joey> what am i supposed to do this is so </joey>
<joey> funny oh my god and a lesser man would </joey>
<connor> have been like i can win this </connor>
<connor> unless a man would have thought i could </connor>
<garnt> out i could outbid this man </garnt>
<garnt> so this is why people hate micro </garnt>
<garnt> transactions yeah i get it now i </garnt>
<connor> understand gamers that's i think </connor>
<garnt> from that moment on as i slowly saw that </garnt>
<connor> man's army </connor>
<connor> approach me the resentment built every </connor>
<connor> day to the point where i was like i </connor>
<connor> can't </connor>
<connor> this is [ __ ] i'm just watching my work </connor>
<garnt> be destroyed </garnt>
<garnt> so well i i guess going back to the fifa </garnt>
<garnt> ultimate thing i'm curious like </garnt>
<garnt> how do people even become pros does that </garnt>
<connor> mean you have like </connor>
<joey> you have to legit be good at it i mean </joey>
<garnt> you know literally drop a house deposit </garnt>
<garnt> oh you have to be good and also have </garnt>
<garnt> disposable income yeah to become a pro </garnt>
<connor> and fifa older than i guess </connor>
<connor> isn't it sad that when you're going to a </connor>
<connor> tournament there's probably some people </connor>
<connor> at that tournament who like </connor>
<connor> need that money to recruit the money </connor>
<garnt> they put in just to like isn't that sad </garnt>
<garnt> oh that is that that is [ __ ] like okay </garnt>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> you know normally you know if you're if </connor>
<connor> you're an amazing fighting game player </connor>
<garnt> all you got to worry about is the </garnt>
<garnt> the hotel getting there and you know </garnt>
<garnt> making sure you have enough to live </garnt>
<garnt> which is all okay which is difficult </garnt>
<garnt> enough yeah but you add on that of like </garnt>
<garnt> oh so i spent 50k on peach like to </garnt>
<connor> to enter this map you know what i mean </connor>
<garnt> it's like this is ridiculous it's so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] i feel bad for the like the </connor>
<garnt> people playing fifa who like genuinely </garnt>
<connor> like the game you have to deal with the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i didn't i didn't know he had a </garnt>
<garnt> competitive scene at all because i i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i stopped playing </garnt>
<connor> after after like oh nine ten and i'm </connor>

<connor> gonna have to give you points for </connor>
<connor> uh the the middle three there yeah bro </connor>
<connor> especially the very middle one </connor>
<connor> i was not expecting from you super mario </connor>
<connor> strikers is like if you played that game </connor>
<connor> as a kid you know you're in the middle </connor>
<joey> it is </joey>
<joey> so good it is legit like it is an actual </joey>
<joey> crime fifa oh no that ain't got [ __ ] oh </joey>
<joey> yeah was here being pro at fifa i was </joey>
<joey> here [ __ ] clapping my friend's cheeks </joey>
<joey> with the super smashes </joey>
<joey> bro super mario strike is right if </joey>
<joey> you've played this game you'll know </joey>
<joey> exactly why this is on here yeah this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] is god tier </joey>
<joey> like everyone who's played this game </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] loves it the original gamecube </joey>
<joey> one right it's yeah yeah it's </joey>
<connor> so good and it's an actual crime we </connor>
<connor> don't have this on twitter have you that </connor>
<joey> it was that one and also </joey>
<connor> sloggers as well the baseball one so oh </connor>
<connor> my god oh my god you just hit me with </connor>
<joey> the stars </joey>
<joey> sloggers super mario sluggers gamecube </joey>
<connor> is so good </connor>
<joey> i had a [ __ ] ordeal trying to get </joey>
<joey> sluggers on the wii oh really </joey>
<joey> really um so what happened with was is </joey>
<joey> that what i saw sluggers somewhere </joey>
<joey> online i was like mom i want this and it </joey>
<joey> was only available from like </joey>
<joey> taobao or something on china right like </joey>
<connor> so my mom bought it from china </connor>
<connor> right for me for christmas and it was </connor>
<connor> like the one game that i really wanted </connor>
<connor> that christmas </connor>
<connor> and i put it in and then obviously the </connor>
<connor> wii has um </connor>
<joey> that that has that what's uh region oh </joey>
<joey> the region log yeah so i played it and i </joey>
<connor> was like why isn't it working mom and </connor>
<connor> obviously my parents have no [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> idea </connor>
<connor> is that like what is it we bought you </connor>
<connor> the game it's the game why isn't it </connor>
<connor> working i mean </connor>
<connor> they didn't figure it out either and so </connor>
<connor> they sent it back and bought another one </connor>
<connor> from china again because for some some </connor>
<connor> reason it didn't it wasn't out in europe </connor>
<connor> for some reason oh really i think if it </connor>
<connor> hadn't released yet because you know </connor>
<connor> back then it was like for some reason </connor>
<connor> they would leave six months between yeah </connor>
<joey> the police and uh </joey>
<joey> europe and australia were always lost </joey>
<joey> once together yeah yeah yeah because </joey>
<connor> you'd have to see all these youtube </connor>
<connor> videos you're like i know this exists </connor>
<connor> why can't i buy it </connor>
<connor> and so i had no whole ordeal i never got </connor>
<connor> to play it in the end even though </connor>
<joey> really two or three times i played </joey>
<joey> sliders at my friend's place and i had </joey>
<joey> the most fun i've ever played in a mario </joey>
<joey> spin-off game i think yeah what is </joey>
<joey> sluggers there's the baseball </joey>
<connor> baseball one yeah i think that the mario </connor>
<connor> strikers is the best mario spinoff game </connor>
<joey> well strikers there's </joey>
<joey> strikers they're sluggers and then </joey>
<connor> there's uh mario three on three </connor>
<connor> basketball as well oh my god </connor>
<garnt> yes do you know that one i never played </garnt>
<garnt> that but </garnt>
<garnt> dude legit i feel i feel like you're </garnt>
<garnt> just naming mario party mini games </garnt>
<joey> dude honestly all of the sports </joey>
<joey> spin-offs of mario are all </joey>
<joey> such [ __ ] solid games like mario </joey>
<joey> tennis [ __ ] solo </joey>
<connor> mario golf [ __ ] solid i think i legit </connor>
<connor> would put like strikers like </connor>
<connor> uh like up there with mario kart like </connor>
<connor> main line yeah </connor>
<connor> i would i think it's that good like like </connor>
<garnt> to me it's like yeah </garnt>
<connor> okay of course i like sunshine gone yeah </connor>
<garnt> of course i like all this game </garnt>
<garnt> but like mario strikers that's when </garnt>
<garnt> you're woke you're like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm listening like if your mates like </garnt>
<connor> you want to play strikers you're like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yet </connor>
<connor> yeah because it was always like you know </connor>
<connor> are they you know because there was this </connor>
<connor> mechanic and it was probably the funnest </connor>
<connor> mechanic in a mario game where like yeah </connor>
<connor> you so your team would be made of two </connor>
<connor> main mario characters so you'd have like </connor>
<connor> you could put like waluigi and then </connor>
<connor> you'd have like four coopers or </connor>
<connor> four uh birdos or whatever right yeah </connor>
<connor> and then he could pick like wario </connor>
<connor> and so there's this mechanic where you </connor>
<connor> could choose to do a super shot with the </connor>
<connor> main character if they had the ball </connor>
<connor> and it was basically like a quick time </connor>
<connor> event and you just nail it in like the </connor>
<connor> perfect like the </connor>
<connor> the like the be like an arm that would </connor>
<connor> swing and hit it in the perfect zone </connor>
<connor> if you got it perfect it would be a </connor>
<connor> guaranteed goal so it's always a thing </connor>
<joey> of like </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] can he do it and it was so </joey>
<joey> hard because the timing is super fast </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] tiny and you have to i </joey>
<garnt> think it's not even guaranteed unless </garnt>
<joey> you're past the halfway point </joey>
<garnt> right if we passed a halfway point to do </garnt>
<garnt> it and yeah it's it's [ __ ] it's so </garnt>
<connor> good </connor>
<connor> it's so [ __ ] good dude but do you </connor>
<joey> want to go through your </joey>
<connor> three by three sure sure sure okay okay </connor>
<garnt> i gotta ask first </garnt>
<connor> i know which one you're gonna ask why </connor>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] is battalion wars </garnt>
<garnt> okay all right i've never </garnt>
<connor> i've never even heard of it if you look </connor>
<connor> up battalion wars it's like one of the </connor>
<connor> highest rated games on like the </connor>
<connor> at least this one is on the wii and the </connor>
<connor> first one is one of the highest rated </connor>
<connor> game dude it is like a really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> good strategy game all right </connor>
<connor> so it's like um so i really like the </connor>
<connor> online </connor>
<connor> where it's kind of like um it's kind of </connor>
<connor> really hard to experience like tanks </connor>
<connor> no so it was basically like you'd be </connor>
<connor> given like a set amount of army so you'd </connor>
<connor> be given maybe like three tanks </connor>
<connor> four long range tanks ten uh ground </connor>
<connor> units and there would be a mission </connor>
<connor> and so the the way that it worked is </connor>
<connor> like you would have to try and </connor>
<connor> take over or take over a base or push </connor>
<connor> push the enemy out </connor>
<connor> without losing as many people as </connor>
<connor> possible but the online was really good </connor>
<connor> it was essentially </connor>
<connor> the same thing but one person was </connor>
<connor> defending a point and the other person </connor>
<connor> had a push </connor>
<connor> right and it was really fun cause i got </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] good at it when i was </connor>
<connor> like 15 </connor>
<connor> and i would just keep winning and i </connor>
<connor> would like cheese people with strats and </connor>
<connor> stuff it's such a good game </connor>
<connor> i played so [ __ ] much of that game </connor>
<garnt> it's so good because i've never heard of </garnt>
<garnt> this game right and i look at this cover </garnt>
<connor> and i'm just like this looks like some </connor>
<connor> chinese knockoff game like </connor>
<connor> dude this is like the mom </connor>
<connor> i want advanced wars we have advanced </connor>
<garnt> wars at home can we zoom in can we zoom </garnt>
<garnt> in on this yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you can see you can see the cover here </garnt>
<connor> right now oh dude it's good dude it's so </connor>
<connor> good check out gameplay </connor>
<garnt> okay probably i'm just i'm not because </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like genuinely curious why i've </garnt>
<connor> never heard of this game before yeah </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like um i don't know how to </connor>
<connor> explore because it's like </connor>
<connor> it plays somewhat similar to halo wars </connor>
<connor> but but quite different like oh </connor>
<connor> that's it as well so i completely forgot </connor>
<connor> one of the main mechanics of the game </connor>
<connor> so imagine a real-time strategy where </connor>
<connor> you can be like give me con </connor>
<connor> first person control of this guy yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna [ __ ] get on the ground and </connor>
<connor> do the work yeah </connor>
<connor> so you can swap between the units of who </connor>
<connor> you're doing first person right </connor>
<connor> so because sometimes obviously the </connor>
<connor> automation is like good yeah you can </connor>
<connor> obviously be way more </connor>
<connor> like in control and do more damage so </connor>
<connor> like the like </connor>
<connor> you know because there's tanks there's </connor>
<connor> planes there's whatever like the planes </connor>
<connor> were okay but if you went first person </connor>
<connor> you could really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] people up with them yeah and you </connor>
<connor> could dodge [ __ ] way easier and stuff </connor>
<connor> like that </connor>
<connor> dude it's so good anyone who played </connor>
<garnt> battalion wars 2 will know it </garnt>
<garnt> no no i'm just realizing that we went </garnt>
<connor> through my entire three by three </connor>
<connor> talked talked about it for an hour and </connor>
<connor> not once did i use the term mechanic </connor>
<connor> that's all gameplay mechanic i'm just </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah it gave me the mechanic so </connor>
<connor> that's the selling point of games </connor>
<garnt> right didn't didn't mention that once </garnt>
<connor> throughout my entire three by three </connor>
<connor> one thing that's going to be definitely </connor>
<connor> i guess throughout all of my nine is </connor>
<connor> that like i really think they have like </connor>
<connor> super like strong game mechanics no no i </connor>
<garnt> look at this and i'm just like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of these have really strong </garnt>

<connor> don't game into it </connor>
<connor> that's so underrated i mean who doesn't </connor>
<connor> game nowadays though well i </connor>
<connor> i i could get my parents to play guitar </connor>
<connor> hero with me true true which is like </connor>
<connor> like think of how many games you could </connor>
<connor> like i'm not my parents i want to play </connor>

<connor> if he sees me clapping cheeks with this </connor>
<garnt> guitar </garnt>
<connor> but i want to try that out yeah and he </connor>
<garnt> did and it was great there's the one </garnt>
<garnt> time where you could be like my parents </garnt>
<joey> give a [ __ ] about my hobby </joey>
<connor> but they don't it's like </connor>
<joey> okay but the thing is did you own guitar </joey>
<connor> hero 3 um okay </connor>
<connor> because like i only won guitar though i </connor>
<connor> couldn't afford it </connor>
<connor> because his thing like i love playing </connor>
<connor> rhythm games i love playing especially </connor>
<connor> with like when </connor>
<connor> when we're at the arcade and everything </connor>
<garnt> like that i love playing rhythm games </garnt>
<garnt> i've always </garnt>
<garnt> loved the feeling playing rhythm games </garnt>
<garnt> i've never like gotten to the point when </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> okay i'm going to own a rhythm game now </garnt>
<connor> i'm going to practice a rhythm game i </connor>
<connor> mean when guitar hero was out man they </connor>
<connor> were like </connor>
<connor> they were [ __ ] everywhere it was so </connor>
<connor> easy to get like knock-off guitar </connor>
<connor> ones and stuff like it was like before </connor>
<connor> rock band came along is when the hype </connor>
<connor> started dying but like it was </connor>
<connor> everyone had rock yeah guitar hero yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm sad because like i feel the fact </joey>
<connor> that i </connor>
<connor> started learning how to actually play </connor>
<connor> guitar kind of threw me off playing </connor>
<garnt> guitar hero </garnt>
<garnt> because like i would like watch people </garnt>
<garnt> play guitar hero and i'd play it as well </garnt>
<joey> and i'd be like this is really fun </joey>
<joey> but i could also just be playing a </joey>
<connor> guitar </connor>
<joey> people who don't like instruments yeah </joey>
<joey> right right exactly and even now like i </joey>
<joey> still enjoy watching like that </joey>
<connor> uh that twitch streamer who plays guitar </connor>
<connor> custom songs </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah like i love like </joey>
<joey> everything about guitar just seems so </joey>
<joey> fun </joey>
<joey> oh yeah yeah it's great i mean i think </joey>
<joey> it's a banger what are you learning </joey>
<connor> where's the score system how do i get </connor>
<connor> ranked you know it's none of those </connor>
<joey> like people who play sports games hate </joey>
<connor> playing sports </connor>
<connor> well you know what other other rhythm </connor>
<connor> game could have been on here that i </connor>
<joey> i i didn't play the rhythm game but i </joey>
<connor> played the other game of it was uh </connor>
<connor> donkey konger oh yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> basically donkey kong </connor>
<connor> the donkey kong bongos on gamecube </connor>
<joey> jungle beat right jungle beat yeah </joey>
<joey> i thought was way better than the um uh </joey>
<joey> the actual </joey>
<joey> rhythm game one yeah game one which was </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but then they </connor>
<joey> had like a platformer </joey>
<connor> yeah that was using the bongos yeah did </connor>
<joey> you see this yeah no jungle b was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] awesome you would like platform </joey>
<garnt> and then like you would you'd like so if </garnt>
<garnt> you clapped at a certain thing and then </garnt>
<garnt> if you like hit both it would do a </garnt>
<garnt> certain </garnt>
<garnt> oh no i remember literally replacing the </garnt>
<joey> controller with like two points </joey>
<joey> and it played so well like you think it </joey>
<joey> wouldn't and then like sometimes the </joey>
<connor> the boss fights were like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> clapping battles yeah it was so cool </connor>
<connor> man the game was so good that could be </connor>
<joey> on here as well so </joey>
<joey> for me it was like only that one rich </joey>
<joey> kid who had that game and everyone was </joey>
<joey> like wait you have it without end up </joey>
<joey> coming over well that was because like i </joey>
<joey> played uh </joey>
<connor> the rhythm game one at my friend's house </connor>
<connor> and i was like mom please get me this </connor>
<connor> for christmas </connor>
<connor> and then i like at the time i i kind of </connor>
<connor> really regretted it because </connor>
<connor> to me it was like i paid like three </connor>
<joey> times the price of a video game </joey>
<connor> right for just one game yeah and it was </connor>
<connor> good but i was like oh it's over now </connor>
<joey> yeah because for me it was a choice </joey>
<connor> between jungle beat or </connor>
<joey> taika and like i got taiko obviously </joey>
<joey> because it was like </joey>
<garnt> there's more places it was more for me i </garnt>
<garnt> think my problem with rhythm games is </garnt>
<connor> that i have a hard time </connor>
<connor> looking at it as anything but a party </connor>
<connor> game right </connor>
<connor> and because like i i understand people </connor>
<connor> getting getting into rhythm games but i </connor>
<garnt> cannot play a rhythm game for more than </garnt>
<garnt> like a few songs before i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> okay i </connor>
<garnt> i think one thing that rhythm games i </garnt>
<garnt> quite like even though i don't like </garnt>
<connor> instruments or care about music much is </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> i really like the uh you can always like </connor>
<garnt> feel like you're improving </garnt>
<connor> even when you replay a song or like when </connor>
<connor> you're going through you always feel </connor>
<garnt> like you're improving i i'll tell you </garnt>
<garnt> what like rhythm games are it's </garnt>
<connor> it's feeling like you're playing an </connor>
<connor> instrument without going through the </connor>
<connor> boring parts </connor>
<connor> yeah like my god like imagine imagine if </connor>
<connor> you could just learn how to play guitar </connor>
<garnt> without having to do scales </garnt>
<connor> right like wait there's only five </connor>
<garnt> buttons yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's so easy you mean i don't i don't </garnt>
<garnt> have to like practice scales five times </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> like five times every time just one </joey>
<joey> rhythm game i didn't put in my </joey>
<connor> three by three but i could easily put it </connor>
<connor> on there is um rhythm heaven </connor>
<connor> you know that game on the ds i played </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] it i played that game </connor>
<connor> so much that i snapped two ds styluses </connor>
<connor> while playing that game holy [ __ ] snap i </connor>
<connor> didn't know this thing </connor>
<connor> yeah because i was like so [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> concentrated on it that like i literally </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<connor> there's a [ __ ] crap yes just impaled </connor>
<joey> like the stick comes out the other side </joey>
<joey> legit i played like the reason why my </joey>
<garnt> original ds broke was because i played </garnt>
<garnt> too much rhythm here </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god because it got to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where like my touch pad was like </garnt>
<garnt> you've damaged me like so much so that </garnt>
<joey> the inside is just [ __ ] now and </joey>
<garnt> nothing responded </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like your ds is just like that </garnt>
<garnt> anime character who's just like </garnt>
<garnt> who's like gone through hell and just </garnt>
<joey> has been like battered and bruised no </joey>
<joey> dude my my ds [ __ ] like the touch pad </joey>
<connor> on my ds just looked like bucky's body </connor>
<connor> it was just like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> it was just like shattered it's like </joey>
<joey> this guy's been through like a thousand </joey>
<connor> years old </connor>
<connor> so much guns in it yeah oh dude it was </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] oh my god i had so much fun </connor>
<joey> playing rhythm evan any other questions </joey>
<connor> um i mean everything's sonic rider yes </connor>
<joey> listen i know this is gonna get flat </joey>
<connor> right i'm surprised this wasn't the </connor>
<connor> immediate thing that i was giving flag </connor>
<joey> for right </joey>
<joey> right i'm just shocked there's a sonic </joey>
<joey> game honestly like </joey>
<connor> i didn't give you flack because i was </connor>
<garnt> actually really close to putting sonic </garnt>
<garnt> adventure 2 on my </garnt>
<connor> no sonic battle adventure 2 yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that was that was that was that easily </connor>
<garnt> could have been on here </garnt>
<garnt> running around at the speed of sound </garnt>
<connor> just for like me like </connor>
<connor> me like giving like my chows like </connor>
<connor> steroids </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] in there drag him up do the race </connor>
<connor> i love that that was so fun um yeah i </connor>
<connor> mean like sonic riders was like the one </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<connor> that because it came with my gamecube </connor>
<connor> right so when i bought the gamecube it </connor>
<connor> was when it was </connor>
<connor> already dying and they were just </connor>
<connor> literally trying to sell it with </connor>
<connor> anything so i got like um </connor>
<connor> a bunch of free games with my gamecube </connor>
<garnt> for like very cheap </garnt>
<garnt> and sonic riders was the one that i </garnt>
<garnt> hated most that came with this game </garnt>
<garnt> right i was like </garnt>
<garnt> i was like these controls suck dick it </garnt>
<joey> is one of the most janks </joey>
<connor> it's like so [ __ ] jank right and like </connor>
<joey> the the learning curve for this game the </joey>
<joey> mechanics seemed completely like </joey>
<joey> overkill </joey>
<joey> like a kids game yeah but then after </joey>
<connor> like i actually sat down and like just </connor>
<connor> for like 20 hours didn't understand the </connor>
<connor> game and like eventually understood what </connor>
<connor> was happening </connor>
<connor> this game felt so [ __ ] clean like it </connor>
<joey> felt so good </joey>
<connor> i felt that way with uh kirby's air ride </connor>
<connor> as well because </connor>
<garnt> for the first like 10 hours i was like </garnt>
<garnt> wait it's not just a racing game yeah </garnt>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is this i have to like </joey>
<joey> earn my ride and then go into what the </joey>
<joey> right right because there was like this </joey>
<connor> like glide mechanic where you had to </connor>
<connor> like jump in the other person's like </connor>
<connor> trail yeah it was completely jank and it </connor>
<connor> would like throw you out and stuff and </connor>
<connor> it was </connor>
<connor> so gent but it was like probably the one </connor>
<connor> game where </connor>
<connor> my impressions on it completely 180'd </connor>
<connor> after i like actually put time into it </connor>
<connor> right i got good at it and i was like </connor>
<connor> wait </connor>
<connor> this is a [ __ ] clean game and i </connor>
<connor> played it so goddamn much i played this </connor>
<joey> game </joey>
<joey> so i was glad to know that i'm not the </joey>
<connor> only one who has like a 3d sonic game as </connor>
<connor> like a guilty pleasure game </connor>
<connor> dude yeah it was like for me it was </connor>
<connor> sonic heroes </connor>
<connor> i i could have personally yeah and i </connor>
<connor> didn't put in my 3x3 just because like </connor>
<connor> if i did </connor>
<joey> i know people will be like you put a 3d </joey>
<joey> sonic game no </joey>
<connor> dude i could i could put some honestly </connor>
<garnt> like i i defend it i i have </garnt>
<garnt> no like fond memories of any 2d sonic </garnt>
<connor> games but it's the 3d sonic games </connor>
<connor> i have fun i remember i tried it look </connor>
<garnt> because it's </garnt>
<connor> there's one reason because i was a </connor>
<connor> nintendo kid through and through so </connor>
<connor> sonic wasn't available till the gamecube </connor>
<connor> okay that's why </connor>
<connor> exactly that's why listen sonic right </connor>
<joey> this is a good game </joey>
<joey> if you if you learn listen like if you </joey>
<connor> watch people play it for the first time </connor>
<joey> they'll be like this is [ __ ] garbage </joey>
<connor> yeah this is the worst game ever but </connor>
<connor> then if you see someone who's good at it </connor>
<connor> you're like damn that looks [ __ ] good </connor>
<joey> no legit it's a good game no it is a </joey>
<joey> good game i played it </joey>
<joey> that's why i'm glad to know that like </joey>
<joey> i'm not the only one who's like you know </joey>
<joey> what there are good sonic games like </joey>
<connor> special </connor>
<connor> sonic heroes if i replayed it probably </connor>
<joey> jank as [ __ ] oh yeah i probably hate the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] out of it i'm like i remember that </connor>
<connor> casino level i [ __ ] hated </connor>
<connor> in that game but i enjoyed sonic i </connor>
<connor> remember you just keep dying randomly </connor>
<joey> from stuff in there yeah it was </joey>
<joey> it was one of the most i don't think it </joey>
<garnt> was a [ __ ] game yeah i don't think i've </garnt>
<connor> played sonic heroes but i've definitely </connor>
<connor> played </connor>
<connor> some 3d sonic games and i've actually </connor>
<garnt> enjoyed most of them </garnt>
<joey> it's it's [ __ ] i mean i mean i mean </joey>
<connor> black ops is self-explanatory </connor>
<joey> black ops 2 that is i think even though </joey>
<joey> i played i </joey>
<joey> couldn't tell you the difference well </joey>
<joey> there's a big there's a massive </joey>
<connor> difference okay okay </connor>
<connor> okay there's you know as if any you know </connor>
<joey> which one's the one where it literally </joey>
<joey> starts off with the airport getting shot </joey>
<connor> up </connor>
<joey> that's moderate that's my extent </joey>
<connor> of knowledge of course when that came </connor>
<joey> out that was such a big deal like oh </joey>
<joey> yeah it was a huge idea </joey>
<joey> my mom like she'd already bought me the </joey>
<joey> game and then she was like </joey>
<joey> connor i've heard about this thing in </joey>
<joey> this game where you kill a bunch of </joey>
<connor> people at an airport </connor>
<connor> i didn't buy you that game did i and i </connor>
<connor> was like no no no </connor>
<connor> she was like oh okay good good good </connor>
<connor> no russian no yeah modern warfare 2 is </connor>
<connor> the one that i probably played the most </connor>
<connor> modern warfare 3 is one where i won a </connor>
<connor> bunch of free [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> and then black ops 2 was probably the </connor>
<joey> one i had most fun with and that i </joey>
<joey> played competitively like in teams and </joey>
<joey> stuff and i really enjoyed </joey>
<joey> yeah it was so fun it was so clean yeah </joey>
<joey> that game they like optimized it it was </joey>
<connor> like the best card 100 hands down </connor>
<connor> the maps were the best the multiplayer </connor>
<connor> had like a good rank system which they'd </connor>
<connor> never had before </connor>
<connor> i don't think they ever put back in like </connor>
<connor> it was legit good it was such a it was </connor>
<connor> just a [ __ ] great game </connor>
<connor> fantastic [ __ ] game anyone who likes </connor>
<connor> card will tell you that black ops 2 is </connor>
<joey> the best game yeah that's that's </joey>
<joey> what i hear most of the time it's like </joey>
<connor> it's either black ops 2 or modern </connor>
<connor> warfare you're like this is all noise to </connor>
<garnt> me </garnt>
<joey> is is this how it feels when we talk </joey>
<joey> about music </joey>
<joey> probably i'm i'm like i'm like cool oh </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> like it's has it got the people the most </connor>
<connor> balanced you know it's it's just a great </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<connor> it's just the game and i i put way too </connor>
<connor> many hours and it's what got me into </connor>
<garnt> like competitive gaming and i like </garnt>
<garnt> really that was like the first esports i </garnt>
<garnt> started watching </garnt>
<garnt> i just had like a really good tournament </garnt>
<garnt> okay um but then all the [ __ ] pro </garnt>
<connor> players like weird </connor>
<connor> as [ __ ] at that time they were just like </connor>
<joey> yeah it was weird it was very strange </joey>
<connor> and then i'm not surprised you have time </connor>
<connor> crisis and metal slug in there because </connor>
<connor> yeah whenever we go to an arcade </connor>
<connor> together and that you have metal gear or </connor>
<connor> not </connor>
<connor> so metal slugs all right see you later </connor>
<connor> metal slug i have </connor>
<connor> always just been obsessed with other </connor>
<connor> places uh that's battles like acts i </connor>
<connor> think i think </connor>
<joey> i think metals like x is like the best </joey>
<joey> game overall </joey>
<joey> um if you don't know what metal slug is </joey>
<joey> it's a neo geo game that was really </joey>
<joey> popular in arcades and you can probably </joey>
<joey> still find it in a lot of arcades </joey>
<joey> um it's aged super [ __ ] well oh it </joey>
<joey> looks so </joey>
<joey> like the sprite work on it for its time </joey>
<joey> was like insane yeah like and it </joey>
<joey> looks like it's still almost insane and </joey>
<joey> it's got like some of the best [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> sound effects the </connor>
<connor> rocket launcher i love that [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> the gameplay is so goddamn clean in that </garnt>
<garnt> game yeah it doesn't overstay its </garnt>
<garnt> welcome it's like his six levels enjoy </garnt>
<garnt> them get the [ __ ] out </garnt>
<garnt> did you ever enjoy contra contra was </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] difficult like i mean it </garnt>
<garnt> was that's </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i think the the reason why i </garnt>
<joey> don't like i think metal slug three </joey>
<joey> is like probably one of the way too hard </joey>
<connor> is that like it goes from like you know </connor>
<connor> level one and two and metal slug three </connor>
<connor> from being you know a fairly challenging </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<connor> uh to like level uh i think four five </connor>
<connor> and six just being absolutely [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> stupid </joey>
<joey> i mean i remember the first time you and </joey>
<connor> i ever like game together we played all </connor>
<connor> three of the middle slogging games back </connor>
<connor> if with two people who played the game </connor>
<joey> you could easily breeze through it and </joey>
<joey> then we got the three </joey>
<joey> yeah and we were like [ __ ] this game </joey>
<connor> it's so hard </connor>
<connor> three like there is it is like you have </connor>
<connor> to play that game </connor>
<connor> every absurd amount because even if you </connor>
<joey> know where all the enemies are spawning </joey>
<joey> and where they're coming from it's like </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter because there's just </joey>
<joey> so much [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's literally yeah yeah it's complete </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] i just did it just to [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] with you and take your money i just </joey>
<garnt> realized there should have been another </garnt>
<garnt> game on my </garnt>
<connor> three by three i'm like we're talking </connor>
<connor> about this uh mega man x </connor>
<joey> oh my god yeah like i'm thinking i was </joey>
<connor> thinking like side scrollers i </connor>
<garnt> completely forgot how much i was </garnt>
<joey> obsessed with sci-fi i was i was </joey>
<joey> tossing up between mega man x and mega </joey>
<garnt> man 2 right yeah just </garnt>
<garnt> purely mega man x is just [ __ ] it's </garnt>
<connor> it's like it still feels like anime </connor>
<connor> right it's got </connor>
<connor> it's got such an anime story line yeah </connor>
<connor> um but </connor>
<connor> my god like the the gameplay in that is </connor>
<connor> clean as well </connor>
<connor> i forgot how much i loved hard games as </connor>
<connor> a kid yeah man i really [ __ ] now i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> hey yeah please because i'm like </connor>
<connor> man yeah i remember i completed contra </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<joey> super contra at least on the snes </joey>
<joey> without without the contra code uh yeah </joey>
<joey> without the controversy my cousin i'm </joey>
<joey> hardcore gamer right yeah i'm just like </joey>
<joey> what </joey>
<garnt> i remember completing mega man and that </garnt>
<garnt> was really easy what the [ __ ] happened </garnt>
<joey> to me man </joey>
<joey> yeah because i was exactly the same like </joey>
<connor> i i haven't beaten contra without the </connor>
<connor> conjurer code yeah but like i </connor>
<connor> i remember like how easy it was for me </connor>
<connor> to be like mega man 2. i could be in </connor>
<connor> like an </connor>
<connor> hour and like you know a lot i think </connor>
<connor> last year the year before </connor>
<connor> i was like i want to stream some retro </connor>
<connor> games oh i'll play mega man 2. because i </connor>
<connor> played that like [ __ ] crazy yeah dude </connor>
<connor> i got like 30 minutes in i only beat </connor>
<garnt> like two like [ __ ] robo boss i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> this game is [ __ ] impossible how did </garnt>
<joey> i beat this as like a 10 year old you </joey>
<garnt> should have patience man </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but no because yeah okay go for it </garnt>
<joey> but like stuff with like contra like i </joey>
<joey> never played as a kid so when i play now </joey>
<joey> and like just [ __ ] kills you because </joey>
<garnt> there's a lot of [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> right like yeah i'm just immediately </garnt>
<connor> turned off from [ __ ] like that yeah </connor>
<garnt> no this is just [ __ ] it's it's weird </garnt>
<garnt> because i i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> this conversation has brought back so </garnt>
<garnt> many memories about how </garnt>
<garnt> how much patience i had as a kid yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember another game that was </garnt>
<garnt> uh people complained about being super </garnt>
<garnt> hard and super [ __ ] he was battle </garnt>
<connor> toads </connor>
<connor> um it was the level with the bikes right </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i i still remember the level </garnt>
<garnt> with the bikes and having to complete </garnt>
<garnt> that and completing battle toes and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> man i remember i i think i just blanked </garnt>
<joey> it out because there was just so many </joey>
<joey> hours of my life that were just some </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] level yeah and i just </joey>
<joey> as a kid you were just mind-numbingly </joey>
<connor> just like [ __ ] learnt it through um </connor>
<joey> through muscle memory right right and </joey>
<connor> i would not have the patience to do that </connor>
<garnt> anymore like if it was like you value </garnt>
<connor> your time </connor>
<connor> you're like if there's something like </connor>
<garnt> because battle told by the battle toads </garnt>
<garnt> let's be honest is [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah full of [ __ ] but i [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> love that game </joey>
<joey> yeah but because you can't you can't </joey>
<joey> play that now and be like this is </joey>
<joey> fantastic it's like ninja gaiden for me </joey>
<connor> as well yeah </connor>
<joey> that game is just free yeah where it's </joey>
<garnt> like i remember i almost beat that game </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid and i got to like i think like </garnt>
<joey> the second to last level now i can't </joey>
<garnt> even get past level one yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm trying to think about how the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] did i be mega man x </garnt>
<garnt> on the [ __ ] snez controller right my </garnt>
<garnt> god i remember getting like cramps and </garnt>
<garnt> carpool tunnel </garnt>
<garnt> from like the like like tapping the jump </garnt>
<garnt> button on the wall </garnt>
<connor> like again some of the bosses right at </connor>
<garnt> least it's not as bad as a nest </garnt>
<connor> controller </connor>
<garnt> that thing was [ __ ] awful in your </garnt>
<connor> hands </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i i just think for me metal </connor>
<connor> slug </connor>
<connor> is the best age just a best overall </connor>
<joey> uh running guns i think i think it's one </joey>
<joey> of the one of the games that's like age </joey>
<connor> the best i feel like if you look at any </connor>
<connor> like any indie game that comes out now </connor>
<joey> that is like a side scroller running gun </joey>
<garnt> it just it looks so inspired by metals </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah my work is like identical yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's it's like the blueprint of like </garnt>
<garnt> this is how you make a clean </garnt>
<garnt> running gun yeah it's you know metal </garnt>
<garnt> slug you know </garnt>
<garnt> three is [ __ ] um but like one two </garnt>
<garnt> and x </garnt>
<joey> i mean x is just kind of two yeah like </joey>
<joey> one two and x like i would highly </joey>
<joey> recommend getting x i think it's on </joey>
<joey> steam one and two are also </joey>
<joey> on steam you can get all of them yeah go </joey>
<joey> and get it it's such a fun game </joey>
<joey> um it's just great this is when you play </joey>
<joey> with someone else right yeah yeah it's </joey>
<joey> so funny yeah it's so difficult </joey>
<connor> as well so it's just a great game i mean </connor>
<garnt> it's clean yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm on crisis man okay some [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> the original one i think is such a </garnt>
<connor> goddamn </connor>
<connor> gem of a game when you go to an arcade </connor>
<garnt> you see i still think time crisis is </garnt>
<garnt> good and the only reason i could never </garnt>
<connor> progress </connor>
<connor> too far in time crisis was because i </connor>
<garnt> never had enough money yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah so like i think once you get over </connor>
<connor> that point of time crisis where you've </connor>
<joey> beaten it a few times </joey>
<joey> you can beat the whole game at least </joey>
<connor> game one on one credit like pretty much </connor>
<joey> pretty easily yeah because you know </joey>
<connor> you know when all the bullshit's coming </connor>
<connor> and to me when i used to play because </connor>
<connor> like you know when you're when you would </connor>
<connor> go to an arcade right because we i would </connor>
<connor> stay in like france for like i don't </connor>
<connor> know two weeks at a time yeah my parents </connor>
<connor> would give me like two euros a day </connor>
<joey> maybe how did you complete the game the </joey>
<joey> first time which is what i wanted yeah </joey>
<garnt> i've i've like no matter what i i have </garnt>
<garnt> always run out of money yeah i feel i </garnt>
<joey> feel like the first time you played time </joey>
<connor> crisis if you only had like two credits </connor>
<garnt> right yeah you could </garnt>
<connor> maybe get possible you know maybe up to </connor>
<connor> like stage two so this was like </connor>
<connor> something over like years </connor>
<connor> where it was like i would always even </connor>
<connor> like see it in arcades and i would </connor>
<connor> always pick it up and then </connor>
<joey> maybe if i had two weeks i would play it </joey>
<joey> like every day for two weeks right </joey>
<joey> or i would like you know and as well i </joey>
<joey> got to the point where it </joey>
<joey> when when okay if you had your name on </joey>
<joey> the high score </joey>
<joey> all of them so i would go and try and </joey>
<joey> take all 10 slots when i would go </joey>
<connor> when i would go to like a vacation point </connor>
<connor> again because i would be there for like </connor>
<connor> two weeks so i'm like oh what i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> do is i'm gonna take every single </connor>
<connor> slot on this thing yeah but then i um </connor>
<connor> and so eventually what you could what i </connor>
<garnt> would do is </garnt>
<garnt> i would be like if someone was gonna </garnt>
<garnt> play it i would just like i would just </garnt>
<garnt> chill out and i'd be like oh that's me </garnt>
<garnt> by the way </garnt>
<garnt> and then they would be like oh yeah they </garnt>
<connor> would be like oh you want to play with </connor>
<connor> me </connor>
<connor> i'm like hell yeah give me your credit </connor>
<connor> and they'd give me a credit right and i </connor>
<garnt> could just play </garnt>
<garnt> you literally game the system no yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but then but then it was [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> because some people uh some of the </garnt>
<connor> systems when they pulled out the plug at </connor>
<connor> night like it would wipe all the high </connor>
<connor> schools that was like my worst nightmare </connor>
<connor> because i would i would get the high </connor>
<connor> score </connor>
<connor> yeah you know feel real good i'd come </connor>
<connor> back the next day and i'm like </connor>
<connor> where is it where is my high school my </connor>
<joey> street cred </joey>
<connor> gone just like that i'm like no how did </connor>
<garnt> you prove that that name was you though </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i want to know people just </garnt>
<garnt> took your word for it </garnt>
<joey> um that's a good question how did they </joey>
<joey> do i guess it's just the old system </joey>
<joey> right of just people just took your word </joey>
<connor> for it </connor>
<connor> yeah i guess the moment they i put the </connor>
<connor> coin and i started [ __ ] just </connor>
<connor> destroying everyone they'd be like i </connor>
<joey> think it's him </joey>
<joey> it's you know this the old speed run </joey>
<connor> rules right like you don't need you </connor>
<joey> don't we don't need video proof we </joey>
<joey> trust that you say well because like if </joey>
<joey> you're a rookie right time </joey>
<connor> they'd go like this you know i would </connor>
<joey> just like so i would like get yeah </joey>
<garnt> and then like flick it off like that </garnt>
<garnt> excuse you in time crisis right that's </garnt>
<garnt> good </garnt>
<garnt> so yeah because the way right i learned </garnt>
<garnt> right i'm like wait the the normal way </garnt>
<garnt> of shooting so </garnt>
<garnt> if you i'm assuming most people who are </garnt>
<garnt> watching this have seen or played a time </garnt>
<connor> crisis if you haven't it's the one where </connor>
<connor> you put your pedal down </connor>
<connor> on the thing and then you pop out to </connor>
<connor> shoot that should be enough to let you </connor>
<connor> know i mean i assume if you've left your </connor>
<connor> house been to an arcade or </connor>
<connor> anything or then bowling you've seen </connor>
<garnt> this thing it's it's [ __ ] basically </garnt>
<garnt> it's the best arcane </garnt>
<garnt> uh arcade game you can play you don't </garnt>
<connor> live in japan yeah and i realized right </connor>
<connor> after a while i'm like right </connor>
<connor> if you're doing the whole like holding </connor>
<connor> it with two hands pointing shooting your </connor>
<connor> finger isn't fast enough and the way the </connor>
<connor> time crisis worked with points is that </connor>
<connor> you had to </connor>
<connor> like there would be this like a smash </connor>
<connor> combo right when you </connor>
<connor> shot a character first there was like a </connor>
<connor> split second where you could keep </connor>
<connor> shooting them with bullets </connor>
<connor> to get more points and combo it so if </connor>
<connor> you shot someone once that's it you only </connor>
<connor> got like 10 points </connor>
<connor> you could unload like eight bullets into </connor>
<connor> one person so what you'd have to do is </connor>
<connor> when they would all pop up on screen you </connor>
<connor> have to get like max amount of points on </connor>
<connor> each person on screen right so i would </connor>
<connor> unload the whole mag into one character </connor>
<garnt> so that's how you had to be like a man </garnt>
<garnt> just like discovered turbo mode no yes </garnt>
<connor> it was literally like imagine like i </connor>
<connor> literally just learned the technique of </connor>
<connor> like spamming this thing like this i </connor>
<connor> would like to twitch my </connor>
<connor> absolutely like oh [ __ ] like and then i </connor>
<garnt> would do it for everyone on the screen </garnt>
<garnt> and so that way no one came close to </garnt>
<garnt> beating me in school </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and then i would remember the </garnt>
<garnt> points where like i think a time crisis </garnt>
<garnt> one </garnt>
<connor> or two there's a point where you get a </connor>
<connor> machine gun and if you you could like </connor>
<connor> juggle the cover </connor>
<joey> so that you could keep your combo even </joey>
<connor> while going in cover mm-hmm so you could </connor>
<joey> like juggle it to get an absurd combo </joey>
<joey> this man at age 10 is optimizing games </joey>
<garnt> so i remember this </garnt>
<connor> speech like literally like age 13 </connor>
<garnt> and then like it was like yeah in maxing </garnt>
<connor> time crisis yeah i </connor>
<connor> i loved it and then you know then you </connor>
<connor> start playing time crisis three and four </connor>
<connor> so two was nice two is when they </connor>
<connor> introduced like sorry i'm gonna go into </connor>
<connor> in depth yeah no no no no no no no </connor>
<connor> so time crash is one all you had was the </connor>
<connor> pistol yeah and you could do </connor>
<connor> boom time guys two they started </connor>
<connor> introducing like weird [ __ ] like machine </connor>
<connor> gun grenade </connor>
<connor> shotgun you're like all right whatever </connor>
<connor> cool time guys is threes where they </connor>
<connor> start getting [ __ ] weird with it and </connor>
<connor> they start introducing all this dumb </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] and now we're on like seven </joey>
<connor> yeah and it's just garbage like it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] game where you just get [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> shot it's like it's like house of the </connor>
<joey> dead well you were playing five the </joey>
<joey> other day and you said five was all </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> it's okay but like they introduced like </connor>
<connor> they i feel like they they did what </connor>
<connor> house of the dead did </connor>
<connor> like where house of the dead was an </connor>
<connor> amazing arcade game one was </connor>
<garnt> pretty challenging two was quite </garnt>
<garnt> difficult and they started adding a few </garnt>
<garnt> things that were like that's true that's </garnt>
<garnt> cheeky that and three onwards they just </garnt>
<garnt> started adding [ __ ] that would just kill </garnt>
<connor> you yeah like unless you literally like </connor>
<connor> perfect headshot yeah everything yeah </connor>
<connor> because you've played it right yeah and </connor>
<joey> there's times where you're literally </joey>
<joey> hitting everything on house of the dead </joey>
<connor> and it's just like it doesn't matter </connor>
<connor> yeah just [ __ ] dead and it's like </connor>
<connor> this game [ __ ] sucks dick [ __ ] this </connor>
<connor> game you just took my money and i don't </connor>
<joey> like it i'm a good guy </joey>
<joey> literally you're literally that kid you </joey>
<garnt> know in persona 5. you know the kid in </garnt>
<garnt> the arcade yeah like teaches you the gun </garnt>
<joey> moves </joey>
<garnt> that's literally i'm i'm just sitting </garnt>
<garnt> here i'm i'm just thinking i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> i've heard connor talk more passionately </garnt>
<connor> about something </connor>
<connor> like since i've been friends with this </connor>
<connor> time crisis </connor>
<connor> crisis is the best game and i also had </connor>
<garnt> it on ps2 </garnt>
<garnt> so that also helped okay wow that was </garnt>
<garnt> the next stage up right so i had i had </garnt>
<garnt> time gracious two </garnt>
<garnt> on the ps2 and so when i went to the </garnt>
<garnt> arcade i was like it's just like the </garnt>
<connor> simulations </connor>
<connor> like i've been waiting to use that meme </connor>
<connor> it was literally like that because i was </connor>
<connor> like i already know exactly when is the </connor>
<connor> optimization </connor>
<joey> i i know all the levels off by [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> matrix </joey>
<connor> well that was the thing as well it's </connor>
<connor> like because because you were like you </connor>
<connor> were broke and you didn't have credits </connor>
<connor> you i would legit like </connor>
<connor> it was the same thing with metal slug i </connor>
<connor> would be like i would just go up to the </connor>
<connor> kids and i'm like </connor>
<joey> hey i'm really [ __ ] good at this if </joey>
<connor> you give me a credit i'll help you get </connor>
<joey> really far and then you'll be like oh </joey>
<connor> okay sure </connor>
<connor> because then it was a win-win because </connor>
<connor> even though i was doing all the work </connor>
<connor> they felt like they were getting an </connor>
<connor> extra 15 minutes of fun </connor>
<connor> where they would have got two yeah you </connor>
<garnt> know what i mean i mean that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> the thing right where </garnt>
<connor> you know that i mean i guess arcade </connor>
<connor> games were the original pay to win </connor>
<connor> yeah because you know </connor>
<connor> like like i never met a single person </connor>
<garnt> who had completed time crisis because </garnt>
<garnt> how the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> does any kid my age complete time yeah i </garnt>
<connor> would like i would like have a fit </connor>
<connor> in my head if i even got hit once in </connor>
<connor> time crisis after a while because i was </connor>
<connor> like i knew where they all should have </connor>
<joey> been coming this man is trying to know </joey>
<joey> hit time </joey>
<connor> well it was like it was so fun because </connor>
<connor> after like you said right you're not </connor>
<connor> supposed to that the games weren't </connor>
<connor> designed for you to play it this much </connor>
<connor> yeah but this is also why they started </connor>
<connor> upping the difficulty of arcades because </connor>
<connor> people would just </connor>
<connor> sit there all day yeah and complete </connor>
<connor> games on one dollar and get 30 minutes </connor>
<connor> when they should have been getting two </connor>
<connor> minutes </connor>
<connor> and so that's why they started upping </connor>
<connor> you know now it's like all the arcade </connor>
<connor> games like even the ones that used to be </connor>
<joey> like pretty fair and used to feel good i </joey>
<joey> just [ __ ] like yeah like the mario </joey>
<joey> kart arcade game now [ __ ] that game </joey>
<joey> sucks you get one race </joey>
<joey> it's shitty you know like if you were </joey>
<joey> doing like daytona back in the day </joey>
<garnt> if you were [ __ ] good at that game </garnt>
<garnt> you kept to get you kept playing because </garnt>
<garnt> you kept getting to the checks points </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> right but now it's like you get one race </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] off that was three dollars it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> no just because you got to take a </connor>
<connor> picture with me and put it on the </connor>
<connor> character you think that's enough to </connor>
<connor> keep me happy </connor>
<joey> oh [ __ ] off mario this is [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> although to be fair every time i see </joey>
<joey> that and i'm with like three other </joey>
<connor> people i'm like they always want to play </connor>
<joey> it </joey>
<connor> you play it and then every time you play </connor>
<connor> it you're like all right </connor>
<garnt> yeah because people want to play because </garnt>
<connor> it's mario kart </connor>
<connor> yeah it plays worse than the actual </connor>
<garnt> mario kart yeah how do they do that it's </garnt>
<connor> supposed to be better what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i'm so passionate about because arcade </connor>
<garnt> games suck now </garnt>
<connor> see dog va the fall of arcade games </connor>
<connor> there's some good verizon for them </connor>
<connor> you know i think we spoke about it on </connor>
<connor> the podcast four but typing of the dead </connor>
<connor> in uh i think i hope it isn't in the one </connor>
<connor> that closed down because one of the game </connor>
<joey> centers in akihabara closed down right </joey>
<joey> right and only one of them had typing of </joey>
<joey> the dead yeah because you don't know </joey>
<joey> what typing of that is google it </joey>
<joey> uh yeah that's good um the jojo battle </joey>
<joey> royale is okay </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like a it's like an unreal </joey>
<joey> engine mod there's it's kind of [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah there's no real arcade games </joey>
<joey> now actually it's always the mech one </joey>
<connor> we even spoke about that have we oh no </connor>
<garnt> the giant mech one </garnt>
<joey> was [ __ ] amazing we don't know what </joey>
<joey> it's called but here it is </joey>
<connor> so we know what it looks like you get to </connor>
<joey> pilot a mac like you literally sit in </joey>
<connor> the cockpit </connor>
<connor> you put a seat belt on and there's like </connor>
<connor> uh gas pedals </connor>
<joey> drift pedals yeah and it's like 4d </joey>
<joey> cinema so it actually yeah it moves </joey>
<garnt> it moves as you are flying about so you </garnt>
<garnt> are literally </garnt>
<garnt> as close to a mecca pilot as you can </garnt>
<connor> possibly be and it's got ranked pvp </connor>
<joey> so you literally you literally like you </joey>
<joey> all jump in the mechs with the boys and </joey>
<joey> you can pvp against other people </joey>
<joey> literally capture the flag yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> and it's like domination i think yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah and yeah you literally like </garnt>
<garnt> it's so fun because when you smack down </garnt>
<garnt> that thrust and drift pedal </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] the chair jumps back yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> jumps back and then it's like </garnt>
<connor> like yeah like uh was it like when the </connor>
<connor> chains going up on the roller coaster </connor>
<garnt> like drifting yeah yeah it's so good </garnt>
<garnt> like drifting in the end just firing </garnt>
<garnt> missiles at the same time i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> dealing with that with the boys you know </garnt>
<joey> switch out the game </joey>
<joey> and reload the other one as you're </joey>
<connor> saying oh my god </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah we're trying to arcade after </connor>
<connor> some players yeah yeah you come to japan </connor>
<garnt> you've got to check this this is </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone says rhythm games no this </garnt>
<garnt> is the best arcade game i've played </garnt>
<connor> in japan bar none yeah i believe it's is </connor>
<joey> it </joey>
<garnt> sega yeah it's saying yeah it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> i've already seen it in </garnt>
<connor> a few are like rounds and i saw it in </connor>
<connor> sega but like yeah </connor>
<connor> it's actually insane i think it's is it </connor>
<connor> two dollars or three dollars a play it's </connor>
<joey> like yeah </joey>
<connor> two dollars not enough yeah two dollars </connor>
<garnt> a player i think but </garnt>
<joey> one play can last you you know like 15 </joey>
<joey> minutes 15 20 minutes </joey>
<joey> i'd happily play like pay like five </joey>
<joey> pounds if it was like in the uk </joey>
<connor> yeah because my god you get to pilot a </connor>
<garnt> mecca that's so cool </garnt>
<connor> oh god i don't even know what's going on </connor>
<joey> because i can't read what the [ __ ] the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] they're saying yeah like i </connor>
<joey> yeah i love it it's so funny i mean i </joey>
<connor> can read what they're saying but i don't </connor>
<connor> give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's not important to me all right </connor>
<connor> before we move on okay like i </connor>
<garnt> i like i i'm wondering why okay before </garnt>
<connor> we get to halo wars i'm wondering why </connor>
<garnt> you put apex over </garnt>
<garnt> over league all right okay is this is </garnt>
<garnt> this recency bias </garnt>
<connor> i think there's definitely a bit of </connor>
<connor> recency bias yeah um i don't know for me </connor>
<connor> league of legends was fun and i really </connor>
<garnt> really really enjoyed the time i had </garnt>
<garnt> with it and </garnt>
<garnt> it could easily be on here yeah i think </garnt>
<garnt> apex is on here just because like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know apex made learning japanese </garnt>
<garnt> fun for me </garnt>
<garnt> okay like isn't that isn't that fun yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because you're actually using it right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like </garnt>
<garnt> for me apex has been such a door opener </garnt>
<connor> like right now like </connor>
<connor> it's just like everyone's playing apex </connor>
<connor> right now and like it's so easy to be </connor>
<connor> like yo player packs let's jump in </connor>
<connor> you know yeah like uh i don't know just </connor>
<connor> anyone it's like </connor>
<joey> especially japanese or like youtubers </joey>
<connor> it's like yo let's play apex </connor>
<joey> yeah um i don't know it's so fun and i </joey>
<joey> feel like it's it's like </joey>
<garnt> even though i just started playing it </garnt>
<garnt> recently i have been playing it i did </garnt>
<garnt> start playing it at launch </garnt>
<garnt> right and i feel like the game's only </garnt>
<garnt> gotten bigger and better now and i feel </garnt>
<joey> like that's rare </joey>
<connor> for games especially battle royale like </connor>
<joey> i feel like it's more popular now than </joey>
<garnt> ever </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah and it's [ __ ] massive in </connor>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah um v cheapers man they they </garnt>
<garnt> just completely broke the system yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's crazy i mean you know it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's crazy seeing how like when it came </garnt>
<connor> out you know the story of apex is that </connor>
<connor> they they literally announced apex </connor>
<joey> legends i don't know if you knew this </joey>
<joey> a day before it came out oh [ __ ] really </joey>
<connor> because what happened was is that it was </connor>
<connor> made by the same people as titanfall </connor>
<connor> right so ea thought it says published by </connor>
<connor> yay but it's made by respawn the people </connor>
<connor> who made titanfall who made call of duty </connor>
<connor> modern warfare 2 back in the day </connor>
<connor> so you have that you have that clean fps </connor>
<connor> gameplay combined with a nutty movement </connor>
<connor> of titanfall </connor>
<connor> yeah um and yes so what happened was </connor>
<connor> that they literally were just like oh by </connor>
<connor> the way is a new battery owl </connor>
<connor> and because they thought it was gonna </connor>
<connor> bomb because it was made by the same </connor>
<connor> people who </connor>
<connor> had made titanfall yeah with no titans </connor>
<connor> in it yeah </connor>
<joey> and everyone was like yeah i'm not </joey>
<joey> playing that where the [ __ ] max the </joey>
<joey> mechs were the best part </joey>
<connor> yeah but yeah no it was a surprise hit </connor>
<connor> it [ __ ] blew up the gameplay is so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] clean </connor>
<garnt> like i mean i've like from what i heard </garnt>
<garnt> apex was just battle royales but just </garnt>
<garnt> was </garnt>
<garnt> with every mechanic refined it's so good </garnt>
<connor> it's so fun </connor>
<connor> and you know it's really like weirdly </connor>
<connor> one of the most beginner-friendly battle </connor>
<garnt> royales i think yeah </garnt>
<garnt> what i want to know is has it gotten to </garnt>
<connor> a point where everyone's just really </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] good at the game yet </garnt>
<connor> no there's a meta and everything's </connor>
<connor> broken the matchmaking is surprisingly </connor>
<connor> good like when i play ranked i </connor>
<connor> really struggle like against people my </connor>
<connor> own level when i go in like normals if </connor>
<connor> i'm like playing with uh someone who's </connor>
<connor> like got a really bad stats it'll like </connor>
<connor> even us out like i can feel like a god </connor>
<joey> but you know so in other words yes but </joey>
<joey> he's on the other side </joey>
<connor> no no no no no because i'm playing you </connor>
<joey> know i play with some people who are </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> you know arguably have no hands yeah and </garnt>
<connor> they seem to have the time of their life </connor>
<connor> right and i'm you know to me i would be </connor>
<connor> like that's not fun but they seem to you </connor>
<connor> know they </connor>
<connor> again people who you know because it's </connor>
<joey> such a position heavy game it's not </joey>
<joey> about mechanics </joey>
<joey> it's more about do like okay are you if </joey>
<joey> are you standing out in the open and </joey>
<joey> someone else is on the high ground </joey>
<connor> shooting at you you're probably gonna </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] die yeah but like you know </joey>
<connor> you don't need to have like aim god cs </connor>
<connor> go [ __ ] that's like i hate that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> fortnite felt like that as well like i </connor>
<connor> feel that like </connor>
<connor> if you just have like some form of game </connor>
<joey> knowledge which you can easily learn </joey>
<joey> you know it's easy and all the </joey>
<joey> characters are really unique it's really </joey>
<joey> fun like i don't know it's great i </joey>
<joey> really think you guys should try it out </joey>
<joey> try it out with me apex stream literally </joey>
<joey> every episode every episode i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> keep saying it until </joey>
<connor> trash taste apex when it's good like and </connor>
<connor> legit like i've made so many </connor>
<joey> new friends from it and yeah like the </joey>
<joey> other week 47 of asking the boys to play </joey>
<connor> literally like </connor>
<connor> and so the other day i actually met up </connor>
<connor> with people who i met up on apex i met </connor>
<connor> on apex </connor>
<connor> with two japanese guys oh really spent </connor>
<connor> the whole night trying to talk japanese </connor>
<connor> it was very like taxing </connor>
<connor> my god i realized i was an hour into </connor>
<connor> talking only japanese and i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i had to do this for like another </connor>
<connor> four hours of like not being able to </connor>
<joey> communicate </joey>
<joey> yeah um it will do wonders though oh no </joey>
<connor> it was definitely helping like i feel </connor>
<joey> like i definitely have like the basics </joey>
<garnt> completely locked down like it's all </garnt>
<garnt> muscle memory like i could just say [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> just talk nonsense you know that's good </garnt>
<joey> stuff oh chinchin big you know </joey>
<joey> all the stuff you need um it's the only </joey>
<joey> thing that's that matters yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah it was fun you know it was just </connor>
<connor> crazy to think that i met these guys </connor>
<connor> from just chatting [ __ ] on a video game </connor>
<garnt> literally just going in a lobby and </garnt>
<garnt> screaming broken japanese </garnt>
<garnt> and then i was hanging out with them you </garnt>
<connor> know that's cool yeah it was just chill </connor>
<garnt> like i think it's </garnt>
<connor> all about the friends we made along the </connor>
<connor> way and honestly </connor>
<garnt> which you can't say about league of </garnt>
<connor> legends exactly i have made friends from </connor>
<garnt> league of legends but like </garnt>
<garnt> it just felt like i can't imagine making </garnt>
<garnt> a friend from a guy you met in a lobby </garnt>
<connor> in league of legends so </connor>
<connor> well that's the thing it was always </connor>
<connor> weird friendships with them like with a </connor>
<connor> with it because it was always like we </connor>
<connor> were the same rank we played ranked </connor>
<connor> together </connor>
<connor> yeah this weird thing of like that that </connor>
<connor> was what it was and we were like we our </connor>
<connor> friendship was </connor>
<connor> tangential on the fact that we were both </connor>
<connor> the same rank and we were good enough to </connor>
<connor> play together </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but in apex it's like oh you </connor>
<joey> know i you know i play with a guy who's </joey>
<joey> called kyochan he's like a 45 year old </joey>
<joey> man right from </joey>
<joey> like west uh japan who's [ __ ] awful </joey>
<connor> at the game </connor>
<connor> but he's he's really funny and so like </connor>
<joey> that's like you know i like playing with </joey>
<connor> him that's </connor>
<joey> just like there's no it feels chill it's </joey>
<joey> a really chill game but it can be a </joey>
<joey> really intense game if you want it to be </joey>
<joey> yeah and it's like perfect because it </joey>
<joey> has like enough lows in it where you can </joey>
<joey> just talk </joey>
<joey> and then when the moments where you're </joey>
<joey> like fighting it's like it's focus on </joey>
<joey> fighting all right </joey>
<joey> so that's why it's on there i </joey>
<joey> legitimately think it's the best battery </joey>
<joey> i've played i've played so many of them </joey>
<joey> it deserves to be on there it's a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] great game play pex legends </joey>
<joey> um and finally halo wars i'll quickly </joey>
<joey> talk about this i played </joey>
<joey> i have probably put more hours into any </joey>
<joey> game here uh halo was probably the game </joey>
<joey> i put most hours into </joey>
<joey> really why halo wars i don't know what </joey>
<joey> it was it was me what made me </joey>
<joey> fall in love with rts's that game was </joey>
<connor> terribly </connor>
<connor> unrefined and and awfully unbalanced </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> and you know i've never played wars but </connor>
<connor> that's all i've heard about yeah that is </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> extremely unbalanced i think it was the </connor>
<connor> case of i was very fortunate that </connor>
<connor> my my four like i had three best friends </connor>
<connor> and we all loved halo wars so as a case </connor>
<connor> of every single day we just went home </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> played halo wars yeah and it was just </connor>
<connor> like the perfect game to chat to and </connor>
<connor> also be like </connor>
<connor> you know all right do this do this yeah </connor>
<garnt> i really like the idea of rts games </garnt>
<connor> i like i mean i i remember playing </connor>
<connor> command and conquer </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] much that was that was my rts </connor>
<connor> game but i i like i've never got into </connor>
<connor> rts </connor>
<connor> like more than just build a bunch of </connor>
<connor> soldiers and then click on </connor>
<connor> click on anyone who looks at you funny </connor>
<connor> that is that that's like my tactics when </connor>
<connor> it comes to rts games </connor>
<connor> i think the one thing that i really </connor>
<connor> loved about halo wars is that it really </connor>
<connor> did 2v2 and 3v3 well </connor>
<connor> i can't think of a single rts game that </connor>
<connor> has 3v3 </connor>
<connor> like can you name it it's always 1v1 </connor>
<joey> yeah and like i find that </joey>
<connor> like boring yeah like the fact that i </connor>
<connor> can be there with my mates and we can </connor>
<joey> all back each other up and then like </joey>
<joey> yeah you kill one dude's army </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] his his friend's army is literally </joey>
<connor> coming to wipe you out and then you're </connor>
<connor> like bro bring in your army where you at </connor>
<connor> man where you at </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] that actually sounds </connor>
<garnt> really fun because that's so funny i </garnt>
<connor> guess that's the reason i never </connor>
<connor> played pvp in any rts even though i know </connor>
<connor> there is there i just played the </connor>
<garnt> campaign and i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> i can complete the campaign and it's a </connor>
<connor> chill game because it's like the games </connor>
<connor> were never more than 20 </connor>
<connor> 20 30 minutes they were normally 15 10 </connor>
<connor> minutes so it was great because what </connor>
<connor> would happen is like </connor>
<connor> you know there would just be moments </connor>
<connor> where your mate or there would be like </connor>
<connor> all three of them would be attacking </connor>
<connor> your mate </connor>
<connor> and none of you are ready and you're </connor>
<connor> like yeah i'll see ya </connor>
<connor> did i play [ __ ] no like i'm just </connor>
<connor> realizing my my three by three is a lie </connor>
<connor> why is red alert two not on my three by </connor>
<connor> three red look come on and conquer red </connor>
<connor> lord too </connor>
<garnt> that's a [ __ ] amazing game and not </garnt>
<connor> many people remember it yeah halo wars 2 </connor>
<connor> is pretty good it's on uh you play on pc </connor>
<joey> it's pretty good does are the </joey>
<joey> civilization games rts </joey>
<garnt> they're like turn based it's like almost </garnt>
<garnt> turn-based right because i really really </garnt>
<joey> like this i played </joey>
<joey> two like [ __ ] crazy back in the day i </joey>
<connor> feel like it's in the category it's in </connor>
<joey> the category it's like a different style </joey>
<garnt> like i play civilization every now and </garnt>
<garnt> again because you know when you get that </garnt>
<garnt> feeling of just replaying a game every </garnt>
<joey> now and again so </joey>
<joey> i get that with sieve sometimes and i'm </joey>
<joey> just like i play one game it lasts it </joey>
<joey> lasts like eight hours i'm like okay </joey>
<joey> i've </joey>
<joey> i'm that's that that that's that's my </joey>
<garnt> one out the window now </garnt>
<connor> i'm satisfied yeah yeah honestly halo </connor>
<connor> wars is a great game i'm sure if anyone </connor>
<connor> played it </connor>
<garnt> who like played it with mates i would i </garnt>
<connor> would love to play an rts that's like </connor>

<connor> of the wild obviously um </connor>
<connor> why should marry wood out of all of the </connor>
<joey> marios okay super mario world for me </joey>
<joey> okay because </joey>
<joey> a lot of these games like especially the </joey>
<garnt> older ones like um </garnt>
<garnt> kirby's nightmare and dreamland and </garnt>
<garnt> final fantasy 6 and stuff like that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i got them as </garnt>
<garnt> hand-me-downs from my cousin so like </garnt>
<garnt> basically all the super nintendo games </garnt>
<garnt> and like especially like kirby games </garnt>
<garnt> especially </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah all hand-me-downs and super </garnt>
<garnt> mario world was one of the first </garnt>
<garnt> like mario games i had like properly sat </garnt>
<garnt> down yeah </garnt>
<garnt> knowing it was a mario game yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> you know there's like games when you're </garnt>

<joey> mario games and you can't you can't hate </joey>
<connor> on that that's literally like </connor>
<connor> one of the best games of all time it is </connor>
<joey> one of the best [ __ ] platforms </joey>
<connor> like it was a tie between super mario </connor>
<connor> world for me because we can only choose </connor>
<connor> one game per franchise right yeah </connor>
<connor> obviously </connor>
<connor> for a mario game hard as [ __ ] for me to </connor>
<joey> choose but it was a tie between super </joey>
<garnt> mario world and yoshi's island oh </garnt>
<garnt> yoshi's island i [ __ ] love you i was </garnt>
<joey> like both of them are like </joey>
<joey> equal number one for me right um but i </joey>

<joey> dude that game's [ __ ] hot like that </joey>
<garnt> level is [ __ ] hard yeah </garnt>
<garnt> have you guys ever played the original </garnt>
<joey> mario yeah yeah yeah i think i think </joey>
<joey> i've actually played </joey>
<joey> every mainline mario game because </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] nintendo re-releases it every </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] year and says </joey>
<joey> pay me 10 bucks for the same [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> game and i'm like okay did you play as a </garnt>
<connor> kid </connor>
<connor> yeah okay as a kid did you want to eat </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] chocolate the bricks </garnt>
<garnt> was that just me no </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> but like yeah as a kid i remember i i </garnt>
<garnt> have a distinct memory of just </garnt>
<garnt> looking at the bricks and just thinking </garnt>
<garnt> man those look delicious </garnt>
<connor> they kind of look like chocolate that is </connor>
<connor> definitely like i hope you didn't say </connor>
<connor> that out loud because your parents were </connor>
<connor> like oh god </connor>
<joey> oh [ __ ] we should we should take this </joey>
<garnt> game away </garnt>
<garnt> oh god all right that's just me okay in </garnt>
<connor> my life </connor>
<connor> much like gaunt right i i think my three </connor>
<connor> by three is a little bit of a lie </connor>
<connor> because there's a bunch of games on here </connor>
<connor> because to me i was like okay </connor>
<connor> for me through and through i was always </connor>
<connor> a nintendo simp </connor>
<connor> yeah nintendo seemed from the moment i </connor>
<connor> got my first game console to today </connor>
<joey> yeah but because of that i feel i've </joey>
<joey> kind of put </joey>
<joey> too many nintendo games on my 3x3 i mean </joey>
<garnt> i mean like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it's the first thing that came </garnt>
<joey> to your mind right yeah but i would okay </joey>
<joey> there's one game that i would [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> put on here on the xbox </joey>
<joey> and uh that's uh this game called ssx </joey>
<garnt> tricky </garnt>
<garnt> of course oh my god i forgot about that </garnt>
<garnt> i put so many hours into that game that </garnt>
<garnt> was such a good </garnt>
<joey> that was such a good [ __ ] game oh my </joey>
<joey> god dude </joey>
<joey> ssx tree okay for those who don't know </joey>
<garnt> ssx is the snowboarding game </garnt>
<garnt> right and it did you play snowboard kids </garnt>
<joey> as well on the n64 was that just me oh i </joey>
<joey> played a little bit of that </joey>
<joey> yeah i played a little bit of that i </joey>
<joey> think i think it was the first time i </joey>
<garnt> saw ssx3 because i think my </garnt>
<garnt> dad got it yeah because like my dad was </garnt>
<garnt> the one who bought the xbox because he </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to play like a bunch of like </garnt>
<garnt> racing car games and one of the racing </garnt>
<garnt> card games that me and my dad [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> bonded over was burn </garnt>
<connor> out three that's the [ __ ] yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing which i would also put </connor>
<connor> on my three by three but like </connor>
<connor> he also brought home this game called </connor>
<connor> ssx tricky i'm like i never [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> cared about snowboarding i didn't know </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] this is </connor>
<connor> joey we haven't seen snow we live in </connor>
<joey> australia yeah that's going to do </joey>
<joey> something legit the first time i ever </joey>
<garnt> saw snow it was an sssg </garnt>
<joey> but like i played it and the moment you </joey>
<garnt> hear that [ __ ] title screen music i </garnt>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<garnt> hell the [ __ ] yeah like to me </garnt>
<connor> i'm just getting reminded but ssx tricky </connor>
<garnt> is on like the same level as tony hawk </garnt>
<connor> yeah in my mind in terms of just </connor>
<joey> addictive gameplay </joey>
<connor> tony hawk's pro skater 2. yeah i never </connor>
<joey> played any of these games oh </joey>
<joey> sorry like ssx trick i don't know i </joey>
<connor> think the one thing i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] optimized the [ __ ] out of ssx </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah because it was probably the </connor>
<connor> one game where i was like </connor>
<joey> no no no this isn't the perfect score i </joey>
<joey> know i can fit </joey>
<connor> one more trick into this show when </connor>
<connor> you're addicted to a game it's like yeah </connor>
<joey> i know i could fit like one more 180 </joey>
<joey> into this like </joey>
<joey> trick combo of this one yeah and i would </joey>
<joey> just keep </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] playing this over and over and </joey>
<joey> over and over again i think i 100 </joey>
<joey> percent of it actually it was probably </joey>
<joey> one of the first games a hundred percent </joey>
<garnt> i think i was close to 100 percent </garnt>
<joey> as well i mean all of these games have </joey>
<garnt> 100 percent yeah yeah um in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> uh pokemon silver the original silver </joey>
<joey> it's the one game where i've actually </joey>
<joey> broken the in-game timer like i played </joey>
<garnt> so much of silver right now </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like how do you do that what is the </garnt>
<connor> in-game timer the in-game time the max </connor>
<connor> in-game time is 999 </connor>
<connor> hours and that's reasonable which is </connor>
<connor> reasonable it's like a thousand hours </connor>
<connor> right but the only way i achieve that is </connor>
<connor> because of </connor>
<connor> like you know obviously you play through </connor>
<connor> the game and then you're like okay </connor>
<connor> well i've finished i've gotten all 16 </connor>
<connor> badges what do i do now yeah </connor>
<connor> complete the decks okay i'll do that </connor>
<connor> what's the step after that </connor>
<connor> get every pokemon to level 100. okay </connor>
<connor> i've done that </connor>
<connor> right get all the shinies and i did that </connor>
<connor> with you what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i did that would you take that to </connor>
<connor> yourself i did that to myself because </connor>
<connor> at the time right i was borrowing my </connor>
<connor> friend's game boy color </connor>
<connor> right like we kind of like this was </connor>
<connor> during the time where like i had like a </connor>
<connor> couple of childhood friends like </connor>
<connor> lived nearby where we met each other </connor>
<connor> often enough where it's like </connor>
<garnt> can i borrow your n64 can i borrow your </garnt>
<garnt> super nintendo or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i never actually owned the game </garnt>
<garnt> boy color </garnt>
<connor> and but i had pokemon silver </connor>
<connor> um i don't remember where i got it from </connor>
<garnt> maybe i borrowed it from my friend </garnt>
<garnt> probably like that probably something </garnt>
<garnt> like that but like i borrowed the game </garnt>
<connor> boy color enough times where </connor>
<connor> i was like and it was the only gameboy </connor>
<connor> yeah and also silver was the only </connor>
<connor> gameboy color game i had </connor>
<connor> right as well so it's like whenever i </connor>
<connor> saw the gameboy color just sitting on my </connor>
<connor> desk i'm like </connor>
<connor> well i mean i could just [ __ ] play </connor>
<connor> this yeah and kill some time </connor>
<connor> and as a kid you know you have no </connor>
<connor> concept of time as you're playing a game </connor>
<connor> right so it's like </connor>
<connor> so yeah i just [ __ ] was like well </connor>
<connor> literally got nothing else to do other </connor>
<connor> than i guess i'll just try and catch all </connor>
<connor> the shinies </connor>
<connor> oh my god and i [ __ ] did that and </connor>
<connor> that sounds like torture and i maxed out </connor>
<connor> the in-game clock i was like oh </connor>
<connor> 999 is the max all right i got it now </connor>
<garnt> jesus yeah nice joey </garnt>
<garnt> i'm telling you like you think you're </garnt>
<garnt> like you know god thinks he's like you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> once you're into a game you get addicted </garnt>
<garnt> to it yeah i get [ __ ] no no no no no </garnt>
<garnt> no i i know you do you're on another </garnt>
<garnt> level and like kirby's uh </garnt>
<joey> nightmare in dreamland was the first </joey>
<joey> ever game i owned because the gameboy </joey>
<joey> advance was the first console i own i </joey>
<garnt> think i've played that game </garnt>
<garnt> i've never played a single kirby game </garnt>
<joey> okay this game </joey>
<joey> was the game that got me to kirby right </joey>
<joey> since then i [ __ ] love every kirby </joey>
<joey> game and like </joey>
<joey> i'm telling you like if you're ever </joey>
<joey> feeling sad </joey>
<joey> just play a kirby yeah it might be the </joey>
<connor> most like your child </connor>
<connor> yeah so i'm gonna describe you a copy of </connor>
<joey> cubby's dream literally if </joey>
<garnt> like you might think it's like childish </garnt>
<garnt> and dumb and like [ __ ] easy or </garnt>
<garnt> whatever </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but it is literally impossible to </garnt>
<joey> play a kirby game </joey>
<garnt> and not be happy like it's it's just </garnt>
<connor> it's this challenge except there is </connor>
<connor> there is there's something </connor>
<connor> there's something about it where it's </connor>
<connor> like i might be in the shittiest [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> mood </connor>
<connor> and i'll play like 30 minutes of any </connor>
<connor> kirby game yeah immediately happy </connor>
<connor> right and like i think that's why i </connor>
<connor> liked playing it because i was like i </connor>
<connor> don't want to play a game that makes me </connor>
<connor> sad i mean </connor>
<connor> later on in my adulthood i was like yes </connor>
<connor> jerry's like heavy rain </connor>
<joey> heavy rain yes metal gear solid give me </joey>
<garnt> all of that sure </garnt>
<garnt> yes uh i i would like a bit of </garnt>
<garnt> depression please and uh </garnt>
<joey> and i think again like that's another </joey>
<connor> reason why i like played a lot of like </connor>
<joey> animal crossing for example or like </joey>
<connor> you know again like pokemon it's like </connor>
<connor> you can't you put animal crossing in </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> the top nine in your life yeah damn yeah </connor>
<garnt> okay because </garnt>
<joey> every like this one in particular well </joey>
<joey> well yeah honestly </joey>
<garnt> well wild world specifically because i </garnt>
<joey> was [ __ ] obsessed with the ds </joey>
<joey> and this was one of the few this is the </joey>
<connor> ds one i was gonna say cause i heard a </connor>
<connor> lot of like </connor>
<connor> you know now that now that people have </connor>
<garnt> like calmed down about an animal </garnt>
<connor> crossing the first one i've heard a lot </connor>
<garnt> of people being like you know </garnt>
<connor> it is good but it does feel like it's </connor>
<joey> lacking in a lot of ways yeah and that </joey>
<connor> they're adding in the functions that </connor>
<connor> were in the previous ones </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah literally all the add-ons that </joey>
<garnt> they currently added </garnt>
<connor> what is the point of animal crossing </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean i i i feel like </connor>
<connor> i'm trying to understand why there's </connor>
<connor> like anti-vaxxers when i'm watching </connor>
<connor> like i like i hear i hear what you're </connor>
<connor> saying i get it but </connor>
<connor> i'm seeing it and i'm like i don't get </connor>
<joey> it at all i i totally get </joey>
<joey> people which is why i was really shocked </joey>
<connor> at </connor>
<connor> how popular the newest one got yeah </connor>
<connor> because to me </connor>
<connor> animal crossing a lot like harvest moon </connor>
<connor> yeah i always thought was like that </connor>
<connor> one niche series where it's like if you </connor>
<connor> weren't into it from the beginning </connor>
<joey> doesn't matter how many new games they </joey>
<garnt> bring out you'll never get into it i </garnt>
<garnt> mean like the more people talk about it </garnt>
<garnt> the more i'm just like well this is just </garnt>
<garnt> a pay your mortgage simulator yeah so </garnt>
<connor> i i watch it and i'm like okay so you go </connor>
<garnt> hit that rock and then you you get some </garnt>
<garnt> stone okay and then you go and talk to a </garnt>
<garnt> guy who gives you a </garnt>
<joey> recipe for something that you didn't </joey>
<joey> want and then you go and make that thing </joey>
<joey> and it's like a cabinet that you might </joey>
<joey> not need </joey>
<joey> and then i'm like confusing if you don't </joey>
<joey> want it you can sell that and then </joey>
<joey> everything is just seems </joey>
<joey> so slow and of course it's nintendo so </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] is just unnecessarily complicated </connor>
<connor> like i saw someone going to like uh </connor>
<connor> someone else's island </connor>
<connor> and it took like a minute of like </connor>
<joey> cutscenes to go to someone's island or </joey>
<joey> something yeah and then like everything </joey>
<connor> just seemed slow </connor>
<joey> in it and i was like why i think that's </joey>
<joey> the entire point of animal crossing it's </joey>
<connor> supposed to be slow </connor>
<connor> because it's not supposed to be like </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> uh [ __ ] uh harvest moon </joey>
<garnt> i get the sims though right because </garnt>
<joey> you're kind of like you're kind of </joey>
<joey> trying to </joey>
<joey> you you're kind of like living a life </joey>
<joey> like that maybe that maybe you couldn't </joey>
<garnt> like live </garnt>
<joey> in real life you know what's really </joey>
<garnt> weird i never got into the sims </garnt>
<garnt> i know i never got into the sims i </garnt>
<joey> always thought sims was really boring </joey>
<garnt> yeah which is weird because of an animal </garnt>
<garnt> crossing because the thing is i really </garnt>
<garnt> like simulation games </garnt>
<garnt> but i've never like never a life </garnt>
<garnt> simulator game i've always liked what it </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<joey> you know why i never go into the sims </joey>
<connor> because it wasn't cute </connor>
<connor> honestly i understand that honestly you </connor>
<joey> look at harvest moon you look at animal </joey>
<joey> crossing you're like that's [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> adorable i </connor>
<connor> i was i was never into sims but like </connor>
<connor> when i started voice acting and it's a </connor>
<connor> weird tangent yeah like i started seeing </connor>
<connor> sims voice acting project everywhere </connor>
<connor> right people making their own movies in </connor>
<connor> sims </connor>
<garnt> this was a huge thing oh yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> machinima yeah and i was just like </garnt>
<connor> what the [ __ ] this is ugly and it looks </connor>
<connor> dumb yeah and it's like the animations </connor>
<connor> of sims like </connor>
<connor> yeah and then they would you have to </connor>
<garnt> like voice act to it and i'm </garnt>
<connor> i feel like that's part of the like old </connor>
<connor> age of the internet there's something </connor>
<connor> there's some campiness to it that i feel </connor>
<garnt> like has its own charm </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right absolutely it would be like </garnt>
<connor> it's like this oscar-worthy drama </connor>
<connor> performed via sims animation it's like </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> but i think that's the whole appeal </joey>
<connor> right because when uh animal crossing </connor>
<connor> first came out </connor>
<connor> right i think i read this somewhere and </connor>
<connor> correct me if i'm wrong internet but </connor>
<connor> i think the whole appeal of animal </connor>
<connor> crossing was it was supposed to be </connor>
<connor> marketed towards </connor>
<connor> housewives in japan right who wanted </connor>
<connor> something to do </connor>
<connor> as you know their husbands or </connor>
<connor> significant others were out working all </connor>
<connor> day yeah that's literally how they </connor>
<connor> marketed it because i was like it was a </connor>
<connor> non-challenging game </connor>
<joey> no literally it was like it was a game </joey>
<connor> where i was like are you tired of being </connor>
<joey> in the kitchen all day </joey>
<joey> yeah literally it's like because it's </joey>
<garnt> it's so not challenging </garnt>
<connor> and also it's non-stressful either it's </connor>
<connor> like it's a game that like </connor>
<garnt> literally just gets all your stress off </garnt>
<connor> because you forget about everything in </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> in your real world yeah where you can </connor>
<connor> just focus on a completely </connor>
<connor> separate just there are no you know </connor>
<connor> stresses or no </connor>
<joey> i guess like bad things to happen with </joey>
<joey> like any consequence whatsoever in this </joey>
<joey> world </joey>
<joey> right so it's literally nintendo was </joey>
<joey> like imma create a distraction for </joey>
<joey> stressed adults </joey>
<garnt> and call it animal crossing because i </garnt>
<garnt> remember my first and only experience </garnt>
<garnt> with animal crossing was the original </garnt>
<garnt> animal crossing on the gamecube </garnt>
<connor> right and the only reason i knew about </connor>
<connor> it right </connor>
<connor> was because i don't i think for the </connor>
<connor> longest time it just wasn't available in </connor>
<connor> the uk like yeah </connor>
<connor> it was only available like they </connor>
<connor> translated it but it was only available </connor>
<connor> in the us </connor>
<connor> yeah and i had heard about it from like </connor>
<connor> this nintendo gaming pc i don't know </connor>
<connor> gaming magazine yeah gaming magazine </connor>
<connor> gaming magazine that's what i meant to </connor>
<connor> say this nintendo gaming magazine </connor>
<connor> and they were like it just got like </connor>
<connor> super good reviews and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> holy [ __ ] this must be a banger of the </connor>
<connor> game every [ __ ] review is given </connor>
<connor> every review is giving this five out of </connor>
<connor> five yeah i'm just like holy [ __ ] this </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> this this is a must-get game why is this </connor>
<connor> not available in the uk right so i </connor>
<connor> literally had to like </connor>
<connor> look up some like import websites and </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> like seriously like i had to import </connor>
<connor> animal crossing from the us </connor>
<connor> buy like a specialized import disk where </connor>
<connor> like because </connor>
<connor> um yeah because um old gamecube games </connor>
<connor> were region logged so you couldn't just </connor>
<connor> put a us disk into a uk device </connor>
<connor> you needed a special disk that you </connor>
<connor> needed to insert into the gamecube um to </connor>
<joey> regen unlock it so that you can put </joey>
<connor> animal crossing into yeah yeah and </connor>
<joey> so i had to research and do that to do </joey>
<connor> that by myself with a </connor>
<connor> very limited budget because i i didn't </connor>
<connor> really have much of a budget to work </connor>
<connor> with back then </connor>
<connor> um but i i had saved up and i brought </connor>
<connor> animal crossing </connor>
<connor> and i was just like this is gonna be </connor>
<connor> amazing guys this is gonna be an amazing </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<connor> i've imported this game which is [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> expensive to import a game and i bought </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> extra hardware on top of that just so i </garnt>
<garnt> could play the game because every review </garnt>
<garnt> said it was amazing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then i started playing it i'm </garnt>
<joey> just like when's the gameplay kicking </joey>
<joey> i was like okay it's an awfully long </joey>
<garnt> cutscene yeah yeah i was like okay </garnt>
<joey> okay i was picking apples i'm just like </joey>
<connor> so i'm </connor>
<connor> the gameplay is going to kick in </connor>
<connor> sometime i'm going to have a point to </connor>
<connor> why i'm doing this </connor>
<connor> because i i expected it to be on the </connor>
<connor> same level as like pokemon </connor>
<connor> or stuff like that when i'm catching </connor>
<connor> stuff or i'm like i'm going on an </connor>
<connor> adventure yeah and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> okay surely when i pay off this mortgage </connor>
<connor> that's when the gameplay all kicking </connor>
<connor> so i play i play animal crossing and </connor>
<connor> like and i </connor>
<connor> i and i [ __ ] paid tom nook back or </connor>
<connor> whatever the [ __ ] is i pay off </connor>
<connor> i pay off my mortgage because i'm just </connor>
<connor> like there must be a reason why every </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<garnt> every magazine is giving this five stars </garnt>
<garnt> pay off my mortgage </garnt>
<garnt> and then the game just continues and </garnt>
<garnt> then tom looks like </garnt>
<garnt> here's another mortgage </garnt>
<joey> what's interesting is like okay because </joey>
<joey> you like games like </joey>
<joey> banjo-kazooie or like jrpgs where </joey>
<joey> there's like a whole like </joey>
<joey> collect like a collecting element to it </joey>
<connor> right yeah like linear games more than </connor>
<joey> open world and stuff like that i i do </joey>
<garnt> like linear games more than openly right </garnt>
<joey> i like it's funny because i feel like </joey>
<garnt> i do like the idea of open world games </garnt>
<garnt> but if i'm going to sit down and play </garnt>
<garnt> something then i much prefer linear </garnt>
<joey> games right because one of my favorite </joey>
<joey> aspects of animal crossing personally is </joey>
<joey> like the whole like </joey>
<connor> catching fish and bugs and collecting </connor>
<connor> all the artworks and collecting all the </connor>
<connor> furniture </connor>
<connor> like it's basically the collecting </connor>
<connor> portion of it right whereas a lot of </connor>
<connor> other people who play the game you know </connor>
<connor> enjoy the whole like you know </connor>
<connor> diy you know creating your own amazing </connor>
<connor> looking town amazing looking house kind </connor>
<connor> of thing to me that's like </connor>
<connor> second yeah number one for me is </connor>
<connor> definitely like i need to complete my </connor>
<connor> fish index i need to complete my bug </connor>
<connor> index </connor>
<connor> why why why do you want to do that </connor>
<connor> because i got that love </connor>
<connor> from playing all the jrpgs right and </connor>
<connor> like and </connor>
<connor> obviously six is up there because like </connor>
<connor> there was that for six </connor>
<connor> for me as well but like i think the </connor>
<connor> reason why i picked six and i think </connor>
<connor> why final fantasy 6 is my favorite not </connor>
<connor> only final fantasy game but my favorite </connor>
<connor> jrpg ever </connor>
<connor> yeah is because like it was the first </connor>
<connor> game where i was like this is a work of </connor>
<connor> art </connor>
<connor> right like this is like not just a game </connor>
<connor> it's like the gameplay is like </connor>
<connor> cool you know i've played all the </connor>
<connor> previous final fantasies like four and </connor>
<connor> one and [ __ ] like that </connor>
<connor> right the gameplay is basically the same </connor>
<connor> but six was the first time where i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i didn't know story could be this good i </connor>
<connor> didn't know game music could be this </connor>
<connor> good </connor>
<connor> i didn't know you could have this much </connor>
<garnt> immersion in a game </garnt>
<garnt> yeah where and i got to like the fight </garnt>
<garnt> like the fact that you know people still </garnt>
<garnt> talk </garnt>
<joey> to this day about like the final fight </joey>
<garnt> scene right yeah i like the six </garnt>
<garnt> like final fantasy 6 i feel like it's </garnt>
<garnt> overshadowed by final fantasy vii but </garnt>
<garnt> everyone i know who's played final </garnt>
<garnt> fantasy 6 holds it higher than final </garnt>
<joey> fantasy xv i've always said the true </joey>
<connor> final fantasy that's like </connor>
<connor> six is the true final fantasy fans pick </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah right because it's like </connor>
<connor> you're not persuaded by like the </connor>
<connor> graphics quote unquote because this was </connor>
<connor> the last </connor>
<connor> 2d final fantasy iron seven is roblox </connor>
<connor> yeah seven is roblox but people still </connor>
<connor> put it on this [ __ ] like pedestal of </connor>
<connor> graphics right it's like </connor>
<connor> what are you seeing and like you know </connor>
<connor> don't get me wrong seven is also a good </connor>
<connor> game yeah </connor>
<connor> i also like seven but six was i don't </connor>
<connor> know there's something about it where i </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> this game could look like absolute [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> right and </connor>
<connor> the story and the music and everything </connor>
<connor> just the immersion of getting into this </connor>
<connor> world </connor>
<connor> is so [ __ ] well done yeah where it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i don't care how this game looks um yeah </connor>
<connor> it was like </connor>
<connor> to this day like the [ __ ] battle </connor>

<joey> judge you there's a lot of there's a lot </joey>
<joey> of final </joey>
<garnt> talked about hating turn-based battles </garnt>
<connor> yeah i am regretting </connor>
<connor> uh not putting i wish i put runescape on </connor>
<garnt> my list now </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah i'm surprised runescape wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> on your list i played runescape that was </garnt>
<joey> like the first game i ever like had a </joey>
<connor> membership </connor>
<joey> for actually maybe club penguin yeah </joey>
<joey> club penguin was the first one for me </joey>
<connor> penguin on my list dude going on those </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] tubes down there the snow slope </connor>
<joey> tipping the ice becoming the cia agent </joey>
<joey> like definitely like when you say </joey>
<joey> emotion in the world man i was so into </joey>

<joey> going to like monkey island and stuff oh </joey>
<connor> my god </connor>
<connor> so good just put runescape on my list </connor>
<garnt> yeah i want to want to remake my three </garnt>
<garnt> by three after talking to you guys about </garnt>
<garnt> it i could honestly make a three by </garnt>
<joey> three of like </joey>
<garnt> each console like did you would you want </garnt>
<garnt> to talk about tawario at all </garnt>
<joey> terraria okay terraria for me was like </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> when it came out i had already like </joey>
<joey> known about minecraft </joey>
<connor> because minecraft obviously came out </connor>
<connor> before terraria why is minecraft not on </connor>
<connor> here in terrarius </connor>
<connor> i thought you liked minecraft more than </connor>
<joey> terraria i think minecraft for me is </joey>
<joey> kind of like </joey>
<joey> i like it and it's a game that i can </joey>
<connor> always come back to </connor>
<connor> but i don't think i was like as heavily </connor>
<garnt> into it as i was with terraria because </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> i think terraria came out when i was in </garnt>
<connor> maybe like middle school or high school </connor>
<connor> or something </connor>
<connor> okay and the only ever time where i </connor>
<connor> would spend </connor>
<connor> like i would not sleep right and be in </connor>
<connor> like a [ __ ] skype call with my </connor>
<connor> friends in high school </connor>
<connor> was playing terraria right like there </connor>
<connor> were so many nights where </connor>
<connor> after school you know we'd be on the bus </connor>
<connor> home we'd be like all right </connor>
<connor> we're playing terraria after dinner yeah </connor>
<connor> like 7 8 pm </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah all right cool we all get on a </connor>
<connor> skype call and we [ __ ] play tomorrow </connor>
<connor> till like 6 a.m like all right see you </connor>
<connor> in school in two hours </connor>
<connor> like i had so many nights like that </connor>
<connor> playing terraria right i don't know why </connor>
<connor> i could have easily done that with </connor>
<connor> minecraft to be honest but i think it's </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<joey> i don't know there's something about </joey>
<joey> like side-scrolling games that just </joey>
<connor> just just tickle my fancy it looks fun </connor>
<connor> every time i see terraria i'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> that looks like fun </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean was there a point to </garnt>
<garnt> terraria </garnt>
<connor> it's kind of like is there a point in </connor>
<joey> minecraft yeah it's like it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like the point of my i mean there is </joey>
<joey> actually like a story where it's like </joey>
<joey> you have to go through and like there's </joey>
<joey> like a bunch of </joey>
<joey> story dungeons kind of thing right you </joey>
<joey> have to discover right yeah </joey>
<joey> there is an end game there's a bunch of </joey>
<joey> content for free right oh yeah </joey>
<joey> everyone's always like the chad terraria </joey>
<joey> dlc for free yeah </joey>
<connor> exactly i think i have terraria i think </connor>
<connor> i paid for it i just never played it i </connor>
<connor> don't know why </connor>
<joey> it's really really fun and it's it's </joey>
<connor> it's like minecraft for me as well where </connor>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> if i just need like a game to just kind </connor>
<connor> of mindlessly play and just relax too </connor>
<connor> then i'll either put minecraft tutorials </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah it's just a other than that other </joey>
<joey> than that it is the most vanilla 3x3 </joey>
<garnt> i've ever made i mean like i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> totally understand why it's your 3x3 </garnt>
<garnt> uh it's this is very much a joey 3x3 </garnt>
<joey> these are like nine games that i can </joey>
<joey> always come back to </joey>
<joey> and it's probably the most amount of </joey>
<joey> time i've ever spent on any game i've </joey>
<connor> wrote down a bunch of other games that i </connor>
<joey> wish i could have put on </joey>
<joey> yeah i think i did too borderlands 2 i </joey>
<joey> thought was really [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> league of legends oh i pulled it i put </joey>
<joey> gary's mod on here </joey>
<garnt> maybe portal 2 mario party 2. </garnt>
<connor> yeah i'm surprised nobody put mario </connor>
<connor> party here because i wanted to talk </connor>
<joey> about mario about the party </joey>
<joey> party too with that story mission </joey>
<joey> challenge oh hands down the best my </joey>
<joey> reply </joey>
<joey> the amount of blisters i've gotten from </joey>
<connor> mario party man </connor>
<connor> yeah my god whoever designs </connor>
<connor> the like arc yeah whoever designed the </connor>
<garnt> n64 controller </garnt>
<garnt> like he just hated humanity he woke up </garnt>
<connor> and he chose violence yeah </connor>
<connor> he would like put it into games where </connor>
<connor> i'm like i'm sure there's better </connor>
<connor> solutions </connor>
<connor> that was like a rowing down the uh uh </connor>
<connor> rowing down a like a raft thing yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> the man just the man just saw an </garnt>
<garnt> ergonomics book and just set it on fire </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> like yeah because yeah like i said with </connor>
<connor> the rowing one </connor>
<connor> the the mechanic was you to like go this </connor>
<connor> way if you wanted the boat to go this </connor>
<connor> way or go the other way if you wanted to </connor>
<connor> go that way yeah i'm pretty sure that's </connor>
<connor> if i might be wrong </connor>
<connor> i think so and uh i'm like you could </connor>
<joey> have just done literally anything else </joey>
<connor> like why did </connor>
<joey> you know there's like eleanor yeah </joey>
<connor> my favorite mario party 2 mini game was </connor>
<garnt> i think it was on mario party 2. </garnt>
<garnt> it was one where you have to like there </garnt>
<garnt> was like it was like swamps domino i </garnt>
<garnt> love that one oh that was a good one </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] no you have to like mash like </joey>
<connor> knock down as many likes </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah i love the one the </connor>
<connor> skateboarding one as well oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> uh the blow up the balloon and like as </garnt>
<garnt> full as you think it can go </garnt>
<garnt> oh that was a good one that was a good </garnt>
<joey> one that was a good one yeah i just love </joey>
<connor> the fact that [ __ ] the go-karting one </connor>
<joey> go-karting one [ __ ] sucks </joey>
<joey> what i love about too is just that it </joey>
<connor> doesn't [ __ ] around it does not hold </connor>
<joey> your hand </joey>
<connor> it's like if you [ __ ] up you [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so good </connor>
<joey> um pokemon coliseum oh oh stadium for me </joey>
<joey> on gamecube </joey>
<garnt> the one with the story yeah and we could </garnt>
<garnt> catch other people's pokemon the </garnt>
<garnt> darkness i realized like i got </garnt>
<garnt> super into pokemon snap pokemon snap was </garnt>

<garnt> march oh wow wait wait to spoil it let's </garnt>
<garnt> go </garnt>
<garnt> um uh professor layton i actually really </garnt>
<joey> liked those games </joey>
<joey> i played the first one it was really </joey>
<joey> really good yeah and then i had an </joey>
<connor> honorable mention for the worst [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> game i've ever bought in my life </connor>
<connor> uh and i completely regretted it we </connor>
<connor> music probably </connor>
<connor> you ever seen this game no [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> garbage game </connor>
<connor> you had to buy it with a controller as </connor>
<connor> well so it was like 90 bucks when you </connor>
<connor> were a kid </connor>
<connor> so i asked my parents for it because i </connor>
<connor> was like wow look at shigeru miyamoto on </connor>
<connor> stage [ __ ] wagon </connor>
<connor> you get this game and literally to play </connor>
<connor> the instruments you just like waggle a </connor>
<joey> controller and it sounds like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and like that's the whole game there's a </joey>
<connor> whole i'm gonna show you it later you're </connor>
<joey> gonna be like oh is that the one where </joey>
<joey> you have to like conduct </joey>
<connor> you can conduct and it doesn't work very </connor>
<joey> well at all and then there's one where </joey>
<joey> you like can play a trumpet and all you </joey>
<joey> do is press the button and hold the wii </joey>
<joey> this i think i've seen and then there's </joey>
<connor> one where you play guitar and you just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] it was garbage i've seen </connor>
<joey> like i've seen meme videos of it </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] oh yeah for me horizon zero dawn i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i i feel like self-explanatory </garnt>
<garnt> anything with a good story and good </garnt>
<joey> characters fire emblem three houses </joey>
<joey> yeah i put fire emblem awakening oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> that was really </garnt>
<garnt> the gameplay more than the story and </garnt>
<garnt> fire emblem yeah i i mean i the reason i </garnt>
<garnt> put three houses on </garnt>
<garnt> is because i'm ah about the gameplay </garnt>
<connor> because it's turn based but </connor>
<connor> it was just fire emblem with persona and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like yeah literally </connor>
<connor> this is this is everything i need yeah </connor>
<connor> like this gives me a reason to get </connor>
<connor> through </connor>
<connor> get uh play through the game uh metroid </connor>
<connor> pla metroid prime </connor>
<connor> oh cool uh [ __ ] incredible uh and </connor>
<connor> that was one of the few games where i </connor>
<connor> was totally invested in the world um </connor>
<connor> and it went again what i when i went </connor>
<connor> again </connor>
<connor> went against what i said before because </connor>
<connor> you had to kind of figure it out </connor>
<connor> yourself </connor>
<connor> yeah um but the </connor>
<connor> walking gameplay season one i mean </connor>
<connor> that's uh oh this is the </connor>
<joey> telltale game yeah wow um that was i </joey>
<garnt> mean bro </garnt>
<joey> it was good and then it became bra i </joey>
<garnt> mean it wasn't really a game it was just </garnt>
<joey> a good story yeah </joey>
<connor> for me uh uh okami is up there yeah okay </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] good uh obviously i said </connor>
<garnt> rhythm heaven </garnt>
<connor> link to the past yeah wii sports yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah uh smash bros melee obviously </connor>
<garnt> yeah obviously um </garnt>
<connor> and then like recently like i recently </connor>
<connor> just played like the two bayonetta games </connor>
<connor> yeah those were really [ __ ] good to </connor>
<joey> honestly this there's too many like why </joey>
<connor> why why do we have to just confine it to </connor>
<connor> nine because you know you gotta have </connor>
<connor> something to talk about </connor>
<connor> like a five </connor>
<garnt> what i've realized after uh doing this </garnt>
<joey> episode is that </joey>
<joey> um there are so many games that i love </joey>
<joey> that i just did not remember </joey>
<joey> yeah um because i i i go back to my </joey>
<garnt> comfort picks but man and there's a </garnt>
<joey> there's a lot of games there what's the </joey>
<joey> one game that we're all gonna like if we </joey>
<joey> had to pick one game after today that we </joey>
<joey> have to </joey>
<joey> then we're gonna go back and play red </joey>
<garnt> alert two </garnt>
<joey> ssx is tricky for me honestly you didn't </joey>
<connor> mention the soundtrack of ssx tricky </connor>
<connor> because because </connor>
<joey> the amount of time like trick </joey>
<joey> is right that's what made that game so </joey>
<joey> good to play man </joey>
<garnt> like because i realized the reason i </garnt>
<garnt> freaked out was because for the longest </garnt>
<garnt> time i couldn't remember </garnt>
<garnt> why i wanted to learn snowboarding so </garnt>
<garnt> bad </garnt>
<garnt> i had just thought that snow </garnt>
<garnt> snowboarding seems cool </garnt>
<joey> you didn't listen to the theme as you </joey>
<joey> were learning to snowboard i did not </joey>
<joey> and uh like you stopped like you had </joey>
<joey> just reminded me yeah </joey>
<garnt> ssx tricky is the sole reason why i </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to snowboard </garnt>
<joey> so bad and that's why yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> tony hawk's pro skater 2 was the reason </joey>
<joey> why i wanted to learn how to do this </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> i i just blanked out that memory of my </garnt>
<garnt> life </garnt>
<connor> my [ __ ] god </connor>
<connor> boys for halo wars with me yeah yeah um </connor>
<connor> i mean like i think i think we've gotten </connor>
