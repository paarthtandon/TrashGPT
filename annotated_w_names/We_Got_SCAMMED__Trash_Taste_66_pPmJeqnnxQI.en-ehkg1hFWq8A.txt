<SPEAKER_02> - Smell my jeans, Garnt, smell my jeans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get that shit out of my face, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like musky shit.
- That's dripping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with your fucking sweat,
Connor, is that what you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about when you mean drip? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - God, you don't know
how many people would pay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for that experience.
- Smell my jeans, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Smell Connor's jeans.
- Give a sniff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get that shit out of my face, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Smell his jeans.
(upbeat music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey guys, welcome to another episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of Trash Taste podcast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm your boy, I'm not your boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am the boy with the boys.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking stumbled
through that, didn't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that the worst
intro you've ever done? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, my all my
intros are the worst one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could feel, I could
feel like your mind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just like starting up as
you're saying that sentence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like...
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, you know, those
really old lawn mowers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your dad has, where you have to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (revving) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like five times until
it finally gets started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's my brain right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So how are you guy's week's been? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just had an absolutely
fucking ordeal this morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so this is like fucking what now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like volume eight of Gaijin
versus Japanese Bank, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we're, I think we're
like at that volume now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thriller and Manilla,
Gaijin versus bank. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The bank strikes back" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I mean, like, to me, like, now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, going to a Japanese bank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of like going to the dentist now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like I do anything I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to put it off, right?
- I like my dentist actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah, I really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been great here, the
bank's way, far worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would rather have like
an anal rectal cavity, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever that is, opposed
to going to the bank. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - An anal rectal cavity at the dentist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At the dentist, I would rather her use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that drill on my ass.
- Let me see your teeth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would rather her do
anything experimental. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, honestly,
I agree because like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been putting off going
to the bank for ages, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I've needed to send
money abroad to back home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Because right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm helping my parents pay for
the mortgage of their house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they can retire and
have a nice comfy life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Good Asian son right there.
- Flexing right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just being a good Asian son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As you do, so, I mean,
I've been doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like basically since I started YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but since I moved to
Japan, obviously a lot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> most of my money is now in
my Japanese bank account </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I've known for a while </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've needed, that I was going to need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to transfer money into
my British bank account. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was just dreading
this, right, as you do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As you do with any
Japanese bank experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> What I didn't realize was
that I was going to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the biggest ordeal I've
had yet in the Japanese bank. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, God.
- So I mean like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm just like, okay,
I booked the appointment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you can, you
can't do anything online, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as we've said, on call. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - God forbid you can be you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the 21st century.
- [Joey] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so I turn up as usual and normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when we turn up to the bank,
they normally have one guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who works there that
acts as an interpreter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he speaks English
and Japanese, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So he wasn't there today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So...
- So they just let you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> do the appointment, did they know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they knew it was me, they knew. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you know the guy, you normally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they weren't
gonna be like, uh, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, that sounds Japanese (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, so it was the same woman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that handles our accounts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the interpreter, the
guy who speaks English, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't there this time.
- [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I'm just like, "Okay, this is gonna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is gonna like, this is gonna put my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaks Japanese) to the test, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is gonna, this is going to stretch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to the fucking limits, right?"
because, because I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thankfully I have been, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> practicing as much as I can.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Especially my listening skills. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But this is gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this was going to stretch
it to the limit, so- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like bank hard mode.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was bank like fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Doom impossible mode or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, we start the process and we take it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we take inventory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I bring all my usual stuff, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got my hunker, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got my bank book, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got my bank card, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> got everything.
- Fully prepped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, fully prepped.
- [Joey] All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, I'm experienced.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a fucking Japanese bank war veteran. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know what the fuck I need to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at Japanese banks, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know what happens in the battlefield. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'm like, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we start the process, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can I transfer money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to my British bank account please? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or transfer money overseas?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then she starts explaining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me the process and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fucking hell, okay, like, I understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, 70% of what you're saying" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like, I'm like, great, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm following what she's saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "You know what? maybe, maybe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe this, maybe this
will be a smooth process" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I put in my name, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put in my address </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything I need to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we get to the actual transfer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> part of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the actual transferring </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> money to an overseas bank. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so she asks me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about the bank and I say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, it's a British bank. It's Barclays, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's my account" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then she says, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and here's where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's where my Japanese got tested. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She said something, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I heard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I heard "transfer" and I heard "purpose" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I heard "connection" right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Okay.
- So in my mind- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Stitch it all together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no 'cause this- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's how you do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause that's just how you do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I heard those words,
so I stitched the meaning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the words to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "what was the purpose of the transfer?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? 'Cause that's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Naturally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's naturally what I assume. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I was like, oh great,
the purpose of my transfer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "My friend in Nigeria. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A prince actually."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I tried to explain in the
most broken Japanese I can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the purpose of my transfer
is just to transfer money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to myself in England.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, British bank account </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in England, my British
bank account in England, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> transferring money to that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And she was like, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and re-explains and she re-explains it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and now I'm just like, okay,
so how do I explain to her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm going to be paying
a mortgage for my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in England and I'm just
like, fucking hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is-
- I struggle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to spell mortgage in English, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, I'm just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, wait,
mortgage has a T in it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, (speaking Japanese). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the most I can come up with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Which is basically- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Better than I would have done, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is basically, for the purposes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of my parents, I'm paying for- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Paying for their house.
- Paying for their house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And she was like, no, no, no, no, no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we just like try
to brokenly communicate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to each other and then she just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then she whips out
the Google translate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like-
- Yeah, I was about to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why don't you whip this out?
- And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, here we go, here we go.
- [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then she Google translates it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she's just like,
and the translation is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Do you have any evidence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have a connection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the purpose, to the
person you're transferring to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the purpose of this transfer?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What? It's-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's me!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "It's literally me"
- "It's literally... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's me! are we, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this a fucking circus
we're running here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what's, what's going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like how can I prove </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I have a connection to myself?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Right?
- It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I were you, I would have been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "So, how many fucking Garnt Mayatapos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> do you know in the world?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Tell me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was dreading about Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is that nothing's ever good enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no.
- It's like, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to see a passport of other you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, because, because
to a Japanese person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sending money to yourself overseas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a concept that
they don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "Why?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the first thing I say was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, I mean, my names are identical </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't that enough proof?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she was like, "No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's because in Japanese bank,
your first name comes second </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and your surname comes first, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's Manitapo Garnt" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then in my British
bank account, Barclays, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's Garnt Manitapo
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and because the names don't match, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they obviously assume-
- Different person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - They obviously assume
I'm like a duel citizen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm fucking Jason Bourne </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with five different identities. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He whips out the pistol bag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What, which one, it's actually Russian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- So I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do I need?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And she was like, "I
dunno" I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I dunno, do you have any bills?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't have any bills
'Cause I live in Japan now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but will like a bank statement do?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And she was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, sure. A bank statement will do" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do I have to print it out?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she says, "Yes, it
has to be printed out" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And scanned to us and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, shit because obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thanks-
- "Can I borrow your printer?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thankfully, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with British banks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I can access my statements
very conveniently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on my phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you can't just do this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And on any, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on any electronic device </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, "Okay, how can, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, this is where my
engineering problem skills </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like commence" Because I, first up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first thing I asked her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like, "How, like how much like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can I go to the Konbini? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to print off my, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to print off my statement" right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she says, "Sure, how
much time would that take?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I asked "How much time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is this appointment booked for?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she says "I have an hour" All right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the appointment's booked for an hour, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I have an hour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time slot, because I am not fucking going, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I am not coming back to the bank, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just for the purpose of this transfer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm not missing out
on this appointment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm like "Fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm doing this right
now" and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, "I'll be right back, I'm going to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the Konbini, I'm going
to print out my stuff" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "To print out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what I could have showed you digitally" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- I could've just done this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I could have sent it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to you in an email.
- Email. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, so I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, "Do you have a
fax? You can fax it to us" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I rush off to the Konbini </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I realized that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so there's, so every Konbini
has a printer, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's only a few ways
to connect to that printer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - One way- (laughs)
- I know, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You see where I'm going with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One way is via phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and the other way is via USB stick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah.
- So I was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, great, maybe, I got it on my phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'll just connect via my phone" so I- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think you will.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that to me was like my first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my first option to problem
solve this fucking issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that shouldn't be an issue, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I tried to download the app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to connect to the printer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The app's not available internationally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course.
- I have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my Google Play store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is still linked to my UK account. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily, luckily </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that wasn't too big of an issue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I have a Japanese account as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for this exact purpose of
downloading Japanese apps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I download the app and
everything is in Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my nihongo is not jouzu
enough to figure out Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, my nihongo was not good enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to figure out this app. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what I did is, I have
a second phone, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you translate it.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And this second phone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is my UK phone, so-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I have like this old UK phone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an iPhone five,
which is like my phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I upgraded to this new phone now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is, the only
purpose for that phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just so I have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> UK SIM card so I can phone home, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or if any UK people want to phone me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm fucking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm fucking on my phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with another phone Googling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Google translating my phone
with another phone (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've done that.
- And I'm just looking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a little fucking clown in the Konbini </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm there for about
four, 10, 15 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to get this phone
to connect to the printer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It just does not want to connect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] No, no.
- Fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what is
going on with the app, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even think it was the language. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just think it was the app. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I've tried, I've tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> using that app and I
tried for like an hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just doesn't connect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is why I just always
carry around the USB stick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right? Same, same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just never know when
you need to print something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fuck, this isn't going to work, okay" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 15 minutes have passed,
the time is ticking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've only got like, at this point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've only got half an hour
left of the appointment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I also still need to fill
out the rest of the form. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I've got another 15 minutes at most. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "Okay, I
need to find another way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thankfully, I remember I
brought my laptop with me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Great.
- Good stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I can and I have a USB stick as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my bag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like, "Great,
I just need internet" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so unfortunately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with Japanese sims, you can't
tether internet (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's like, it's like an option </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to pay for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly, exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm just like fucking Googling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Where is the nearest internet Hotwire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> internet hotspot?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I look for coffee shops, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I'm like brilliant,
there's a fucking coffee- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or like McDonald's or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like everything
you do, there's another thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like side quest to
complete the side quest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I'm gonna have to order
a drink at Starbucks" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Brilliant, there's a Tully's coffee shop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like right, you know,
a block down from me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I fucking sprint to this coffee shop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to buy a coffee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause that's just adding more time on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like outside the coffee shop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like fucking Watchdogs, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I like, I take out my laptop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle of the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the middle of the street,
I take out my laptop, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> open it, fucking connect to the wifi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so ghetto.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like a scene of Watchdogs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or something where I'm just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Turning off the traffic lights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm hacking-
- Into the main frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm hacking the system,
so I like download, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> download my, download my statement, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put it in my USB stick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> run back to the fucking Konbini, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then I can finally
print off the statement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and by then 20 minutes have passed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking run back, run back to the bank </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Do I have enough time to
complete this transfer?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's like, yes, yes,
we'll make enough time to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thank fucking God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I hand her the statement, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's like, "Okay,
great, we can use this" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, so we start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> filling out the rest of the form. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So she asked me for my
British account number </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and account details. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I whip out my
Barclay's debit cards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And she looks at it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, we could have just used that" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I am literally about to scream right now" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you know, if you ever ask a bank, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like person, like, being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why didn't you tell me that before?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then they'll just be like,
"Well, you didn't ask" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - (mumbles) Pandora's fucking box. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like "Cool, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thank you for giving me all the options" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was there a transfer
limit that you could do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There wasn't a transfer
limit thankfully enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But the transfer itself cost $80, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just like, fucking Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I think the reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why Japanese banks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I read up on this before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I had to help Aki do
the exact same thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like send money back home </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> for her parents and like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to go through this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously I didn't have the problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the Google translate thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I got it done in one go.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Jesus Christ, like why is this just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> such an arbitrary process, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it shouldn't take this long" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I saw like a thing being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh it's because Japan has, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> run into like a lot of, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money laundering issues and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't know if anyone can be bothered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to money launder if it takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that fucking long to do it"
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, it's probably
a deterrent at this point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like, why would you money
launder in Japan when- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When it takes like a full
day to process, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I can't be fucked to
money launder any more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just be a law-abiding citizen" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, it's probably easier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like abide by the law </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> than be a money launder at that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like money
laundering is not an issue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that is an every day issue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the consumer at the bank. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right?
- I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we should really be looking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at these massive billion dollar transfers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that are done from the Cayman Islands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guarantee it was probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, it happened maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once or twice and then obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> every Japanese company,
when something bad happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> once or twice, they get
super paranoid about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, "Guys, we have to stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this money laundering
crisis, it is unstoppable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Make the process as bullshit as possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so that no one can be bothered to do it" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that really the reason why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I've noticed that
like anything payment wise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan is very easy to send money to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but very difficult to get it out of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've just wondered too, I just assumed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like Japanese
government being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, we want money to stay here" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, that's probably
also a thing as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure the money laundering thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is just like a farse, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a public thing that they just say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think guaranteed.
- Yeah, it's for safety. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why we don't like it.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "We don't want you breaking any laws" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever like sent,
have you ever been scammed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> via like any money scheme
or something like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like I remember like the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like phone scams and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, just like been scammed
with like transferring money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you never got it back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that
'cause I remember when I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only time I've sent
money, that was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could, just got completely scammed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I rightly so got
scammed because this was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was trying to buy a
fake ID when I was under age. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, yeah, mean-
- I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I totally deserved it.
- Instant karma compilation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No it is, I absolutely
deserved it but I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like I remember, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> back when you're a UK teen, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the person who had the fake
ID was the cool guy, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he was the king.
- He was the fucking king </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because could buy the drinks, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he could buy the alcohol, he
whips out the realistic looking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> fake ID and it's not just like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously like really like
obviously fake student ID. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Like you can buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like $5 from like some guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So I was just like, how did, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I knew a guy who had
a fake ID, so I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "How did you get it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he tells me this, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really dodgy fucking
website and I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course.
- And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Am I desperate enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to carry the risk of trying
to purchase this ID?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as he was downloading Tor.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause this is how I-
- It isn't Amazon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause this is how I realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you couldn't pay by
card with this website, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God, Bitcoin?
- No, no, no, this is far, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this was way before Bitcoin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you had to transfer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> via Western Union.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally, anything with that is a scam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Anything that uses, I'm pretty
sure that's how Western Union </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> makes money, through scams.
- Which is why I asked, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I obviously,
'cause I had never heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of fucking Western Union
before, I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck is Western Union? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I only know about it from scams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, same, same, yeah.
- Now I do know about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> from scams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and so, because I tried, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I tried sending this, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do I send money via Western union? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that a bank, is that
like some Nigerian bank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like, like I've
never heard of this before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like I, three blind this fake ID, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because at that point I was a dumb kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was stupid enough to just trudge- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were desperate enough.
- I was stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and desperate enough to
just try anything to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> get a fake ID.
- Mans was desperate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh?
- Mans was desperate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so I was like, sure, I'll try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this Western Union stuff,
maybe it will work out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Famous last words.
- And then I find out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can only send like
Western Union transfers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at not even banks but like
certain corner shops in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not even anything efficient. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the most dodgiest
places you can send money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and these are the only
places you can send money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, "Maybe it'll work out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it'll work out"
- That's like the equivalent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of being like, you can buy this with cash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we have to meet in
an alleyway somewhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It can't be on the open road.
- And I think I would have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> preferred to meet someone in the alleyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause at least there would
be like another person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could communicate with, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much was it?
- Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much was it?
- It was like 30 pounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, that was a lot for
me as a 16 year old kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever all right?
- Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like what was I trying
to, moral of the story is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't buy fake ID kids, it's not worth it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and also-
- Of course it's not worth it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you didn't fucking get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Don't be stupid like me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The moment you see Western
Union as well, turn around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like don't even bother with that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I know Japan actually has like
a lot of scams because like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how the population
here is very old, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the majority of
them, so there's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like phone scams that happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've heard about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the most famous,
like variety of phone scams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is they called (speaks
Japanese) which means, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "The Me, Me Scam" so
basically how it works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a guy calls up like an old, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, granddad or a grandfather </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who like they do back
research to see like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Do they have grandchildren?
Do they have a son </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or a daughter?" and they call them up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's me, it's me" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, posing as their son or daughter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "Oh, it's me, it's me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need help, you know, can you get me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like X amount of money"
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So on and so forth
and so many old people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fall for it.
- Everyone's so, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Polite in this country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right, it's insane how much, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my grandma almost
fell for it one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember.
- [Connor] Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like when I was quite
young, luckily she didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but like yeah, there was, they asked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like absurd amounts
of money, like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> upwards of like hundreds
and thousands of dollars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Jesus.
- [Connor] Jesus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just to be like, "Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can you transfer it like tomorrow? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like desperately need
it, I just lost my job" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> blah, blah, blah, all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every year, dude, like
old people fall for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I need $100,000, I lost my job" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I lost my job.
- "I need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to order a Domino's pizza in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need a hundred thousand dollars" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I need to buy out
all the Domino's stocks" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need one large
Domino's pizza from Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - $100,000 (laughs)
- It's $100,000 (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There's also the, I think actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember I watched videos
about people who became homeless </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in Japan and apparently one of the scams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that makes people
homeless a lot of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is guarantor scams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like people ask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> people to be like guarantors on their rent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they just run off.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then they have to
pay the guarantor thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and they lose a shit ton of money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Because most people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> can't afford to pay double rent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is a shitty thing, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Not to mention </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the key money and all that.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a scam in itself.
- Key money is a scam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in and of itself.
- That's just a scam </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's agreed to, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think so.
- At what point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does it stop being a scam
and does it just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tradition is the biggest scam of all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just don't understand
the point of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Just being like, oh yes, here's
an extra month worth of rent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as a thank you for letting
this peasant stay in your abode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, I'm fucking
paying rent every month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you not happy with the rent money? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm already paying you
money to stay in your place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you want to pay me
extra money to be thankful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I'm paying you money, I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Am I not thankful enough for the rent? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Why should I be thankful to pay you money? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, in Japan, you have to pay one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to two months rent upfront.
- Yeah, depending, depending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some places you don't have to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In my place you have to.
- And it's not a deposit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, deposits, like
everyone always asks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is it a deposit?
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- There's a deposit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Which like comes back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to you after you move out
but then there's key money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which just does not return.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's literally just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like a-
- It's just a bribe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all it is.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's to be like, "You'll
let me stay, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a legal bribe.
- It's a legal bribe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "You'll let me stay, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's some money"
- You know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least they don't in,
Japan, they have to deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like Microsoft scams and
like the Indian call centers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, true, oh my
God, can you imagine that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's the reason
we get them so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause Indian people can speak English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I remember when I-
- The moment Indians </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> can start speaking Japanese, it's over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, I remember- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the moment
where actual companies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> move their call centers from India </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to let like literally any
other country it's over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's always in India,
that's what makes it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so hard sometimes.
- Yeah, God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, everywhere you'd call in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was always an Indian call center. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Especially with internet.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- The amount </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of times I'd call up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know if I'm talking to a scam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause the service is
so shit, you could film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's always like internet
and banking as well, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- That's always great, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to have a-
- Which are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the two big things.
- Yeah, that's what was great, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have a dad who worked in IT. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'd never needed to call them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd just be like, "Father, help me please" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Help me.
- "I know you're not Indian" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> When I first worked with BookWalker. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was doing a promotion with them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was actually on one of my videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I prank called scammers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah.
- And this is where I learned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that they don't have them in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'd made this video, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where I basically just called up scammers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just kept promoting
BookWalker to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Just kept doing it, kept doing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I would like do a super cut </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the funniest
moments and they would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get really pissed off and
I would be like Microsoft </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and I would just be
like, I would just start </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing "The Price is Right" music to them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just start basically doing a pitch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And just piss them off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then whenever they blocked my number, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd make a new number
and I called them again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I filmed it and it was great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It was this really funny bit,
it was like two minutes long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just great of me
and it was great promotion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I was-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, that series was
doing really well for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was literally just me
doing ad reads for two minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to Indians and call centers and yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I sent it off to BookWalker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Oh God,
they might not like it" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they were like,
"Okay, it looks that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Will we get in trouble with
Microsoft for doing this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like-
- The truth comes out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Microsoft backing up scammers.
- No, it was 'cause </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when we called them up, they
were obviously pretending </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be Microsoft.
- Yeah, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So BookWalker is like,
"Oh, is Microsoft okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with you doing this?"
(laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How dare you harass their employees? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Shit, do we need approval
from Microsoft about this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "What? No, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what this is, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, yeah, it's a scam, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They call you up, tell
you your PC is broken" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "No way, that's a thing?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a thing.
- I was like, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it was too Maylene, actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Man] You know when
we call you Microsoft, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know who's going to answer you first? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cortana's going to answer you first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Maylene] I knew it was
fake but I had to make sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, it's even worse
because Maylene's American. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Maylene should have known this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Maylene] I needed
to have written proof. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughter)
(cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maylene said she needed written proof </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that it was a scam.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Excuse me, can you give me approval?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Can you sign if you are
actually scamming me right now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not sure."
- Only in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> do you need-
- It's like, promise- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Written proof from scammers
that you're being scammed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Do you promise you won't scam me?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "I promise I won't scam you" scams you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Man] It's an agreement.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Do I have your word, scammer?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Do I have your word?"
- "Do I have your word?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "I can trust you, right, scammer?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Do you have a hanko
stamp, can I get a hanko </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> proving you're not a-"
- My God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, that is true, actually,
now that I think about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We don't have anything like that in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be honest, you're right
because think about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if Maylene says that,
she joked saying proof, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What's stopping a Japanese
company from saying, "Oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're providing tech support,
they get the Hanko stamp" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That Japanese governments,
they start calling up people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying, hi, we're Microsoft,
they probably wouldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get shut down for a while.
- Probably not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause even if the report gets filed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Japanese government
will take five fucking years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to analyze the case and
decide that it's a scam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And by then they would've
fucking dipped out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and then they'll have
ten new networks and companies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope none of the
Indian scammers see this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like, "Write that down! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Write that down, write that down!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like "Gentlemen, we are expanding" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Dave knows nihongo
get him in, get him in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He knows Keiko, they'll
surely fall for it" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Who's seen anime here,
who's watched anime?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've been getting
into like the, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the YouTube channels that really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> look into the Indian scammers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I think, is it Jim Browning? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Is that his name? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm a big fan of them all.
- Yeah, I really love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what Jim Browning does and I dunno what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I dunno some of the other people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well, some of the people who actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just phone them back up as well
and just really troll them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I saw one guy
who got an Indian scammer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so fucking angry that he
was literally shouting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on the phone.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, have you watched like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah Kitboga, have you watched Kitboga? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He does ones where he does like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the inverse speed
runs, I guess, slow run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Slow runs, yeah.
- Where he tries to keep them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the phone for as long as possible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- And I swear, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he on average gets it
like four or five hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy shit.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And just wastes their time.
- He's far too good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at sounding like an old grandma. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- An old American grandma. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's too good at that.
- He uses a filter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but he also like, he
does a really good job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And he's got the mannerisms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down perfectly 'cause
he just does it all day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So he's there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pretending to be an old
grandma for like six hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on Twitch, it's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] He works with a
voice coach, apparently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really, oh my God.
- That's someone dedicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to their craft, right there.
- They will get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like nine hours, though, on a call. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking hell, reverse speed run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and then at the
end, the reveal is so great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you could just hear
like how fucking annoyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this scammer just gets so fucking angry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're not fast enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- You hear some of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're like,
"No, got to warm up now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Get the Google Play card
now, now you dumb bitch" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like shouting at them, like "Wow, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is some good customer service. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This is still better than
like Virgin media, I think" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause like what
clocked me onto to that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to be honest, that was
like, it was recommended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I got recommended just a random clip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just, An Indian guy like shouting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at full fucking volume.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get a lot of that.
- Just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why are you so dumb?
Why are you so stupid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are you doing that?"
and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "What the fuck man?"
- Yeah, you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> click the wrong thing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like traumatizing
for these older people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I bet, Jesus Christ.
- Like someone could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> murder my mother and I don't
think I'd be as angry as that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right, right?
- Like Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What the hell, man?
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's some really
good Jim Browning ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where he like gets their
like passport information. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- On their like PC </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he like shows it to them.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really fucking good.
- Go on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Scare the shit out of them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Check out Jim Browning
like if you ever want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fall down a rabbit hole and just wonder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is actually on the other side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of whoever like phones up, phones you up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and tries to scam people.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, for every one of those people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's calling them back and
fucking with them, it saves, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, one person's money and time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, if anyone
deserves to be fucked with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's scammers.
- It's scammers, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah because even if
you you're quite savvy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with this stuff, you're unlikely to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if you hear an Indian accent
calling you and telling you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, you need to pay
X money to Microsoft" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're probably not
gonna fall for it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's because we know.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But also the older people-
- The older generation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have no idea, right?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly.
- I have a distinct memory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> from when I was like 10
of my mum coming to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and being like, "You know our friend? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Apparently Microsoft called them up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and said that they have
some of the worst viruses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the world on their PC"
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, "Wow, really?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Really" and that was all I heard of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A week later she comes back, she's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Turns out it was a scam and they lost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and they lost 1000 pounds"
- Holy shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Adjust for inflation,
that's like 10 grand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They said that they had the Y2K bug. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was around that time, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I know it wasn't actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I was very, very young </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just had this weird
memory of being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "That's sounds strange"
- "That sounds dumb" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Why would Microsoft call you up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why wouldn't they just nuke your PC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there was a problem?"
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've had to teach my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is like, there was a period when they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were not tech savvy at all, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're still not exactly tech savvy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least they were not tech
savvy enough to even attempt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go on the internet and
go on Facebook and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- And it was the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when they started to
take more of an interest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on being online and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it really was kind of
like stepping on eggshells </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when trying to explain to them
that some emails are not real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some emails are
scams and it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes when mum just
like, will send me a message </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, "Is this,
should I click on this link? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Should I click on that
link?" and like, I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how to properly convey,
which sometimes like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which emails are legit and
which emails are not legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's kind of like explaining
to someone over the phone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how to diffuse a bomb sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I told my parents, right, I said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Even if you get the
email saying your accounts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have been hacked or
anything like that" I said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I told them and the same
with numbers as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause my dad won nearly,
I think he nearly fell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for him a few times and I always told him, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Just call them back, like call the go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if you get called by your bank, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like go to the bank's website, call them" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Immediately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't talk to them.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause you know, odds are,
your bank probably isn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to call you and if they do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll probably ask you
a bunch of weird stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, for like, you know-
- Just call them back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Any like social media gets compromised, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> quote, unquote from an
email, then just go directly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to the website and check, yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, never fall for that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I nearly fucking fell for that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the Google Ad Sense thing.
- Yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause Jim Browning fell for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't get that email?
- Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Dude, you're lucky, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> If Jim Browning fell for it, anyone can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I saw his video on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> actually.
- Dude, it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worryingly convincing.
- But that's the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> right, it's like, it's hard
to like convey to your, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, your parents
or your grandparents. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Like how do I identify </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between a scam email and not a scam email </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I feel every
year it's just get like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that line is getting
narrower and narrower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's getting good, man.
- It's getting too good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Which is why like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is why I find it so hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to explain to them
because sometimes I say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to like second guess myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm second guessing myself
and I literally grew up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on the internet, I work on the internet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- How can my parents, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> who have little to no knowledge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of internet culture at
all tell the difference? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right?
- And how am I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> supposed to convey that through texts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or through phones and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't believe any email
you get sent, basically. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> And thank you for sponsoring
this episode, back to the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember the first time
that Maylene messaged me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like to work with BookWalker,
I thought it was a scam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, honestly, I
thought the same thing as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no way this is real.
- I was like, "Hold on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hold on a second, it says Kadokawa" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "The Kadokawa? No" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I swear the first one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking deleted it immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Nah, that's a scam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Get out of that" and Maylene messages me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emailed me again after
a week and she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't know if you read my last email, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we were interested in
working with you and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Did I delete that one?"
- Oh, there was a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a YouTuber who they,
I can't remember which one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they got like offered a
role to voice an anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - By Funimation.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they thought it was a scam? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When they publicly announced
that they'd gotten the role. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- In the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was just a fake email.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's painful.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like, I thought-
- That is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I've cringed out of body, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in pain for someone else more in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I laughed but that was, that
is just a bruh moment, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I did that shit and
I found out it was a scam, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would just quit social
media all together. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I would, yeah,
I would just not show my- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would just disappear
from the internet, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would not show my
face, also, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> generally when you get calls in stuff- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you're not supposed to say, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you're not supposed to say, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I guess maybe it was a test. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, "A-ha, no role for you!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gotcha.
- It was like Willy Wonka. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Ah, you were too
greedy! No role for you!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe it was really Funimation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but they just needed to pass the test. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like Indiana
Jones but the holy grail, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, "Ah, you choose grief! No" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because I going back
to the BookWalker email </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> emails that we first got, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looking back Maylene must've
emailed me way earlier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before I actually replied
for the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And what got me to reply </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was meeting you for the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like, "Oh yeah,
that email from Maylene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you get an email
from Maylene as well?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was just like,
"That's not a scam? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's real, that was
real this entire time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've just been ghosting her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and deleting all the emails" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember, I think that,
I think I sent that email </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to about like three or four
different family members </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to be like, "Does this look fake? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I'm really scared
to reply to this shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and get like a virus 'cause
like, I don't even know" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily it wasn't but yeah, I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it was the way that like
Maylene wrote the email </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or what it was, yes, I'm blaming Maylene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Blame Maylene.
(laughter off screen) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think it was just before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this was before the point
of (speaking Japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we thought any kind of companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like would contact us.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because before that, like
the biggest complaint, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had not worked with
any big company, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- It was always like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually yeah, it was not
a thing back then at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was still tiny back then as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, nah, no way I
can't, this jump is too high. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- That's way too unrealistic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, yeah, arguably
BookWalker kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> paved the way in that way,
I feel like BookWalker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opened up.
- I took the bullet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, "I'll take it
for the good of the people" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Reply.
- Reply. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you see the YouTube scam, though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you see what like the-
- I saw what it was about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think literally every, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> all of my other friends got that email, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> including you guys and
yeah, so I was scared. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was sifting through my email
as well and I didn't get one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So essentially what happened was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I got an email from
a Google email that said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, it was, the message was sent like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, you have a duplicate Ad Sense account </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know, your
channel will be deleted" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I think that is one
of the rules of Ad Sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that if you do actually have
multiple Ad Sense accounts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you will get banned off Ad Sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you can only have
one Ad Sense account. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they do send an
email like that as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and I only have one
Ad Sense account but we, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had multiple channels, so
maybe I thought, oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there must be a mix-up
because I'd recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just had the new channel
and it was kind of a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but this is often how
scams work though as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They prey on very
coincidental circumstances </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that have been happening
outside of the scam itself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, like Jim Browning
said in his thing, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes and I'm sure you would
just order the product </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on Amazon, 10 minutes
later, you get scam email </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about Amazon, just pure coincidence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it happens to play off a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right, concerns, so yeah, it's this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the one thing that
was probably the red flag, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I think did make
me unsure, but again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was kind of so worried that I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, I should just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to hear him out at least" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was through Google Hangouts,
but it was Google email. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, okay, well it's a bit weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because normally they would just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but then again, I've never had
correspondence through Google </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they're just so
shit at talking to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know how they
would reach out to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Because they've done email </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the past but sometimes they haven't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I don't really
understand, I think that also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is one of the reasons why
I almost did fall for this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because YouTube is so unclear
on how they reach out to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, the only
time I've ever talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to Google directly-
- Well, I've- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Through Twitter.
- Yeah, I've spoken to them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never had someone reach out to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That's never happened,
so I'm talking to them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they going through the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're like, "Oh
yeah, you have a duplicate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Ad Sense account" and I'm like,
"That doesn't sound right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't have the
duplicate Adsense account" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're kind of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, well you do" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "Okay, well what's the ID </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the Adsense account?"
Adsense accounts have IDs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he gave me an ID and it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> not even remotely-
- [Joey] Close. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Close to anything and I was like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, well that's weird" and I was like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Can you tell me about the account then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's the duplication?" and they just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't tell me anything.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He was like, "It's all
private, it's all private" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which would kind of make sense, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah and I was like, "Okay, well fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fine, all right, well" I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Can you tell me that
you're a Google employee? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you share some proof?"
and he was like, "No" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Because I'm not!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Scooby-doo mask reveal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At this point, and then,
what he was trying to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and he was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can make multiple YouTube accounts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> under one email. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so he told me to
make a new YouTube account. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So I did this because I was just curious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to see what the steps he
was telling me to do were. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- 'Cause I knew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> none of this was permanent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it doesn't really matter
if you make a new account, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't like delete anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- So he told me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to make a new YouTube account and then go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the YouTube account management page </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then set, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have the new account that I made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> takeover the old channel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Now what this does is that
it deletes all the videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right.
- And delete everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's basically like a factory reset. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It kind of just puts it like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like this channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's gonna like plaster it on top. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Brand new. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nothing else was here before.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's kind of it.
- It's just a coverup, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and then, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just deletes everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was telling me to do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so I got to the point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I clicked on like the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to see what the menu was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to do it and I was
going through the steps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like, "Oh yeah,
it'll delete everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Except for like likes
and comments and stuff" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like "That's weird" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, and then I was like,
"No, this doesn't seem right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This seems a little weird" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I was like, "Yeah, sorry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to contact YouTube myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I don't trust this at all" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so I closed the chat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I contact YouTube and like, "Hey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is anything wrong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my accounts? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, everything's
going to be deleted?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "Nope, that's all good" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You're sure? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This guy said it was"
and he's like, "No, no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all good" I was
like, "Oh, okay then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess I'll carry on" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I found out it was a big steal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> multiple had fallen for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the problem was that you just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you wanted to ask an
official person at YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how, who do you contact? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had to like do a web chat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with someone at Google. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - How'd you do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that possible?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You can do like a web chat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are real employees at Google? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if it's real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably just like the most advanced AI. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think on their
website they have like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, "Would you
like to talk to someone?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a pop up.
- Oh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's one of those services.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was chatting to them
and then they would just ask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for information and stuff and yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was actually surprisingly easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know, that's, I think that was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that might've been just YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, you know, it's all a blur. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the thing, that's the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all shit.
- Everything is so hidden </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in secrecy that if someone did
come up to you and was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is who we are, we're Google, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're YouTube, you have a
problem" then like most people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like, especially for
the smaller YouTubers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they wouldn't know any better
because they'd probably think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to themselves, "Oh, I guess, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one's really told me
how to contact Google. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess this is how they contact you" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- And that's probably why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so many people fell for it.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I, oh, sorry, did you
have something to say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, that was it,
Jim Browning fell for it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and a few other big names,
The Spiffing Brit, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fell for it as well.
- Lots of big YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fell for it.
- It's convincing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I just remembered, I almost fell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like a scam recently
because my friend's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Facebook account got hacked.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And yeah and so his account
got hacked and so the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who hacked his account
was like really clever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and sent like a mass message out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I got it as well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a mass message out to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think everyone, just everyone
on his contacts list, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just saying, "Hey, like,
I've really needed a favor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now, do you have a minute?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Right and it was obviously
a bot running it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause if you replied anything else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I like a predetermined script, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then it would just like block you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or it would like just close the message </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that,
so a bunch of people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> including Sydney, right,
'cause this was when I actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> got the message while we
were recording Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So that's why I didn't see the message </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but Sidney saw the
message and she was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, what's going on"
and the message was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it felt like
a natural conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the bot had already predetermined </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a certain conversation
route that people could take. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It ended up being like a
conversation chain that says that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where he said that he was
locked out of his, I think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think like he was locked
out or something or he, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he needed to pay the rent today </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and no, he was locked
out of his bank account </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he needed to pay rent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Through Western Union. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Only accepting Western Union. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not Western Union but
he needed to pay his rent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or he was going to get
kicked out or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he needed to transfer money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to his landlord. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he was like, "Can you
please transfer money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a certain bank
account? And I'll cover it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I get my bank account back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'll pay you interest as well" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, so Sydney was phoning
me afterwards being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo, yo, yo Garnt, Garnt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have you seen the message? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, he like, like Mike's
in a lot of trouble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You gotta, you gotta send money on me" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, okay,
'cause it came from Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Sydney sounded so desperate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I didn't even read the message. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got to send the fucking money, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So before I send the money,
thankfully I checked the message </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that my mate sent me and
by that point, thankfully, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I remember seeing the message </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just suddenly
it just disappeared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- And his account got, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just got deleted.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, 'cause when I saw it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the Facebook was
back to the default icon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So like I was, that's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like I was this close
to just sending him money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause he's a good mate
and sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you always got to get your mates' back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course.
- And it was really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking convincing
'cause I saw the messages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some other people got,
'cause unfortunately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've got a pretty good,
pretty big friend group </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and unfortunately two people
ended up sending him money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no.
- And I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the conversation chain,
it was genuinely convincing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it wasn't just
a one message thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a genuine conversation chain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just a really well-made bot, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it
was a really well-made bot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I probably would
have fallen for it as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he's a good mate and like you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and that's the
thing, right, that's scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially when it's coming
from like a friend, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel in that situation,
like I think the best thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do maybe is to like
call them up, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just to like double-check, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Just to be like, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think that's what-
- 'Cause it's very hard to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a little easier to fake a chat room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> than it is to fake a phone call, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think if, you know,
you did phone him before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then it would have been sorted
out but sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was worded in a way where
he just, he just needed it now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And again, that's the scary thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just getting as better and better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's probably where
having a Japanese bank account </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be an advantage
because then you'd be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Sorry, sorry man, I've got to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> book an appointment for tomorrow" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Can you wait a week, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the next open slot on my bank?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "You know, the next quarter is in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> three months, that's the best I can do" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I can't get a statement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> until like three months from now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to try someone else" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I'm sorry, man, I can't
do internet banking transfer" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Do you accept Western Union?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can give you that.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway, enough about
scams, I'm going to hijack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this podcast for a moment and turn it back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into an anime podcast.
- Oh, for fuck sakes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I just need to, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't watch anime.
- Just let me have this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me have this Connor,
let me have this 'cause- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know exactly what
you're going to talk about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course you do.
- I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course you do Joey, so this weekend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched the new Evangelion movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, fuck sakes.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I just, I need-
- How did you not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> see this coming, Connor, he was literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tweeting about it all week.
- I need to talk about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I need to move on with my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This man's tweeted
about it, like he watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like "13 Reasons Why" for the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm glad, though, you finally
watched it because again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I watched it on the day it
came out in the cinemas, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking six months ago or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was a really, really long
time ago and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I want to talk about it
so bad on the podcast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but these two haven't seen it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm just going to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just going to bottle this emotion up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now I can finally pop the bottle!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And talk about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I watched it and I literally like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cannot move on with my
life, like, I literally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like witnessing the
death of a family member, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know-
- Honestly... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like actually mortifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh my God.
- So good or bad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of death, like weird cousin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you didn't really like or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how to like possibly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convey the feeling I felt
but what I will say is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, like I shouldn't have
just, I shouldn't have ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> been a monk at all, right? that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was a fucking scam 'cause
if I wanted to feel Zen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I wanted to reach
Nirvana, I should have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just been an Eva fan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I felt more Zen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after the End of Eva, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after this end of Eva, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than I ever did as a monk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it that good?
- It was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, it's the type of movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can't just clean-
- What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me explain.
- It's a simple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking question.
- Let me explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the type of movie that
you can't just clean up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the word good.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or bad.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's neither
of those, it's just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds like it's mediocre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's definitely not.
- It's definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not mediocre,
- If it's anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not mediocre, it is the
polar opposite of mediocre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I filled the MDB page. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> The reviews were kinda-
- All over the place? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah seven, eight, it's
around about seven, eight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, I think the
only way I can describe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that last movie is-
- Do you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to have a very IQ to understand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have to what?
- Honestly, yeah kinda. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You kinda do, actually.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not even gonna like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why they called it-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [All] 3.0+1.0 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is like the most
pretentious fucking title. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very difficult to
figure out that that's four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you can't perform
rudimentary mathematics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> then you're just not even allowed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you watched the original Eva </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when it got released on Netflix, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did, I did.
- What was your opinions of- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The TV series?
- At the time? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, he watched the TV series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was fine, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand why everyone
is so hyped about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, did you-
- I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I could see why you'd watch this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and you would remember this.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I didn't think it was that amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah, I think like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's the common-
- It leaves an impression. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'll say that much,
you know, and you can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, this isn't like
the irregular high school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever the fuck that
one is where you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally don't even know who you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm 20 episodes into this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was four seasons of
that shit as well, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - See what I mean, I
didn't even know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's like a spinoff
coming this season as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, it's-
- Well yeah, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's one of those shows
that definitely was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand entirely why this is iconic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone is in love with this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I just personally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't that into it.
- Did you leave satisfied? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, not at all.
- Okay, good, good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was like, 'cause
that was my experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was the worst part, is the ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Let me ask you then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> did you leave satisfied?
- With the original Eva? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, with 4.0.
- Oh, fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I-
- Like the TV series, though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was shit.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The TV series left everyone unsatisfied. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, like I remember the
first two times I watched Eva. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking hated it.
- [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the first time I watched it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was 12, of course I wasn't gonna- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course (laughs)
- Of course I was not going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to understand Eva when I was 12 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I re watched it.
- Not enough IQ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I re watched it to
review it as an Annie tuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I was just
like this is even worse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than I remember it.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause now I now I'm actually invested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in the characters and the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and the mysteries.
- You actually understand it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sort of.
- It felt like a slap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the face.
- Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Someone who spent all day watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course, what did I end up with? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Applause and congratulations, that's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thanks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter)
- Is this it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is it?
- It's like the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is mocking me being
like, "Congratulations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you sat through all of this for nothing" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- So they could what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Milk another 50 years
out of this of movies? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hell yeah, dude.
- Is that literally it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ano was five heading that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He was planning ahead.
- He was fucking fiving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I remember going on
the internet fucking angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Surely they can't be the ending" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then people were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yo, have you heard of this movie called- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - End of Eva.
- End of Evangelion? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which I'm-
- As in, the end of it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is--
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it is an end of Eva. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Whether you are satisfied with- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that the alternative ending one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes.
- It's alternative </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's also cannon.
- Yeah, so- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If that makes sense.
- So kind of the history </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> behind the first two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the TV series ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that as you could probably
tell the studio just kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ran out of money and
ran out of like budget. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they had to like piece
together something, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And so that was the ending that you saw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so either like either
fans were so unsatisfied </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they sent Ano and
the company death threats, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Ano himself was so
unsatisfied with the ending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that he decided to-
- He was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's just "(mumbles) call it a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Fans'll love it"
- It's just art. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, let's make another ending to Eva </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's the end of Evangellion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people were just like,
all right, I'm ready now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the ending that
we never got for Eva. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's on the title of the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's called End of Eva.
- And it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even the ending, right,
that's what I understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a ending.
- It's definitely a ending </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but it definitely doesn't
leave you satisfied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so what's the
watch order of Evangellion? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - One.
- No, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> TV show, then movies?
- Ah, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So 1.0 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is basically the first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say 15 episodes of the TV series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, there's an abridged movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's basically just
like a Cliff Notes version </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the TV series and then
2.0 the first half of 2.0, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it approaches the original
ending of the TV series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then goes on a different route. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's fucking cheeky that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so he made-
- And this aired in theaters? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - This aired in theaters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This cheeky fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (out of camera laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Made one third of a movie
and called it a day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretty much, yeah.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe I should just make shit things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and re-release them again in future </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and add another-
- So basically, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the second half of 2.0 and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> mind you, I don't fully
remember everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was a while
since I watched it but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do, I do.
- But I'm pretty sure- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're talking to someone
who literally knows every frame </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of the first movie 'cause
I fucking abridged it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go on then, go on then.
- So like one point it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> basically just almost a
shot for shot recreation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like the first four,
five episodes and then- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, with cleaner art, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, cleaner art and minor,
minor, minor differences </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then 2.0, like it's
still like very, very similar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like episodes, maybe
like six to 18 ish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For fuck sake.
- Yeah, I mean it goes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it has other differences, it
introduces a new character, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the girl glasses and it has other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like-minded differences
but for the most part, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's pretty much the same and then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like introducing
a whole new character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is not the same.
- I mean- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the same until you
introduce the character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For fuck sakes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the same until you introduce
her and then 3.0 and 4.0, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which I'm going to go,
which I'm going to call 4.0, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because three plus one is four. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What asshole would call it that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is dumb.
- Why would they do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's an asshole called Anno Hideaki. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For fuck sake.
- 3.0 and 4.0 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like completely different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like almost like a-
- That's completely original. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- This feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first time you
walked into Starbucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and realized it was not
medium, small, large. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why, why did you do this?
- It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which one's Venti, which ones like large? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is a Venti?
- Wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Tall is medium?
- I still don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what a fucking Venti is,
I still don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, the part that fucked me up was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tall is not large.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tall is medium.
- Tall is medium. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fucking hate this.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm like, what is that, like giant? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, tall is small.
- Tall is small. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Grande is medium.
- No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Wait, it is?
- Yeah, Grande is medium. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Venti is large.
- This is why I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> liked the chart, I can see the price. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how I decide.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyway, sorry, go on back to the 4.0. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Back to the 4.0, yeah.
- Anyway, so 3.0 and 4.0 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> are completely original.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I watched, okay, so I watched 3.0 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the day it came out in cinemas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was 16 when that came out.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it was literally 10 years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've only seen it once.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So imagine me going
to the cinemas day one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> airing 4.0 right now I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, "I got this" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still remember.
- You don't got this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't, I was like, "I don't got this" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because literally the
first five minutes of 4.0, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it does a recap and I'm
like, oh, thank God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's great because there's
a 10 year gap, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- So it goes through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like super fast, like super
artistic way of just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's what happened in 1.0,
here's what happened 2.0, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's what happened 3.0, goes through 1.0 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, okay, yeah, this
is just the TV series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen TV series many
times, got it in the bag. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 2.0 it was like, okay,
yep, still the TV series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but introduced the new character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, cool, yeah, 3.0 I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't remember any of that shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then 4.0 just begins
and I was like, "Cool" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm literally going into this movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> with maybe about a 5% understanding of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what has happened so far.
- It's all good, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't think that
would've helped you at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the reason I didn't,
I chose not to see it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in cinemas, right, was because
obviously it wasn't subbed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was in Japanese.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With a series like Eva,
I wanted to at least try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to understand what was going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I did remember
what happened in 3.0. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, I remember
most of the plot points, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'll be able to follow along easily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So finally, I waited for it to
come out and I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I should have just seen this in theaters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I have as much of an understanding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of what's going on in my own language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than I do in a fucking other language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'm barely understanding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - For me 4.0 was like, "All right, cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a line, I understood
what they were saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I'm starting to get it" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then literally the next line I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't know what's going on" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "this is
a language I am fluent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is my first language
that they're speaking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It sounds like a different language" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> There's is so much terminology
and being thrown around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which I'm sure there was
some kind of explanation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of probably in 3.0 but of course, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I have a 10 year gap with 3.0. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't remember that shit.
- The definitive way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch it is to watch
3.0 and immediately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately start 4.0
- Probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think it even
matters because I doubt- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not gonna remember it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I doubt a lot of people are
going to be able to follow along </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the first watch through anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because so much terminology
gets fucking thrown around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and gets like pulled out of his ass like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the scenes I'm just like "Anno, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you're a
genius or a madman" like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah and then here's
the more fucked up thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I realized, if there's
anything I got out of 4.0, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the fact that there's
literally information in 4.0, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you will have no idea what the fuck it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you read the manga.
- For fuck sake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anno literally took every iteration. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, it took
bits from the TV series, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it took bits from End of
Eva, even a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from Death and Rebirth and the manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just combined it all together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like-
- What's Death and Rebirth? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the other movie.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's just basically a recap movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, for fuck sakes.
- It's a recap movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> small minor details in "Death and Rebirth" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that are only specific
to "Death and Rebirth" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I've like,
for someone like you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't even recommend watching it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm exhausted hearing this.
- You don't have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> watch Death and Rebirth.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean-
- If you've watched two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three and four?
- Yeah, I mean, if- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And End of Eva.
- If you feel like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because-
- Do I really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do I really have to watch End of Eva? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think no.
- End of Eva is- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, if you're wanting
to get into End of Eva, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> get into Evangellion as
a franchise, then yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you need to watch End
of Eva but like, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it depends on what you're looking for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause if you're just looking
for like a normal TV series, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a normal story to get like
entertained, so much so where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, you're like, you're looking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a normal plot arc,
you're looking for mysteries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be solved, that's
just not going to happen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as you've just experienced once. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think what's so special
about Eva is that it's a series </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just so powerful
that if you kind of relate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to what Anno was trying
to portray on screen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you said yourself, you
could tell why a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought this, like a
lot of people saw this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as like a really powerful series
that affected them, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just, 'cause it is
just that raw and powerful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because Eva to me, Eva,
like I didn't get Eva </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first few times I watched it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I said, I was like, I hated that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then like I reached later elite, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I reached a period in
life later where I started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like fucking resonate more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with what was being portrayed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on screen, I wouldn't say I
understood the entire plot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't think that's the point of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think the point of
Eva is to understand the plot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think the point of
Eva is to like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't just look at the shiny robots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fighting the big monsters
if you want but I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the true magic
of Eva was just Anno </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pouring his heart out on
screen and capturing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like capturing
his psyche in a sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why it's like
that's why you can view it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and this, and you can just be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't get it, this
is a complete mind fuck" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is an absolute mind fuck.
- Yeah, I truly think it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially with 4.0, I
truly think the only person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on the planet who can fully understand 4.0 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all of Eva is Anno because- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, probably working on the movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, what is-
- No, I guarantee it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guarantee it.
- Because 4.0, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel, especially 4.0 is like a true, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not only is it like a
true love letter to Eva </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's so much stuff
that Anno just crammed into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that really has nothing to do with Eva. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's literally like, he just
threw it in because he likes it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel that's what Eva is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's literally a
series that Anno was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I like robots, I like
monsters, I like Kaiju fights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love all of this shit
that I personally enjoy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to cram this
shit into one series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's Eva" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause like, you
like you like BoJack, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I still haven't
watched the last season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm too scared.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I feel like BoJack is
probably the closest kinda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like closest big American show
that I can compare to Eva. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause both deal with like-
- BoJack is the Eva </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of cartoons.
- "Get in the robot, BoJack" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is kinda, it's such a
weird comparison but that is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - BoJack is Shinji.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean BoJack was like, I
guess BoJack was very clear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in what it was trying to portray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess I was slightly
confused many times during Eva. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, am I supposed
to feel sorry for Shinji? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's an entire character study </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in and of itself.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because both are the kind of same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well they tried to tackle, they try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to tackle broken characters
trying to just find value </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in themselves and just live
with themselves, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what both series tried to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> BoJack has a much more
structured, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much more structured story,
much more defined character arcs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just easier to follow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And much less technical bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt like, you know, in BoJack, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you got to like, see
why he was so fucked up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I felt like in Evangelion, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't really learn much about Shinji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just whining.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I definitely feel like, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the finer details are there if, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for people who want to look into it deeper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel especially the
movies do a really good job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in portraying Shinji as
this like broken kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because I mean,
he's a 14 year old kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has like massive daddy issues </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because his dad's an
absolute fucking asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Never grew up with his mum, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is forced to pilot a fucking
giant robot the age of 14 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and has to save the world.
- I don't know why he's sad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about this, this is amazing.
- I mean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 14 year old me would have killed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the option to-
- I mean, I'm not going to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously not going to
say any spoils for 4.0 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but especially in 4.0, his dad is fucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he's like, I didn't think his dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could get even more fucked.
- 4.0 it goes from like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to a hundred, I'm like,
you can not be serious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but I think the reason Eva </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is such an important
series to so many people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> including myself, is that it
just hits these emotional notes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've just never seen
in any other piece of media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just, I think that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because Anno didn't give a shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about telling a, you know, a
story that was easy to follow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He just wanted to like,
put something out there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He just wanted to put his
emotions into something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- And that's what I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from him and that's why it's
so like, to so many people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is such an important thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's rare that you see something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that isn't like, that
isn't so well-defined </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that you can relate to on an, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in an emotional sense.
- It's almost not storytelling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like Anno's not really storytelling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as he is almost just emoting.
- I really can't describe Eva </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> without sounding like that
pretentious dick head, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I hear myself and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of just off.
- Well you know, I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What a wanker.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one of those things
where I think I definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with TV shows and media, as
opposed to traditional art, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I very much prefer it when
they essentially tell me- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tell you, yeah.
- What trying to get across. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course.
- And as much as you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could argue, okay, well, that's
for dumb people and whatnot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like also like, well, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel that if it is
art, I suppose it can be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but then also sometimes it isn't
marketed as such, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when you look at a painting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no doubt in
your mind that it's art </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can interpret it however you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you get whatever you want out of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think with TV shows, because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> such a different medium it's, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> what is art supposed to
be when it's TV and film? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I would argue that some
of the best shows are the ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that can present an artistic
idea in an artistic way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but make it simple enough
for anyone to enjoy, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I feel that's like
really good storytelling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's where I think
BoJack Horseman is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I agree.
- BoJack Horseman- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt like it delivered a topic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think a lot of people and a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of older people don't really
think about or care about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't talk about.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think like I'm not
bringing down BoJack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I also think it's
an amazing fucking show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just think like Evangellion was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is so unique because you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if there's one thing that
doesn't make fucking sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or you can't logically always
follow its emotions, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes you just feel
something and you just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why the fuck, why do I feel this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I just logically
don't know why I feel this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I shouldn't feel this"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like, that's what
Eva portrays so well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not meant to be
logical in a lot of senses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but sometimes you just see
something, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't know why I kind of relate to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I just do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why I resonate with this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I just do" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's been my experience with Eva </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I guess the biggest thing
that I never got from Eva </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was the satisfying
conclusion of like closure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like this is it.
- An actual ending. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like this is it, I am
satisfied because you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of, you know, as an Eva fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you find your own fucking closure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You've watched End of Eva and you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What the fuck did I just watch? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need someone--"
sometimes you need someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to help you process what you just watched. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, that sometimes you
spend hours reading up analysis </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and reading up this and reading up that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just like-
- End of Eva </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is one of those movies where like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you watch it and you
go, "That was awesome" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but then the moment your
brain actually kicks in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and goes, "But do you
know what it was about?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the one, that's
the moment where you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like the existential dread, like, "Wait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe it wasn't good, what was it about?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why do you think I didn't enjoy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or connect with Evangellion, do you reckon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a reason why?
- I feel maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because you were kind of over-hyped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like the outside, I think maybe- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's possible.
- What were your expectations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coming in?
- Something deep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe that's what it is, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, something impactful.
- Because Eva is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Eva is simultaneously the deepest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but also at the same time,
something that doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make any fucking sense.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not something you watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to per se enjoy because I remember like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only times I've actually, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually kind of understood
Eva really depended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on what mindset I was in, I couldn't just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I thought, I
was under the impression </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was going to be some
form of interesting take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like being a teenager and struggling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with mental health issues.
- It was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, to a certain point.
- I mean, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just not told in a way
that is just traditional. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, it's told a very raw way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's just, they don't care about you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> following the story,
they just wanted to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put these raw thoughts and
raw emotions, put it on screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just like, just put
it out there and that's what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like, that's what I got from
Eva, which is why like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the time that I connected with
Eva the most just happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to be the points when I was
in the worst point in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, you know, it's just something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's not something I think people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should watch to enjoy, I
think people should watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to experience it and maybe
you didn't enjoy this time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't enjoy the first time I watched it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but maybe there would be a
point when you're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where some of the words or
something from it rang out to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just like, maybe this is the time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, are you saying that Eva </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is an acquired taste?
(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No Joey, stop putting words in my mouth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And what I will say about End of Eva 4.0, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without spoiling what happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm not, I'm not going to spoil it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That explains the only
thing I will kind of say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that it is a conclusive full stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember because growing
up, I can't like, I don't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how to convey to
you what it's like growing up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a franchise and
being like, this has got, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this franchise is going
to be around forever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There is never going to be
an end for this franchise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you kind of make
peace with that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- 'Cause I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when the movie got
released, I think I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were meeting up to be like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't wait for 5.0, in my
20 years, can't wait for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know to like dig up the grave of Eva" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I talked to plenty of Japanese
people who were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no, "This is the end" I
was like, "Sure, sure" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, Joey goes sees it, Nabo goes sees it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, "This is the end" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Sure, all right, bet" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally, you won't
believe it until you see it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, it is, it is and then- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll watch the movies.
- I mean, you can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I like, I'm not like, I have like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've decided, I'm going to watch them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're going to watch them?
- You have decided? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll watch the movie.
- Where? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think all four movies
are on Prime Video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Netflix and all of End of Eva, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> all of Evangelion the
original series is on Netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all of the movies are on Prime Video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of all four of the movies.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because like, why
not, 'cause like, again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've only seen 3.0 and 4.0 once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like-
- What, like on Stream? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, on Stream.
- Oh, what, you press play? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause like
Twitch has a thing for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I might do that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a thing for that now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's
a thing for that now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, what?
- Like a watch party function. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's that like?
- So basically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the Twitch thing, I think this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a relatively new thing but basically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you do a watch party together now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when you go to that person's Twitch page, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the person streaming is
actually in the corner now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you get prompted to
log into your Prime Video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or Netflix.
- Oh shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it like, and it syncs up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude!
- And it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a brand new thing now,
yeah, my Twitch partner- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can online stream now?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No fucking joke.
- That's a game changer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy-
- I can work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and watch Netflix?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So my Twitch partner was like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since all the Eva movies
are on Prime Video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and Twitch has this new thing now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can easily do a watch party. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, oh fuck
yeah, dude, let's do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jeff Bezos owns that
too, he owns all of these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But of course, on Amazon Prime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So now you can-
- Now, now- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now you can cry on Stream.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Or get very confused. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, okay, so I got to ask you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what was your reaction when- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, I'm out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, when, okay, okay- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Obviously, no spoilers
in this episode, obviously. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, I just
want to know what your, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want to know
what your reaction was- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, your reaction.
- When the credits </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> started rolling.
- When the credits </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> started rolling?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry Connor, I just need- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no.
- I just need to gush. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just need to gush.
- I've literally never, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that might be
the first time in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where the term dumb founded
is like actually eligible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like, I think if you had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if I had seen myself
in the cinemas, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably would have made a face like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> For the entire credits just
because because my brain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think could process
what the fuck I just watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, because I went
to go see it with Ken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who was on the show, right and
he was obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during the credit
sequence, he was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, I know that anime, I've had that" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Meanwhile like what Ken was
saying was just going in one ear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and out the other.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was like, "Ken,
don't give me more information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm still trying to process
everything I literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just watched" and yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it was, I think the
best way to describe 4.0 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me was it was very bittersweet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Because it's like you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not until really those credits end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you walk out of the
cinemas that you realize, oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is really it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like there isn't gonna be
another movie anymore, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe there will be, maybe
there'll be a spin off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or something, I don't know.
- This story has ended, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, this movie franchise has ended. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like something I fucking
grew up with my whole life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- And like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Is this how I'm going to feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when like One Piece ends?" or like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how I felt when
Arthur got canceled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't, I don't even want to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't believe they canceled Arthur. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Arthur got canceled? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Arthur got canceled?
- Arthur got canceled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Arthur got canceled?
- Arthur got canceled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - When?
- Like right after the episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> where I said "Arthur
will never be canceled" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you serious?
(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally got canceled.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just assumed Arthur
was going to be there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when I had like grandchildren children. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck man.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, I dunno, like I feel this is how, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've obviously never experienced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like a show I grew up with,
like a big, big franchise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that to just end
in my lifetime, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I feel this is how it's going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when like One Piece, or like Jojo or like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even want to
imagine when One Piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Jojo ends.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy fuck.
- Like I feel that emotion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I felt at the end of
4.0 is how I'm going to feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's not a great feeling.
- It was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's rare enough
that I watch something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I feel something
I've never felt before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> which is exactly what I felt because this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is something I grew up with,
something I always thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> would be there, right
and then it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just over.
- And really does feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like a family pet has just died. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's something
that, it really is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, it's honestly,
it's that same emotion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, I started fucking bawling man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause like, here's the thing,
I wasn't even hyped for 4.0. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Right 'cause like nine years
had passed since the fast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since the last week and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever, it's out, I'll
watch it out of obligation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I love Eva but I don't,
I could go my entire life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without watching another Evangelion movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I would have been
completely satisfied. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I watched it literally out
of obligation and then like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think the last half hour
hit and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, what is this
I'm feeling right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is this a feeling of
closure, am I closing a page </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my life right now?" I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What is this feeling?"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then the end credits,
felt like the end credits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> started rolling and I just,
process is the right word </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there are so many
emotions coming up at once </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I just, I didn't know
how to process them all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just felt empty
and you just felt like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I felt like a fucking void
in my life and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's nothing that's going
to fill this hole up anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why I need to talk about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I'm so desperate to, because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I remember as well,
like when the first posters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for 4.0 released in
Japan, the tagline for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was (speaking Japanese) which
means goodbye Evangelion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, okay, that's
kind of a cool, very, you know- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like very like artistic,
like kind of tagline. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't think anything of it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then when they said
that line in the movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at a particular scene, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't do this to me man, don't leave me!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - "I'm sorry, I should
have treated you better" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I should have treated you better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I should have treated
you more, more, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't leave me, not now" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like that was the moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like, oh, okay like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that point I think really solidified to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how important this series was to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd forgotten it was until that moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, I've been doing ever since, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever since that movie I could, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've not been able to watch anything else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've not been able to play any games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just feel like the emptiness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally can't
consume any other media </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for at least a week.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like I tried to and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This ain't Eva, what's the point?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I'm really
scared to rewatch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I tried playing League. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Lost, I'm just like, "Don't care" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that how it should all be ending? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just like, nothing's
going to fill this void. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like that moment after you cum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just don't feel anything,
you just sit there like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no emotion.
- I think I've just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reached Zen, like I feel like
I've reached enlightenment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like fuck being a monk, man, like is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what it feels like, you
just like an open book </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just like, I finally-
- Who would have thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you could become a monk
with a 6.99 membership. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm finally at peace with
my life and now I just want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get the hell this on, I
just want to move on now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So for anyone watching
this who's never seen Eva, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we're not coming onto here
saying that we recommend you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch Eva, it's hard to recommend- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's hard to recommend
now because you're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> going to have the same experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we had where you just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where you grew up with this,
so, and you know, like I said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're someone who's going
in a tough time in your life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then I honestly recommend
you experience it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because maybe it will teach
you something about yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna say, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, if you haven't had any struggles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with mental health, is it hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to appreciate stuff like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so.
- I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like after I watched Eva, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've like, I've just been binge-watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so many like Eva analysis videos but like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm the same.
- Which is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess like my way of coping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Ken and I had
about a six hour conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and Hezekiah about just
the movie we just watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the entire time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and I think the video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I like related to the
most in terms of what I felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I watched the first time was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was Eva abridged.
- No no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Scamboni Reviews </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> did a video called "You
Don't Understand Eva" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In like sarcastic text, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where he basically broke
down why Eva is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically a really badly told plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he basically broke it down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a way where I
completely agreed with him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I would've completely agreed with them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause that was basically
what I was trying to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I had watched first time
because I just didn't resonate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or relate to anything
that was trying to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, me neither, you know,
I didn't really feel sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for Shinji at all, I felt
like I was supposed to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the thing,
the emotions were there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but the execution was not there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like, I don't think
like you were even supposed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to feel sorry for him,
right because yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like either you do feel sorry for him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or you don't, like a
lot of people would do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because a lot of people relate
to that kind of mental space. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right that they can resonate with that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but like the series doesn't
explicitly tell you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should feel sorry for this
person, this person is this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just, that's kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's kind of like the
thing that maybe like not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not everyone will enjoy Eva,
not everyone should enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I wouldn't recommend it to someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a very healthy mental
state because one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you probably wouldn't get it and two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't wish for you to
be in a bad mental state </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to begin with to get it, right, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you know,
BoJack, I thought was great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I wasn't depressed watching it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I certainly was after.
- Well, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean like things like
BoJack and like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we related Eva to BoJack
but I think like something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like Oyasumi PunPun. is probably closer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in terms of like actually, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> presenting a very sad story
in a way that can get anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of any mental state invested
in the story of BoJack, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you know, BoJack
in that case was told </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a very like straightforward, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like here's the thing that's fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, this is why
you should feel sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and for most people, they felt sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It was very easily presented. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was, yeah, easily presented but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel Eva in that
sense is almost so vague </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with what they want the viewer to feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- To the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like, here are the emotions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you should be feeling but
we're not going to tell you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to feel those emotions specifically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's up to you to decide.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kind of thing.
- Like, I don't trust anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who says they understand Eva,
like you can spend all like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just sounds like you
can have an interpretation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of Eva.
- You can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have an interpretation of Eva.
- Oh, there's many, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> many interpretations.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But to claim to understand
Eva I feel like is just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't, I honestly
don't think it's possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm sure there are some
Eva fans that are out there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are just like, I
can't believe he said that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Um, actually.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like I've spent
so many fucking hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching different people analyze it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different people's
interpretation but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there are so many different
interpretations of the series </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to begin with that I just
think that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's a reason why we
are still discussing it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to this day 26 years later.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think it'll always be discussed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember, it was
a couple of years ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think like when we
were still in the rush </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of all these people, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just analyzing every
single piece of imagery </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the TV series, right and
one that got discussed a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was when the angels explode,
they create an explosion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that looks like a cross.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there was, I watched
so many analysis videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being like, this is why
Anno chose the cross </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and why it's super symbolic
and blah, blah, blah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then a couple of years later, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they came out with an interview with Anno </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were asking,
"So is there any reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> why when the angels explodes,
it turns into a cross?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he literally just said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I just think it looks cool" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't mean anything
and all the anime YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were like, "We spent all
this time analyzing something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that you just put in
because it looks cool?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like that alone
to me really showed the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that Anno doesn't think this shit is deep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He just put it in because it's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, if you're saying that
you didn't have time or money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to make a proper ending-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the odds that he had the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be able to be like, no,
no, no change the explosion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to a cross.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is why you should do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's symbolic to the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, because it's just a love letter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to all the shit Ano likes, he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the cross looks
cool, let's add that shit in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would say that maybe he
didn't make a conscious choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He put stuff in just
because it felt right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It looked right and it
created a certain tone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a certain mood, whatever.
- Especially in 4.0. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you can analyze that
but to say that everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a purpose and everything
was put there for a reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think, no, no, not everything in Eva, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think Anno knew everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he knew what he wanted to say in Eva. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think especially in 4.0 as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was so much shit in there, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't make any
sense, why is that there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, fuck it, you know what is on there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just let him do what he wants to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah.
- Well, I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like moving on from
like Eva as a franchise, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can like tag you back in now, Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> We can tag you back in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, has it been any other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like points or like series or franchise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you've kind of like grown up with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that franchise and you've had like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've seen the franchise come
back years and years later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you view it differently as an adult, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as opposed to when you saw it as a kid? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Aw, geeze.
- 'Cause I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first time it happened to me was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when Toy Story 3 got released. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was literally thinking Toy Story 3 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when you said that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
feel that's the only thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like stuck around, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there's been two,
there's been Toy Story three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and American Pie Reunion.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, what?
- I can't relate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to the latter, unfortunately.
- I think that American Pie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was like, 'cause like when American, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when American Pie one
and two got released, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was fucking massive during,
not even like my generations, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think like I
already saw American Pie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was like my
older cousins' generation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they would like put it
on TV and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There's fucking boobs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck is going on here?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] "Am I even allowed to be here?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Am I allowed to be here?"
- Imagine that came out today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, no, oh my God but
I remember watching like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause that's how I experienced
American Pie one and two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was fucking massive and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> seeing American Pie Reunion
and just seeing everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as just like responsible adults </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and just like being adults.
- That's what that's about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, having like children, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they have a high school reunion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see these
characters and they're, one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like a lot older
and people have jobs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they have children and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck is this, what's
happened to my childhood? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a real high school reunion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone's still in a uni, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone's still getting
pissed and partying, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure I saw his dad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know his dad, in American Pie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- The one who's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in every movie?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty sure I just saw him in Canada </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was on like the ski lift. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- I'm pretty sure I sat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> next to him, I'm near certain I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He spoke to me as well ad
he had the exact same voice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I couldn't exactly see his face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's wearing ski stuff.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But he looked like it and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I think this is him"
- You should have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just been like, are you
the dad from American Pie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't ask him, I wasn't
sure and imagine if he wasn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he'd be like, what the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then you could have spun it being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you sound just like him.
- I'm near certain it's him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was like 14, so I didn't want to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, right, right.
- But I was like, I swear, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I swear it's fucking you.
- How do you remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that shit?
- 'Cause he literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just reminded me, I remember
getting off the ski lift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking like, was that, was
that the guy from American Pie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you see like, these
fucking bushy ass eyebrows? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes!
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, that's the
one thing I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bushy ass eyebrows.
- He has like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the exact same skin tone,
the voice was like, spot on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, what the fuck, is this him? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is this him?
- No but like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I mean, have you
seen all the Toy Stories? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't seen Toy Story four. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good.
- I was like Toy Story three- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't.
- Toy Story three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was my Ava 4.0, you know, where- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, what?
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, where I
watched it and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was a nice sendoff to Toy Story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- And then, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they made a fourth one and
I'm just like, fuck this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, don't bother with the fourth one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you like three, I
didn't really like three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't like it so much, I liked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it felt special to me
because it felt like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I was saying goodbye. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "The end of an era"
- The end of Story Story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The end of Toy Story,
3.0, Death and Rebirth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No but just like seeing
Andy grow up and seeing- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's all right, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean-
- We need like a Toy Story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 1.0, yeah.
- What is the plot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of Toy Story 4? why is there- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're at the circus, I don't even, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't even watched.
- So I saw Toy Story 4 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in cinemas because it was available. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I went to go see with Aki
just 'cause we were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "We want to go to the cinemas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's playing right now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, Toy Story 4 is there, all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's go watch it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause at that point, I hadn't
heard anything about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I went to go see it,
yeah, it fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It really does suck, I
mean, the movie is decent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but literally the last
15 minutes of that movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> not only ruin the movie
but just completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ruin the entirety of
the Toy Story franchise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I heard it
broke a lot of the rules </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and also it kind of like
ruined Woody's character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it completely
destroyed every character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just ends off with like this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, Woody's on the road now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I'm also not that invested
in the cast of Toy Story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So if you know, if Buzz
commits war crimes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not really going to care that much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just going to be like, "All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, I mean, he shouldn't
have bombed that place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but okay"
- But at least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Toy Story 3, right, obviously
not going to spoilers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least Toy Story 3--
- I think you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spoil Toy Story 3.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's okay to spoil.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> There might be people that
are like, I can't believe- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is not, this is not 4.0. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can spoil Toy Story.
- I can't believe they ruined </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ending of Toy Story 3 for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can spoil Toy Story 3. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, well, okay, well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Toy Story 3, like,
you know that scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where Woody's like, "So long, partner?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like really fucking nice.
- That was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like that made me tear up a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not going to lie.
- I just didn't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the fuzz bear, the care bear
villain, I just didn't like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, at least
it didn't last, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I guess so.
- It didn't last. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the scene that stuck out to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with Toy Story 3, if we're getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into spoiler territory-
- The incinerator scene? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the incinerator scene.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You talk shit.
- What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hated that scene.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just dragged on, you
knew what was going to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, come on, then, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, what?
- Are you a fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie critic, right?
- What, do you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they should have died?
- I would have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would've been a nice twist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Critical!
(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Famous Pixar movie.
- What if they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just then clear cut to like the factory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they make Buzz and
Andy, it's just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just cuts like a pile of ashes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Should have pulled
like a Rick and Morty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, actually, that was
the alternative universe of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know-
- That would have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> truly ruined Toy Story.
- We say like 10,000 Buzzes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in like Toy Story 2, why couldn't we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like Spanish Buzz takeover, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (off camera laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what's, why, why?
- El Buzz. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why?
- I'll tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who would've killed
off the Toy Story cast? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who?
- Hiri Akiano. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, he would've killed them off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and been like, they're all
toys, they all share one mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They go into the incinerator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they explode in a giant cross. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The end.
- The end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck your childhood, kids.
- They're toys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if they went anywhere near an incinerator, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they would've melted and been deformed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah, of course.
- Also, what year is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we have incinerators
attached to like kindergartens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever?
- That is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who installed an incinerator
in the kindergarten? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> How irresponsible is
this, why was that there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Don't go near that room, children" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, is this-
- Was it in the kindergarten? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was nearby, right?
- I completely- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or something?
- I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was nearby or something.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Why, I just, my gosh.
- Didn't they go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a garbage dump?
- I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's right.
(cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just thought it was
attached to like the school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The kindergarten.
- That would've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been the real plot twist.
- It had been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was actually a disposal site all along. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was not a kindergarten, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor just fucking Memento'd himself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where like you just like, I'll tell you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you King Crimsoned yourself
where like a time period </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just fucking disappeared.
- I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you're like, "I
guess they just ended up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in a fucking incinerator"
- I was so bored </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> at that point in the movie because one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and two I liked a lot, I liked that a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love the scene where he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I got to drive to work" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he crosses the street </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in his car.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That scene was a banger.
- That's a classic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a classic scene.
- I love that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just naming off memes now, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Toy Story one and two are actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like really fucking funny.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, can I just say, Toy Story 2, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that scene at the airport is
still one of my favorites. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It's amazing.
- That fight scene, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can I call it a fight scene?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a fight scene.
- Yeah, that squabble scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt, you know, a lot of the modern, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can watch a lot of the older films </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I haven't even
watched before, kids ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought that they were
really good because they just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, as an adult, you can watch them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I find that when I watched a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the new kids films, I can't
watch them because I just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, you're talking
about recent Pixar films </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like they've been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, this is a common
thing where everyone's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, they've been dumbed down" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I did feel that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I watch a lot of the
older movies, like Disney, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like eighties to two thousands, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I can watch any of them.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm like, this is good but a kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> could watch them as well.
- I mean like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did have like a period
where I actually sat down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and like watched all of like
the recent Disney movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the recent Pixar movies
'cause I wanted to make sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, is it
actually getting dumbed down? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Or is that just like my
like own opinion about it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, have you watched Pinocchio? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That movie's fucked.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That movie is-
- I do not remember Pinocchio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you watched Pinocchio?
- I might have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I might have.
- Dude, they fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> smoke cigars and they turn into donkeys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - They smoke cigars,
gamble and drink alcohol </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, what the hell?
- Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and these kids are like eight years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't remember Woody
like cracking open a bong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you know what I mean, like-
- Buzz! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Buzz, yeah, are you gonna hit the bong? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Andy's in college bro,
let's hit the bong!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's huge! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The bong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just starts talking.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just Seth Rogan, like,
I don't remember this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty sure that's just
fucking Sausage Party, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure this is actually like a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Playboy magazine comes to life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like a cartoon, Robot Chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like a New Ground spinoff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think this is, pretty
sure this is a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, wait, there was a Robot Chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like they go to, am
I dreaming this weather? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like they do Toy Story
parody and like dildos talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or something.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a million dollar idea.
- Maybe I've made this up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If not, that's all yours, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's low hanging fruit but-
- I feel like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds like a fever dream
but most Robot Chicken skits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are fever dreams.
- Adult Toy Story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like, with
movies, I can't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what I've made up and
what is actually happening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what has happened.
- You shouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> share too much, man, you're giving away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a million dollar ideas left and right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing is, I'll have this idea, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, it's already been
done, it was never done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was never done.
- Until it wasn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have an absolutely horrid memory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just absolutely abysmal when
it comes to remembering films </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and media, I just can't,
I remember what I felt- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You remember JoJo and
that's pretty much it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember what I felt about the media. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember much about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like one or two
scenes here and there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all I remember.
- I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that's pretty common, though.
- Is that common? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I think especially if you- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't remember character names either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm also shit at
remembering character names. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but I feel that's
especially the case </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for people who have consumed
like a shitload of media. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right, like after a while,
like your brain's gonna overcap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with that kind of shit.
- Is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just the modern day
problem of too much media? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Too much consumption.
- Too much media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember fucking anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I'm watching YouTube
shorts and I feel like my brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has like one second memory.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like the shorts are not helping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, TikTok and the shorts, definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't helped in hacking
your brain to be like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on to the next thing,
consume, consume, consume. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then I talked to my dad and he like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't remember the word
for anything and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> shit is that what I'm going to be like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like-
- I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a different problem.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He just refuses to learn, like if you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if he's learned a word a certain way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he just will never correct it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean?
- Like he- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like pronouncing or like-
- Yeah, pronunciation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He will never change the
pronunciation once he's decided </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what the pronunciation is in his head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think that's a memory issue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's just being stubborn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that, I think that
is like an older thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I think I've met a
few older people who do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you like, you
correct the pronunciation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "No"
- My dad is like that as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My dad's like, he tells
a fact and then I go, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Actually it's not" and then he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Nah, that's not a credible source" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, I'm kind of like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know.
- Are you going to tell me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that gif is not pronounced gif? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is gif, I don't give
a shit if he says jif. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's gif.
- That's the point, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't give a shit if
that guy says it's jif. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not.
- I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's gif.
- It's gif. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like fucking the
world could end and like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't have a say,
even though you made it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't have a say.
- The G stands for graphic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't say jraphic.
- No, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a g sound, it's gif.
- Like there could be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there could be a gun to my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like, you can live
if you just say jif. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll be like, no, shoot me now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gif.
- Shoot me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bang.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll take the gun off him, it's gif. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, even if you made the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you can have, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if you've made it clear from the start, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it was that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's what it was but it
became massive public domain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and was widely used before it became </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the public discourse
that it was called jif. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right, right.
- So at that point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no, he might've been saying it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a while but he
didn't do a very good job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of making everyone know it was jif. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> He should, everything at the
bottom showed a watermark </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying it is pronounced
jif to make it clear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like as a
creator, you didn't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have much say over how.
- Especially when it becomes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that widespread, it's already
like rooted into society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are so many things that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once they're adopted by
the public, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they become their own
kind of beast, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It becomes its own thing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you don't really get a say over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's like, you know,
if Anno came out tomorrow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and said it's actually
pronounced Evanjellion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We'd all be like, "No, it's not" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's Evangellion.
- Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like JK Rowling telling us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like weird Harry Potter
facts, like they just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they shit themselves then teleported away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I don't believe you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though you made this
and this is your world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no, you don't have a say in this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pronounced Harry Pooter, actually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't have a say over it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> What was the other weird
one that they brought out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like something weird
about Hagrid or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was, Dumbledore's gay or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dumbledore's gay.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was already-
- No but that's canon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that was already
canonical, there's another one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with like Hagrid where
it was like something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really fucking weird about Hagrid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't remember.
- He was like onto anal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or something.
- And I was like, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like-
- Hagrid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> had a fucking threesome
with Snape and Dumbledore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - McGonagal.
- And it's canon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, what are
you doing JK Rowling? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why, why are you doing this?
- It happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in between the first two books. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just didn't write it.
- It's interesting though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't it, how like, if you
do try and retcon things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or what it feels like retconning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the audience would be like, "No" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, Anno has done
that several fucking times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's come out several
times saying like, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not like that, like for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the crosses.
- "The cross </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't mean anything"
- "The cross </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't mean anything"
or "I just put this in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I thought it was cool" and then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess, so, I guess it comes off- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And people are like, "No, no, no" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then that's
interesting, right 'cause then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that begs the argument of,
it's not whether as much as, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not really anything to
do with the media itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's more so to do with
what the public likes you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like is life.
- That is true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's whether or not the public actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> takes you seriously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So even if she released a new book, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure people will be like,
"Nah, it's not canonical. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just don't like it, I
just don't like it" do I? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes you, sometimes you
just got to decide, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And also I think, I
think she has pushed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with what she can get the
audience to agree with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think once you've
brought in these characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you've brought in this world, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a certain amount of, ah, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't not really agree with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, she certainly
hasn't helped her public image </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with that kind of stuff, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Meanwhile, if like fucking Nasu came out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with another Fate thing, it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ah, yes, this is actually not canonical, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> all the Nasu fans will be
like, yes, thank you, Nasu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you for another piece.
- Was Anno ever ridiculous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with the stuff that he suggested? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you seen Eva?
(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but like it's all always in line. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, hearing JK-
- Eva is the definition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of ridiculous.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's why it's in line, Harry Potter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had rules to some extent.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And to hear her go "Yeah, the reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why Hagrid doesn't have kids is 'cause </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he exclusively fists people"
that's not something that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that doesn't line up-
- He's incapable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of reproducing.
- You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't line up
with what I understood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> about Harry Potter.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To say that is like, "Okay, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know about that" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's is the level of
absurd that JK Rowling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> would bring to the table.
- I wish that was canon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually wish that was canon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's not any more ridiculous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> than like taking a shit and
making it disappear with magic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I also, I love that,
I also think that's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Why wasn't that in the movie?
- I want like sometimes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes like I think
sometimes as an author </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and as a consumer, you've got to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you got to think sometimes, at what point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is there too much detail
in world creation? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's true.
- That's the exact point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when there's too much fucking detail. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's too much fucking detail. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just loved that JK
Rowling thought about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after the fact, "That's
a neat little fact" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will let everyone
know, "Siri open Twitter" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would like to teach you
guys about the information </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the teleporting fecal matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This also makes me
wonder, was it just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were they just fucking fascinated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when they first saw a
toilet in the human world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, holy, you have
a room dedicated for shitting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just amazing, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do they wipe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does that get teleported as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't get teleported,
I believe in like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do they get teleported?
- Does every single, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> by that sense, you'd never need a shower </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because every single thing
attached to your body, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> including some, this is, you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well does it get teleported
while it's inside of you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, I think what I
remember from the tweet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that she tweeted, I think you take a shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they don't teleport it anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just make it invisible, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Magic away the evidence?
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just magic away the evidence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What does that mean?
- That's so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interpretation, oh my fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Magic away the evidence.
- I need a five page thesis, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no, I need like a 20 page thesis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need like a six hour
video on the poop situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You must have shit on
your ass though still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's not clean, you need
a bidet something or I assumed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as the spell get rid of that,
if so then why would you need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to ever shower because surely the smell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> can also get rid of any
bodily fluids or odor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you might have also, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they nut and if
they're inside of someone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they don't wanna get them
pregnant, did they just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Deletus!
(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do they just cum and then like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fetus Deletus.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do they just, genuinely, do they cum </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and they can just be like, cum
be gone like and it's gone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are they able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to cast spells, if they,
okay, okay, I believe, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm on board, I'm on board
with the fact that you can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you can spell away your own fluids, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In your own body, if you get your fluids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in someone else's body, can
your spell still get them away? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Does it, can you get rid of fluids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in other people's bodies?
- I just like to imagine like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that a thing?
- I want to say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next time I nut.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like baby, where's the condom? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Pulls out a wand, fetus deletus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Things you should never say after sex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Fetus...
(laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are we 10 years old here?
- I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - JK, can you please
make that cannon, please? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's information I want to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about the Harry Potter universe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please make that canon.
- I don't care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the disappearing shit.
- [Connor] I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I care about what they
do to replace condoms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Harry Potter world.
- Oh, God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna be able to get
that image out of my mind now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor was having a rant
and I just like went off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in my own world.
- Just pointing the wand down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "I got you, babe"
- Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What were we talking about?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What were we talking about?
- Do you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to repeat your rant?
- I was saying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if you can get rid of the
fluids, excrement, that's yours, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you nut in somebody else,
can you get rid of that fluids? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you have nut inside of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess, so pull a fetus
deletus, then you got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Your blood is now gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You are dead, you know?
- Spinal fluid, gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just collapse.
- This is a very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disgusting conversation
about bodily fluids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fascinating, it's fascinating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you, thank you, JK Rowling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you, JK.
- For letting our imagination </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> run wild.
- For asking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the important questions and answering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the important questions as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I still can't get over the
fucking, like what was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Deleting the evidence with
magic or some of shit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, it was her own
words, vanish the evidence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Vanished the evidence with magic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I'm going to
say in court next time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I commit a murder, your honor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I vanished the evidence with magic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Moving on from that.
- On other, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moving excrement, I've
been moving my stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've been moving your shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've been moving period, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, moving house, oh
my gosh, took so long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- How's that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> been going for you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Very long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, people on Twitter were asking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and people coming into
my streams being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor's not streaming, what's happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone's like, why he hasn't
streamed for like 10 days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I miss it, so kind of like
no subs when I come back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So sad, gonna have to work
from the ground up again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're pretty much
fully moved in, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you're out of your office? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I fully moved like a week ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but then I went away for
like five days as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and also I didn't have any
furniture and then it all came </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's taking up all of my living room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like building stuff
is such a nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I got like Jenga stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of the way and then build it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but then it takes up a lot of room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the boxes obviously
were tightly packed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you've got to leave
the box to another room, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so it's like every time I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I make any progress,
something else turns up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that I got to do and
I'm like for fuck sakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> At least have a bed now.
- Oh, yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a nice bed as well.
- You got the koala bed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I did.
- Are they like taking care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of all the fucking cardboard
that's been building up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, yeah 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK you could just,
you know, fill up your car, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> drive down to the local recycling center </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and chuck all the cardboard.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty easy, really.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But in Japan you can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to put it in your,
you have to recycle it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in your building.
- On a specific day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually you might be
able to take it somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't have a car.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And also I'm not renting a car </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just to take cardboard but luckily, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the new place I moved into,
you can just put them out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> at any time.
- Oh, that's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And there's like a whole area </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for trash downstairs.
- Oh, like an inside area? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah 'cause my previous
place it was put outside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you could only put it on
like Wednesday at 8:00 AM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, my current place
is like that as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I hated that 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck dude, I got shit to do, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, my place though, it says you need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to take everything out before 8:00 AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just do it the night before, not a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - At my place, they
don't come to pick it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'til like 2:00 PM.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, they did that too, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm just like, I'll
just fucking take it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the morning then, whenever.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They used to, in my old
place, when I first moved in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like, "You have
to wake up at 7:00 AM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to take out the trash" I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm not waking up at 7:00 AM"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll stay up till like 4:00 AM </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and do it, I'm not waking
up at seven, fuck off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you serious?
- I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gotten me to like get a
good sleep schedule at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I wake up nice and
early in the morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get shit done.
- But that's not a good thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to wake up to.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Oh yeah, wake up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't wait to go fucking take out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my fucking smelly garbage"
- You get used to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after a while, honestly.
- But then yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the new place is great, you
can just chuck it out anytime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like, normally the more
modern apartment buildings, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just like go downstairs
and there'll be an area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, our old office had that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it was a newer building. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the trash take out was super good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's basically like
that, it's like identical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's like a separate room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like stinky trash, I guess? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, burnable.
- Uh-oh, stinky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - All your food that's like burnable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- So there's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like another room for that.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess that's good, right,
like because you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't have to, your
nose don't have to struggle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you take cardboard out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so weird though, there's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my room has like this really like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> massive security camera
that points at the trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm guessing it's to stop you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from doing anything strange.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or I like putting
trash that you shouldn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And there is literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like black and white
tape all over this room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it looks like a murder room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think it's on purpose to scare you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- To make you not feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's okay to like-
- What would you do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think trashing stuff you
shouldn't be trashing there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like trashing rules in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like weirdly specific.
- 'Cause burnable stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> right, in Japan, yeah, it's very specific. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like plastic bottles,
can't go with plastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It has to very specifically
go with plastic bottles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, there's a whole nother area </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for that and cardboard
can't go with paper. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Paper is another thing.
- And that paper is burnables. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, no, no, no, no,
in my place, it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really?
- It's recyclable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really?
- Yeah, paper is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some places it's burnable but also depends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on the size of the paper,
if it's too small, it's not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't put it in the thing,
it's really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many rules and most
of them you have to follow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And all of these rules as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> changes depending on where you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you
can live in the same, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can live in Tokyo but
every municipality in Tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has a different rule and like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so also like batteries is very specific. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It can only be in a certain place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So all this stuff is very confusing and, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there should be no matter
where you live in Tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or Cytomel Chiba or any of those places, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there should be an English guide. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They normally all have them.
- You should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get an English guide at the
town hall when you move in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's very confusing
because sometimes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the material wasn't covered,
so like cardboard is good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but cardboard pizza boxes, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's been greasy, so it can't go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I
actually have an app that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where if I type in a certain thing- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, really?
- Then it tells me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what day to take it out.
- That's pretty useful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if I'm not sure then
I go to my app, I type in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like, 'cause I
remember one time it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like a specific
type of styrofoam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not like the, it's not like the hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like squeaky styrofoam, it's
more like a squishy styrofoam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, the softer one?
- The squeaky one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, the black one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The one that's layered?
- Like the squishy styrofoam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, "Fuck, I
don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I looked it up on the app and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a completely different day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh thank God.
- Wait, really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I put that in burnable, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I dunno, maybe my
municipal is different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Styrofoam is just the one
thing where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where does this go, I'm just like, uh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Styrofoam is burnable, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some types of styrofoam is burnable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Other types is plastic.
- I thought it was recyclable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Plastics, I've been putting it- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, it completely
changes where you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes it's all-
- I just put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like eight bags of that
shit in the burnable, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes it's all burnable,
sometimes it depends, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're gonna get a knock on your door, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like the police are going to come in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like, so...
- Excuse me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you the guys that threw
out all that styrofoam? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just having a hunch.
- Imagine being the guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just like threw
out all the burnables </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the wrong place.
- There's a lot of foreigners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in my building as well, so it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't feel like the odd one out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I definitely felt like in my old building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was for Japanese families.
- Well you were living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in an area that was very like, not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, dude.
- Not exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like gaijin friendly.
- We all were. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause we all lived five
minutes away from each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I lived even
further out than you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I definitely lived with
like all the families. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - A relatively older
building as well, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, it was super old and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely a family building as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, I didn't
see anyone else there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who looked even remotely my age. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They were nice though, I never really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> had any problems, except
I got a noise complaint </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I expected as much.
- Well, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're shouting at fucking 02:00 AM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one of those things that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's probably a matter of time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I first moved in, I would literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> walk around my own apartment
like metal gear solid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I was so sick 'cause
I'd heard nightmare scenarios </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about noise where I was just
tiptoeing around my apartment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like at night because I genuinely
thought if I just walked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> at a normal brisk pace, I
would get like shouted at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, the months go
on and you start to realize, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, okay, okay.
- I can't help the clapping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of my ass cheeks being so loud. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm so dummy thicc.
- Yeah, you're so dummy thicc. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, then one
time I had friends over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who stayed over until five and
I never got a noise complaint </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I was like oh,
okay and then you slowly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get more comfortable.
- You test the limit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because you know, and
then maybe something happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where, all right, there's a deadline, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to record this thing, it's 2:00 AM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they need it right now.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, well I guess I'll do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just scream one line and I'll do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I'll also, I had to
record voice lines one time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just, I distinctly remember
we're full on shouting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but this was like midday
but it was to the point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where I was, this is shouting so loud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so aggressively that
I would totally understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if the police were called in any scenario. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sounded like a murder was happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Literally, even a murderer
wouldn't have done it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with such conviction the way I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was, I did that and that definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> made me more confident.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So it's one of those
things where it just built up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I started streaming
and I started streaming later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and later and later and then
I started screaming louder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and louder and then eventually
I got a noise complaint, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> which is totally 'cause I
think it was one where I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> totally screaming at 4:00 AM,
which I totally understood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just assumed the people below me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because this was a four bedroom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just assumed they were sleeping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a totally different
room and they were so old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that nothing would wake them up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing, yeah.
- I was hoping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that they were that kind of
old people where they were not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> getting up for anything.
- Yeah, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes like, you get
lucky because like the room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that if you, especially if
you have multiple rooms, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the room that you screamed the loudest in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is nowhere near where the
person downstairs is sleeping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's always, it's mostly like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where is the bedroom located
and am I making a lot of noise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where their bedroom is located? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause anywhere else I feel
like it's more understanding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about it, but it's always the bedroom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think like I really lucked out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the apartment I had before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've never got a noise complaint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're very lucky, I don't
know how you've done that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I definitely should, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I fucking limit tested that thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've had parties at
your house at 5:00 AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've had very loud parties
at 5:00 AM on a Saturday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So we weren't being complete assholes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't matter to the old people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In Japan, that is
not acceptable anywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's, yeah, I fucking
limit broke that shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I didn't get a noise complaint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm very, very surprised.
- Saturdays, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter what
day of the week it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to an old person, like 'cause
like the cops aren't going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, all right,
we got a noise complaint </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and you'd be like, it's Saturday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - License to party.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Saturday.
- Cop's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Understandable, have a nice day" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just feel like I
lucked out because I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I had neighbors who had
like a mutual understanding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I feel like I've
had the only neighbor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I know of, of anyone living in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that was like really fucking noisy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they would have arguments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the time and it wasn't
just like a Japanese argument, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was full on shouting, sometimes it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most un-Japanese Japanese
argument I've ever heard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right?
- Very dramatic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just like, if you make noise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you know, I'm going
to make noise as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mutual understanding.
- Yeah, mutual understanding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a symbiotic relationship, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, there were, I
always very, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if I was making noise, I would be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if they're having a party once a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly.
- It's once a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can live with that,
it's not like I have like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno like a bonsai tree
that's sensitive to noise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something in my
apartment that shits itself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it hears two decibels,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I think it's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's why I
wouldn't really call the cops </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but Japanese people
have no chill with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they just immediately call the cops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well no, because to them it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why are you being so loud at home </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when you could just go
to an (speaking Japanese) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and go out in town and have
fun?" and I'm like, I would, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if everything doesn't close at 8:00 PM </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and alcohol can't be served.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> One of the things that's
been so, taking so long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my new places that
my office I've actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like gone through the
whole effort of like trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to sound treat it to
the best of my ability </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as much as you can 'cause the best way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to sound proof a room used to do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> while they're building the God damn room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've had to do it in post. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- And it's been a nightmare. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've had to put like two
layers of stuff on my wall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I still haven't done it all yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like two layers of fabric
that I've attached to the wall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I'm doing the third,
which is that like sound foam </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know, YouTubers
just put like four pieces </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, it's soundproof,
my room and it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is not even remotely soundproof. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like the rooms where it's
like one piece over here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> another piece over here.
- It's just one piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> behind where they're
sitting and then like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my job here is done.
- Soundproofed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - My living looks super weird right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's just all
like every single wall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is like a black plastic rubber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- But it works, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't really hear me-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Immediately the echo's gone? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and so I put a
layer of the rubber stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down as well and then I
put noise reducing carpet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on top of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like you can jump in my
room, neighbors ain't going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to hear shit downstairs.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually just finished
laying down carpet in my office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as well, like finally.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was talking to
Jerry while I was doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jerry was like, that
sounds like a good idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so I decided to do that in my room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause my room was like
super fucking echo-y. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I have like wooden floors. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it helps so much, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Immediately once I put
up, before I even started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> putting up the sound foam
immediately with the carpet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, 80% of the echo just gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, every single wall you do makes it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it gets better results.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's not since I moved to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm just like, man, carpets
look good, I miss carpets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like we had to carpets in England. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you didn't have, like
you didn't have a house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you never had a house in
England that had wooden floors, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right 'cause it's not
good for noise, not noise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a heat installation, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had them.
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No living room was wooden
but upstairs was carpet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so our house was like
half wooden, half carpet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - In like your rooms, you'd
have carpet and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't know how much I missed that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until I moved to Asia
where everything here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is wooden floors.
- We had like fitted carpet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Europe, I think why that they come in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and they specially like get the right size </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they fit it all professionally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but in Japan they always use the square, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like just pick up and go kind of things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the post carpet.
- They just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan, like a lot of
the carpets are just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll see them everywhere,
they're just like these- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like cubes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We have it here.
- Like squares. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they're everywhere,
like they're just like squares, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you plunk them down and
then you just cut them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around the edges, like
hand cut it to my room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It looks really fucking good but I spent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a whole fucking day doing them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I did too, because
my room's not square. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like weird fucking shapes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, fuck sakes.
- Yeah and cutting the corners </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff in a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So look it looks good from a distance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but when you get down on the floor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you see how much of a shit job I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's hard, man, it's hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm very proud of it, I've
been DIYing for like two days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it look good, it looks amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and when everything's set
up, it should be good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That'll be me in like two months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I think I'm the
last one to move out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm planning to have a whole
wall of just JoJo posters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh nice.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That'll be like-
- Didn't you have that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your old place?
- No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Literally, before you could see the walls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was going to make it like
literally like 90% of the wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is just Jojo posters.
- Isn't it already? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No but like, they had
gaps, they had gaps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want gaps, I
want it to be literally- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Side by side by side.
- The wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is made out of JoJo.
- The wall is JoJo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The floor is JoJo.
- But like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how good of a shot would it be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like just behind me,
it's literally just Jojo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's so bad ass.
- The wall is JoJo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like, the way I attached
it to the wall was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't sure if it would,
it would like be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to hold the posters
'cause this rubber stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I got to prevent
sound is fucking heavy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You bought a roll as well, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is, it's massive.
- Like, what is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 meters, it's a 10 meter roll. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - By like one meter wide, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One meter wide, 10 meters
long and it's 20 kilograms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it is so fucking heavy.
- You put that on your wall? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly, right?
- How? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With great difficulty and so
I was concerned, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the way I attached to it, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wonder if it will stay if
I then put posters on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So before I left for my
trip, I attached the posters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, hopefully
when I come back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my wall will be intact
and luckily it's intact. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's intact, yeah.
- Should be fine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the poster frames I
have are extremely light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like the lightest
poster frames I could find. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, then you should be all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Should be fine,
- Should be fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hopefully, be really awkward </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm streaming one day and my whole wall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just fucking comes down.
- I feel like the big test </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to be in summer,
right or next summer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just going to leave
my AC on all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not risking it.
- Really, all the time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I did in my
current place, because you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the electricity bill, right,
if you have, I had like what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 20 grand of computer
equipment in my room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and filming equipment,
the AC bill to have it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> running all the time is what like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe an extra 200, 300
bucks for the whole summer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah, it depends on
how long you have it on for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess.
- So for the summer period, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just to leave it on, I'll pay that much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to have my equipment be fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's true.
- Humidity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> fucks your microphones and
cameras and PC equipment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would rather just have
the whole room AC'ed 24/7. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'm thinking to
invest in a dehumidifier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just to put around my-.
- Just get a dehumidifier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah.
- I have a dehumidifier in my- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - As like a Southeast
Asian, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> part of my soul is dying when
I hear AC is on 24/7, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, you can just
put the AC on dehumidify. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a setting for dehumidify. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's true.
- So I'll leave it on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay, okay, what happens if the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when the AC inevitably breaks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a good AC, it's not breaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't your AC break?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> One of the other AC is broken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what's to say it
won's happen in your room? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The other one for two years was fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll deal with it when it breaks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It'll be down for like three days at most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fine.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like I grew up with
like, I grew up with my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beating into me, that just like, "Look, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the world could be on
fucking fire right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you're not telling on that
AC unless you like really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really need to"
- Also, I'm probably gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> get a bunch of comments being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor's wasting so much electricity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's not in the room" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, "No, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm saving the money for
not replacing the equipment" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's saving the equipment.
- Like the devil </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could be raising hell
right outside a window </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're not turning on the AC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, fuck that, sometimes
I go to my mate's house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in summer it's fucking roasting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Why are you like this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Why do you hate yourself?"
- I mean, the summer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the devil came back from hell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and planted his ass crack on the earth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, if you can withstand that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can live in a sauna, that's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to judge
you, you can live in that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't come to my fucking house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and tell me to turn my AC off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't choose to live a life like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't want to live on hard mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I don't need to, I'm not going to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck off, don't come to
my house and tell me that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm going to do exactly that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> next time I come to your house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm going to go mom
mode and just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I can't believe you're
wasting all this electricity" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Think of the electricity bill, Connor" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I couldn't care less, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Think of the electricity bill, my God" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, I've lived like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't need to live like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I make good money now, I don't
need to worry about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just feel sorry for your
AC, man, it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I'm getting a break sometime, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - In the new place as well they installed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like those industrial ones,
you have them as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, built into the ceiling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right.
- Looks pretty modern. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Really nice.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Lifesaver that.
- It's beautiful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just noticed that this AC is not on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's already cold.
- Yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's thankfully cooled down this week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Are we still technically in summer? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know
- We are technically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in summer, this like
past week we've had this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like rain, this torrential
rain from this like cold front </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming in from Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's been light flood warnings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the greater Tokyo area
and I'm just like, oh man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this typhoon season is really fucking off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I looked at the news,
it's not even typhoon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, it's not a typhoon, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just rain, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> how is it raining more
than a typhoon right now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just cause like seasons in
Japan just don't make sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to me, like you wake up one day
and then Japan just decided, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, summer's over, we're
in the next season now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's snowing now.
- Yeah, winter's over, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're in the next season,
there is no fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> transition period. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You wake up one day and you
suddenly go from like dying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the heat to like, oh
you got to wear trousers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and long shirts now and long sleeves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The statement of
"Japan has four seasons" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is the biggest lie of the century. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- It does not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It has two seasons cot, cold or hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cot.
- Cold or hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the only two seasons,
there is no in between. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know how you go to that
one place and someone's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh you don't like the weather? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just wait five minutes, ha
ha ha ha, in Japan it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't like the season,
just wait a few days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it'll change.
- Just leave the country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't put your jacket
away, you're going to need it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in about three days, guaranteed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then there's England, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Where I never know what the
appropriate way to dress is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in England, like if it's summer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do I wear a long sleeve still? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Still do I wear short
sleeves, do I wear shorts? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do I bring a coat with me, I just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> England is the place where
it's always acceptable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to bring a coat just in case.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't, what am I supposed to pack? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We're going to England, I
don't know what to wear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I genuinely don't.
- Do I, what I have to wear? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can I get away with shirts, do I have to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do I need to bring the drip? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, how much
drip do I gotta bring? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much drip, is drip
acceptable in the UK? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much, am I allowed to be drip? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Am I allowed to be drip?
(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Am I allowed to be drip in the UK? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
- Yeah 'cause like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just one place where I go outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, should
I bring a coat with me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the answer is always yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You can never really go
wrong with bringing a coat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the UK, in Japan, I
feel like a fucking clown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I bring a coat in the summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I mean, especially
this time of year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, have you noticed though that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what you wear in the UK
is completely different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to what you would normally wear here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like in terms of like sense of fashion? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I feel like,
at least with me, like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Sometimes.
- I wouldn't dress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this in Australia, for instance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why?
- I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel that like,
just in general, just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, maybe it's
just the area that I live in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like Japan, I feel
has definitely like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put in like a different
sense of fashion into me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than back in Australia, like it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me in Australia fashion
was t-shirt, shorts, sandals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean that's Australia, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean that was like-
- Isn't that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the national motto of Australia? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, you'd feel fancy
if you wore a pair of jeans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, it's like that level, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But here it's like, I dunno, I feel weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> going out with t-shirts,
shorts and sandals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I think, it's
just living in a country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's permanently in summer, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that's kind of me in Thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where if I'm not wearing
t-shirts, shorts and sandals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something special is happening,
like, so it's like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in England, you look
for any opportunity you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to wear shorts, in Thailand, you look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for any opportunity you can to
wear jeans and long sleeves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to wear jeans, I don't
really like wearing shorts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really feel comfortable in them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't like exposing your legs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe I haven't found the right pair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes, don't you sit on, I feel like I'm- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, how short of shorts
are you wearing, though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, reasonably sized, reasonably sized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right, right.
- I feel like I can't enjoy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every surface, you know
when you just sit down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on some things like wearing shorts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like how my skin
touches this, geeze. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What about like three quarter pants? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, those are a bit
strange, aren't they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, see, like it's
weird, like something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like three quarter pants
is completely normal here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I would feel super fucking weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I wore three quarter pants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Australia and it's not
because of like the weather. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just because like, I
wouldn't see anyone in Australia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just fashion wise wearing
three quarter pants. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just don't think
shorts look very good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like no, no, no, okay-
- No one looks good in shorts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No look-
- Every Australian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is offended.
- No one looks better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in shorts than they would
wearing like jeans or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's sunny outside, okay,
so people can look good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the beach or whatever
in shorts or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Anytime you go inside, you
sit down in the restaurant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you look like a fucking
clown, there is no exception </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to not looking like a
clown when you go inside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're wearing
shorts, like there's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm watching like the Trash
Tastes off the dark screen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, fucking
hell, our legs look so ugly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just knees on knees on knees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's just so many knees, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Too much skin going on.
- And if it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the three quarter
pants, well we just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at that point you just
have commitment issues. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just commit to shorts or commit to jeans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like please come on, just-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think like, being from the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like fashion was
never a high priority. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially in Wales.
- Well, yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel in the same way
with Australia as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I feel just, I
never even thought about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I was wearing in Australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I look around me and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really see anyone
who's like fashionable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - People have so much fucking drip here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's insane.
- Yeah, the drip here- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People will just be going to work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'll be dressed
like a fucking model. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's nuts.
- And I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why I almost, not so much pressured </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I guess I kind of, that
made me look at myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reflect on myself
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I have to
step up my game, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I feel like London
was pretty fashionable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, everyone dresses the same, I feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Everyone dresses the same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel in London.
- I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would say that even
maybe people in London </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have even more drip than
people here in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's my genuine
opinion, you see someone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have such shit takes (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why can we not agree over
fucking London? (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You the architecture, I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think London's a fashionable city. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You loo at like a fucking
Primark or anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the models, everyone
fucking dresses the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you fucking talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Primark slaps, like, for what you get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the price, Primark
fashion is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, for fucking child labor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can get some good clothes, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Primark's a great place.
- I remember one time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I bought 10 t-shirts for
eight pounds in Primark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought, fucking
hell, who made a deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the devil here, why was
this price able to go through? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've bought one thing at Primark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was a pair of eight
Sonic the Hedgehog socks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for five pounds.
- That's overpriced. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck, you got mugged off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like one pound for eight socks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah but I'm like-
- I bought a whole suit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> from Primark for like
30 quid and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck, what happened?
- I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it looked decent, right, it looked decent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the problem, it looked good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean, that's the problem? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think now I'm like,
you know, we paid what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like fucking 70 pounds for a
t-shirt, no $70 for t-shirt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so what, 40 pounds for a
t-shirt, I now feel that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, maybe it's because
I have more money now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe it's because I'm
not, I'm doing much better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> for myself, I feel that, oh,
I think I would rather pay 30, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> $40 for a very good
t-shirt as opposed to $8 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for 10 t-shirts.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but like, that's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the biggest thing I've noticed- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just think something's gone wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I feel like the biggest difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since moving to Japan
is that there were just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more affordable options in high street </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in high streets in the UK and that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How much affordable is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're cutting some severe
human rights corners here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I'm like, no, this
is like, I mean, that's going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a different topic,
we're talking about drip, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right, people having drip, I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in London, a lot
of people have the drip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Drip comes with a cost, guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With the blood,
- Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course, it comes with the cost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The poor children.
- But like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you look here and basically like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just Uniqlo here and Uniqlo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like a few other places here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but in England you just
have a lot of choices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there is like no
equivalent to Primark, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think worldwide, there's been nowhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the world I've gone
to, that is a really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really cheap place to find
clothes and just looks as good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as Primark, I'm just, I
will happily still shop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at Primark now, I think Primark clothes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like underrated
just because it's cheap, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you look at Primark clothes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you could easily sell that for like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just always walk out
with like five t-shirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm never going to wear because
I thought they looked good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in the store, 'cause it's so cheap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you're like, I'll have five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's literally me at Uniqlos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally like the
Primark is the equivalent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of going to an all you can
eat buffet at a restaurant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, you're just like, maybe I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having an Indian curry and a pizza </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the same time, you know?
- Sick hearing now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna hear that combination. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's just like you do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're just like, well,
I just got so much choice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just, maybe we'll have
a bit of Mexican as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a bit of Chinese and it's just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's an absolute fucking mess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - My fight or flight response </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is kicking in just hearing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you shit yourself violently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you wipe it away
with magic, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fine, Garnt.
- Bring it back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can have it, yeah, sure, drip, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, so are you saying Primark is drip? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not saying Primark is drip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, I just had to make sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm saying Primark is
affordable drip, it doesn't look- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's an oxymoron.
- Why, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, like, what is drip? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Expensive clothes, just-
- Drip is like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was just
clothes that look good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but it's kind of like
the Hypebeast stuff as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh fuck off, fuck off,
drip, that just means </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that good drip, you know, you
have to buy brand name shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's kind of what it was.
- Usually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what it was.
- That's usually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that what is was originally.
- It's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been developed a bit more
now and kind of hijacked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be more of just good clothes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, just fashionable clothing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just fashionable clothing,
that's what I, that's what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I heard drip, that's
what I always thought it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, sometimes brand name clothes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what a person would think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck off, fuck off.
- That's what someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who doesn't wear drip would say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you telling me that
every brand name's stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looks good, there are equally
as many brand name stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm just like, this
looks like absolute dog turd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and if I see someone wearing that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to think they have zero drip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You can wear a Louis, that
could be Louis Vuitton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I could think it looks like shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I get that but at
the same time, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if I was like walking down the
strip, flaunting off my drip, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and then someone
came up to me and was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That drip's sick, where'd you get that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't like be like, Primark. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to say that.
- I'll fucking say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it looks good, who
the fuck gives a shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If it looks like, if you
look like you have drip, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then you have drip, I couldn't
matter where it comes from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't matter, it doesn't
matter where he comes from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, fighting for the everyday man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I copped this piece from Walmart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is from The Gap.
- Yeah, Tarjay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, fashion is like the
biggest fucking scam there is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you saying to me-
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to, I just want to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't feel bad about buying now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want something that lasts as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm obviously not
going to like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking go to every high-end place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and buy like $500 t-shirts
or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've bought so many
t-shirts from Primark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I sweat in once and it
is like permanently stained. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can not get those orange
pits out to save my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's why you
buy five of them, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's the problem is I feel bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about buying a shirt
that I bin immediately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after I have one bad summer or I go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to one Indian restaurant.
- Like why buy five shirts? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I mean, the fabric is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely low quality fabric, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, that's the problem,
I don't want to buy a shirt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I feel like I can only get two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three good wears out of.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what you pay for when
you pay for cheap fabrics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I'm saying, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> why don't you use that money to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> buy one good quality one
that'll last you and is more- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Garnt, I see you
hating the environment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck you with your t-shirts.
- What has that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> got to do with drip, though?
- Because- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you look good, you look
good, I'm just fucking saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck the planet, fuck those little kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making those shirts, you got
drip at affordable price. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you've just been brainwashed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the fashion industry
to say this looks good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's expensive and
has a brand's name, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I also think that you
pay for the quality material </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that lasts a while.
- Yeah, I agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The quality material
doesn't always equate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like Glam, right?
- We buy those Glam shirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right they're, like 60 bucks a t-shirt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes 80 bucks.
- I have got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some serious mileage out of those shirts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- No, so I'm not arguing- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that shit's dripy.
- Yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If people are like,
oh, it's $60 a t-shirt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Bro, how many of those
t-shirts have you bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like Primark and shit
that like are fucking garbage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> after like five washes.
- I'm not arguing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm arguing that you
can buy good quality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good looking stuff for a
lot cheaper than you can get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for Glam and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just think fast fashion is
like bad for the environment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just bad in general,
I just think you should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> buy shirts that-
- Just buy something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that lasts.
- Buy something that lasts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's saying that he, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you saying that a t-shirt
should always be like $30, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> minimum, 30, $50 dollars minimum? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not so much about the price for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's about like what it's made of, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And like if it'll last.
- I have so many t-shirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I don't wear because I
just have too many t-shirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of them, I would just buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they were cheap.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would never end up wearing them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would always wear the nicer
shirts that I could clean- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't you also say that you just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't wash jeans,
you just throw them away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and buy new ones?
- I would wear a pair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of jeans for like two years
until they are fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wear the same pair of
jeans over and over again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't wash your jeans?
- I will, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I would rarely wash them,
you don't need to wash jeans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why are we talking
about dripping advice? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (off camera laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't need to wash jeans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We are taking drip advice from this guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't need to wash jeans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're taking drip advice from a guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> who doesn't wash his jeans.
- Hey, Google. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry, who is the
peasant here, Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry, who is the
fucking peasant here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you need to wash jeans?
- Look, I will argue right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that yes, like you could
buy a $10 shirt, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> From Primark or something
and you can, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can layer with something cheap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can make it look
good but what I'm saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the average Primark buyer-
- You should never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wash a pair of jeans is one of the CEO </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of a jean company says.
- The CEO of a jean company? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Particularly, if it's
a good quality jean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Said Michael Jean, the creator of jeans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it's a good quality jean,
you don't need to wash it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will-
- You just spot wash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that shit, you got to stain,
just get rid of the stain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not know enough about this topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Genuinely, genuinely, you don't need to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be fair.
- I don't trust your- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying, I don't
know enough about this topic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Smell my jeans, Garnt, smell my jeans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get that shit out of my face, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Get that out of my face.
- They smell fresh, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's that musky shit.
- I've been sweating in these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They smell good, give them a sniff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just, that is
drip, that's dripping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with your fucking sweat, Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that what you're talking
about when you mean drip? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bro, there's some stains here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that I should got to spot clean off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt, do you know how many people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would pay for that experience? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Smell my jeans, bro.
- Smell Connor's jeans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give them a sniff.
- Get that shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> out of my face, man.
- Smell his jeans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Smell it.
- Smells good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah?
- Yeah, man, give them a wiff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would you say that after
wearing them in summer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> No.
- I don't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> washing my jeans because,
and frankly as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't like how they feel
after you do wash them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They feel horrible the
first time you wear them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after you wash jeans,
they feel all like crinkly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and you got to wear them back
in again, I don't like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean that's if you
do like a cold wash though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, warm wash.
- If you do a warm wash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where it doesn't like
shrink, then it's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it still does it.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You're buying the cheap jeans, then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no, Uniqlo's finest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, to be fair,
Uniqlo does do good jeans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just saying you don't,
you don't need wash jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean-
- I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wear the same pair of jeans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I don't have multiple, I
only have one pair of jeans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> When it breaks, I just buy a new one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When it gets holes, buy a new one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When it's, a stain's too
deep, I get a new one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's is pretty much all I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you considered like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like removing the color from your shirts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want my jeans to look fresh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just soft wash everything.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't need to wash jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, there you go,
the drip king has spoken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't need to wash jeans.
- It's the King of Drip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I just think
fashion is bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't worry about how much you spend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's-
- Glad to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have Trash Taste, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, okay, like,
the one thing I never got, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for example was Supreme, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, that's a different caliber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What you mean that's
a different caliber? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It all comes down to drip, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no like Supreme-
- That's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How is it, it's literally a brand name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's expensive as fuck.
- No, that's not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not a brand, that's a meme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's a man.
- Yeah, Supreme is a fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at this point-
- It's not a meme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They made a crow bar, no one
is going around being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this posh.
- They made a brick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is not a company
that is in the business </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of making extremely high quality stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's in the business
of making scarce stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - To this point-
- At this point, it is a meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it wasn't always a meme, if you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to any Asian country back when
it was like in their prime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and people had Supreme on
just because it was expensive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was one of the biggest
brand names at that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't like good quality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't good quality,
Supreme was a skate brand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Supreme isn't like a daily wear brand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like skateboarders used to wear, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was like made for skateboarding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but for the longest
time, that was drip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was drip, right?
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't argue with me, you can't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There hasn't been a
single, like in my opinion, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there hasn't been a single
piece of Supreme shirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything where I was like, that's drip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like the old
definition of drip was brand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Was brand.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all that kind of stuff.
- But I feel like now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's been adopted so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and used so much over the last few months, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it does just mean looking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and I'm just saying, you don't need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to fucking buy expensive
stuff or brand name stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have drip, you don't.
- No, you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You also shouldn't be
buying 10 t-shirts for $5. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You also shouldn't be
wearing a Primark shirt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and calling it drip.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you can call it a drip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just saying if you layer it right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, okay, if you layer it right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but there isn't a single
person going to Primark </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, time to buy some drip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one goes to Primark thinking that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, if you spend $30 t-shirt right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's a worthwhile investment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're wearing this shit every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, if it looks good.
- That $30 t-shirt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is going to last you longer
than those three 10 pound shirt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 100%.
- Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like all I'm not saying
don't buy $30 t-shirts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it looks, all I'm
saying is if it looks good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks good, doesn't
matter about the price. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Doesn't matter about
the fucking brand name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's all a scam, anyway because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think at that point, it
literally just comes to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that person's personal preference of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do they consider this drip or no? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just saying, I
think we're fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we're just really fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck does that mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't put words in my mouth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think this is a shit debate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like three people who
have no idea in fashion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, what is drip?
- I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm arguing the best way
to perform open heart surgery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I'm really not
qualified to be discussing this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Obviously, wearing Supreme.
- Not none of us are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but wait, when are we ever qualified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to talk about the things we-
- We're never qualified </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to talk about shit we argue about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three weaves discuss drip,
we're possibly the three least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> qualified people to talk about drip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That doesn't mean I'm not going to argue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's Trash Taste.
- You know who do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> has drip though, our patrons.
- They do, they do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they are dripping the funds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> into the picture.
- Man, this guy is dripping, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> man, he probably owns 10 Supreme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at these Hypebeasts right here. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> - This was a very long episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> How long have we been recording for? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We talked about scams.
- Fuck me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We talked about scams,
Harry Potter shit and drip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Toy Story.
- And Toy Story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Toy Story and we somehow
talked about Eva as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I completely forgot.
- And Eva as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We forgot that we just talked about Eva. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> and you can buy drip from Primark. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's three things you
should take out of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hagrid fists.
- Hagrid fists. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, bye guys.
- Bye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bye.
