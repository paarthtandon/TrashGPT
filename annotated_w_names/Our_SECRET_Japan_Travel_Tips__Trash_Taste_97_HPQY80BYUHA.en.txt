<joey> don't know if you know my username but </joey>
<garnt> uh i'm growing yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm the only man in here i think we are </garnt>
<garnt> since we all shaved at all the same time </garnt>
<garnt> i wonder like who's who's growing he's </garnt>
<garnt> going to grow back the fastest now i </garnt>
<joey> think we're all kind of growing at the </joey>
<connor> same rate yeah you got black you got a </connor>
<connor> black beard </connor>
<garnt> you got to wait you got a black what you </garnt>
<garnt> got a black beard got a black bear why </garnt>
<connor> does that matter because that means my </connor>
<joey> favorite one-piece character </joey>
<connor> badass pirate back yeah yeah uh </connor>
<garnt> really lacking in uh </garnt>
<connor> creativity with this pirate's name um </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<connor> and obviously </connor>
<garnt> you're </garnt>
<joey> wait till i tell you about whitebeard </joey>
<joey> you'll never believe what he looks like </joey>
<connor> finish your sentence </connor>
<connor> conor black is darker </connor>
<connor> than brown yes </connor>
<connor> okay thank you what a hot song thank you </connor>
<connor> okay can we can we check that can </connor>
<connor> someone factor that stuff </connor>
<connor> out more it stands out more yeah well </connor>
<connor> let's get the ruler out let's uh let's </connor>
<connor> let's get the ruler if you want to if </connor>
<connor> you if we want to go we're going down to </connor>
<connor> the middle </connor>
<connor> does your face feel heavier with </connor>
<connor> blackheads </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> i know black paint is heavier than white </connor>
<connor> paint is that true yeah </connor>
<joey> is it actually yeah </joey>
<connor> that sounds like it could be true but </connor>
<garnt> that also sounds like it could be </garnt>
<joey> complicated so are you saying so are you </joey>
<connor> saying that a head of black hair is </connor>
<connor> heavy i don't believe any other color of </connor>
<connor> hair </connor>
<connor> well on that scale where your hair is </connor>
<garnt> not of a significant like </garnt>
<connor> weight in general right i think it's </connor>
<connor> very minimal but like let's say i </connor>
<garnt> learned this because i was like i was </garnt>
<garnt> looking at like weird uh ways that uh </garnt>
<garnt> planes save costs yeah which actually </garnt>
<joey> ties in nicely to auto layer travel yes </joey>
<garnt> travel so if you're traveling yes the </garnt>
<joey> reason why you don't see black planes </joey>
<joey> oh because they're heavier it's heavier </joey>
<joey> i thought it would just would have cost </joey>
<joey> a lot to paint the damn thing well no </joey>
<joey> they paint it white </joey>
<joey> oh i i would have thought they painted a </joey>
<joey> wire because of reflection yeah </joey>
<connor> or maybe the heat that is </connor>
<connor> twice as heavy i believe black paint is </connor>
<garnt> twice as heavy as white paint damn okay </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't know that well uh white hair is </garnt>
<garnt> thicker than black hair so i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's just enough paint that's </garnt>
<garnt> just like black hair nerfing yourself </garnt>
<garnt> because obviously because like that's </garnt>
<joey> that's that's like nature doing a </joey>
<connor> balance patch right it's something to do </connor>
<connor> with the pigments </connor>
<connor> that's the weirdest balance patch i've </connor>
<garnt> ever heard white hair is thicker than </garnt>
<garnt> black hair because black hair is heavier </garnt>
<joey> than white god's like shave off a few </joey>
<joey> pounds yeah we got a little level of </joey>
<garnt> playing field right now i got it wrong </garnt>
<garnt> white paint contains higher solid </garnt>
<garnt> content than black paint so white paints </garnt>
<connor> actually solid content no no no no no </connor>
<garnt> referring to athletes referring to </garnt>
<garnt> airplanes </garnt>
<garnt> yeah no that's what's there so wait so </garnt>
<joey> white paint is heavier than black paint </joey>
<garnt> yeah because they require more pigment </garnt>
<connor> to achieve the same level of saturation </connor>
<connor> so then i'm sure i'm pretty sure that's </connor>
<joey> wrong so then why do we not have black </joey>
<joey> planes yeah this is considered this is i </joey>
<joey> think i think the i think it's not that </joey>
<joey> deep i think it's purely just because it </joey>
<joey> reflects more of the sun and it doesn't </joey>
<joey> turn the plane into a you know [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> oven we're sounding like [ __ ] flat </garnt>
<joey> earthers right now yeah yeah yeah why </joey>
<joey> why play white paint's clearly heavier </joey>
<garnt> okay yeah this this is this is the this </garnt>
<garnt> is the reasoning behind it i have is </garnt>
<joey> that what a flat earth </joey>
<joey> but have you seen a black plane before </joey>
<garnt> how do you know </garnt>
<garnt> we've clearly never been around the </garnt>
<garnt> world the same amount of like </garnt>
<garnt> pseudoscience we're saying right now i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like no none of us are even close </garnt>
<joey> to scientists and uh we can like you </joey>
<joey> could logically make uh an argument for </joey>
<joey> both i feel yeah and uh come out on top </joey>
<joey> but uh i don't we don't uh even if the </joey>
<joey> if even the fact checkers i mean to be </joey>
<joey> fair oh yeah it would make sense if the </joey>
<joey> planes were black because </joey>
<joey> like then it'd be easier to spot in the </joey>
<garnt> sky right </garnt>
<garnt> no it would be harder to spot in the </garnt>
<garnt> night time </garnt>
<garnt> right because it would be like </garnt>
<garnt> completely invisible then but it's </garnt>
<joey> completely invisible anyway </joey>
<joey> this is so confusing you can't see a </joey>
<connor> bright white plane in the night </connor>
<connor> when i googled uh does black paint way </connor>
<connor> more than white paint google said white </connor>
<connor> paint weighs more but then i got another </connor>
<connor> article that says </connor>
<connor> uh black paint weighs more so bottom </connor>
<joey> line we don't [ __ ] say bottom line </joey>
<joey> nobody knows no one knows </joey>
<joey> we we cannot even scientists can't even </joey>
<garnt> agree with each other if black or white </garnt>
<joey> is heavier than each other have you ever </joey>
<joey> been in a plane that wasn't painted </joey>
<joey> white </joey>
<joey> uh i've been believe i have the ugliest </joey>
<joey> plane i've ever been on it was like a </joey>
<connor> shade of like you you i was with you </connor>
<connor> easyjet isn't that it was like it was </connor>
<garnt> like a shade of like highlighter oranges </garnt>
<joey> oh that is that is [ __ ] disgusting </joey>
<connor> it's a gross color i know they paint it </connor>
<connor> so that they don't have to like keep </connor>
<joey> like fixing the impurities on the chrome </joey>
<joey> or whatever oh is that what it is yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's it's cheaper to just </joey>
<joey> paint it again </joey>
<joey> i thought it was like a branding thing </joey>
<joey> uh well i mean obviously it's like well </joey>
<connor> we have to paint it to save costs yeah </connor>
<joey> as well brand it a little bit yeah but </joey>
<joey> is it heavier than white or black paint </joey>
<connor> probably it's probably heavier but maybe </connor>
<connor> the branding is like worth it it's </connor>
<garnt> probably lighter right because it's easy </garnt>
<connor> jet so it's got to be cheaper </connor>
<joey> surely surely yeah i don't know that is </joey>
<garnt> yeah i guess now that i think about it i </garnt>
<garnt> think that's the only </garnt>
<garnt> hey like only plane i've been on that's </garnt>
<garnt> like completely different color from </garnt>
<joey> white i've never eaten </joey>
<garnt> i've been on the pikachu plane i was </garnt>
<garnt> gonna say that apa aside from the pizza </garnt>
<joey> i thought i was going to be more excited </joey>
<joey> getting on that plane but then i </joey>
<joey> realized i can't see you can't see it </joey>
<connor> just looks like a plane this is what it </connor>
<joey> feels like to get a sick skin in a first </joey>
<garnt> person game it's like it's like do you </garnt>
<connor> want a badass skin then i can't yeah </connor>
<joey> that actually is </joey>
<joey> amazing what's the point what's the </joey>
<connor> point i never got that why do people </connor>
<joey> care about skins in first person games </joey>
<garnt> so you can flex it on other people </garnt>
<joey> because you see some other people you </joey>
<connor> see your arms and that's pretty much it </connor>
<garnt> it's to show dominance amongst your </garnt>
<garnt> fellow players yeah to make them know if </garnt>
<connor> you have the samurai armor and halo you </connor>
<garnt> have an absolute massive [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> i obviously have not played enough first </garnt>
<connor> person games but we're not talking about </connor>
<connor> games today what are we talking about </connor>
<connor> because i thought it'd be fun to </connor>
<joey> actually do a themed episode it's been a </joey>
<joey> while since we've done a themed episode </joey>
<joey> right the music episode was the last </joey>
<connor> this is the most scuffed themed episode </connor>
<joey> by the way </joey>
<joey> we haven't written anything down we're </joey>
<garnt> just like winging it yeah i mean i mean </garnt>
<connor> i mean okay by themed episode we have a </connor>
<connor> topic that i hope we're gonna stick to </connor>
<connor> i'm not okay i'm not gonna get it i'm </connor>
<garnt> not gonna guarantee that we're gonna </garnt>
<connor> stick together i guarantee we'll talk </connor>
<connor> about among us in 20 minutes </connor>
<garnt> but uh i i feel like now that we're </garnt>
<garnt> getting ready to travel and now that it </garnt>
<joey> seems like the country is slowly opening </joey>
<joey> back up i mean at the time of recording </joey>
<joey> uh japan have finally let in you know uh </joey>
<joey> work visas and student visas after like </joey>
<joey> what two years is it like two and a half </joey>
<joey> two years and who knows what the </joey>
<joey> situation is going to be like now when </joey>
<connor> this episode actually is released maybe </connor>
<connor> the country will be open and maybe a </connor>
<joey> bunch of you are going to be traveling </joey>
<connor> to japan for tourism and stuff like that </connor>
<joey> you know best case scenario is that </joey>
<joey> before the year ends people start coming </joey>
<connor> so hopefully this episode will come in </connor>
<connor> handy when you do eventually come to </connor>
<connor> japan yeah but uh </connor>
<connor> i mean so like probably gonna be a while </connor>
<joey> though yeah </joey>
<joey> lots of lots of time to plan out well </joey>
<joey> yeah you know like many people pointed </joey>
<joey> out japan unfortunately uh has an </joey>
<connor> extremely older population </connor>
<connor> and older people don't really leave </connor>
<connor> japan and a lot of them have never left </connor>
<connor> japan never even gone out of the country </connor>
<connor> yeah so a lot of the people i think it's </connor>
<garnt> like 80 or 70 90 percent of people agree </garnt>
<garnt> with the travel </garnt>
<garnt> ban right yeah whereas other countries </garnt>
<garnt> you know like europe uk it's like well </garnt>
<connor> i've got to have a holiday in benidorm </connor>
<connor> oh my cousin's from who lives in </connor>
<garnt> portland because people in the uk want </garnt>
<joey> the country to be open because otherwise </joey>
<joey> they'd be stuck in the uk and where the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] is there to go on a holiday in the </joey>
<garnt> uk butlins </garnt>
<connor> yeah which is why it sucks because like </connor>
<connor> obviously a lot of people from america </connor>
<connor> europe don't really understand why japan </connor>
<connor> isn't opening up and it's like well you </connor>
<joey> need to kind of understand the </joey>
<joey> japan puts like probably the most amount </joey>
<joey> of effort into their domestic tourism </joey>
<connor> yeah i mean that ties into the whole </connor>
<joey> elderly population yeah </joey>
<joey> people like i want to travel but i don't </joey>
<joey> want to get on a plane yeah i know i'll </joey>
<joey> get on a bullet train and go somewhere </joey>
<joey> completely different yeah it's you know </joey>
<connor> but let's just be optimistic </connor>
<connor> i'll be i'll stop being one customer </connor>
<connor> let's just be optimistic and let's be </connor>
<connor> like you know what maybe maybe the old </connor>
<garnt> people will uh change their minds and be </garnt>
<garnt> like you know what you know what tourism </garnt>
<connor> tourism good right </connor>
<connor> single wars started because the old ones </connor>
<garnt> pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> so so yeah so let's say japan is open </garnt>
<garnt> and you are planning a trip to japan and </garnt>
<garnt> you've heard us talk about a [ __ ] ton of </garnt>
<garnt> things um in like about close to like a </garnt>
<garnt> hundred episodes now so you don't you </garnt>
<garnt> don't know where to look because we've </garnt>
<garnt> we've been talking about japan for what </garnt>
<garnt> about about japan for 100 episodes so </garnt>
<garnt> you don't really know even where to </garnt>
<joey> start or maybe we've set a location </joey>
<joey> place and you're like what or who is </joey>
<garnt> that yeah so we thought it'd be fun to </garnt>
<garnt> just have an episode where it's just </garnt>
<garnt> cl like collectively what we actually </garnt>
<garnt> recommend or don't recommend about japan </garnt>
<garnt> if you're gonna plan our trip use this </garnt>
<garnt> episode as like a placeholder just to </garnt>
<garnt> listen to it and be like oh that sounds </garnt>
<garnt> interesting and if the place sucks you </garnt>
<joey> can blame us </joey>
<garnt> pretty much </garnt>
<connor> obviously it depends on how long you're </connor>
<joey> going for that's the best yeah yes we're </joey>
<connor> talking about five days </connor>
<joey> maybe you can still go out of tokyo yeah </joey>
<joey> but five days you can very easily just </joey>
<joey> stay in tokyo and have a great time the </joey>
<joey> first two times i came to japan i never </joey>
<joey> left </joey>
<connor> yeah exactly mainly because i was scared </connor>
<joey> um and of the old </joey>
<joey> people they're going to beat me </joey>
<joey> i mean you know using the shinkansens </joey>
<joey> and stuff is kind of intimidating it is </joey>
<connor> daunting yeah if no one's ever like </connor>
<garnt> helped you do it yeah no it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> intimidating because obviously in tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> there's a safety net because a lot of </garnt>
<joey> things in tokyo are built with the </joey>
<joey> idea that there's going to be people </joey>
<joey> from abroad coming to visit right so a </joey>
<joey> lot of places a lot of places have you </joey>
<joey> know english menu still you know you uh </joey>
<joey> it's way more it's way more friendly and </joey>
<garnt> open whereas if you go outside of tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> you want to go eat and you're just like </garnt>
<garnt> okay this restaurant probably doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> have english on it dark souls </garnt>
<garnt> like this this 70 year old shop owner </garnt>
<garnt> has probably never seen a foreigner in </garnt>
<garnt> her life exactly exactly and it is </garnt>
<garnt> daunting you know even even nowadays for </garnt>
<joey> for </joey>
<joey> uh for us even though if even though </joey>
<joey> we're well traveled you know sometimes </joey>
<joey> you know i i can do it but like </joey>
<garnt> sometimes i have to like psych myself up </garnt>
<joey> i'm japanese and i get intimidated yeah </joey>
<joey> because they look at me and they're like </joey>
<connor> you're not japanese </connor>
<joey> i don't know when it happened i just </joey>
<garnt> stopped giving a [ __ ] about being awful </garnt>
<joey> at japanese like a few months ago yeah </joey>
<garnt> so now i just talk and then i get over </garnt>
<joey> it yeah i don't i don't know if i do </joey>
<joey> good but i always get what i need </joey>
<connor> yeah so whether or not i'm doing it </connor>
<joey> right or not i get my i get my tonkatsu </joey>
<garnt> yeah exactly um but yeah like just </garnt>
<garnt> pretend okay </garnt>
<garnt> you're you've just landed and you're on </garnt>
<garnt> a trip with the boys we're gonna show </garnt>
<garnt> you around we're gonna show you around </garnt>
<connor> it's your first time to japan life hack </connor>
<connor> number one okay fly to hannibal don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] fly to narrative yes actually </connor>
<garnt> actually that is that is that's like </garnt>
<joey> that is number one top three locations </joey>
<connor> in japan that suck ass narrator airport </connor>
<garnt> i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it might not be it might not be like </garnt>
<garnt> you might not be able to avoid anything </garnt>
<garnt> on which airline you fly with like if </garnt>
<garnt> you're cuz i know like a lot of the </garnt>
<garnt> major airlines like i think like </garnt>
<garnt> emirates and all those yeah you'll go to </garnt>
<garnt> narita yeah nrt you want to go to hnd if </garnt>
<garnt> you can yeah because you have to get a a </garnt>
<joey> train for one naruto is not in tokyo </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> it's in chiba right yeah it's like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> further away from chiba isn't it yeah </garnt>
<connor> also to get into tokyo will cost you </connor>
<joey> like 50 bucks yeah yeah oh it depends if </joey>
<connor> you go on the narrator express which is </connor>
<connor> like the most famous like bullet train s </connor>
<joey> thing from narita airport it's like it's </joey>
<garnt> so expensive it's actually like 80 bucks </garnt>
<connor> but there's a skyline as well which you </connor>
<garnt> can get yes but like i didn't know about </garnt>
<joey> that the first time i came to narita </joey>
<joey> because they don't advertise they don't </joey>
<joey> totally advertise their narrator express </joey>
<joey> because it's convenient yeah it's </joey>
<connor> because like the narita express um is </connor>
<connor> the big kind of </connor>
<connor> shinjuku right yeah it goes to shinjuku </connor>
<connor> right but uh yeah it's the it's the big </connor>
<connor> one that's advertised about how to get </connor>
<connor> into tokyo and like a one-way ticket </connor>
<connor> there uh using the narita express costs </connor>
<connor> about i think 80 to 100 bucks yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> like 200 bucks yeah </connor>
<connor> the first few times i went to japan i </connor>
<connor> didn't i did not know that there were </connor>
<joey> other choices that you could make uh so </joey>
<joey> if if you have to fly to narita we </joey>
<garnt> highly recommend the skyline yes which </garnt>
<joey> is cheaper than the norwegian it's </joey>
<joey> cheaper and it stops it basically when </joey>
<connor> you get off your plane at narita are you </connor>
<connor> done go to the trains and they'll be </connor>
<connor> like a bunch of ticket things but </connor>
<connor> there'll be one specific office that </connor>
<joey> says skyliner yeah you can't miss it uh </joey>
<joey> they speak english as well so go there </joey>
<joey> yeah and ask them like 40 bucks yeah you </joey>
<connor> pay like half the price yeah yeah and </connor>
<joey> it's it's great and it's just as fast </joey>
<connor> it's actually just as fast which is why </connor>
<joey> i'm just like why is the narita express </joey>
<joey> twice as expensive because they can get </joey>
<joey> their money though yeah yeah but yeah go </joey>
<connor> to hannah hannah's super easy you're </connor>
<connor> basically in uh where are you near in </connor>
<joey> canada uh nearly odaiba yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah tokyo so you're actually one you're </garnt>
<garnt> in tokyo two you can you know take the </garnt>
<garnt> subway dude the [ __ ] uh you can take </garnt>
<joey> the monorail dude the monorail is has a </joey>
<garnt> sick view dude yeah the monorail awesome </garnt>
<joey> or you can just get a cab if you're lazy </joey>
<joey> you can get a cab train or monorail but </joey>
<joey> the most aesthetic one is definitely a </joey>
<connor> lot of the caps have the uh </connor>
<joey> english-speaking uh computer thing in it </joey>
<joey> oh really yeah i've never used it i just </joey>
<joey> i just shouted them like go here </joey>
<joey> but um yeah this uh i've never seen them </joey>
<joey> maybe i should test it just see how it </joey>
<garnt> goes yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah so like we said you know first </joey>
<joey> first step if you can fly to canada we </joey>
<joey> highly recommend you fly to hanada </joey>
<joey> because you're gonna have such </joey>
<joey> it's gonna you're gonna have like a way </joey>
<joey> better experience it's gonna be less </joey>
<joey> stressful getting just genuinely as well </joey>
<joey> that's a really nice airport yeah it's a </joey>
<joey> really nice airport you get better views </joey>
<garnt> and it's also cheaper so </garnt>
<garnt> that's basically every reason you could </garnt>
<garnt> possibly think of to fly to a certain </garnt>
<garnt> airport over another if you have a </garnt>
<connor> choice </connor>
<connor> it's normally more expensive to go there </connor>
<connor> but the cost of like the train tickets </connor>
<garnt> and transitions yeah yeah it might make </garnt>
<garnt> up for my money </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly so it offsets the cost it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like gatwick in heathrow yeah </garnt>
<garnt> in london gatwick's a joke gatwick is </garnt>
<connor> basically in brighton what's the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> point of the airport it's great for me </connor>
<connor> it's it's annoying as [ __ ] it's </connor>
<joey> literally not in like in london what's </joey>
<joey> the other airport that you guys are </joey>
<connor> heathrow no there's one more right oh no </connor>
<connor> luton now no no no </connor>
<joey> then we go to like then we've got like </joey>
<connor> stansted </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like i don't even count those as </garnt>
<connor> like [ __ ] airports okay those getting </connor>
<connor> to stansted and stuff like that is more </connor>
<garnt> difficult than get it like the journey </garnt>
<garnt> like to france yeah right right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it's ridiculous about japan </garnt>
<garnt> we're talking about japan yeah pov </garnt>
<garnt> you've just landed in your airport where </garnt>
<garnt> where are you going to stay where would </garnt>
<garnt> you recommend staying what's it what's </garnt>
<joey> the best player </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> you've got a lot of options right like a </connor>
<garnt> hotel is literally the same stories </garnt>
<garnt> don't do up okay but okay all right yes </garnt>
<connor> you might have to deal with racist books </connor>
<connor> in your hotel room which sucks but it's </connor>
<connor> this it's like the same price as like a </connor>
<garnt> capsule hotel </garnt>
<joey> it's a closet because it is a capsule </joey>
<garnt> hotel yeah i mean you get a bed though i </garnt>
<connor> would highly recommend i would highly </connor>
<connor> recommend airbnbs airbnbs </connor>
<connor> is my is my best experience in terms of </connor>
<garnt> accommodation staying in tokyo which </garnt>
<joey> might be which might be difficult though </joey>
<joey> because of the recent like airbnb </joey>
<garnt> even off because i have stayed in </garnt>
<garnt> airbnbs since they've got ridden got rid </garnt>
<garnt> of a lot of airbnbs and they are still </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 times better than most hotels in </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo and the reason is because most </garnt>
<garnt> hotels in tokyo are they are just </garnt>
<garnt> business hotels right they're they're </garnt>
<garnt> they come with the assumption that </garnt>
<garnt> you're just going to stay like </garnt>
<garnt> the guys staying there aren't even going </garnt>
<garnt> to be going to be in the hotel at all </garnt>
<joey> unless you're staying at like a hilton </joey>
<garnt> like everything else is just like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> everything else is just everything else </garnt>
<connor> is just a closet or a shoebox i think </connor>
<connor> there's some decent ones i think i've </connor>
<joey> stayed in i don't know where they are </joey>
<connor> yeah priced i'm sure there is </connor>
<garnt> i think you have to look you do yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you do have to look but i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> with airbnbs there's just you tokyo is </garnt>
<connor> absolutely saturated with hotels there's </connor>
<garnt> a lot of hotels yeah like because they </garnt>
<garnt> know if all the airbnb yeah yeah you can </garnt>
<garnt> you can definitely find a good hotel if </garnt>
<joey> that's what you want because i get it </joey>
<joey> sometimes you don't deal with an airbnb </joey>
<joey> because sometimes you know it's kind of </joey>
<joey> a weird experience you have to sometimes </joey>
<joey> really sometimes sometimes you get the </joey>
<joey> key in a really weird way and sometimes </joey>
<joey> you're in an apartment building and you </joey>
<joey> get stared at and stuff and then also </joey>
<garnt> you're like the neighbor's house three </garnt>
<garnt> times </garnt>
<garnt> you don't really understand how the the </garnt>
<garnt> locks work and stuff you're like i get </garnt>
<garnt> it a hotel is just like boom card in </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's services they can do </garnt>
<garnt> your laundry and stuff i get it i just i </garnt>
<garnt> just feel like you it's yeah it's it's </garnt>
<connor> it's not this it's up to you but like </connor>
<connor> i want to worry less about things i want </connor>
<joey> to safe in my room yeah but you're also </joey>
<joey> probably staying at a hilton </joey>
<connor> that's like that's like a one night </connor>
<connor> thing if i'm lucky </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> you know i i feel like it's a waste </joey>
<joey> staying in a luxury hotel for like more </joey>
<joey> than one just like more than one day </joey>
<joey> because like you want to do [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> you know what i mean like you want to go </connor>
<connor> outside like just get a hotel with </connor>
<connor> enough room where you can be comfortable </connor>
<connor> eating a cup noodle in it if you want </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> let let me try let me sell you on the </connor>
<connor> airbnb all right guys </connor>
<garnt> okay because with airbnb you have more </garnt>
<garnt> anemies you have like you have a working </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] microwave or like one of those </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of airbnbs have one of those </garnt>
<garnt> mini grills so if you want to like go to </garnt>
<joey> family mart or 7-eleven or lawsons and </joey>
<joey> buy your buy the famous fried chicken </joey>
<joey> that's uh that connor and chris have </joey>
<joey> eaten a lot but you don't want it cold </joey>
<garnt> you can perfectly just grill it in your </garnt>
<joey> airbnb warm it's home when you buy it </joey>
<connor> what do you mean it's warm when you buy </connor>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> how how long are you carrying around </joey>
<garnt> this family i don't know i don't i'm not </garnt>
<connor> okay so like </connor>
<connor> i i will say that probably the one </connor>
<connor> country on earth you don't need a </connor>
<connor> microwave is japan yeah there's </connor>
<connor> literally one on every corner that </connor>
<garnt> you're allowed to use freely </garnt>
<connor> that is true absolutely that is true </connor>
<connor> i love this one </connor>
<garnt> i don't know how that was your first </garnt>
<connor> lives </connor>
<joey> it's like guys they have a microwave </joey>
<garnt> they have a microphone don't worry okay </garnt>
<connor> okay but no like normally like i found </connor>
<joey> like you get more room in your airbnb as </joey>
<connor> well you like yeah like a lot of the </connor>
<joey> times the hotel rooms it's just a shoe </joey>
<connor> box where you don't have room to walk at </connor>
<connor> all </connor>
<connor> yeah with airbnbs you actually have </connor>
<connor> walking space sometimes you you have </connor>
<connor> like a living space and like a bedroom </connor>
<connor> space which is like which is good uh </connor>
<connor> another thing is that a lot of airbnbs i </connor>
<connor> found in japan especially they come with </connor>
<connor> portable wi-fi right so a lot of times </connor>
<connor> you don't want to faff around with </connor>
<garnt> getting data in japan because it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's such it's such a hassle but with so </garnt>
<garnt> many airbnbs basically about 90 of </garnt>
<garnt> airbnbs i've stayed at the owners are </garnt>
<garnt> kind enough to provide you with a </garnt>
<garnt> portable wi-fi which not only works as </garnt>
<garnt> the wi-fi in the airbnb but works as a </garnt>
<garnt> portable wi-fi which you can take with </garnt>
<joey> you as you're traveling around japan </joey>
<joey> although i will say that i think most if </joey>
<joey> not all train stations in the tokyo area </joey>
<connor> have free wi-fi </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] annoying to connect to it though </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> also also every mcdonald's has a free </joey>
<garnt> wi-fi yeah i mean just honestly you get </garnt>
<garnt> it from the airport there's like a </garnt>
<garnt> bazillion of these it is expensive as </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] though data is expensive </garnt>
<connor> google maps is literally your best </connor>
<joey> friend yeah i still use it with the </joey>
<joey> amount of walking you're going to do </joey>
<connor> with me yeah everyone's like if you have </connor>
<connor> like an international plan for data or </connor>
<connor> something i i highly recommend that </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> buying data here which is why i </connor>
<connor> recommend airbnbs if they give you </connor>
<garnt> portable wi-fi buying data here as a </garnt>
<garnt> tourist is really really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> expensive it's like seventy dollars for </garnt>
<garnt> like there's two weeks ago there's </garnt>
<connor> vending machines </connor>
<connor> vending machines at the airport that do </connor>
<connor> sim cards </connor>
<connor> really do </connor>
<connor> data only sim cards yeah they are quite </connor>
<connor> pricey but you know it will do what you </connor>
<connor> need to do because i mean google chrome </connor>
<joey> you can get a vending machine experience </joey>
<connor> right off the bat right yeah </connor>
<joey> oh my god i've never bought a similar </joey>
<joey> vending machine </joey>
<connor> there's also you can </connor>
<connor> just like type in portable wi-fi </connor>
<connor> whatever airport you're going to </connor>
<connor> there'll be ones you can get as well </connor>
<joey> yeah well one piece of advice for me </joey>
<joey> that i want to tell people is get a </joey>
<joey> seeker </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah oh yeah because that's going to </garnt>
<garnt> be your best friend as well this is this </garnt>
<garnt> is a suica card okay this is the </garnt>
<garnt> equivalent to an oyster card although i </garnt>
<garnt> don't believe we use it </garnt>
<connor> like metro cards um it's really easy uh </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<joey> you can get one at basically any machine </joey>
<joey> on the metro or anything like that here </joey>
<joey> like 500 yen yeah it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> 500 yen and you can load it up </joey>
<joey> immediately um every machine has an </joey>
<garnt> english option and multiple other </garnt>
<garnt> languages as well so you don't need to </garnt>
<garnt> worry about learning japanese to buy a </garnt>
<garnt> suiker car it's super easy and yeah same </garnt>
<connor> with </connor>
<garnt> bullet trains yeah and also you can pay </garnt>
<garnt> with it if you don't want to deal with </garnt>
<garnt> cash load up load up a [ __ ] ton of money </garnt>
<garnt> every single fast food chain and every </garnt>
<garnt> single conbini will accept it everything </garnt>
<garnt> mostly vending machines as well yeah </garnt>
<garnt> except machines trains yeah </garnt>
<garnt> everything which is which is very very </garnt>
<garnt> useful because if you don't </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't remember this then you're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna meet needing to bring cash do not </garnt>
<garnt> expect to be able to pay by card </garnt>
<garnt> anywhere just just some places do accept </garnt>
<garnt> it but don't expect to come into a place </garnt>
<garnt> even if it looks like a you know a big </garnt>
<garnt> establishment that should have a card </garnt>
<garnt> machine a lot of places don't accept </garnt>
<garnt> cards or even credit cards to be fair it </garnt>
<garnt> is getting better </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot more places now especially </garnt>
<joey> like since when i first moved i </joey>
<joey> remembered like half the places i went </joey>
<joey> to didn't accept card at all but like i </joey>
<joey> feel nowadays like most places in </joey>
<joey> central tokyo except card but yeah also </joey>
<joey> you know it's the suka is good because </joey>
<garnt> again you can use it not just at a </garnt>
<joey> restaurant but literally anywhere yeah </joey>
<garnt> um so super handy yeah but also just </garnt>
<garnt> carry cash with you always yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> you're going to need it for something in </garnt>
<garnt> japan um even if you don't know what it </garnt>
<garnt> is immediately there's always going to </garnt>
<garnt> be one little thing where this place </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't accept anything but cash or </garnt>
<garnt> machine doesn't accept anything but cash </garnt>
<garnt> you're you're going to need it so don't </garnt>
<garnt> don't assume that we're like in japan's </garnt>
<garnt> like every other you know first world </garnt>
<garnt> country where uh we have a character </garnt>
<garnt> like a mom mom-and-pop like shop right </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> like the old like restaurants and stuff </garnt>
<joey> like that they'll usually just be like </joey>
<garnt> nope cash only yeah yeah and uh i know </garnt>
<garnt> since you're watching trash taste you're </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm guessing a lot of you are weebs </garnt>
<garnt> right i'm guessing i'm guessing maybe </garnt>
<connor> maybe i don't know this i don't know huh </connor>
<garnt> where you going with this </garnt>
<garnt> do you would you could you talk about </garnt>
<garnt> archaeology we've told we've talked </garnt>
<garnt> about how akihabara is overrated right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah or how we think it is but i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like it still is </garnt>
<garnt> one of the best places to go if you just </garnt>
<connor> have like a day or two in tokyo and </connor>
<garnt> you've never been to japan before right </garnt>
<connor> because i feel like there's nothing that </connor>
<connor> really beats that first day akihabara </connor>
<joey> experience because yes </joey>
<joey> yes you can get figures for a better </joey>
<joey> price online or other places what's the </joey>
<joey> magic it's the magic yeah it's the magic </joey>
<garnt> right it's like it's like disneyland but </garnt>
<joey> for weebs yeah it's the fact that </joey>
<garnt> literally every billboard and building </garnt>
<garnt> you see around you is covered in anime </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which is like not really a place </garnt>
<garnt> you can experience anywhere else in the </garnt>
<garnt> world or rather anywhere else in japan </garnt>
<connor> yeah exactly it's kind of out of the way </connor>
<connor> it's a little annoying to get there i'd </connor>
<joey> say i mean it's like what like 15 </joey>
<joey> minutes from tokyo station </joey>
<connor> yeah i'd say if you're going to stay </connor>
<connor> anywhere stay around shinjuku shibuya </connor>
<connor> you want a fun time </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah i'd say shinjuku probably </connor>
<garnt> has the most stuff nearby yeah you have </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> shibuya yeah yeah all that kind of stuff </garnt>
<connor> and then you have the akihabara side of </connor>
<connor> tokyo which you have to quite easily </connor>
<connor> yeah which you can just cut straight </connor>
<joey> across to has like you know asakusa you </joey>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> like you can easily spend a day in </garnt>
<garnt> akihabara oh easy like easily </garnt>
<joey> like every time i go to akihabara even </joey>
<joey> today i still find new [ __ ] to do yeah </joey>
<connor> exactly whether you like retro games </connor>
<connor> anime figures uh classic stuff you know </connor>
<connor> like really old transformer stuff </connor>
<connor> any kind of otaku stuff is that made </connor>
<connor> cafes </connor>
<garnt> boys boys </garnt>
<connor> don't go to a cafe don't go to </connor>
<connor> we a major </connor>
<garnt> helping them yes go to a maid campaign </garnt>
<garnt> have you been normal caffeine absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> not yeah you don't want to no i can tell </garnt>
<connor> people to go we've got we've gone to </connor>
<garnt> like i can get an affiliate there are </garnt>
<garnt> okay here's here's the thing there are </garnt>
<garnt> way cooler themed bars in japan and in </garnt>
<garnt> akihabara than maid cafe you've been to </garnt>
<garnt> a bunch corner and like so many yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you've been to so many and like you know </garnt>
<garnt> you guys you guys have made videos about </garnt>
<garnt> it um sydney's making videos about it as </garnt>
<garnt> well like everyone wants to go to a maid </garnt>
<garnt> cafe but i feel like the maid cafe is </garnt>
<garnt> like the most basic themed cafe you </garnt>
<garnt> could possibly go to when there are </garnt>
<connor> experience that i haven't had but i'm </connor>
<garnt> okay not having i i can have it i've had </garnt>
<garnt> the experience and i have had a much </garnt>
<garnt> funner time going to like the other </garnt>
<garnt> themed bars because wouldn't made </garnt>
<connor> caffeine </connor>
<joey> i feel like it's an afternoon thing it </joey>
<joey> is an afternoon thing but it's also it </joey>
<connor> doesn't matter it's just cringe yeah but </connor>
<connor> yeah like i hated it i just want to see </connor>
<garnt> people go it's also why do you want to </garnt>
<joey> see people go because i want to see </joey>
<connor> people yeah i want them to stay in </connor>
<joey> business right i don't know that they're </joey>
<joey> dying right they're dying at the moment </joey>
<joey> i want them to stay in business but i </joey>
<connor> don't want to be the one giving them </connor>
<connor> music </connor>
<connor> it's a cultural icon </connor>
<joey> it is a cultural icon but i feel just </joey>
<connor> give them your jokes </connor>
<joey> yeah i feel with the amount of like </joey>
<garnt> other themed places in japan and japan </garnt>
<garnt> is very good at doing theme like bars </garnt>
<garnt> and restaurants and stuff like that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i just feel like </garnt>
<garnt> maid cafes are kind of just becoming </garnt>
<garnt> like old at this point yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> you know what to expect at a mei cafe </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but you don't know what to expect </garnt>
<garnt> at like i don't know like a lockdown a </garnt>
<connor> lockout or you know any of those like </connor>
<connor> really cool you know kind of hidden </connor>
<connor> underground like bars and cafes right </connor>
<connor> it's lockout yeah a lockout is this </connor>
<connor> prison themed uh </connor>
<connor> restaurant that i've been to a few times </connor>
<connor> where is it uh there's a couple there is </connor>
<connor> one in shinjuku i believe oh i think i </connor>
<joey> went you basically go underground </joey>
<joey> through a haunted house and then you end </joey>
<joey> up and you eat inside of a cage that's </joey>
<connor> what they scream half the time yeah they </connor>
<joey> think i went through the show i think i </joey>
<connor> went there and i thought the food was </connor>
<joey> like the worst food i've ever had in my </joey>
<joey> life no the main cafe if it was a </joey>
<garnt> million times no like i i i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> the maid cafe food i don't know why it's </garnt>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> a 100 of the time it's horrible food i </joey>
<joey> mean it's on par with </joey>
<joey> like you know rice </joey>
<joey> where </joey>
<garnt> we only think it's good food because a </garnt>
<joey> cute girl made it no no i don't know i </joey>
<joey> think it's okay no but most people feel </joey>
<joey> that way so well the cute girl made us a </joey>
<joey> must be good see and everything's </joey>
<joey> overpriced as well yeah you know it's </joey>
<garnt> everything's overpriced and it's like 20 </garnt>
<joey> bucks for the most mid-autumn ice i've </joey>
<connor> ever had yeah yeah right </connor>
<joey> you know you get a good army rice though </joey>
<joey> i mean if you want like a brand one yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah roll host and then they do a good </joey>
<garnt> one </garnt>
<joey> there's one on akihabara this is like </joey>
<connor> the denny's like deluxe yeah it's like </connor>
<joey> so fancy and the prices are like </joey>
<joey> ridiculous this is this is what i feel </joey>
<garnt> denny's wished it was </garnt>
<garnt> like like going to japan and just going </garnt>
<garnt> to a maid cafe with all the themed bars </garnt>
<connor> that all cafes are available it's like </connor>
<connor> going to america to for a burger joint </connor>
<connor> and going to mcdonald's or some [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like that you know that's right </connor>
<connor> that's that's like you like you can you </connor>
<connor> have to </connor>
<connor> you have i'm there you have so much </connor>
<connor> choice of so many different themes and </connor>
<joey> different unique concepts and then you </joey>
<joey> go to a maid cafe where they do the momo </joey>
<joey> beam on your food and call it a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> day that's it that's it thank you thank </joey>
<joey> you for 50 dollars </joey>
<joey> and uh you know if uh there's there's a </joey>
<joey> lot more places than you can go to </joey>
<joey> through to a maid cafe also i want to </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] die when i go to a major just go </garnt>
<joey> to me cafe at your local con it's </joey>
<joey> probably the same experience it actually </joey>
<joey> is actually honestly the same </joey>
<joey> it's honestly the same except the only </joey>
<garnt> difference is that the one in japan you </garnt>
<garnt> probably won't understand what they're </garnt>
<garnt> saying half the time exactly that's the </garnt>
<garnt> only difference yeah all right but uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean you'll understand when </garnt>
<garnt> you're at all majors i don't want to get </garnt>
<connor> hurt i want to go i'm far too british to </connor>
<joey> like i'm like i want to see you at a </joey>
<joey> main cafe you and you and chris and are </joey>
<garnt> made careful you and chris and the main </garnt>
<joey> cafe would be the best </joey>
<joey> that's too much cringe </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean i mean like i'm i even i'm </joey>
<joey> more attuned to like the anime culture </joey>
<garnt> and stuff and i'm just like i can't </garnt>
<joey> handle no i couldn't handle it it's </joey>
<garnt> it's uh i i think i'd rather be seen at </garnt>
<garnt> a strip club or something like that i </garnt>
<garnt> would i i would </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like that's less normal yeah </garnt>
<garnt> more normal yeah more normal but yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean like obviously get akihabara out of </garnt>
<garnt> your system because you've got you're </garnt>
<garnt> going to go you're going to want to go </garnt>
<garnt> to akihabara yeah you are going to have </garnt>
<garnt> a good time yeah and uh if you're </garnt>
<garnt> looking for you know places to go then </garnt>
<garnt> just look at our figure special you know </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's we basically curated our </garnt>
<garnt> figure special to the places that we </garnt>
<garnt> like to shop in akihabara um are there </garnt>
<garnt> any other shops you would recommend in </garnt>
<connor> akihabara that they go to oh god this is </connor>
<joey> so mean why why me </joey>
<joey> super potato is really good that's the </joey>
<garnt> retro game place that's like what's the </garnt>
<garnt> dojin store oh it's an animal yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah well there's one there's melon </joey>
<garnt> books which are two different ones uh </garnt>
<garnt> both are good yeah that's melon books i </garnt>
<garnt> think has like four entire floors of </garnt>
<joey> just doujin stuff so if you like that </joey>
<joey> then go for it but </joey>
<joey> has a better selection in my opinion </joey>
<joey> yeah i think so and that one has like </joey>
<joey> seven floors or something that is like </joey>
<joey> seven or eight floors </joey>
<garnt> and there's two buildings as well yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah because like a lot of akihabara </garnt>
<garnt> is you go into a store and it looks like </garnt>
<garnt> a one it looks like it's just a </garnt>
<garnt> one-story store because it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] tiny right uh it's full of stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and then you go in and you realize they </garnt>
<garnt> have stairs and then you go up the </garnt>
<garnt> stairs and you realize there's another </garnt>
<garnt> set of stairs and you just you realize </garnt>
<garnt> that it just keeps going up and up and </garnt>
<garnt> up and up so a lot of suddenly you're in </garnt>
<connor> a mob </connor>
<joey> basically and also like the best thing i </joey>
<joey> think about akihabara especially when </joey>
<joey> you go into like the really like small </joey>
<joey> building unmarked buildings is that each </joey>
<garnt> of the floors is usually a different </garnt>
<garnt> store entirely so you could be in a </garnt>
<garnt> figure store at one point you go up the </garnt>
<garnt> stairs and then suddenly you're in an </garnt>
<connor> idle shop and next moment you're in a </connor>
<garnt> retro game shop yeah yeah exact moment </garnt>
<garnt> you're in a tech shop and it's all in </garnt>
<joey> one building and it's yeah great yeah </joey>
<joey> that's why you can literally spend like </joey>
<garnt> hours just in one random building that </garnt>
<garnt> you stumbled into </garnt>
<garnt> um and of course like the arcades there </garnt>
<garnt> as well because if you want to go to </garnt>
<garnt> japan i highly like you have to go to </garnt>
<connor> the arcades there's this oh go to the </connor>
<joey> sega ones because they have the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> mech pilot game dude yeah yeah what's </garnt>
<joey> that one called i can't remember but </joey>
<joey> maybe don't go to the other ones in </joey>
<garnt> north carolina though because like most </garnt>
<joey> of them are gone yeah </joey>
<connor> all </connor>
<joey> there's a ton of sega buildings outside </joey>
<joey> of akihabara oh yeah yeah they have like </joey>
<joey> good games but the uh but the one in </joey>
<connor> zanacki happened have a lot of like </connor>
<connor> vintage games yeah they have typing of </connor>
<joey> the dead still they still have that yeah </joey>
<joey> they have a they have an entire building </joey>
<joey> that just has like an entire floor full </joey>
<joey> of like old school ladies crazy taxi </joey>
<connor> it's got a few other games got time </connor>
<joey> crisis two or three which one you play a </joey>
<joey> game on the arcades for like 50 yen i </joey>
<garnt> think yeah yeah it's like really like </garnt>
<connor> most most arcade games are just a </connor>
<garnt> hundred yen which is </garnt>
<connor> uh the </connor>
<joey> old uh retro game oh yeah oh yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah it was dope as [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> which is also right shinjuku so yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah uh i can't remember what it's </connor>
<connor> called just type in arcade place takada </connor>
<garnt> no baba yeah yeah um and yeah like i </garnt>
<garnt> still think like my favorite arcade game </garnt>
<garnt> is the mecca pilot game so there is have </garnt>
<connor> we talked about it we've mentioned it </connor>
<connor> before but again we don't know the name </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's literally like a hydraulic </garnt>
<garnt> mech </garnt>
<garnt> you'll see it because you literally are </garnt>
<connor> piloting a mech right you'll see people </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] tilting and [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah so you it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> reminds me of um these old-school like </garnt>
<joey> rides you see in malls or sometimes or </joey>
<joey> something where it's like you you're put </joey>
<joey> into like a capsule and you're like it's </joey>
<joey> like a roller coaster and like the uh </joey>
<joey> the capsule like tilts along with like </joey>
<joey> the roller coasters like 4d yeah like 4d </joey>
<joey> that you're seeing so imagine that </joey>
<joey> except you control the roller coaster </joey>
<joey> okay so when you when you when you pilot </joey>
<joey> this mech it'll tilt with you know it'll </joey>
<joey> tilt and curve uh when you accelerate </joey>
<joey> you feel like the acceleration and </joey>
<joey> everything it's </joey>
<joey> it's so cool it's if you're a mecca fan </joey>
<joey> or even if you're not it literally is </joey>
<joey> the closest you will ever come to </joey>
<joey> piloting a giant robot and it's pvp and </joey>
<joey> it's pvp as </joey>
<connor> well and it's also like a hundred yen </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah it's like it's like five </connor>
<connor> minutes ago yeah yeah it's really good </connor>
<connor> it's battle royale but uh if you are </connor>
<joey> gonna go to the arcade you probably </joey>
<joey> should look at like a tutorial about how </joey>
<joey> to get like the cards </joey>
<joey> because some of the progress some of </joey>
<joey> them no like some of the games they will </joey>
<joey> not let you go past the tutorial stage </joey>
<joey> if you don't have a card like basically </joey>
<joey> you you pay the money every rhythm game </joey>
<joey> yeah basically every rhythm game like if </joey>
<joey> you don't have a card um you're you're </joey>
<garnt> basically just stuck at the tutorial </garnt>
<joey> level there should be a card printer in </joey>
<joey> the building if it's a big arcade </joey>
<joey> yeah most of the bigger ones have it so </joey>
<joey> if you don't have a card just go to a </joey>
<garnt> big one and there should be a machine </garnt>
<garnt> that prints cards and they all have </garnt>
<garnt> there's like three different ones though </garnt>
<connor> you need to figure out which ones which </connor>
<connor> it's really confusing i'm sure there's a </connor>
<connor> guide online i'm sure yeah also if </connor>
<connor> you're having trouble what the [ __ ] is </connor>
<connor> being said on screen i just hold up </connor>
<garnt> google translate to the screen and </garnt>
<garnt> generally it works yeah yeah actually </garnt>
<garnt> that is a good le that is a google </garnt>
<connor> translate is it's not perfect but it'll </connor>
<garnt> give you the gist of everything yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> will be your best friend but basically </garnt>
<garnt> you should use it yeah google translate </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't know this until i moved to </garnt>
<garnt> japan where google translates has a uh </garnt>
<garnt> camera option where it will live </garnt>
<connor> translates things that you put through </connor>
<connor> the camera of google translate uh it's </connor>
<connor> been a life saver for me in a lot of </connor>
<connor> places here in japan </connor>
<connor> yeah exactly and uh if you ever in a </connor>
<garnt> restaurant where it's all in japanese </garnt>
<garnt> then google translate camera will be </garnt>
<connor> your best friend unless it's handwritten </connor>
<joey> and [ __ ] unless it's handwritten </joey>
<joey> uh and then you just got it blindly and </joey>
<garnt> then you just gotta hope that you're </garnt>
<garnt> with joey and uh he'll translate </garnt>
<connor> everything for you i just say </connor>
<connor> also sue me i asked for their </connor>
<connor> recommendations and i'm like rolling the </connor>
<connor> dice yeah please for the love of god to </connor>
<connor> give me something good when i usually </connor>
<connor> it's good probably normally it's </connor>
<joey> normally one time they gave me chicken </joey>
<garnt> carpaccio that was interesting oh wow </garnt>
<garnt> raw chicken raw chicken raw chicken </garnt>
<garnt> chicken sashimi </garnt>
<connor> yeah that was that was i was like damn </connor>
<connor> what a what a great recommendation </connor>
<joey> can't wait to get salmonella yeah </joey>

<joey> athletic greens down in the description </joey>
<joey> below and thank you delay greens for </joey>
<joey> sponsoring this episode back to the show </joey>
<garnt> but i mean if you're into weave stuff </garnt>
<garnt> it's not all akihabara of course that's </garnt>
<garnt> like the big mainstream place i i </garnt>
<joey> personally recommend for weeb stuff </joey>
<joey> that's not archibra </joey>
<garnt> not gonna broadway i was gonna say </garnt>
<garnt> because i feel like with with akihabara </garnt>
<joey> you get overwhelmed maybe that's what </joey>
<joey> you want maybe you want to be </joey>
<garnt> overwhelmed with weeb stuff but the </garnt>
<connor> problem with the problem with akihabara </connor>
<connor> is that it's very very much aligned with </connor>
<connor> let's say let's say weeb culture as </connor>
<connor> opposed to you know more other </connor>
<connor> underground anime culture which you can </connor>
<connor> you can find more </connor>
<connor> cool stuff in akihabara i i'd say i </connor>
<connor> don't know </connor>
<connor> more cool stuff in uh nakano broadway </connor>
<connor> because the way i the way i describe </connor>
<joey> akihabara is it's just like imagine if </joey>
<joey> you're on in on the convention floor </joey>
<joey> right that's that's basically akihabara </joey>
<joey> where you're on you're you're in the </joey>
<joey> dealers the dealers hall that's </joey>
<joey> akihabara uh nakano broadway is more </joey>
<connor> like the artist alley where you can get </connor>
<connor> more of like the </connor>
<garnt> more more like </garnt>
<joey> more stuff that's not my shops around </joey>
<garnt> there like the unconventional stuff the </garnt>
<garnt> unconventional stuff right in knocking </garnt>
<garnt> on broadway you know there's a store on </garnt>
<joey> the first floor where they just sell </joey>
<garnt> nothing but old anime cells yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> that place is really dope and then </joey>
<garnt> there's other ones that are like from </garnt>
<joey> like 40s and 50s japan styled stuff and </joey>
<connor> everything huge store there if you like </connor>
<connor> retro games and you want gamecube games </connor>
<garnt> or something that's really cheap there's </garnt>
<garnt> a place called book off oh yeah oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> look off sells a lot of retro enhanced </garnt>
<garnt> stuff yeah i mean that's </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> so many dude i saw like super mario </garnt>
<connor> sunshine in box for like 600 yen yeah so </connor>
<garnt> like five bucks nice yeah book off is </garnt>
<garnt> like a uh it's like a big chain here </garnt>
<connor> isn't it yeah you can you can find book </connor>
<connor> offs </connor>
<connor> in </connor>
<garnt> most major places there is a book off </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere so if you want a good deal for </garnt>
<joey> second-hand stuff just like a bunch of </joey>
<joey> them there's book-off which is mostly </joey>
<garnt> focused on like books and games and </garnt>
<garnt> stuff like that and then there's another </garnt>
<garnt> one called the name's horrible but it's </garnt>
<joey> called hard off </joey>
<joey> i didn't really think that one through </joey>
<joey> uh which is more like kind of like </joey>
<garnt> second-hand like appliances and like you </garnt>
<garnt> can get you can games you can get games </garnt>
<garnt> at heart off as well yeah um but uh yeah </garnt>
<joey> and then book off you can also buy like </joey>
<joey> secondhand clothes as well yeah this is </joey>
<joey> pretty good and then there's another one </joey>
<garnt> there's another version of the off </garnt>
<garnt> series </garnt>
<joey> yeah right off i don't know </joey>
<garnt> yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> like my big problem with akihabara isn't </garnt>
<joey> just the fact that it's like </joey>
<joey> all anime which you know that's not </joey>
<garnt> really that's not really an issue it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like you can't really find anything </garnt>
<garnt> else so </garnt>
<garnt> like if you want to go out for a nice </garnt>
<garnt> meal afterwards there's nothing really </garnt>
<joey> around akihabara i think the only thing </joey>
<joey> i've had in akihabara is the royal host </joey>
<connor> and the the uh the ramen the raw ramen </connor>
<garnt> or if you want a jason ramen to be fair </garnt>
<garnt> yeah well if you want like sorry guys no </garnt>
<garnt> no no i was about to say but what i love </garnt>
<garnt> about nakano is that nakano not only has </garnt>
<garnt> this like kind of cool underground like </garnt>
<garnt> especially in broadway the whole anime </garnt>
<garnt> and like weeb [ __ ] yeah but once you go </garnt>
<garnt> outside of the broadway section of </garnt>
<garnt> nakano which is just one building yeah </garnt>
<garnt> then it has some of the coolest bars and </garnt>
<joey> restaurants restaurants and stuff i mean </joey>
<garnt> the jojo bar is in nagano yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> so that's the perfect reason to go to </garnt>
<connor> nakano that's that's a business i do </connor>
<joey> want to stay afloat come on outside </joey>
<connor> grinder yeah </connor>
<joey> the jojo bar is [ __ ] amazing yeah </joey>
<joey> that that's a place that we want to stay </joey>
<garnt> in business not the maid cafes bring </garnt>
<joey> your business to the jojo bar </joey>
<joey> on twitter though yeah yeah you have to </joey>
<joey> follow them on twitter </joey>
<garnt> even though the google hours say </garnt>
<garnt> whatever he tweets out whether he's open </garnt>
<garnt> or not yeah because it's literally just </garnt>
<garnt> one person it's one dude yeah yeah so </garnt>
<joey> yeah like like that's another reason to </joey>
<joey> go to nakano but aside from that there's </joey>
<joey> just so many other cool places and other </joey>
<joey> cool restaurants and bars that you can </joey>
<joey> go to in nakano and it's one of those </joey>
<garnt> places where you can just stumble upon a </garnt>
<garnt> place you know you don't need to google </garnt>
<garnt> uh you don't need to do a mailing and </garnt>
<garnt> like google which one's like five star </garnt>
<garnt> or something it's one of those places </garnt>
<garnt> that you can just get lost in you just </garnt>
<joey> like oh that place that place looks cool </joey>
<joey> everything's so tight knit yeah and like </joey>
<joey> so many tiny restaurants and uh and bars </joey>
<garnt> and stuff like that yeah cause like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like when i go on holiday right i'm not </garnt>
<connor> the kind of person who is just like </connor>
<connor> planning out everything i don't have an </connor>
<connor> itinerary what i prefer is just going </connor>
<connor> into a cool area and just discovering </connor>
<joey> stuff for myself you know that's that's </joey>
<garnt> the kind of traveler that i am and </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and uh </garnt>
<garnt> of course of course and uh nakano is </garnt>
<joey> like one of the best areas for that i </joey>
<garnt> agree i agree yeah yeah i wonder so </garnt>
<joey> we've gone to akihabara what else is </joey>
<joey> something that like you might consider </joey>
<connor> you know i i think even though </connor>
<connor> you know we don't really go there that </connor>
<connor> often anymore because i feel like it's </connor>
<connor> very much uh you've got to do it while </connor>
<connor> you're here </connor>
<garnt> do a table normally hold on just go </garnt>
<garnt> crazy for it to go to like a cheap </garnt>
<connor> izakaya oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> everything it's like it's like x amount </joey>
<joey> remember how many times we went to like </joey>
<joey> kinokura </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah if you've got to go to a </connor>
<joey> kinokura if you like to drink i mean a </joey>
<joey> lot yeah yeah on a monday it's 100 yen </joey>
<joey> beers yeah yeah if </joey>
<connor> if there's two words you need to learn </connor>
<joey> in japan it's not none of this like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] konichiwa </joey>
<joey> arigato [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> discussion yeah no no you don't need to </joey>
<garnt> know that [ __ ] that [ __ ] or susame as </garnt>
<garnt> connor just said and nomihoudai which is </garnt>
<garnt> all you can drink which is which is the </garnt>
<connor> only the the only two words you really </connor>
<connor> need right </connor>
<connor> or tabitha </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> is food yeah or you can or you can eat </garnt>
<garnt> or you can drink i feel like you'll know </garnt>
<joey> it's nomihoudai because it'll be very </joey>
<joey> bright and it'll have a number yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it'll be like 2 000 and you'll see a </joey>
<joey> picture of a lot of drinks yeah it'll be </joey>
<joey> like 2 000 something or two if you see a </joey>
<joey> timer like 2 000 plus 60 something yeah </joey>
<connor> you're either about to hire a person for </connor>
<connor> uh illegal activities or you're going to </connor>
<connor> be having an all you can drink so </connor>
<connor> fun for all the family really yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah basically yeah just go </garnt>
<connor> just go to an izakaya do you recommend </connor>
<connor> going to a chain one or yeah [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> do you go to a kinokura did you yeah no </connor>
<garnt> it's not english on the table yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's true </garnt>
<garnt> like a torii or like any of those like </garnt>
<joey> chains like although it's not like </joey>
<joey> the highest of quality in terms of food </joey>
<connor> but like i think if you're one like 20 </connor>
<joey> yeah what's it called again </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> we're saying the food isn't that good </garnt>
<joey> but i remember coming here </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] amazing compared to </joey>
<joey> probably where you're from </joey>
<garnt> japan we we have been spoiled our food </garnt>
<garnt> tastes uh we've become food snobs </garnt>
<joey> because i remember i remember the first </joey>
<joey> day that connor came to japan and i took </joey>
<garnt> him to kinokura the moment he got off </garnt>
<joey> the plane yeah and he was like it's a </joey>
<joey> hundred yen for a beer and i'm like yep </joey>
<joey> and he was like oh but it's like it's </joey>
<joey> probably like a cup right out comes a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like pint yeah this is the </joey>
<connor> greatest country in the world exactly </connor>
<connor> exactly yeah literally yeah no the food </connor>
<connor> the food the food is good i i forget i </connor>
<garnt> forget because i've been living for so </garnt>
<garnt> long uh if you're traveling out of </garnt>
<garnt> england the food is like [ __ ] 10 out </garnt>
<garnt> of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> compare compared to anything you can get </garnt>
<connor> in england this is just like a basic </connor>
<garnt> guide obviously we've been in japan a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch you [ __ ] know this [ __ ] you do </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you want but this is for the </garnt>
<connor> the boys and and girls out there who are </connor>
<connor> coming to japan first yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> everywhere you go to have the most 10 </garnt>
<garnt> out of 10 food because you will have the </garnt>
<garnt> most 10 out of 10 food and uh learn like </garnt>
<joey> go go do karaoke just just go speaking </joey>
<joey> of nomi horde yeah speaking of nami hoda </joey>
<garnt> you will definitely need to know that </garnt>
<garnt> word for karaoke because basically every </garnt>
<joey> karaoke has nami hoda and i don't know </joey>
<joey> why you'd want to do karaoke so but </joey>
<connor> maybe you do maybe you have a great </connor>
<joey> singing voice i don't i need to be drunk </joey>
<connor> to sing okay it will probably be a bit </connor>
<joey> awkward because they don't have like any </joey>
<joey> english help yeah you're getting it just </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean you'll be fine i'm sure they </joey>
<garnt> used to follow just yeah just say the </garnt>
<garnt> hold up the number of hours you want in </garnt>
<garnt> your hands yeah and then say nomihoudai </garnt>
<connor> and they'll tell you a price and then </connor>
<joey> you just say yes and i feel there's like </joey>
<joey> a weird i guess like stereotype of like </joey>
<joey> this karaoke culture outside of japan </joey>
<connor> because i think when most people think </connor>
<connor> of karaoke they think of like open mic </connor>
<garnt> like on a stage and stuff like that </garnt>
<connor> which is like i'm not for that yeah i </connor>
<garnt> think that's kind of cringe because i i </garnt>
<joey> love it dude i love it what do you want </joey>
<joey> to do i don't know i can't i can't do it </joey>
<joey> i like tequila </joey>
<joey> i like singing in front of you know my </joey>
<joey> friends and people i know in a room </joey>
<joey> because that's fun like we can all hang </joey>
<connor> the reason the reason i'm not really a </connor>
<connor> fan of like the open mic karaoke </connor>
<connor> is because you only get two types of </connor>
<connor> people that do it </connor>
<garnt> it's either one the [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<garnt> singers who are basically auditioning </garnt>
<garnt> for x factor the next day or you just </garnt>
<garnt> get the piss heads who'd like who just </garnt>
<connor> murder your ears </connor>
<connor> okay i am </connor>
<connor> alive there is no the thing is there is </connor>
<garnt> no in between yeah you you either come </garnt>
<garnt> out getting a free concert or you come </garnt>
<garnt> out regretting the fact that you have </garnt>
<joey> ears there is like no between never a </joey>
<joey> moment where like someone finishes </joey>
<joey> singing and you're like hey that was </joey>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> yeah i think i like gary there's karaoke </connor>
<joey> bars in japan where you can sing with </joey>
<joey> everyone else i love them they're so fun </joey>
<joey> because i remember everyone everyone </joey>
<joey> gets involved everyone in the bar like </joey>
<joey> gets hyped yeah but you can do that with </joey>
<joey> like a small crowd in a karaoke room </joey>
<connor> right but what if you just want to like </connor>
<connor> meet some random japanese people </connor>
<joey> those things oh yeah i mean but i feel </joey>
<joey> there's better ways to meet japanese </joey>
<connor> people than a [ __ ] open mind karaoke </connor>
<connor> no no it's the best way but like i </connor>
<connor> remember because i never really thought </connor>
<garnt> about it because in my head karaoke was </garnt>
<garnt> always you know the the japanese style </garnt>
<garnt> character yeah like in a room right so </garnt>
<garnt> like i remember when uh when felix uh </garnt>
<garnt> came to japan and i really wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> take him to a karaoke in his head he was </garnt>
<garnt> like no i don't want to go to karaoke </garnt>
<garnt> why and he's like because he thought </garnt>
<garnt> about the open mic [ __ ] yeah and he's </garnt>
<joey> like nah i don't want to do that and i'm </joey>
<joey> like oh my poor sweet innocent child you </joey>
<joey> don't know what real karaoke is like and </joey>
<joey> i took him connor was there </joey>
<joey> i went with uh dave as well from </joey>
<joey> boyinaband yeah and he was like that's </joey>
<joey> the most fun that he's ever had in japan </joey>
<joey> and like i [ __ ] told you yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> it's honestly like one of the funnest </garnt>
<garnt> things you can do in japan i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> i think the thing about japanese karaoke </garnt>
<garnt> is that the song selection is [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> godly you want to sing anime songs of </garnt>
<garnt> course you want to sing anime songs you </garnt>
<garnt> have all the anime songs at your </garnt>
<garnt> disposal but if you can't speak the if </garnt>
<garnt> you can't sing the nihongo then uh you </garnt>
<garnt> got basically every major song from </garnt>
<garnt> england and yeah america tablet and </garnt>
<joey> they'll be like foreign songs or </joey>
<joey> something yeah yeah you can speak like </joey>
<joey> uh korean songs and chinese songs as </joey>
<garnt> well like like i i think i think the </garnt>
<garnt> japanese karaoke has a better selection </garnt>
<garnt> of english songs than english karaoke in </garnt>
<garnt> it's insane right yeah um yeah like it's </garnt>
<joey> it's one of the funnest experiences you </joey>
<connor> can do with your mates oh you can also </connor>
<garnt> get costumes oh yeah oh yeah we did that </garnt>
<connor> when we first came to japan didn't we </connor>
<connor> you can go down to the first floor </connor>
<connor> you'll know it's karaoke building so </connor>
<garnt> like something else cyberpunk outside </garnt>
<garnt> they always have the neon signs or the </garnt>
<garnt> really bright signs yeah it's massive if </garnt>
<garnt> you've seen the floors if you see neon </garnt>
<garnt> signs it's going to be pachinko or </garnt>
<connor> karaoke and uh the inside looks like a </connor>
<connor> palace i saw this pachinko they all like </connor>
<joey> a palace inside yeah go into go into the </joey>
<joey> building if your ears are bleeding it's </joey>
<joey> probably a pachinko yeah </joey>
<joey> if it's not bleeding it's probably </joey>
<garnt> karaoke yeah because karaoke is actually </garnt>
<connor> soundproofing yeah </connor>
<connor> although all the pachinko buildings have </connor>
<connor> tinted windows so you can't see him yeah </connor>
<joey> so they're like frosted but you'll </joey>
<connor> you'll if you'll know it's a pachinko </connor>
<joey> building because when someone enters it </joey>
<garnt> and the doors open you can hear that </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] from a mile away </joey>
<garnt> yeah and like i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> do the karaokes if they want to sing uh </garnt>
<garnt> anime songs or japanese songs do they </garnt>
<garnt> have like a function in a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> karaokes now that where you can actually </garnt>
<garnt> when he actually spells it out not in </garnt>
<joey> like katakana ah there's something </joey>
<connor> there's something </connor>
<joey> super rare and the selection is super </joey>
<joey> limited you're better off just like </joey>
<connor> looking up the english lyrics on your </connor>
<connor> phone that's true that's true that's </connor>
<garnt> true but uh yeah but they have like tv </garnt>
<joey> sizes where they actually play like the </joey>
<garnt> visuals and stuff which is pretty dope </garnt>
<garnt> my favorite things is uh seeing what </garnt>
<garnt> kind of music videos they play with your </garnt>
<garnt> songs that you're saying during karaoke </garnt>
<joey> because it's like karaoke videos are my </joey>
<joey> favorite </joey>
<garnt> what is who films that who i'd like okay </garnt>
<connor> i think it's the same people make the </connor>
<garnt> bowling animations yeah probably </garnt>
<garnt> must be so like if you've never been to </garnt>
<garnt> like an asian karaoke a lot of the music </garnt>
<garnt> videos it's basically like the </garnt>
<garnt> equivalent of a stock a stock uh a stock </garnt>
<garnt> image </garnt>
<garnt> just with music videos right so you'll </garnt>
<garnt> have like this random i don't know my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite ones is where is the white guy </garnt>
<joey> at the bar it's the one yeah yeah you </joey>
<joey> know the one i mean </joey>
<joey> he's just like a sad dude </joey>
<connor> it's like a sad specific reference </connor>
<joey> that'll be like one person it appears </joey>
<joey> like every four songs yeah oh it's like </joey>
<garnt> every queen song is just like these five </garnt>
<garnt> people just dancing on a dance floor in </garnt>
<joey> this empty bar and it looks like it's </joey>
<joey> the saddest [ __ ] party </joey>
<joey> yeah right </joey>
<joey> that's my favorite </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> and yeah i don't know what i don't know </joey>
<connor> what company </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] film this karaoke music video </connor>
<joey> british i think </joey>
<joey> that's the thing because it's not asian </joey>
<joey> people it's uh it's all like either </joey>
<joey> british or american yeah i see it's so </joey>
<joey> weird i actually that's a really </joey>
<joey> interesting topic i like i i would </joey>
<garnt> actually want to know who actually who </garnt>
<garnt> actually filmed these where who made </garnt>
<connor> these who actually made these ask joy </connor>
<connor> sound or something yeah maybe where are </connor>
<joey> these videos can i get yeah can i can </joey>
<connor> you link me to the video they look like </connor>
<connor> they're filmed in like the 90s yeah </connor>
<joey> they're really old because most of them </joey>
<joey> are still on like a four by three </joey>
<garnt> aspects yeah yeah yeah yeah you best </garnt>
<connor> yeah you know you've like picked like a </connor>
<joey> good song or a popular song they when </joey>
<joey> they have like the actual music video </joey>
<garnt> you're like oh we're singing good today </garnt>
<joey> boys we're singing the time when you're </joey>
<joey> selecting the song it says if it comes </joey>
<joey> with the actual music video yeah and if </joey>
<joey> it doesn't then you're gonna probably </joey>
<garnt> get a white guy at a bar yeah cause the </garnt>
<garnt> saddest thing is when you select like a </garnt>
<garnt> banger song or something and you're like </garnt>
<connor> i'm ready and then you hear like a midi </connor>
<connor> track and you're like </connor>
<connor> oh it's like like it has like a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> banger like guitar riff or something and </garnt>
<joey> it's just like it's like the worst </joey>
<joey> immediate sounding guitar ever it's like </joey>
<joey> me </joey>
<garnt> that's fun but no karaoke is great </garnt>
<garnt> especially especially with your mates </garnt>
<garnt> and it's a great like it's because </garnt>
<garnt> it's a great way to just open up with </garnt>
<garnt> your mates because normally you go to a </garnt>
<garnt> karaoke bar and you don't really want to </garnt>
<garnt> sing because you don't want to embarrass </garnt>
<garnt> yourself in front of strangers but with </garnt>
<garnt> japanese karaoke you can just embarrass </garnt>
<garnt> yourself in front of your mates equally </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and uh it's a hell of a fun time </garnt>
<joey> but if you want to embarrass yourself in </joey>
<connor> front of your mates in another way you </connor>
<joey> can also go to an onsen as well a public </joey>
<garnt> golf yes which i think is a much taller </garnt>
<connor> hurdle for a lot of people i'd recommend </connor>
<joey> just going to uh you know you can book </joey>
<connor> like uh ryokans uh which normally have </connor>
<connor> onsens uh you can book them on like </connor>
<joey> booking.com yeah and even if you have </joey>
<joey> tattoos like uh you know you can if you </joey>
<garnt> do yeah if you have the expandable </garnt>
<garnt> income where would you recommend for </garnt>
<garnt> that though because before we we had the </garnt>
<garnt> massive onsen </garnt>
<garnt> uh in tokyo </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah onto monogatari unfortunately </connor>
<connor> we can't recommend that anymore because </connor>
<connor> that was because i was so sad i'm so sad </connor>
<connor> because that was like the perfect onsen </connor>
<connor> to recommend because you go to the onsen </connor>
<connor> solution </connor>
<joey> and then you'd go you'd go to like diver </joey>
<joey> city and just see the massive gundam and </joey>
<joey> you're like damn what a perfect day trip </joey>
<joey> yeah that's the perfect day trip </joey>
<joey> unfortunately that's not available </joey>
<joey> anymore i still think some of the well i </joey>
<garnt> mean it depends how far out of tokyo you </garnt>
<garnt> want to go into i mean there's a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> like small bath houses in and around </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo and like the more uh like suburban </garnt>
<garnt> areas uh but that's not really an onsen </garnt>
<garnt> if you want like the onsen experience </garnt>
<garnt> without going too far out of tokyo i'd </garnt>
<garnt> say hakone is probably yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's pretty good um that's in uh </garnt>
<joey> kanagawa which is one prefecture across </joey>
<joey> but you can you can well not even you </joey>
<connor> can get these it's a romance car yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i don't know </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> it's like halfway between a bullet train </connor>
<garnt> and a regular train it's like more </garnt>
<garnt> bougie than a regular train but it's not </garnt>
<garnt> as fast as a bullet train yeah and you </garnt>
<garnt> can go directly from uh shinjuku to </garnt>
<joey> hakone in like an hour i think yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's relatively cheap as well yeah </garnt>
<connor> um and yeah it's a really really nice </connor>
<connor> little cute smile </connor>
<connor> yeah it's it's really cool it's got </connor>
<connor> there's this really small ava store um </connor>
<connor> right on the station yeah yeah which i </connor>
<joey> go to every time i don't know and the </joey>
<joey> reason for that is because hakone is uh </joey>
<joey> what they based tokyo three off of yep </joey>
<joey> um so if you've seen evangelion and </joey>
<joey> you've seen the movies uh you all </joey>
<garnt> recognize the trains that like that that </garnt>
<garnt> they use there because they look exactly </garnt>
<connor> like they do an ava um you'll be like oh </connor>
<garnt> so i see shinji right there listening to </garnt>
<connor> listen to your headphone oh look </connor>
<garnt> disgusting </garnt>
<garnt> and you walk around you see vending </garnt>
<garnt> machines and like oscar and mari and </garnt>
<joey> like gingers </joey>
<joey> if you want like a nice kind of maybe </joey>
<joey> like a two-day trip outside of uh tokyo </joey>
<joey> because hakuna is not only really good </joey>
<joey> especially you know if you love eva of </joey>
<joey> course but like also you know there's uh </joey>
<joey> the jio kudani which is like uh like the </joey>
<joey> sulphur plumes of like the mountains of </joey>
<joey> hakuna is really nice and there's never </joey>
<joey> been there before that's really dope you </joey>
<joey> go up this like huge uh like i was about </joey>
<joey> to say monorail it's not a monorail it's </joey>
<joey> like what do they call it like this uh </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] what are they called it's like not </connor>
<connor> a ski lift but what's what </connor>
<connor> gondola yeah gondola that's it yeah you </connor>
<connor> got this like gondola from the base uh </connor>
<connor> of this lake uh in in uh in hakone and </connor>
<connor> you go up into the mountains and you get </connor>
<joey> this really really nice view of the lake </joey>
<connor> and on a good day like if the weather's </connor>
<connor> really good you can see this like </connor>
<connor> perfect view of mount fuji as well so </connor>
<connor> that's really dope and then you go into </connor>
<connor> this uh little valley and you go into </connor>
<connor> this place called </connor>
<connor> which is called hells valley um japan </connor>
<connor> has a couple of hells valleys oh </connor>
<garnt> as well um and there's also one around </garnt>
<garnt> like gifu as well right but um yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> just this like really cool like sulphur </garnt>
<garnt> plume </garnt>
<garnt> place where you can get really close to </garnt>
<joey> like volcanic sulfur plumes kind of </joey>
<joey> smells like farts uh the entire time </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean but it's kind of a really </garnt>
<joey> cool unique experience um yeah i </joey>
<garnt> personally recommend it's a good day </garnt>
<garnt> trip yeah because i really khaka was the </garnt>
<garnt> first hot springs town that i went to </garnt>
<garnt> and i really enjoyed myself the one </garnt>
<garnt> thing i will say is if you go to hakone </garnt>
<garnt> um it's really </garnt>
<garnt> it's really weird because like i went to </garnt>
<garnt> hakone and i expected it to be something </garnt>
<garnt> it's not similar to tokyo but like you </garnt>
<garnt> expect to go to a hot spring and then </garnt>
<garnt> you expect to like walk around and </garnt>
<garnt> explore somewhere but like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> ryokans they expect you to stay at that </garnt>
<garnt> one establishment for the entirety of </garnt>
<garnt> your trip right a lot of a lot of these </garnt>
<garnt> hotels and a lot of these ryokans will </garnt>
<garnt> have all um </garnt>
<garnt> will have all everything you need within </garnt>
<garnt> that facility because they don't really </garnt>
<garnt> expect you to go out and explore because </garnt>
<garnt> normally there isn't really much to </garnt>
<garnt> explore in that immediate area unless </garnt>
<joey> you take a bus or something right yeah </joey>
<garnt> um at least that was that's my </garnt>
<garnt> experience so yeah there's like don't </garnt>
<garnt> expect like you can go explore but if </garnt>
<garnt> you want to go explore you probably need </garnt>
<garnt> to plan it out a bit more because the </garnt>
<garnt> place you're staying in </garnt>
<garnt> is isn't necessarily going to be near </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of tourist attractions yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you're staying at a ryokan </garnt>
<garnt> um having said that if you do stay in </garnt>
<garnt> the ryokan uh be prepared to uh get up </garnt>
<garnt> and eat [ __ ] breakfast okay </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's that's that's one thing </garnt>
<garnt> which uh at an egregiously early time i </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not sure if i am a fan of it but if </garnt>
<garnt> you do say ryokan very hands are great </garnt>
<garnt> right very kind of great because i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like in terms of hotels they're like the </garnt>
<garnt> most aesthetic place you can stay yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you are pampered there it's great it's </garnt>
<joey> the most authentic like japanese </joey>
<garnt> accommodation experience yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> and then you normally have the nicest </garnt>
<garnt> onsens that you could you could find you </garnt>
<connor> normally sleep on a on a futon though on </connor>
<connor> the floor so not a bed so if that's </connor>
<joey> something you might but if you want that </joey>
<joey> authentic japanese experience </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> yeah but like if you if you don't come </garnt>
<connor> down for breakfast at the agreed time uh </connor>
<connor> they will find your family and they will </connor>
<garnt> kill everyone you love or at least </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i get out of like if if </garnt>
<garnt> it's included in the cost as well so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's why they're normally quite </garnt>
<joey> expensive because dinner is normally </joey>
<joey> included yeah they don't want you </joey>
<joey> wasting money yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> you know these dinners are normally like </joey>
<joey> really large courses they're like the </joey>
<joey> reason why already okay like you know </joey>
<joey> like real cons like normally like what </joey>
<joey> like three four hundred dollars a night </joey>
<joey> minimum </joey>
<joey> and that's because like half of that has </joey>
<connor> gone to the food if not food yeah you </connor>
<connor> will be eating like a king you will you </connor>
<garnt> won't eat like so if you see the price </garnt>
<connor> of the ryokan um don't get too shocked </connor>
<connor> at the price because you're paying for </connor>
<connor> the food as well and it's normally like </connor>
<connor> really really </connor>
<garnt> really good food it's high quality it </garnt>
<connor> might be even a bit too much sometimes </connor>
<connor> you'll get a good uh taste of the local </connor>
<connor> dishes though normally yeah these local </connor>
<garnt> ingredients yeah and uh yeah a really </garnt>
<joey> good way to just try japanese food that </joey>
<joey> you normally wouldn't order like i never </joey>
<joey> i'm never gonna order half the [ __ ] they </joey>
<joey> give me oh yeah yeah cause half of it is </joey>
<garnt> super slimy yeah uh but i always eat it </garnt>
<garnt> because i don't wanna you know have to </garnt>
<garnt> make eye contact with that small </garnt>
<joey> japanese lady who uh asked me why i </joey>
<joey> didn't like it which they have done many </joey>
<joey> times oh really yeah </joey>
<joey> so now i just i just i just eat </joey>
<joey> everything i i eat everything but </joey>
<joey> originally when i didn't like eat </joey>
<joey> something they would sometimes just </joey>
<joey> stare at me and be like why didn't you </joey>
<joey> eat it </joey>
<joey> what what's wrong </joey>
<joey> what's your dress </joey>
<garnt> do you have covered are you dying i will </garnt>
<connor> find you i will kill you </connor>
<garnt> that's the thing you feel so intimidated </garnt>
<garnt> but no like it's like i i'd even like </garnt>
<connor> recommend going to ryokan to try the </connor>
<connor> traditional japanese food over even </connor>
<connor> going to a restaurant right because with </connor>
<connor> the restaurant you don't know what to </connor>
<connor> order you know you don't you look at the </connor>
<garnt> menu and it's like i don't know what i'm </garnt>
<garnt> going to like but it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> ryokan food is kind of like a tasting </garnt>
<garnt> menu you know you kind of get a little </garnt>
<joey> bit of everything lots of little small </joey>
<garnt> chunks of a lot of them </garnt>
<garnt> some things you don't like but it's a </garnt>
<garnt> great way to just easily </garnt>
<garnt> get the traditional japanese experience </garnt>
<garnt> um just don't miss breakfast because uh </garnt>
<garnt> did they did </garnt>
<garnt> did i hear you say like they came to </garnt>
<garnt> your room once and woke you up to get </garnt>
<garnt> breakfast oh yeah no yeah a woman </garnt>
<garnt> literally i was i was with chris </garnt>
<garnt> i think i was on a journey across japan </garnt>
<garnt> trip and one morning i got oh the night </garnt>
<garnt> prior i got very drunk uh so as you as </garnt>
<garnt> we do as you do and then the morning of </garnt>
<joey> i was very hungover and uh you know and </joey>
<garnt> the lady kept knocking on my door being </garnt>
<joey> like breakfast ready and i'm like oh </joey>
<garnt> yeah shut up shut up i have a throbbing </garnt>
<connor> headache right now and then she [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> just walks in and just like rips the </connor>
<garnt> sheet off me and i'm just like what are </garnt>
<joey> you like what are you my mother like </joey>
<garnt> yeah what the [ __ ] she was like making </garnt>
<joey> sure you're alive and i was like you </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] all right </connor>
<joey> she ripped it off yeah well like all </joey>
<connor> like slowly like took it off it's even </connor>
<connor> worse that's like more creepy and i'm </connor>
<connor> like for one i'm freezing my ass off too </connor>
<connor> i have a throbbing headache three how </connor>
<connor> did you get in </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] i've never heard of them </connor>
<connor> that's an exception though that's </connor>
<connor> something else most places they'll just </connor>
<joey> like ring you up on the phone to make </joey>
<joey> sure </joey>
<garnt> yeah like five more minutes mom five </garnt>
<connor> more minutes </connor>
<connor> please don't like modern real cans if </connor>
<connor> you will that are more like they're like </connor>
<connor> they have beds like western yeah and </connor>
<joey> they're like way more modernized um in </joey>
<joey> hokkaido </joey>
<joey> well it's it's like it has it's weird </joey>
<joey> cause it'll have tatami mats oh but </joey>
<joey> it'll have a bed and it'll have oh i </joey>
<joey> know what yeah yeah those are usually </joey>
<joey> like more higher up though right yeah </joey>
<joey> but they're normally it's because i find </joey>
<joey> that the prices aren't different like </joey>
<garnt> really the really traditional ones </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes cost more than the more </garnt>
<garnt> modernized ones because </garnt>
<connor> they're they charge a [ __ ] ton for food </connor>
<garnt> or maybe they have uh a lot of workers </garnt>
<connor> that's one thing they have so many </connor>
<joey> workers every okay </joey>
<connor> insane they do but also sometimes the </connor>
<connor> service is nuts yeah they're like the </connor>
<joey> moment you turn up there's like four of </joey>
<joey> them greeting you they'll like take all </joey>
<connor> your bags right away and then oh my god </connor>
<connor> it's just like so intense i'm like jesus </connor>
<garnt> christ what's happening sometimes it's a </garnt>
<garnt> bit too intense right because sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like okay i i i know you i </garnt>
<garnt> know you're wanting to make me feel </garnt>
<garnt> comfortable but you're making me feel a </garnt>
<connor> little bit too comfortable now yeah i </connor>
<connor> said like three or four recently with </connor>
<connor> chris on the video and it was really </connor>
<connor> i remember i walked up to one and uh </connor>
<joey> as we were driving into the euro clown </joey>
<joey> there was like 10 employees </joey>
<joey> just like slowly bowed i was just like </joey>
<connor> bro i'm not the queen like literally you </connor>
<joey> feel like </joey>
<joey> you feel like royalty in the best way </joey>
<connor> yeah it's good there's a lot of </connor>
<connor> different price points and different </connor>
<joey> kind of uh </joey>
<joey> variations of onsens and yeah </joey>
<joey> monkeys oh yeah and that was amazing </joey>
<joey> because the whole town is an onsen town </joey>
<connor> which town is this it's called uh i </connor>
<joey> think there's two i think this one's </joey>
<connor> called yutanaka </connor>

<joey> famous for like having a big big onsen </joey>
<joey> pit that you can you can't go in it but </joey>

<connor> yeah that's like the top three onsen </connor>
<connor> cities or towns that was so good because </connor>
<joey> we stayed in london that was literally </joey>
<connor> like one foot away from the town center </connor>
<joey> really cool really really cool area yeah </joey>
<garnt> the other top three i went to uh was </garnt>
<garnt> geronsen as well that's interesting </garnt>
<garnt> that's the one where chris and i uh </garnt>
<garnt> bathed in a thousand-year-old log </garnt>
<garnt> oh oh that one yeah that's that's a </garnt>
<joey> thousand-year-old yeah there's a bath </joey>
<joey> made out of a thousand-year-old log and </joey>
<garnt> those are actually really really nice </garnt>
<joey> that's in ghetto when you guys book </joey>
<joey> onsense well i know that's not a problem </joey>
<garnt> for you joe but do you go with the </garnt>
<garnt> english sites or do you go with </garnt>
<connor> fucking.com super easily okay uh unless </connor>
<connor> it isn't on booking.com which is quite </connor>
<joey> rare actually yeah i've never really </joey>
<joey> seen anything that's normal it's all on </joey>
<connor> booking.com okay it's really weird i </connor>
<connor> like you'd think like super traditional </connor>
<connor> but nah dude you you can book it all on </connor>
<garnt> booking.com yeah have they modernized </garnt>
<connor> have they actually miners i've i've </connor>
<garnt> never seen a real can that i wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> go to that wasn't on booking.com right i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why there is some hotels on </garnt>
<garnt> booking.com yeah yeah which is really </garnt>
<garnt> weird </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah i i said at a place one time </garnt>
<connor> where like they didn't have the onsen </connor>
<connor> built in they had a hot tub so they </connor>
<connor> would fill the hot tub with onsen water </connor>
<garnt> they brought in via truck </garnt>
<garnt> that's weird so is that really an onsen </garnt>
<connor> it's an onsen if it has onsen water in </connor>
<joey> it okay yeah yeah okay which if you fill </joey>
<joey> a bathtub with an onsen water that's </joey>
<garnt> technically </garnt>
<joey> if i bring sea water in my bathtub is it </joey>
<joey> the sea it's the sea is it the c oh yeah </joey>
<connor> well there's no like there's no place </connor>
<connor> where you can go for the tm onsen you </connor>
<joey> know you know the word onsen just means </joey>
<connor> warm springs yeah yeah you can just get </connor>
<joey> it what makes it onsen is that it has </joey>
<joey> like the [ __ ] minerals yeah </joey>
<joey> and every single onsen has like the ph </joey>
<connor> sign and stuff that tells you what's </connor>
<connor> outside of it so they're really strict </connor>
<joey> on what can and can't be an onset </joey>
<connor> that's really strange legally speaking </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but uh yeah highly recommend just </garnt>
<joey> getting over your fear of getting naked </joey>
<joey> in front of your mouth or whatever and </joey>
<garnt> is that a problem is that a problem i i </garnt>
<joey> think yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah for a lot of people jojo fans uh </garnt>
<garnt> that's don't this does not apply yeah it </garnt>
<joey> doesn't apply to you yeah because i </joey>
<joey> remember like there's been a couple of </joey>
<joey> my friends uh who just like refused to </joey>
<joey> go to an onsen just because they were </joey>
<joey> like uncomfortable with getting naked in </joey>
<joey> front of me or you know the the mates </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like looks out for the boys </joey>
<joey> like dicks out for the boys dude like </joey>
<joey> it's we all have them it's like who </joey>
<joey> cares you'll get over it in five minutes </joey>
<garnt> you know it's a bonding experience it is </garnt>
<connor> it is it is it's a morning experience </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i love saunas dude yeah like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if that's like a white person </garnt>
<joey> thing </joey>
<joey> i love saunas i like saunas i just can't </joey>
<connor> stain them for long i love it i love </connor>
<connor> getting in the ice cold water [ __ ] dude </connor>
<garnt> i don't like that i don't i don't you do </garnt>
<connor> the things that i hate yeah </connor>
<connor> dude </connor>
<joey> the onsen for me is the warm-up for the </joey>
<joey> the sauna </joey>
<joey> oh really yeah i'm i when it doesn't </joey>
<joey> have a sauna i get so sad but luckily in </joey>
<joey> japan now recently sauna's becoming like </joey>
<connor> a trend oh yeah for some reason yeah </connor>
<connor> people are obsessed with saunas and the </connor>
<joey> health benefits yeah there's a lot of </joey>
<joey> like dedicated sort of places in japan </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah i'm and my god do i love sauna </connor>
<joey> i love one dude it's very wide of you i </joey>
<joey> think that is very very white but like </joey>
<garnt> um but yeah like i guess going back to </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo is there any other places or areas </garnt>
<garnt> in tokyo's that you that you like i know </garnt>
<connor> it's like a massive tourist trap but </connor>
<joey> just go to golden gate it's fun golem is </joey>
<joey> good don't go into any bars where a </joey>
<connor> guy's telling you to go into a bar yeah </connor>
<joey> go into bars shinjuku there's a lot of </joey>
<connor> really cool places in shinjuku but </connor>
<joey> there's also a lot of sketch places in </joey>
<connor> shinjuku so yeah you really have to be </connor>
<connor> careful again if someone tells you to go </connor>
<connor> into a bar don't go don't go into a bar </connor>
<joey> that's just a rule of thumb uh there's a </joey>
<joey> bunch of really cool bars not in </joey>
<joey> not so between and sanchome sanchome </joey>
<connor> there's a ton of really cool bars and it </connor>
<connor> like behind the malls </connor>
<connor> yeah there's a bunch of really </connor>
<connor> uh tightly knit areas that have a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> ton of nice bars and nearly all of them </connor>
<connor> i've been into are pretty damn good okay </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i think it's mostly when we think </joey>
<connor> of like sketch places in shinjuku it's </connor>
<connor> mostly like some parts of golden gai and </connor>
<connor> nichol </connor>
<connor> which is like the the gay bar district </connor>
<connor> um i've been to a a few gay bars in </connor>
<connor> nichole and they're really really fun </connor>
<connor> but the problem is a lot of places they </connor>
<connor> won't let you in unless you're going in </connor>
<connor> with someone who they already know yeah </connor>
<connor> it's true yeah also a lot of them i </connor>
<joey> don't think are very foreigner friendly </joey>
<connor> i know there's quite a lot actually oh </connor>
<connor> really there's quite a lot okay i've </connor>
<joey> seen i've when i went filming there and </joey>
<connor> i've been there a few few times there's </connor>
<joey> a lot of bars that are very very foreign </joey>
<joey> so if you want to experience gay bars in </joey>
<joey> japan and they are pretty dope at least </joey>
<garnt> the ones i've been to yeah yeah i got a </garnt>
<garnt> new chairman i mean i think gay bars are </garnt>
<garnt> just pretty dope in general check out </garnt>
<connor> the one that i went to </connor>
<connor> it's an anime any song gay bar and i </connor>
<garnt> hate some gay bar so you know you know </garnt>
<connor> that sounds fun as [ __ ] yeah oh yeah it </connor>
<connor> is all the details were just gay bars </connor>
<connor> are like some of the funnest bars you </connor>
<garnt> can go to oh yeah i say this as someone </garnt>
<connor> who grew up in brighton uh there was a </connor>
<connor> bunch of gay bars </connor>
<connor> everyone's just like so up for anything </connor>
<joey> and it's just like it's just it's it's </joey>
<joey> up for anything it runs out for i </joey>
<garnt> also they're just a lot of fun </garnt>
<joey> it's just a good vibe it's a really good </joey>
<joey> bonding experience if you want to like </joey>
<joey> talk to japanese people especially yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah um daikon yama has a great </connor>
<joey> bunch of cool balls like that area </joey>
<joey> does have a bunch of cool bars but they </joey>
<joey> do get a bit costly oh they're very </joey>
<connor> expensive but they're super super cool </connor>
<connor> like there's like breweries and daikon </connor>
<joey> yamaha oh the brewing was really good i </joey>
<garnt> don't think i've been to daikon yes you </garnt>
<connor> have gone yeah i've been we've been to </connor>
<joey> the brewery which brewery is it again is </joey>
<connor> it the spring valley yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> oh that's like that </garnt>
<garnt> oh i thought that was their business </garnt>
<garnt> that area has like like every single bar </garnt>
<joey> i've been to in the area is sick okay </joey>
<joey> yes i i do agree with that i went to the </joey>
<garnt> cigar bar and died on yemen </garnt>
<connor> okay okay every bar in the area i've </connor>
<connor> been to is just awesome i just i just </connor>
<garnt> completely blanked on the area neymar </garnt>
<connor> was just like that's close to ebbis yeah </connor>
<garnt> you can walk from here because it's </garnt>
<garnt> awesome as well </garnt>
<garnt> yeah basically </garnt>
<garnt> is just south of shibuya yeah um it's </garnt>
<joey> one stop away and i'd say that it's like </joey>
<joey> i actually prefer episode over </joey>
<joey> uh shibuya even though shibuya is like </joey>
<joey> the </joey>
<joey> the more famous place to go to because </joey>
<garnt> to me shibuya is just way too crowded i </garnt>
<joey> don't know yeah no i get that yeah like </joey>
<joey> there's also a lot of like really cool </joey>
<garnt> places in shibuya if you know where </garnt>
<garnt> you're looking that's true uh you know a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of like shibuya's a lot like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah shibuya's a lot like shinjuku where </garnt>
<garnt> like it is like heavily like infested </garnt>
<garnt> with a lot of tourist traps but yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> also shibuya is so massive that yeah if </garnt>
<garnt> you go to like you know like uh [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> aoyama for example which is like the </garnt>
<connor> area on the way towards harajuku like </connor>
<garnt> that place has a lot of like really cool </garnt>
<connor> like hidden stuff around as well which </connor>
<garnt> and it's not really that far from </garnt>
<garnt> shibuya yeah i think like yeah one thing </garnt>
<garnt> i would definitely recommend if you're </garnt>
<connor> going to like the big locations is to </connor>
<connor> like kind of try to venture out of the </connor>
<connor> center because there you you do tend to </connor>
<connor> find a lot of really cool hidden stuff </connor>
<joey> that isn't overpriced to [ __ ] yeah uh </joey>
<joey> and that applies to like most places in </joey>
<joey> tokyo yeah exactly what you guys think </joey>
<garnt> of ikebukuro i really like ikebukuro </garnt>
<garnt> right well there's two sides two sides </garnt>
<garnt> okay there's two sides east side of </garnt>
<garnt> ikebukuro okay the west side is like </garnt>
<connor> very very very sketchy yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> the east is sunshine city and everything </connor>
<joey> around that area is actually a city and </joey>
<connor> uh and ultimate road yeah yeah all that </connor>
<garnt> all that heritage what i like about </garnt>
<garnt> ikebukuro is that you get a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> of everything you know it's it's it it </garnt>
<connor> is kind of like you said that was so me </connor>
<connor> me a little bit of everything a little </connor>
<garnt> bit of everything everybody you do kind </garnt>
<connor> of get a little bit of everything yeah </connor>
<connor> if you just want to like go to an area </connor>
<connor> and just you want to get some anime </connor>
<connor> you've got oitamo </connor>
<connor> yeah you've got some really really good </connor>
<garnt> restaurants and really really good bars </garnt>
<garnt> you've got sunshine city </garnt>
<joey> um yeah and then if you want a lot of </joey>
<joey> like really good like southeast asian </joey>
<joey> restaurants and like indian restaurants </joey>
<joey> you go to the west side of ikebukuro but </joey>
<connor> it's also very scary at the west side </connor>
<garnt> yeah literally like i don't know what </garnt>
<garnt> happened okay yeah like the other side </garnt>
<connor> is like literally just like </connor>
<garnt> lots of sketchy places yeah to explain </garnt>
<garnt> you it you east side and west side um </garnt>
<joey> you're not going to be able to easily </joey>
<joey> wander from one side to the other </joey>
<joey> because it's literally east side and </joey>
<joey> west side of the station so you </joey>
<joey> literally have to go through the station </joey>
<joey> to get to either side right </joey>
<joey> um and it's it's like </joey>
<connor> it's such a big dichotomy that i don't </connor>
<connor> like it's literally a [ __ ] line that </connor>
<connor> separates one like </connor>
<connor> the bougie side from like the really </connor>
<connor> really scat side and like i don't i </connor>
<connor> don't know how like one station can </connor>
<garnt> separate like two areas that are just uh </garnt>
<connor> the complete opposite of each other it's </connor>
<connor> crazy on the train on the one side it's </connor>
<connor> like oh you can eat oh all this and the </connor>
<connor> other side it's like women 500 yen an </connor>
<connor> hour yeah [ __ ] sex sex </connor>
<joey> there's a lot of people and like uh and </joey>
<joey> like uh host clubs and stuff like that </joey>
<garnt> there's gonna be a lot of guys trying to </garnt>
<garnt> get you into a lot of girls bars yeah i </garnt>
<connor> understand that you're saying you have a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah yeah each side's good you </joey>
<joey> got a round one a really big round one </joey>
<joey> very big round one yeah um and sometimes </joey>
<connor> shitty is a ton of malls yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah really good shopping really good </connor>
<garnt> food uh lots of fun </garnt>
<garnt> around what round one is americans are </garnt>
<joey> not around modest it's an american </joey>
<joey> as well i think so yeah they're round </joey>
<joey> one it's arcade plus uh bowling bowling </joey>
<garnt> plus uh </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it's got everything yeah i'm pretty </garnt>
<garnt> sure you can live in that round why </garnt>
<garnt> aren't you yeah yeah right it's good </garnt>
<garnt> it's got fun what was the place that we </garnt>
<joey> filmed a video about joey um oh the </joey>
<joey> break room the break room was that nico </joey>

<garnt> rent out movies uh from outside of </garnt>
<garnt> baggage you can't do it inside the base </garnt>
<connor> but if you go to like a rental place you </connor>
<connor> can bring in like games and like rental </connor>
<connor> games and like rental movies you can </connor>
<connor> just like have a room to yourselves play </connor>
<connor> games also the darts in japan is not </connor>
<joey> it's no basic darts this is like </joey>
<joey> cyberpunk darts </joey>
<connor> like it's like the board is like a score </connor>
<connor> there's animations and [ __ ] this thing </connor>
<connor> is so fun you gotta go yeah yeah also </connor>
<connor> you know ordering drinks is kind of can </connor>
<garnt> be kind of stressful if you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> any japanese uh basically there'll be a </garnt>
<joey> phone next to your table a lot of these </joey>
<joey> places </joey>
<connor> now they just have tablets do they </connor>
<joey> bangersters yeah i went in the bags the </joey>

<joey> of them you have to call it some of them </joey>
<joey> have to call it you call up you just say </joey>
<joey> the name of the drink you want and then </joey>
<connor> say </connor>
<garnt> ichi or knee yeah just just say three </garnt>
<garnt> phases uh the third the third the third </garnt>
<joey> phase uh phrase sorry is a number </joey>
<garnt> which is just like you just say numbers </garnt>
<connor> or just number yeah which just means </connor>
<garnt> like the beer on tap or the draft beer </garnt>
<garnt> or the craft beer default beer um that's </garnt>
<garnt> just basically the only drink i ordered </garnt>
<garnt> when i came to japan for the first time </garnt>
<connor> japanese very drinkable i'd say i </connor>
<connor> wouldn't i wouldn't say it's the nicest </connor>
<garnt> but just very easy it goes down </garnt>
<garnt> it's the thing about japanese beer is </garnt>
<garnt> that it's just very it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> refreshing you know what i mean because </garnt>
<garnt> i was going to say it's like water but </garnt>
<garnt> it's that's that's not doing it justice </garnt>
<garnt> you know it's just very you know it's </garnt>
<joey> not it's not american beer yeah it's </joey>
<joey> it's not it's like middle of light </joey>
<garnt> necessarily it's not it's no middle like </garnt>
<joey> watery it's just refreshing you know </joey>
<garnt> because you could it's very light </garnt>
<garnt> without being without feeling like it's </garnt>
<joey> a very cheap beer how do i yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like it goes down really light but you </joey>
<garnt> still get the full taste of the beef </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah exactly i don't know how they </garnt>
<joey> do it's like some japanese wizardry </joey>
<garnt> happening but yeah like some of the most </garnt>
<garnt> refreshing beer i've had is </garnt>
<garnt> i guess this is a place that i also </garnt>
<connor> highly recommend we're going outside </connor>
<connor> we're going way outside of tokyo now </connor>
<connor> is in hokkaido uh because how do you get </connor>
<connor> to hokkaido where do i stay in hokkaido </connor>
<garnt> where do you stay in hokkaido well i've </garnt>
<garnt> only stayed near sapporo actually </garnt>
<garnt> but there are several ways to get to </garnt>
<garnt> hokkaido because hokkaido is uh hokkaido </garnt>
<garnt> is pretty pretty damn big by the way is </garnt>
<joey> the big island at the top you should you </joey>
<connor> should go there because the food is the </connor>
<connor> best and the drink is the best part </connor>
<connor> you know you can get there by train but </connor>
<connor> it's pain in the ass from tokyo yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like four well i mean it's like </joey>
<joey> four or five hours and you the last stop </joey>
<joey> is in hakodate which is oh yeah now </joey>
<garnt> just fly look actually like it's i think </garnt>
<garnt> like when i was stuck in hokkaido the </garnt>
<connor> price for the planes was actually </connor>
<connor> cheaper than the price with this </connor>
<garnt> like we're talking like if you want to </garnt>
<joey> explore outside of tokyo maybe this is </joey>
<joey> your second or you know second trip </joey>
<joey> third trip you've used or maybe you're </joey>
<joey> just such an adventurer you may want to </joey>
<connor> go out or maybe yeah exactly maybe your </connor>
<garnt> adventure you want to go out [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> highly recommend hokkaido oh yeah </joey>
<joey> sapporo is such a cool [ __ ] city it </joey>
<connor> is it is bars yeah go and get uh </connor>
<connor> something called genghis khan </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] awesome dude it's all you can </joey>
<connor> eat normally sometimes if you're lucky </connor>
<joey> uh yeah lamb </joey>
<joey> it's like korean barbecue with lamb but </joey>
<joey> it's a million times so because like </joey>
<garnt> you're gonna come home you're gonna come </garnt>
<garnt> to japan uh and you're gonna cream your </garnt>
<garnt> pants at how [ __ ] good the food is </garnt>
<garnt> here and you're like my god this is like </garnt>
<garnt> peak cuisine how can it get better they </garnt>
<garnt> can't get better and then you go to </garnt>
<garnt> hokkaido and you're like </garnt>
<joey> how they improved on perfection and then </joey>
<joey> hokkaido is like hold my sapporo yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah i'll give you good food yeah like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know how hokkaido has just like </garnt>
<joey> made like such good food even better </joey>
<joey> because all of the best japanese cuisine </joey>
<joey> i've had has basically come from </joey>
<joey> hokkaido it's just in hokkaido like the </joey>
<joey> best ramen i've had his is in sapporo um </joey>
<joey> if you want to seafood i've had it since </joey>
<garnt> yeah of course the best secret i've had </garnt>
<joey> is in sapporo uh if you want to go if </joey>
<joey> you're in sapporo and you want a good </joey>
<joey> just easily find like a ramen joint just </joey>
<garnt> go to ramen alley um because there's </garnt>
<garnt> just a bunch of like different ramen </garnt>
<garnt> shops there and </garnt>
<garnt> up in </garnt>
<connor> where i've had the best ramen i've ever </connor>
<connor> had in japan just like and like every </connor>
<connor> every every store there has like a </connor>
<connor> different type of ramen </connor>
<connor> um and it's just they are all [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> amazing they're all [ __ ] bomb </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> yeah just like hokkaido in general i </connor>
<connor> think if you're gonna go i i we do </connor>
<connor> recommend the winter at least i </connor>
<joey> recommend the winter um because there's </joey>
<joey> a bunch of snow there looks aesthetic as </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] winter wonderland yeah it is winter </joey>
<joey> wonderland that's where the snow </joey>
<joey> festival was held your plane might get </joey>
<joey> delayed </joey>
<joey> that is it forgot that is the one </joey>
<joey> downside of going to hokkaido uh which </joey>
<joey> is because it snows a lot you're kind of </joey>
<joey> playing gacha with your plane like will </joey>
<joey> you will your plane take off in time </joey>
<joey> will it not will it get cancelled well </joey>
<joey> the entire airport shut down uh yeah the </joey>
<joey> fight find out find out when you </joey>
<garnt> basically go because you can never </garnt>
<joey> really plan around that unfortunately so </joey>
<garnt> you can go to nissiko which is in my </garnt>
<connor> opinion one of the best ski resorts in </connor>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<joey> just where we went it's [ __ ] great is </joey>
<connor> amazing yeah it'll probably be rammed </connor>
<connor> with tourists oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> i mean it's amazing though yeah really </garnt>
<garnt> good food i mean like i feel like i've </garnt>
<joey> only been on two ski resorts now in </joey>
<joey> japan and nisiko is the superior one but </joey>
<joey> also it is very foreigner friendly yes </joey>
<joey> so much so that you might have you might </joey>
<connor> encounter more foreigners than you will </connor>
<joey> japanese people yeah it's it's all </joey>
<garnt> aussies yeah it's all aussies it it is </garnt>
<joey> all </joey>
<joey> but then again that's that's almost all </joey>
<garnt> ski resorts in japan it's just all right </garnt>
<garnt> aussies </garnt>
<joey> it's good though really good area really </joey>
<garnt> really really good i've never been to </garnt>
<garnt> hakadate though what's that like i </garnt>
<connor> thought it was chill without this chill </connor>
<joey> i like it the best crab in my life there </joey>
<joey> yeah i think if you want the best </joey>
<connor> seafood </connor>
<connor> because really yeah because it's a pool </connor>
<connor> because that's where they catch all the </connor>
<connor> seafood oh okay so they have a little </connor>
<connor> fish market in hakodate which is the </connor>
<connor> fish market you go there super early in </connor>
<connor> the morning and you get literally the </connor>
<garnt> catch that they caught a couple of hours </garnt>
<connor> prior </connor>
<joey> and it is amazing in my opinion the best </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] seafood i've had yeah i think </joey>
<connor> even though seafood is amazing in </connor>
<connor> hokkaido yeah i have to say and how </connor>
<joey> about that it was like it was the best </joey>
<joey> next level right so good so it's also </joey>
<garnt> really small like kind of quaint little </garnt>
<connor> town as well um you can get around very </connor>
<joey> easily with like the tram system that </joey>
<connor> they have yeah um that's what that's </connor>
<connor> what we do you can walk a lot around a </connor>
<connor> lot of them center though you can you </connor>
<garnt> can but you can also go to like kind of </garnt>
<joey> the nearby uh mountains as well and get </joey>
<garnt> like a really nice view of huckled out </garnt>
<joey> there during the night um yeah really </joey>
<joey> nice would you reckon guy where do </joey>
<joey> record people should get the seafood </joey>
<garnt> does any restaurants or do you want to </garnt>
<garnt> do honestly yeah yeah i mean even it's </garnt>
<joey> all decent yeah even like the hundred </joey>
<joey> yen sushi places uh </joey>
<garnt> really </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because the thing is like even if </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a big chain especially like </garnt>
<garnt> the conveyor belt sushis </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> because the uh obviously the ingredients </garnt>
<garnt> are locally sourced like just because </garnt>
<garnt> even if you go to the same sushi chain </garnt>
<garnt> that you might have been to in tokyo it </garnt>
<garnt> will taste entirely different to another </garnt>
<garnt> sushi to the same sushi chain that you </garnt>
<garnt> have in you know in another place </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so like even if you go to like a </garnt>
<garnt> conveyor belt sushi uh don't expect that </garnt>
<garnt> it was taste exactly the same in tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> as it will in another place you go to </garnt>
<garnt> because i've had the ex i've had that </garnt>
<garnt> exact experience where i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> holy [ __ ] [ __ ] i didn't realize that </connor>
<connor> the quality could differ this much with </connor>
<connor> the same chain oh yeah you think you go </connor>
<connor> to mcdonald's you you get like most of </connor>
<connor> the time get the same experience every </connor>
<connor> time but yeah with sushi chains it's </connor>
<connor> just you it's wildly different depending </connor>
<garnt> no well not wildly because every the </garnt>
<garnt> baseline is good right yeah the baseline </garnt>
<connor> is good it it goes it goes from good to </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] incredible yeah it's what i'm </garnt>
<connor> trying to say here i've never had food </connor>
<connor> poisoning from fish here it's always </connor>
<garnt> been sausages so </garnt>
<connor> take that as scientific 100 percent </connor>
<garnt> proof yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's not even chicken sashimi or it's </connor>
<joey> chicken it's the goddamn sausage no </joey>
<connor> yeah i think i've like one </connor>
<connor> uh one thing you don't you need to take </connor>
<connor> an account into account is that it's </connor>
<garnt> actually like it's a lot harder than you </garnt>
<garnt> think to get from hakadate to sapporo if </garnt>
<garnt> you want to explore all of hokkaido oh </garnt>
<joey> it's right i'd say it's practically </joey>
<joey> impossible to explore all of hokkaido </joey>
<joey> because it's just so massive those two </joey>
<garnt> well those two are like big major cities </garnt>
<joey> without a car yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean i i i drove around hokkaido a bit </joey>
<joey> it's really fun i really recommend it </joey>
<joey> some really cool towns like toyota it's </joey>
<joey> really cool was really nice yeah like </joey>
<connor> the best supercar i've ever had in my </connor>
<connor> life it's in toyota so good yeah because </connor>
<garnt> like the i think i think the drive </garnt>
<connor> between hakadate and </connor>
<connor> sapporo is like four hours or something </connor>
<joey> three to four hours three to four hours </joey>
<garnt> even with the train and we do two hours </garnt>
<joey> with europe and most of the time it's </joey>
<garnt> just you're going through the mountains </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which is really weird because like </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<garnt> you you can really get tricked by the </garnt>
<garnt> map right because you you go on google </garnt>
<joey> maps and you go tokyo to hakadate which </joey>
<joey> is like which is like that and it's like </joey>
<joey> three hours or four hours with the </joey>
<connor> shinkansen and then </connor>
<connor> by the way huh that's not enough it's </connor>
<joey> not shinkansen the shinkansen stops at </joey>
<joey> hakodate oh okay okay no no no yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah two two hakadate it stops a hakka </joey>
<joey> data right so it's like three hours so </joey>
<joey> it's like oh okay that's not too bad and </joey>
<joey> then uh you you're like okay maybe i can </joey>
<joey> explore sapporo as well because it's </joey>
<joey> just over just here it's just right next </joey>
<joey> to hakadate and then you google hakadate </joey>
<joey> to sapporo and it's like four hours four </joey>
<joey> and a half hours yeah to get like to get </joey>
<garnt> like that distance and you're like what </garnt>
<garnt> how does this make sense so uh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's something to keep in mind which </garnt>
<garnt> is uh it's a lot harder to explore all </garnt>
<garnt> of hokkaido than it may initially seem i </garnt>
<joey> think it's because when you're on the </joey>
<garnt> mainland japan you're so used to like </garnt>
<garnt> everything being so much smaller like </garnt>
<garnt> all the prefectures are way smaller all </garnt>
<garnt> the the towns are more likely they're </garnt>
<garnt> definitely easy to get to easily to get </garnt>
<joey> to easier and then you realize that </joey>
<connor> hokkaido in terms of prefectures is like </connor>
<connor> so much insanely larger than the next </connor>
<connor> biggest prefecture in japan that you </connor>
<connor> kind of forget that like oh yeah this </connor>
<garnt> place is </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] massive </joey>
<garnt> right it's like impossible to get around </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah are there any any other places </garnt>
<connor> outside of tokyo that's the obvious </connor>
<connor> count </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah are we gonna are we gonna talk </garnt>
<connor> about kyoto and we are really nervous </connor>
<connor> what is it like cancelled </connor>
<joey> i don't know if we can mention it man </joey>
<joey> after that </joey>
<joey> i think </joey>
<connor> is still great to go if you're you're </connor>
<connor> going to go to osaka right because it's </connor>
<connor> a fun place yeah and you me </connor>
<connor> might want to go to usj see the mario </connor>
<joey> world yeah you may as well go to kyoto </joey>
<joey> it's it's an hour away 40 minutes i </joey>
<joey> think right no it's like super duper 30 </joey>
<joey> minutes yeah yeah you may as well go to </joey>
<joey> both uh kyoto is a [ __ ] nightmare to </joey>
<garnt> get around though i will say uh </garnt>
<garnt> i know there's ways you can get around </garnt>
<garnt> with public transport but honestly if </garnt>
<garnt> you're going there for a trip i'd say </garnt>
<joey> just just taxi it around kyoto it's </joey>
<joey> super yeah so it's a lot cheaper to get </joey>
<joey> a taxi in kyoto and you can do way more </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] because if you just taxi from </joey>
<connor> places in kyoto you'll get so much more </connor>
<connor> done </connor>
<connor> i know that me and chris had like so </connor>
<garnt> many like major like tourist things in </garnt>
<connor> that one day yeah just because we just </connor>
<garnt> taxied everywhere yeah and did it </garnt>
<joey> yeah and uh the ryokans in uh kyoto are </joey>
<connor> amazing obviously super traditional if </connor>
<joey> you want that like super traditional </joey>
<connor> japan you're really good </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> like all those and then the good thing </connor>
<joey> is again osaka is only 30 minutes away </joey>
<joey> nara where you can feed the deers is </joey>
<joey> only like 45 minutes away you can go to </joey>
<connor> the other side you can go to shiga which </connor>
<joey> is near like uh biwaku which is japan's </joey>
<connor> biggest inland lake that place is really </connor>
<joey> lovely </joey>
<connor> feels like underrated </connor>
<connor> iphone store of japan so everything is </connor>
<connor> so minimal and clean yeah kyoto is so </connor>
<connor> impeccable how do you think it's going </connor>
<garnt> to be when the country opens up and we </garnt>
<connor> get tourists i'm scared i've only ever </connor>
<connor> been to kyoto with no tourists yeah </connor>
<garnt> because i've been to kyoto with tourists </garnt>
<garnt> and it's hell because like the reason i </garnt>
<connor> was just like do we want to talk about </connor>
<garnt> kyoto is just because like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like people people will want </garnt>
<garnt> to go obviously but it is </garnt>
<garnt> even more probably like when tourists </garnt>
<garnt> when the country opens back up it's </garnt>
<garnt> going to be even more of a tourist trap </garnt>
<garnt> than tokyo is </garnt>
<connor> i think that's what it seems like </connor>
<connor> is extremely popular with chinese </connor>
<joey> tourists yeah because uh he's a lot of </joey>
<connor> historians i went during chinese new </connor>
<joey> year and it was oh my god oh my god it </joey>
<joey> was like literal shoulder </joey>
<garnt> yeah because like kyoto yeah it's a cool </garnt>
<garnt> place it's not like the place that i </garnt>
<garnt> it's not my vibe when it comes to travel </garnt>
<garnt> just because it's like it's going to be </garnt>
<garnt> so busy so packed and you're going to be </garnt>
<connor> lining up for like uh for like the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] 10th temple that you've seen </connor>
<connor> that day or something like that and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like you know what maybe like maybe </connor>
<connor> we can skip this temple i just i i i go </connor>
<connor> somewhere i just want some nice food i </connor>
<connor> get it it's not for everyone but i love </connor>
<connor> it a lot of people love it um yeah like </connor>
<garnt> i recommend the places around kyoto more </garnt>
<garnt> than kyoto itself kyoto is like a good </garnt>
<connor> base hub i've been together a few times </connor>
<connor> in the past two years i gotta say my </connor>
<garnt> enjoyment of kyoto depended on the </garnt>
<garnt> weather </garnt>
<garnt> right kyoto gets so hot it does in the </garnt>
<joey> summer it's unbearable yeah i just i </joey>
<connor> wouldn't even bother going to oh my god </connor>
<connor> in summer i just i genuinely i tell </connor>
<connor> people i'm like just don't don't come in </connor>
<connor> august you're not gonna have fun yeah </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> come </connor>
<connor> between </connor>
<connor> october just come just come just come </connor>
<connor> come right now come throughs you want to </connor>
<connor> come </connor>
<joey> come between october and </joey>
<joey> april </joey>
<joey> i would mostly agree with you except of </joey>
<connor> the existence of okinawa okay if you're </connor>
<connor> gonna occur but how many people are </connor>
<joey> going to get okinawa like not that many </joey>
<garnt> a lot of people okay </garnt>
<joey> here's here's here's the thing because </joey>
<joey> that's where i recommend tokyo sucks in </joey>
<connor> the summer </connor>
<joey> i will fully agree with conor because if </joey>
<garnt> you're going to go to japan to go to </garnt>
<garnt> just okinawa then [ __ ] go to </garnt>
<garnt> southeast asian countries like there's </garnt>
<garnt> so many [ __ ] beaches there you know </garnt>
<garnt> okinawa is where </garnt>
<connor> we go when we live in japan because we </connor>
<connor> don't have [ __ ] off our we colonize this </connor>
<connor> island bizarre </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean okinawa is where </garnt>
<garnt> is uh is where we go if you live in </garnt>
<garnt> japan to get to like a good beach </garnt>
<garnt> because there's not many choices when it </garnt>
<garnt> comes to good beaches here in japan </garnt>
<joey> unfortunately god forbid mainland japan </joey>
<connor> is a good beach yeah because i'm in like </connor>
<connor> shimoda and stuff </connor>
<joey> i mean </joey>
<connor> it has a bunch i don't know my standard </connor>
<joey> of beaches is very high yeah oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so i don't know and i feel okinawa </joey>
<joey> is the only place that fits my </joey>
<joey> australian standard </joey>
<joey> i was raised in like some of the best </joey>
<joey> beaches in the world </joey>
<garnt> yeah japan doesn't have a lot of choices </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to beaches uh funny for an </garnt>
<joey> island nation but then again i'm from </joey>
<joey> england as well and we have the exact </joey>
<garnt> same problem so </garnt>
<joey> i i would argue that okinawa is not only </joey>
<joey> great for the beaches but you know kind </joey>
<joey> of very similar to hokkaido where like </joey>
<joey> the food that you can get in okinawa is </joey>
<garnt> like next level i've never actually been </garnt>
<garnt> to okinawa yes </garnt>
<joey> but i've only seen like the spam sushi </joey>
<joey> you know like spam sushi is like you </joey>
<joey> know more famous one but like there's so </joey>
<joey> many there's so many like traditionalist </joey>
<connor> okinawan uku style foods that are just </connor>
<connor> so good and i mean like the booze in </connor>
<connor> okinawa as well like you know because </connor>
<connor> like in in a hokkaido you have sapporo </connor>
<connor> bee yeah right which is like you drink </connor>
<joey> saparabhi in hokkaido it's like poor </joey>
<garnt> classic support class which you can only </garnt>
<joey> get in like hokkaido for some reason </joey>
<joey> yeah whereas in okinawa there's a </joey>
<joey> specific type of beer called an orion b </joey>
<joey> or an orion b however you want to </joey>
<joey> pronounce it and orion b in sapporo </joey>
<joey> in okinawa is probably just as not </joey>
<joey> worthy as a sapporo in hokkaido you said </joey>
<garnt> onion beer </garnt>
<connor> and then you cut the onion cut the </connor>
<connor> onions </connor>
<joey> or it's spelled orion but it's </joey>
<joey> pronounced </joey>
<joey> orion beer is it's it's like a okinawa </joey>
<connor> specific beer and that on like a summer </connor>
<connor> day in okinawa is </connor>
<connor> god tea okay it's so good and just </connor>
<connor> okinawan food in general if you want </connor>
<garnt> like a different kind of twist on </garnt>
<garnt> japanese food that you can't really get </garnt>
<garnt> anywhere else i would definitely </garnt>
<garnt> recommend okinawan food yeah and there's </garnt>
<garnt> plenty of okinawa based restaurants in </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo as well like there's there's a </garnt>
<garnt> really good one in nikki actually in </garnt>
<garnt> sunshine city i go to quite a bit </garnt>
<garnt> um so if you want like a different take </garnt>
<garnt> on japanese food i recommend knocking on </garnt>
<garnt> food yeah i mean i mean speaking of food </garnt>
<garnt> um a lot of people come here or at least </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of anime come anime fans come here </garnt>
<joey> expecting to uh enjoy like the weeb </joey>
<joey> aspect and then pretty much everyone i </joey>
<joey> talk to they come to japan and they're </joey>
<joey> just like i stay for the food oh yes the </joey>
<garnt> food collection </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah right right you spend </connor>
<garnt> your money on food if you're gonna spend </garnt>
<garnt> your money on something i i know it's </garnt>
<garnt> going to be hard walking through </garnt>
<garnt> akihabara and you can see some cool </garnt>
<garnt> anime figures spend your money on a good </garnt>
<joey> meal you will not [ __ ] regret it </joey>
<joey> it'll be the best meal you've probably </joey>
<garnt> had in your entire life yeah what kind </garnt>
<garnt> of things you guys recommend people try </garnt>
<garnt> out when they're here not ichiran not </garnt>
<garnt> each one right </garnt>
<joey> now no no no </joey>
<joey> go to a job go to </joey>
<joey> wherever you are </joey>
<connor> find the filthiest grossest looking </connor>
<connor> ramen place most likely the ramen will </connor>
<joey> be a ten out of ten yes or one i mean </joey>
<connor> it's you know no it's always no no it's </connor>
<garnt> never a one it's never a one the ones </garnt>
<joey> that </joey>
<garnt> the ones that have the [ __ ] neon </garnt>
<joey> signs look really pretty on the outside </joey>
<garnt> they're just covering the fact that the </garnt>
<garnt> food is made yeah and the thing is it </garnt>
<garnt> might look intimidating because </garnt>
<garnt> obviously it looks very traditional you </garnt>
<garnt> don't know how to order most of the time </garnt>
<garnt> it there will be a machine right </garnt>
<garnt> like a ticket machine and all you have </garnt>
<joey> to do is put your money in and uh if </joey>
<joey> you're having trouble you know </joey>
<joey> figuring out </joey>
<joey> uh what the orders are because there's </joey>
<joey> normally like only like four ramens to </joey>
<joey> choose from anyway so that's the good </joey>
<joey> places yeah those are the good places </joey>
<joey> the less choice you have on the menu the </joey>
<joey> more like the better chance it's going </joey>
<joey> to be that it's gonna [ __ ] bomb </joey>
<joey> because it's like it's </joey>
<joey> uh because that that means that this </joey>
<joey> family or the the person running the </joey>
<joey> restaurant has just like perfected their </joey>
<joey> christmas they've perfected it they've </joey>
<joey> sharpened their craft you know </joey>
<joey> yeah um but most of the time you're only </joey>
<joey> gonna have like three or four ramens to </joey>
<joey> pick from you can like use the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> google translate thing uh </joey>
<joey> hack that uh </joey>
<garnt> life hack that we use um if you're </garnt>
<garnt> having trouble but it's not it's really </garnt>
<garnt> not that um intimidating at all so you </garnt>
<garnt> just choose you choose your meal maybe </garnt>
<garnt> you go with the gyoza as well maybe </garnt>
<garnt> you're doing beer with it um and then </garnt>
<garnt> you just give your tickets to the ramen </garnt>
<garnt> guy and he'll give you your order that's </garnt>
<joey> pretty much it and it's the bit and it's </joey>
<joey> probably the best [ __ ] ramen you'll </joey>
<garnt> ever have in your life yeah honestly uh </garnt>
<garnt> like we just said earlier convey about </garnt>
<garnt> sushi i actually prefer conveyor belt </garnt>
<garnt> sushi a lot of the times to the more </garnt>
<garnt> expensive sushi chains and sushi </garnt>
<joey> restaurants i think i think it depends </joey>
<joey> for me like i i don't mind going to the </joey>
<joey> more expensive ones maybe like once or </joey>
<joey> twice a year but if i just want like a </joey>
<joey> consistently like good </joey>
<joey> sushi then yeah there's nothing wrong </joey>
<connor> because there's a lot of places that </connor>
<connor> they're just like lunch sets that are </connor>
<connor> like 2 000 yen you get like a bunch of </connor>
<garnt> stuff that's true because you're like </garnt>
<garnt> right in front of you here's the reason </garnt>
<garnt> why like because with conveyor belt </garnt>
<garnt> sushi like it's </garnt>
<garnt> such a good value for money yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember the first time coming to japan </garnt>
<garnt> and just thinking like the sushi is </garnt>
<garnt> amazing because it [ __ ] is amazing i </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to stuff myself full with as much </garnt>
<garnt> sushi as i could eat and you can't do </garnt>
<connor> that with expensive changes i prefer the </connor>
<connor> ones with the conveyor belts but you </connor>
<joey> order and then it comes out on the </joey>
<joey> conveyor belt because that's most places </joey>
<joey> now yeah yeah i know there are still </joey>
<garnt> some that have like the rotating ones oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's just like i would rather </garnt>
<garnt> have the freshly prepared one yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so with a lot of conveyor belt </garnt>
<garnt> brands or places that we that you go to </garnt>
<garnt> um they'll have a system where some of </garnt>
<garnt> them some of them will literally like be </garnt>
<garnt> automated where they'll have a plate </garnt>
<garnt> that gets like shot to you on like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] and yeah the first thing is </garnt>
<joey> usually yeah it's usually shaped like a </joey>
<garnt> bullet train yeah yeah yeah right it's </garnt>
<joey> like so thematically </joey>
<joey> it's so cool it's so cool and uh yeah </joey>
<joey> like i to this day i still </joey>
<joey> i still eat as much conveyable sushi as </joey>
<joey> i can because i think it's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> amazing i love i love stuffing myself </joey>
<joey> forward sushi and i can't do that at </joey>
<joey> more expensive restaurants i mean </joey>
<connor> sushi's good sushi's good but at the end </connor>
<garnt> of the day it's just fish rice wasabi </garnt>
<connor> right it's fish fries from wasabi and </connor>
<connor> there's i also think you should try the </connor>
<garnt> foreign food here like try to see what </garnt>
<garnt> their takes are on uh foreign foods it's </garnt>
<garnt> quite interesting they do some really </garnt>
<connor> good foreign food here yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> italian food especially time food's </garnt>
<connor> really good here yeah there's some good </connor>
<garnt> really good burgers different from </garnt>
<garnt> uh italian food in europe it's really </garnt>
<connor> good though like imagine that you know </connor>
<connor> that some some restaurants combine the </connor>
<connor> techniques of uh you know </connor>
<connor> italian chefs but use japanese </connor>
<connor> ingredients which uh is can be really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] impressive </connor>
<connor> uh it's maybe not the most authentic </connor>
<connor> thing but you get something new </connor>
<connor> especially the fish here yeah yeah oh my </connor>
<garnt> god fish dishes in japan and italian </garnt>
<connor> food are like next [ __ ] levels yeah </connor>
<connor> definitely holy [ __ ] the best kind of </connor>
<garnt> fusion oh so good what do you think </garnt>
<connor> about them trying wagyu beef </connor>
<connor> yeah try it try it i mean you know </connor>
<joey> the thing is there's so many different </joey>
<connor> types of wagons when you've lived here </connor>
<connor> long enough i feel like you you kind of </connor>
<connor> go off wag you yeah you're like i kind </connor>
<connor> of want more meat than fat yeah but the </connor>
<connor> first time you have it it's like a like </connor>
<garnt> a [ __ ] like what the [ __ ] this is an </garnt>
<garnt> explosion in your mouth </garnt>
<garnt> of that flavor it's food wars it's based </garnt>
<connor> on like yeah pretty much yeah eating </connor>
<garnt> wagyu his mouth is just </garnt>
<garnt> like where's like the best place to get </garnt>
<connor> wagyu if you don't know what you're </connor>
<garnt> looking for though </garnt>
<garnt> that's really hard yeah go anywhere in </garnt>
<connor> kobe i guess and just get kobe beef </connor>
<garnt> there well let's let's let's assume like </garnt>
<connor> every single prefecture in japan like we </connor>
<connor> have our own beef that is good i think i </connor>
<joey> think i think </joey>
<connor> in takayama is probably the best like </connor>
<connor> type of wagyu i've had right </connor>
<connor> kobe beef is like </connor>
<garnt> it's good but it's so fatty at times </garnt>
<garnt> where you're just like oh my god i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know if i'm eating like a piece of fat </garnt>
<joey> or not yeah you're just eating butter </joey>
<garnt> basically yeah basically you just </garnt>
<garnt> americans you love them you'd love that </garnt>
<connor> right yeah americans love it like saying </connor>
<connor> like teppanyaki you always get like you </connor>
<connor> can always get like wagyu </connor>
<joey> yeah tampon yaki's pretty good it also </joey>
<garnt> just depends on how it's prepared as </garnt>
<garnt> well a lot of times but like what i </garnt>
<garnt> really like about like hidaku for </garnt>
<garnt> example is that like they literally just </garnt>
<garnt> like put a bunch like cubes over </garnt>
<joey> basically just on a stick put it on top </joey>
<joey> of a fire just put some salt and pepper </joey>
<joey> on that [ __ ] and boom it's like the </joey>
<joey> best [ __ ] food you'll ever have and </joey>
<connor> they sell it as street food i mean </connor>
<connor> chris's favorite food yakitori as well </connor>
<garnt> yakitori is good </garnt>
<connor> again like </connor>
<connor> kind of wrong did you feel like the best </connor>
<connor> types of yakitori are the </connor>
<garnt> all-you-can-eat ones or do you think </garnt>
<garnt> they should go to like a more </garnt>
<joey> traditional yakitori place i think both </joey>
<joey> are pretty good i think if it's the </joey>
<joey> first time you're experiencing that </joey>
<joey> you're probably not going to be able to </joey>
<connor> taste the difference i think the only </connor>
<connor> ones who are like you know go only opt </connor>
<connor> to go to like say the more </connor>
<connor> traditionalist ones yeah the ones who </connor>
<connor> have just had so much [ __ ] tori </connor>
<joey> kizoku that they're just like all right </joey>
<joey> let me just try and be you know </joey>
<connor> if you really want to try those kind of </connor>
<connor> place though you really need to do need </connor>
<joey> to learn the names though yes yes </joey>
<joey> because a lot of those places don't have </joey>
<connor> a menu </connor>
<connor> oh yeah that's true because they just </connor>
<connor> you just walk up it's literally just a </connor>
<joey> counter and a dude standing there just </joey>
<joey> infinitely cooking chicken and you just </joey>
<joey> have to say that just saying that's the </joey>
<joey> best one is the best one </joey>
<connor> the layers dude they taste so good japan </connor>
<joey> does nikki based food so well oh dude </joey>
<connor> it's so good yeah it's really really </connor>
<garnt> good i can just plow down on like 50 </garnt>
<garnt> like negatives yeah i just i guess </garnt>
<garnt> chris always wants the sugar i think </garnt>
<garnt> soukiness just i love </garnt>
<garnt> the meatballs yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i love it i love it like why bastardize </garnt>
<garnt> this this chicken dude just give me the </garnt>
<garnt> bastardize the chicken rip it apart and </garnt>
<garnt> shove it back together talking about it </garnt>
<connor> just grind it apart and make it into a </connor>
<connor> ball that's great it's just like it's </connor>
<garnt> not the only time i will accept boneless </garnt>
<connor> chicken </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ground chicken the reason why i </connor>
<connor> don't like it </connor>
<connor> it's almost like </connor>
<joey> like negimo is the perfect balance </joey>
<garnt> between meat and veg right you get one </garnt>
<connor> bite of chicken and veg right yeah </connor>
<connor> perfect soup in it just pure like just </connor>
<connor> ground meat and i'm like this is too </connor>
<garnt> much but like i like that because it's </garnt>
<garnt> it more evenly spreads the seasoning </garnt>
<garnt> right because it's it's seasoned in the </garnt>
<connor> ground meat right </connor>
<connor> i mean i i just i kind of want a </connor>
<connor> variation you know </connor>
<joey> well you know that's the great thing </joey>
<garnt> about yakitori right different </garnt>
<garnt> structures yeah </garnt>
<connor> calorific ones there's like ones where </connor>
<connor> we like it's uh </connor>
<garnt> meat filled with cheese pork belly i i </garnt>
<garnt> highly recommend pork belly as well if </garnt>
<joey> uh </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah i mean that's the like again you </garnt>
<joey> that's what i order if i don't want to </joey>
<joey> have something like wagyu beef but you </joey>
<joey> still want that like explosion of like </joey>
<joey> flavor </joey>
<joey> in your mouth like that perfect </joey>
<joey> what would you say then is the most </joey>
<joey> underrated japanese food for people to </joey>
<joey> try when it comes to japan right because </joey>
<joey> like everyone obviously everyone knows </joey>
<connor> that they're going to go to a sushi </connor>
<connor> place they're going to go to like an </connor>
<connor> izakaya but like </connor>
<connor> uh the one that no one ever talks about </connor>
<connor> unani niki's like the boss dude i was </connor>
<garnt> gonna say unagi as well yeah yeah please </garnt>
<connor> try unagi it is expensive it is </connor>
<connor> expensive it is expensive but it's worth </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> it's an experience okay because like i </connor>
<garnt> remember i remember </garnt>
<garnt> explaining to my mom how i'm like really </garnt>
<garnt> into unagi but i had to explain to her </garnt>
<garnt> that uh it's uh eel right yeah she's </garnt>
<garnt> like oh yeah people why'd you like eat </garnt>
<connor> well that's disgusting and that's </connor>
<joey> because like her perception of eating </joey>
<connor> eel is like jellied eels oh yeah i'm </connor>
<joey> just like my god like the living in the </joey>
<garnt> uk has to like ruined your perception of </garnt>
<connor> this [ __ ] s-tier food so it's like </connor>
<connor> the way it's prepared is that it's </connor>
<garnt> grilled and then it's like smoked i </garnt>
<garnt> think as well yes yeah and so it's it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't it's not slimy it's just like </garnt>
<connor> kind of like you know when you grill a </connor>
<connor> fish and it's kind of like nice and </connor>
<connor> crumbly and dry and and then they s the </connor>
<connor> way they season and sauce this bad boy </connor>
<joey> it's not tried that's the thing it's not </joey>
<connor> somehow moist it's it's moist it's good </connor>
<connor> it's just like it has like the uh </connor>
<connor> consistency of like fish and it's like a </connor>
<connor> perfectly a perfectly good </connor>
<joey> uh perfectly good like flavorful moist </joey>
<joey> fish you put that on a bed of rice i i </joey>
<joey> feel like i feel like </joey>
<joey> there's some really cheap places you can </joey>
<joey> get it but i'd say the places that cost </joey>
<connor> around two to three thousand yen for a </connor>
<joey> box are probably like the places where </joey>
<connor> you'll get some really good ones yeah </connor>
<joey> you know i've gone to places where they </joey>
<connor> charged like seven thousand yen seventy </connor>
<joey> bucks which i've got a place where it's </joey>
<joey> like a hundred bucks for yeah and it's </joey>
<garnt> like it's like damn it's good can you </garnt>
<connor> tell the difference in the taste though </connor>
<connor> yeah i so i </connor>
<connor> it's weird man within an aggie it's like </connor>
<connor> i feel like the the subtleness of the </connor>
<garnt> flavors especially the fish yeah when </garnt>
<garnt> you get it cheap it's so harsh the </garnt>
<garnt> flavor yeah yeah whereas like the good </garnt>
<garnt> ones the sauce is kind of light the fish </garnt>
<garnt> that's like the eel is just really i </garnt>
<connor> don't know how to describe it [ __ ] it </connor>
<joey> i don't know do you know what i mean i i </joey>
<connor> know exactly i know you </connor>
<connor> i don't know it kind of like the skin </connor>
<connor> also the texture of the skin on the </connor>
<connor> cheek places is like really </connor>
<connor> uh rough yeah rough and kind of yeah </connor>
<connor> it makes you feel like you're eating </connor>
<connor> something fishy whereas normally when </connor>
<connor> it's good or naggy it doesn't remind you </connor>
<connor> it doesn't feel like you're eating fish </connor>
<joey> yeah it feels like you're eating meat </joey>
<garnt> yeah which is like the weirdest </garnt>
<garnt> comparison yeah it's it's like a meaty </garnt>
<joey> fishy kind of it's like it's like a meat </joey>
<joey> and fish combo yeah the best way imagine </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah you have to try do you </garnt>
<joey> ever get like ubereats unagi i've had it </joey>
<connor> a bunch uh it's generally at meh yeah </connor>
<connor> i'd say you've got to go to a restaurant </connor>
<connor> if you're in japan you're probably not </connor>
<joey> getting ubereats so don't worry about it </joey>
<joey> don't waste your time with uber i will </joey>
<joey> say sometimes that if it's a nice unagi </joey>
<joey> place you might have to reserve </joey>
<garnt> unanimity takes a while to cook yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like uh a lot of places especially </garnt>
<garnt> if you're out there summer summer yes </garnt>
<garnt> it's a summer food </garnt>
<garnt> primarily but you can get in winter it's </garnt>
<garnt> still good yeah the places in the </garnt>
<garnt> countryside outside of tokyo normally </garnt>
<garnt> always have to call in advance yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> tell them that you're coming or that you </garnt>
<garnt> want to book because it takes i think at </garnt>
<garnt> least an hour or two to cook it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> though because it's smoked and stuff so </garnt>
<garnt> it takes a while it's really really good </garnt>
<garnt> really really recommend it yeah and </garnt>
<connor> people don't really talk about it </connor>
<connor> because people don't like the idea of </connor>
<connor> eels </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm always hyping it up though i </connor>
<garnt> love it yeah i mean i guess for me if i </garnt>
<garnt> can't say unagi uh if you are going to </garnt>
<joey> like a more expensive uh seafood place i </joey>
<connor> really like uni i mean yeah </connor>
<joey> i know connor i know connor hates it </joey>
<connor> but i've uni has like really grown on me </connor>
<joey> since i've moved to japan like really </joey>
<joey> really yeah i just like okay you know </joey>
<joey> how favorite you know how you know they </joey>
<joey> say like if you if you take a seashell </joey>
<garnt> with you and you put your ear against it </garnt>
<garnt> then you can hear the ocean and hear the </garnt>
<garnt> scene so me eating uni is like eating </garnt>
<connor> the seeds it's like tasting this it's </connor>
<connor> like it's you know like if the she had </connor>
<connor> poop and you ate it it would be </connor>
<joey> if the seeds were like the best flavored </joey>
<connor> poop if if if that's if that is true </connor>
<connor> poop just just i i i guess </connor>
<connor> i'm a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> i guess i'm about to play euphoria all </garnt>
<garnt> over again baby because i i am a seed </garnt>
<connor> lover if you know what it is it's on </connor>
<connor> screen right now it says orange looking </connor>
<connor> paste thingy you'll you'll recognize it </connor>
<connor> because it always stands out in the </connor>
<connor> sushi yeah everything it looks like </connor>
<connor> one of these things is not like the </connor>
<garnt> other </garnt>
<garnt> but it looks it's so refreshing </garnt>
<garnt> so you'll know which camp you're in yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> when you try it please let me know to be </connor>
<joey> fair </joey>
<joey> i think out of like the almost like </joey>
<joey> maybe 10 to 20 people that i've taken to </joey>
<garnt> a sushi place and they've tried uni i </garnt>
<connor> think like like 75 of them ended up </connor>
<connor> liking it yeah what i think it's like </connor>
<joey> most people i think are very thrown off </joey>
<connor> with how it looks i spoke to dadas and </connor>
<connor> emily and they were like yeah they were </connor>
<connor> like let's go to a sushi place like sure </connor>
<connor> like the one place i don't want to go is </connor>
<connor> if they have too much uni </connor>
<connor> and i was like don't worry i hate uni </connor>
<joey> too </joey>
<joey> yes that's so good no taste no taste no </joey>
<garnt> taste but oh yeah like i i really really </garnt>
<garnt> like uni and i even if you don't like it </garnt>
<garnt> i recommend you try it out because </garnt>
<garnt> it's a very unique flavor it's very </garnt>
<garnt> refreshing it's nothing </garnt>
<garnt> it's nowhere on the same level as like </garnt>
<garnt> something like [ __ ] natto or </garnt>
<connor> something like that where it's like </connor>
<connor> weird foods it's a very subtle flavor </connor>
<joey> subtle it's like a it's a bomb going off </joey>
<joey> no it's not what no </joey>
<joey> it's like refreshing it's like eating </joey>
<joey> the ocean it's like it's like a salty </joey>
<joey> creamy type of like you know nice flavor </joey>
<garnt> that goes yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's so weird because you literally look </garnt>
<joey> at the sea urchin and just like how the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] anything edible come out of that </joey>
<joey> it's like what the hell is this they </joey>
<connor> crack it open gold </connor>
<connor> gold of the ocean </connor>
<joey> um okay i would probably recommend then </joey>
<joey> um what japan does really [ __ ] well </joey>
<joey> when when we think of meat based foods </joey>
<joey> in japan you know most people are pretty </joey>
<joey> quick to go like uh you know wagyu and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that i think they're like </joey>
<garnt> tonkatsu in japan oh yeah it's god tiff </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] which is uh which is uh </garnt>
<joey> uh fried no not fried well deep yeah </joey>
<connor> like pork dude if you ever go to gunma </connor>
<connor> holy [ __ ] these things are like yeah </connor>
<connor> they look like they're fighting back </connor>
<connor> thick pieces of pork it's so good though </connor>
<connor> oh there's this really good chain in </connor>
<connor> tokyo </connor>
<connor> i'm going to call my sin yeah oh my set </connor>
<joey> dude my son is god here uh did i took </joey>
<connor> you there yeah i told connor and it's </connor>
<connor> like 40 bucks though but like holy [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> but it is the best poor color you'll </joey>
<connor> ever have oh </connor>
<joey> my gosh </joey>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> yeah pork cutlet like there's there's </connor>
<garnt> nothing that can be like a fresh pork </garnt>
<connor> cutlet hungover it's my go-to yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's just like shrimp has the egg [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like the texture is just godly you bite </garnt>
<joey> in and it's all crispy and then you get </joey>
<joey> the rich inside it's nice and juicy oh </joey>
<garnt> my god [ __ ] me out god </garnt>
<joey> you can have it by itself or there's </joey>
<connor> another really like cool way to eat it </connor>
<garnt> which i like which is katsudon yeah </garnt>
<connor> which is like where you like put it in </connor>
<garnt> an egg and like have some money people </garnt>
<garnt> that are a better right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not a fan of katsudon really because </garnt>
<joey> it's like to me to me </joey>
<joey> to me part of my like one of my favorite </joey>
<joey> things about tonkatsu is the texture </joey>
<joey> right but when you put it on the egg it </joey>
<garnt> just like it gets rid of that crunch to </garnt>
<joey> it no but like it's written but that's </joey>
<joey> replaced with the [ __ ] amazing like </joey>
<connor> egg and like pork flavored </connor>
<connor> all that turns your </connor>
<garnt> it's that crunch it's that fresh crunch </garnt>
<garnt> that just it's it's just godly and by </garnt>
<connor> putting egg over it you get a fresh one </connor>
<connor> you can get like the crunch with the egg </connor>
<joey> and the sauce and the you got them you </joey>
<joey> gotta you have the cuts on the licen </joey>
<joey> dude it has the crunch i can't believe </joey>
<garnt> you just tell me what it is i can't </garnt>
<garnt> believe it tell you what it tell you </garnt>
<connor> what it is it's it's like putting milk </connor>
<connor> in your cereal all right </connor>
<garnt> you get rid of the texture you i like </garnt>
<connor> that crunch i like that fresh crunch </connor>
<connor> chatted on is better than the normal uh </connor>
<connor> cause you get the egg the egg and the </connor>
<connor> onions are a game changer but with the </connor>
<garnt> rice because when you get the perfect </garnt>
<garnt> ratio of of meat egg rice and onions in </garnt>
<garnt> one bite it's like it's like food wars </garnt>
<garnt> levels </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's the best i don't know what go </garnt>
<garnt> on god's little baby though god's like </garnt>
<connor> dude gonna ask questions like do you </connor>
<connor> peel your crayons before you eat it like </connor>
<connor> yes like i don't know don't don't trust </connor>
<garnt> god </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i mean it's it's it's it's a </garnt>
<garnt> prayer it's a preference thing it's a </garnt>
<garnt> preference i've got so to me to me the </garnt>
<garnt> best thing about tonkatsu is to eat [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> is that [ __ ] what you do no no no no </joey>
<joey> no he's got good taste because he likes </joey>
<connor> uni natto all right you want to side </connor>
<connor> with a guy who says old bread tastes the </connor>
<joey> same </joey>
<garnt> but i will agree uni and nato has gone </garnt>
<joey> live they're [ __ ] godlike yeah but </joey>
<joey> again like i would like to argue there </joey>
<joey> is so much more to japanese cuisine than </joey>
<joey> sushi and wagyu like yeah go ahead eat </joey>
<joey> the sushi </joey>
<garnt> and ramen right all [ __ ] amazing but </garnt>
<garnt> if you go out there and try out some </garnt>
<garnt> other like lesser-known stuff and </garnt>
<garnt> there's like we only just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> scratched the surface there is plenty of </garnt>
<garnt> other stuff </garnt>
<garnt> maybe maybe you're like oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> with economics </connor>
<connor> you know takoyaki as well you know it </connor>
<joey> kind of chooses uh yeah some people </joey>
<connor> really like it some people don't there's </connor>
<connor> some really nice restaurants actually </connor>
<connor> that do it that are like really good </connor>
<connor> prices </connor>
<connor> it i mean it's street food right but </connor>
<connor> there are some restaurants that do it </connor>
<joey> amazingly but if you're gonna have some </joey>
<joey> of the best okonomiyaki and takoyaki </joey>
<joey> especially you've got to go to osaka </joey>
<connor> that's true yeah </connor>
<connor> the best the okonomiyaki the best </connor>
<joey> okonomiyaki i had was in osaka in like </joey>
<joey> this like really shitty downtown </joey>
<joey> where like five people could fit in it </joey>
<joey> and it was [ __ ] amazing well the </joey>
<garnt> thing is it's just like i feel like the </garnt>
<garnt> rule with asian food is that if you buy </garnt>
<garnt> it on the streets or if it looks [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> dirty that food is gonna [ __ ] be </garnt>
<garnt> amazing and then and that rule is also </garnt>
<garnt> consistent in japan as well if you have </garnt>
<garnt> the if you have the opportunity to buy </garnt>
<garnt> street food it's not it's normally </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing yeah i've got a question </garnt>
<garnt> what about conbini food where does that </garnt>
<garnt> come into this combini food um company </garnt>
<joey> food is an experience i think that's </joey>
<joey> really fun for the first couple of days </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah obviously you're gonna want </connor>
<connor> you're gonna want to save some money and </connor>
<connor> spend some money on restaurants but i'd </connor>
<connor> say yeah yeah you could definitely gotta </connor>
<garnt> try to food's still </garnt>
<garnt> great compared to everywhere else </garnt>
<joey> because i'm like </joey>
<joey> i'm like compared to the rest of the </joey>
<joey> world compared to the restaurant because </joey>
<connor> like i'm remembering when i first came </connor>
<connor> to japan i'm just like damn i can live </connor>
<joey> out of 7-eleven and family my entire </joey>
<garnt> life and i did for like a good few </garnt>
<joey> months and didn't get bored you guys </joey>
<joey> lived off conveniently like onigirian </joey>
<garnt> sandwiches yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> because like compared to like the food </joey>
<garnt> we have uh like [ __ ] tesco's or </garnt>
<joey> whatever it's like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> okay listen right these sandwiches are </connor>
<connor> good they're decent but these sandwiches </connor>
<joey> aren't better than the ones i'm </joey>
<joey> reserving my judgment i still have yet </joey>
<connor> to try a tesco meal deal </connor>
<garnt> i know for a fact i know when we go to </garnt>
<connor> the uk for god's wedding later right </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm going to try it out and i'll </joey>
<connor> see which side i'm he's pretty scared </connor>
<connor> because i know for a fact you're going </connor>
<garnt> to like the tesco meal deal more okay </garnt>
<garnt> but like comparing tesco food to [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> combini food it's it's nowhere near it's </garnt>
<connor> nowhere near yeah okay first of all joe </connor>
<joey> here's i'm going to tell you first of </joey>
<connor> all sandwiches actually have crust on </connor>
<joey> them okay that already wins all right </joey>
<garnt> what do you what what what do you want </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't want a sandwich </garnt>
<connor> no i'm not saying i'm okay i'm just </connor>
<connor> saying the sandwich is about it all </connor>
<garnt> right okay that's that's not an argument </garnt>
<garnt> i'm saying conbini food in general would </garnt>
<garnt> you want what do you want if you want to </garnt>
<joey> tesco muddy but you don't want a </joey>
<joey> sandwich get a salad sorry it's decent </joey>
<connor> it's not great i'm looking at a </connor>
<garnt> cornbread [ __ ] salad pasty if you're </garnt>
<garnt> on pasta it's a cold pasty a cold pasta </garnt>
<connor> it's like a pork ball with batter </connor>
<connor> egg no egg in the middle yeah you gotta </connor>
<garnt> you gotta compare that to like [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> good good fried chicken </connor>
<connor> but the sandwich game is absolutely </connor>
<connor> appalling i still like them yeah but the </connor>
<connor> uk sandwiches are like it's like </connor>
<garnt> like the sandwich there's the sandwich </garnt>
<connor> in kombini's section is like one one </connor>
<connor> tiny section compared to like literally </connor>
<connor> what's up with that why is that a meal </connor>
<connor> deal why is that a drink get your own </connor>
<garnt> tea get a sandwich and a little snack </garnt>
<joey> because you have an infinite amount of </joey>
<joey> choice yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> like just called going to the food </joey>
<connor> section at a convenience also i don't </connor>
<connor> like in japan how it's really hard to </connor>
<connor> get a normal sized bag of crisps like </connor>
<joey> they're all big sized right you notice </joey>
<joey> that yeah it's like you can't you talk </joey>
<joey> about like the small you can't just have </joey>
<connor> like one portion of crisp it's like you </connor>
<joey> have you're committing to like three </joey>
<joey> bags yeah would it be fair to be fair </joey>
<joey> though like when you when you do buy the </joey>
<joey> big ones though like 60 of it is air </joey>
<joey> which is probably the equivalent to like </joey>
<joey> one small sized bag of chips so yeah but </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean like if especially if you </joey>
<joey> come from england uh i think connor's </joey>
<joey> romanticized tesco muir deals absolutely </joey>
<joey> not because you got these sandwiches and </joey>
<joey> uh if you go to the company you also </joey>
<connor> have sandwiches but you also have like </connor>
<garnt> onigiri fried chicken you have some </garnt>
<connor> yakitori sticks you got bentos </connor>
<connor> i don't [ __ ] with the yakitori sticks at </connor>
<connor> conbini's i wouldn't get them you won't </connor>
<garnt> get them so you get like you get like </garnt>
<garnt> you've got fried chicken beef balls have </garnt>
<connor> the sausages there before </connor>
<connor> did you get food poisoning from them i </connor>
<connor> did not i've had the 7-eleven like not </connor>
<connor> corn dogs the ones like just hot dogs on </connor>
<joey> a stick yeah it's all right the corn </joey>
<joey> dogs at 7-eleven are kind of all right </joey>
<garnt> no i've never had one i i like corn dogs </garnt>
<connor> it's hard to [ __ ] up a corn dog if you </connor>
<connor> go to a mini stop which you won't see </connor>
<connor> often they have soft serves they are the </connor>
<joey> rarest yeah although many stop soft </joey>
<connor> serves are godliness yeah yeah like they </connor>
<connor> specialize in soft surf and it's it's it </connor>
<connor> goes hard but finding it but like mini </connor>
<joey> stops are like the ssrs yeah </joey>
<connor> i think in tokyo i think it's only like </connor>
<joey> 0.5 percent of companies in tokyo are </joey>
<connor> mini stops most of them i feel like are </connor>
<connor> around like shinjuku weirdly i see a lot </connor>
<joey> yeah i know there's one like up north </joey>
<connor> where i used to live but that was very </connor>
<connor> rare they get though i was very happy i </connor>
<joey> lived near a mini stop i was like oh yes </joey>
<garnt> i've pulled the ssr let's go babies </garnt>
<garnt> so much just so you're supposed to </garnt>
<connor> choice with food and how about however </connor>
<garnt> much you want to spend you can spend </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i guess we've gotten a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the basic things out of the way of like </garnt>
<garnt> your first visit to japan what if what </garnt>
<garnt> if someone has a little bit more time </garnt>
<garnt> and has been to japan a few times where </garnt>
<garnt> would you guys recommend that they go to </garnt>
<joey> well i mean i you know we did this the </joey>
<garnt> shima nami kaido which is on the cycling </garnt>
<garnt> special honestly </garnt>
<garnt> like that inland sea area is [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> beautiful gorgeous [ __ ] incredible </garnt>
<garnt> and i've really really since the cycling </garnt>
<garnt> special i really want to go back there </garnt>
<garnt> like i really want to go back there and </garnt>
<garnt> do the route again basically just just </garnt>
<garnt> look at the spike this just look at the </garnt>
<garnt> cycling special and just look how </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] beautiful it was because the </joey>
<joey> best thing about it is that like you </joey>
<garnt> have you know all of like hiroshima </garnt>
<garnt> that's near there you have right next to </garnt>
<garnt> that there's a prefecture called okayama </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh where i went there for a video </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> there's this like little small town </garnt>
<garnt> called kuroshki which is like this </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] cool retro style town </garnt>
<joey> that's just basically just like this </joey>
<garnt> hill that overlooks the inland sea and </garnt>
<joey> it's so [ __ ] gorgeous and then if you </joey>
<joey> want to cross that inland sea and go to </joey>
<garnt> like shikoku uh yeah you have places </garnt>
<garnt> like ehime which is really like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> down to earth and like kind of chill </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<connor> not the most it's not the most exciting </connor>
<joey> thing but like if you're a little bored </joey>
<joey> of like yeah if you're a little bored of </joey>
<joey> like the kind of whole city life of </joey>
<joey> tokyo and stuff like that in the main </joey>
<joey> cities uh that's really really nice yeah </joey>
<garnt> and if uh if watching the cycling </garnt>
<garnt> special kind of like intimidated you uh </garnt>
<garnt> don't worry you don't need to do the </garnt>
<garnt> entire route in a day um if i was to do </garnt>
<joey> it again i would definitely not do it in </joey>
<joey> a day you can also rent a car just drive </joey>
<garnt> across you can also rent a car but if </garnt>
<garnt> you also want to keep healthy you know </garnt>
<garnt> keep keep </garnt>
<garnt> you know work out those muscles then i </garnt>
<garnt> do actually highly i highly recommend </garnt>
<joey> the cycling route um i highly recommend </joey>
<joey> you doing that in uh two days maybe </joey>
<joey> three days you know how well if </joey>
<joey> now that you think back what was what do </joey>
<joey> you think is like the optimal time you </joey>
<garnt> would recommend i would call that a day </garnt>
<joey> we still do in a day yeah i reckon if i </joey>
<joey> didn't want to be hurting i'd say at </joey>
<connor> least two days i think it was just </connor>
<connor> annoying because we were filming i think </connor>
<connor> it would have been not pretty fun if you </connor>
<joey> could just power up there's a couple of </joey>
<joey> like the islands in between where </joey>
<joey> admittedly there isn't a whole lot going </joey>
<joey> on but like the first couple of islands </joey>
<joey> uh you know that's like closer to like </joey>
<garnt> hiroshima there's like still a really </garnt>
<garnt> like cool like town vibe to it and you </garnt>
<garnt> know there's like a lot of like cool </garnt>
<connor> beaches there as well so if you go yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's like there's some genuinely </connor>
<connor> nice beaches there's a fit you are i </connor>
<connor> guess if you really aren't fit at all i </connor>
<joey> wouldn't yeah maybe just stick to the </joey>
<joey> first island yeah yeah yeah but you know </joey>
<joey> if you're somewhat active and you you </joey>
<connor> know you'll have no problem cycling then </connor>
<connor> yeah i'd just do it on one day it's very </connor>
<joey> you can also just cycle around hiroshima </joey>
<garnt> as well yeah yeah i mean honestly it's </garnt>
<garnt> like some of the most beautiful views </garnt>
<garnt> i've had in japan yeah i'm not saying a </garnt>
<garnt> lot because a lot of japan is photogenic </garnt>
<garnt> as [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> so it's a bit unfair i mean i i guess </connor>
<connor> sticking on that vein um if you want to </connor>
<connor> go see mount fuji um i do recommend </connor>
<connor> going to one of the lakes around there i </connor>
<garnt> can't remember the name exactly but like </garnt>
<garnt> school how good should you go </garnt>
<garnt> like we like lake kawaguchiko is just </garnt>
<garnt> like you can also cycle around there you </garnt>
<garnt> can rent a bike me and you've </garnt>
<garnt> gone on a date where we've rented the </garnt>
<garnt> bike and just cycled around the entire </garnt>
<garnt> lake </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of unfair where you go to a </garnt>
<garnt> place and everything looks photoshopped </garnt>
<garnt> even though it's real like you you take </garnt>
<garnt> a picture there we've taken a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> pictures there i don't know we've uh </garnt>
<garnt> when the last time we went there was the </garnt>
<garnt> uh we went camping right when we went </garnt>
<garnt> camping yeah and luke took a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> pictures and we took a bunch of pictures </garnt>
<connor> and everyone took a bunch of pictures </connor>
<connor> and nowhere </connor>
<joey> i know and no matter what it was </joey>
<garnt> impossible to take a bad picture it just </garnt>
<connor> looked like a postcard especially when </connor>
<connor> it's clear yeah yeah yeah yeah which it </connor>
<joey> was when we went very lucky yeah but um </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know because like i </connor>
<connor> remember when we did the journey across </connor>
<joey> japan two to mount fuji yeah a lot of </joey>
<joey> people thought that by the end of it we </joey>
<joey> had just like green screened ourselves </joey>
<joey> in front of it because it just looked </joey>
<garnt> that good it's it's it's so weird being </garnt>
<garnt> in that place and you just like i </garnt>
<garnt> literally look like </garnt>
<joey> i let you feel like i'm looking at the </joey>
<joey> green screen or like it's this is a this </joey>
<garnt> is a screen saver right like a desktop </garnt>
<connor> yeah i'm looking at a screen saying i'm </connor>
<connor> waiting for the pipes animation to see </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's it's so surreal that a place </garnt>
<garnt> can look that photogenic but just exist </garnt>
<joey> in real life without any uh without any </joey>
<garnt> plug-ins or any uh any photoshop edits </garnt>
<connor> on no yeah yeah yeah no rtx on well it's </connor>
<joey> probably one of the places you might </joey>
<connor> want to drive though it's kind of </connor>
<joey> annoying to go by train and stuff yeah </joey>
<joey> there isn't a whole lot of traffic i'd </joey>
<joey> say like outside of the major cities </joey>
<joey> like osaka um tokyo sapporo and stuff </joey>
<joey> like that um driving this driving is </joey>
<connor> your best friend you literally like </connor>
<garnt> you'll have such a hard time if you're </garnt>
<garnt> trying to do it by public transport as </garnt>
<joey> i'm sure </joey>
<connor> probably is uh experience because you </connor>
<garnt> only do all by public transport yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah actually uh on that vein i guess an </garnt>
<connor> app i highly recommend uh is the app </connor>
<connor> that we use is a dd </connor>
<joey> which um there are there is like a few </joey>
<connor> taxi apps in japan uh </connor>
<joey> taxi but uh dd is the most i guess </joey>
<joey> foreigner friendly because it's you can </joey>
<joey> uh full english so it's all english so </joey>
<garnt> except for any card yeah it will accept </garnt>
<garnt> any card with with other apps it's been </garnt>
<garnt> really finicky with the types of cards </garnt>
<connor> that it will accept japan taxi and go </connor>
<garnt> taxi whatever it is now oh yeah god it </garnt>
<connor> is i have a japanese card and she keeps </connor>
<connor> denying it really i have a japanese card </connor>
<connor> it denies it i have it so annoying i </connor>
<connor> have a foreign card it denies it i have </connor>
<connor> like cards from like </connor>
<connor> like thailand and the uk and it's just </connor>
<connor> like it doesn't want to accept anything </connor>
<connor> it doesn't accept anything so i don't </connor>
<connor> know what card it will accept </connor>
<connor> um so yeah i like highly recommend dd </connor>
<connor> over uber here would you say sorry </connor>
<connor> because i know you can use uber if you </connor>
<connor> want yeah you can use uber but uh </connor>
<connor> whatever you're comfortable with yeah i </connor>
<connor> think i think dd is i think there's more </connor>
<connor> taxis on dd um yeah and it's and it's </connor>
<joey> the best in between because dd is not as </joey>
<joey> popular as a japanese app like go taxi </joey>
<garnt> but it is still way more friendly if you </garnt>
<joey> unfortunately uber is just not really a </joey>
<joey> thing here no uber uber ubereats is but </joey>
<garnt> like the actual uber i know i know some </garnt>
<garnt> people who use it religiously yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> but mainly for food i guess yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> also hailing cabs is really really easy </connor>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> especially in tokyo if you you know if </joey>
<joey> you're confident enough and just telling </joey>
<joey> them where to go uh it's really easy </joey>
<garnt> yeah obviously that's a big if yeah i </garnt>
<joey> understand it's at all but i think for </joey>
<joey> the most part if you're in tokyo the </joey>
<joey> train system is just so convenient you </joey>
<garnt> probably google very rarely will have to </garnt>
<garnt> don't try to learn the maps just use </garnt>
<garnt> google maps yeah it's pretty simple it </garnt>
<garnt> routes it out for </garnt>
<garnt> is absolutely lying google literally </garnt>
<garnt> knows the best route i'm i'm i wish that </garnt>
<garnt> people would shut up being like i know </garnt>
<connor> the streets better no you don't google </connor>
<connor> google has every [ __ ] satellite in </connor>
<connor> existence and billions of data it knows </connor>
<joey> whether to be fair there has been times </joey>
<joey> where i've looked at google and i'm like </joey>
<joey> nah dude you're going you're gonna like </joey>
<joey> deal you're gonna like the aesthetic </joey>
<connor> route sometimes sometimes google wants </connor>
<connor> to like make your life easier to a point </connor>
<connor> where it's like listen it's just quicker </connor>
<joey> if i just walk yeah yeah yeah they're </joey>
<joey> like no no we're gonna make it so you </joey>
<joey> don't walk it um </joey>
<joey> yeah but generally for if you're only </joey>
<joey> getting you're gonna have to change </joey>
<joey> three different trains if you wanna get </joey>
<joey> a to z google will generally tell you </joey>
<joey> the best way and you could tell it to </joey>
<joey> fewer changes or more changes </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's i've it's never failed me in </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo yeah even outside of tokyo i'm </garnt>
<connor> driving i use it for driving i use it i </connor>
<connor> bought one of those shitty little things </connor>
<connor> on amazon that you stick on like the air </connor>
<garnt> fans oh yeah yeah phone hold your phone </garnt>
<garnt> yeah man yeah it's good i'm good </garnt>
<garnt> is there any other places you guys would </garnt>
<connor> recommend a bit out of the box </connor>
<connor> i've never been to kyushu i already </connor>
<garnt> think joey is good kyushu is great uh i </garnt>
<joey> i think kyushu is underrated as hell </joey>
<garnt> yeah um i one place i really really </garnt>
<garnt> liked in kyushu was um kumamoto yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah where aso is the volcano mount also </connor>
<connor> is yeah but like i think kumamoto is </connor>
<connor> really cool because it's like it's again </connor>
<connor> this like huge like volcanic caldera but </connor>
<connor> it's also like it weirdly reminds me a </connor>
<connor> lot of like the kind of like plain uh </connor>
<connor> open plain places that i went to a lot </connor>
<garnt> in like australia and like in england </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that yeah it doesn't look </garnt>
<garnt> like japan right and it's so weird but </garnt>
<garnt> like it's really really cool if you like </garnt>
<garnt> your like kind of mountainous areas it's </garnt>
<garnt> really dope and also you're really close </garnt>
<garnt> to like nagasaki as well which is a </garnt>
<garnt> really dope city um nagasaki is a super </garnt>
<garnt> cool city that's like very like vintage </garnt>
<garnt> feel it has like a very european feel as </garnt>
<connor> well because like a lot of the a lot of </connor>
<joey> like european settlers came in and out </joey>
<connor> of nagasaki um </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know kyushu i think is </connor>
<garnt> really underrated has some really good </garnt>
<garnt> food as well as one of the game yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's really cool yeah i still haven't </garnt>
<garnt> been to kyushu as well you can go to as </garnt>
<connor> well which has the other really massive </connor>
<connor> onsen area </connor>
<garnt> mean to hiroshima it's like five hours </garnt>
<garnt> all right </garnt>
<garnt> and that's not even in kyushu yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean like i guess one place </garnt>
<garnt> that i don't really hear people talking </garnt>
<garnt> about is obviously like if you're a wine </garnt>
<connor> lover like me and sydney are uh you can </connor>
<connor> go to the wine capital of japan even </connor>
<connor> though like wines not as well known here </connor>
<connor> but i mean we discovered the place </connor>
<garnt> because we're not like i'm not a big </garnt>
<connor> sake fan </connor>
<garnt> i'm not a massive sake fan but there are </garnt>
<garnt> plenty of places to try sake in tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> and basically anywhere you go into japan </garnt>
<garnt> but if you want to have a little taste </garnt>
<joey> of the japanese wine culture here </joey>
<joey> because it's not very well talked about </joey>
<joey> you go to koshu valley it's in the </joey>
<joey> yamanashi prefecture which is like you </joey>
<joey> can literally make it a day trip oh you </joey>
<joey> wanted to um it's like just about like </joey>
<joey> an hour an hour and a half out of tokyo </joey>
<joey> uh you can literally just go on on the </joey>
<joey> jr line and go to </joey>
<joey> go to the stops around kosher valley um </joey>
<joey> there is one place i do recommend if you </joey>
<joey> are interested uh i believe the building </joey>
<joey> is called budo budonooka i think </joey>
<joey> yeah um great hill yeah yeah great grave </joey>
<joey> hill um i believe that's the place uh </joey>
<joey> because that's the place i've talked </joey>
<joey> about before where you can go in and </joey>
<connor> they have a wine cellar with about a </connor>
<connor> hundred different wines you pay 13 bucks </connor>
<connor> and you can try as many wines as you </connor>
<connor> like and uh </connor>
<connor> it's self poor they give you they give </connor>
<connor> you a they give you a little cup and uh </connor>
<connor> you can try as many ones as you like </connor>
<joey> there's there's little bowls where you </joey>
<joey> can spit out the wine if you don't like </joey>
<joey> the taste of the wine you know </joey>
<joey> um actually just 13 bucks to get mounted </joey>
<joey> on wine yeah i've done it i've done it </joey>
<joey> plenty of [ __ ] times it's a really </joey>
<joey> really good experience and then there's </joey>
<joey> a really nice restaurant up there um </joey>
<joey> where you can see the entire view of </joey>
<joey> koshi valley and you can see all the </joey>
<joey> grape farms and all the grape vines </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it doesn't look like japan yeah it's </joey>
<joey> it's it's got such a good [ __ ] view </joey>
<garnt> um and me and cindy go in there for a </garnt>
<garnt> yearly trip uh to try out the different </garnt>
<connor> wines there that come out every year </connor>
<connor> yeah you can i i think i drove there in </connor>
<connor> this decent parking but if you do like </connor>
<joey> sake i would recommend niigato you got </joey>
<connor> to ah yeah is like the capital of sake </connor>
<connor> and like rice fields and stuff yeah i </connor>
<joey> went to a similar </joey>
<joey> thing like to the winery except it was </joey>
<joey> all sake </joey>
<connor> for like 20 bucks and you could like </connor>
<connor> taste test yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> it's basically like all throughout </connor>
<joey> niigata it's just like all really really </joey>
<connor> nice like sake based on something </connor>
<connor> to it yeah so if you like sake go to </connor>
<joey> niigata if you like wine go to yamaha </joey>
<connor> but also in the negative vending </connor>
<connor> machines the there's </connor>
<joey> it's like nectar of the gods </joey>
<connor> it's wonderful it's just like </connor>
<joey> sugary goodness oh it's so good it's </joey>
<garnt> very good it's so bad for you though </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like 100 sugar watching yume is a </garnt>
<garnt> bit too sweet for my palate otherwise i </garnt>
<garnt> probably would like i couldn't drink it </garnt>
<garnt> straight but like you know you're mixing </garnt>
<connor> it up like soda yeah yeah i mean </connor>
