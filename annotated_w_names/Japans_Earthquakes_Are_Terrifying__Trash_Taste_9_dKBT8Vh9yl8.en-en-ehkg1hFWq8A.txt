<connor> - I love Daft Punk. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, wow, the noise sounds nice. </connor>
<connor> Like I like the noise, you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> Is that weird? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Is that weird? </joey>
<connor> - Yes, it is weird. </connor>
<joey> - Am I weird? - It is very weird, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I know I think you just basically described music </connor>
<audio> in the most like, bare bones monkey brain terms. </audio>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It is a bunch of noises put together. </garnt>
<audio> (upbeat music) </audio>
<garnt> - Do your parents like, watch "Trash Taste"? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they comment on every little thing you do now? </garnt>
<connor> - My mum told me that like, to stop putting </connor>
<garnt> my hand near my face </garnt>
<garnt> and for the past like five episodes I've tried </garnt>
<connor> to avoid putting my hands anywhere near my mouth. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, my mum's like, "Oh you wore shorts this episode. </garnt>
<connor> The entire world knows you're wearing shorts this episode, </connor>
<connor> by the way, why are you wearing shorts?" </connor>
<connor> - How does she know that? </connor>
<connor> Your legs don't show. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know either </connor>
<garnt> but apparently on camera they showed it </garnt>
<connor> when I sat on this side, so. </connor>
<connor> - She's like, "Enhance, enhance." </connor>
<garnt> My mum gave me shit whenever I was saying </garnt>
<garnt> that British food is awful, </garnt>
<garnt> you know. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I was neglected growing up </garnt>
<audio> 'cause I was fed beans on toast often. </audio>
<audio> It's true though, mum. </audio>
<connor> But anyway, welcome to this episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> I'm your boy, Connor. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I forgot what I'm supposed to say. </connor>
<connor> - I'm your boy. </connor>
<connor> - I'm your boy because I couldn't figure </connor>
<connor> the rest of the words. </connor>
<connor> - It's your boy. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm with the boy, </connor>
<connor> that's it. </connor>
<connor> And the other boy. </connor>
<joey> - And together we are "The Boys". </joey>
<joey> - "The Boys". </joey>
<joey> That was, had to be one of the best intros. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I just, you know, when you're like auto-piloting the intro </connor>
<connor> and then you just realize halfway through </connor>
<connor> that you're auto-piloting the intro, </connor>
<connor> and then you're like taking it over </connor>
<connor> and you're like, oh wait, I should have just auto-piloted. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like, being on a podcast, </garnt>
<garnt> normally if I'm having a normal conversation sometimes </garnt>
<audio> and I know like, sometimes I know when I start a sentence, </audio>
<audio> I know how I'm gonna end the sentence </audio>
<audio> but when you're on a podcast, </audio>
<audio> you always have to finish the sentence </audio>
<garnt> even if you kind of realize halfway through </garnt>
<joey> that you're not making any sense. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I'm just like, okay, I'm gonna have to say something </joey>
<joey> because I've been silent for the past two minutes </joey>
<joey> but I don't know how to start it or how to end it, </joey>
<joey> where this is going. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you're right, you're right. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - So gentlemen, I thought, considering </connor>
<connor> I believe we all watched "Japan Sinks" recently. </connor>
<garnt> - That was a nice little coinkydink there. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And we all watched it separately, </connor>
<garnt> I didn't know you guys were watching it. </garnt>
<connor> - We didn't make an effort to all watch it. </connor>
<connor> We all just like, oh, we all just watched... </connor>
<joey> - We all just turned on Netflix </joey>
<joey> and was like, "Oh, okay it's on, cool." </joey>
<garnt> - And it came out recently at the time of recording </garnt>
<garnt> but so by the time you are seeing this might not be. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it was only like, three or four days ago. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Something like that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah for us but-- </connor>
<audio> - So to explain what "Japan Sinks" is </audio>
<audio> since we're gonna be doing </audio>
<audio> some kind of discussion around it, </audio>
<audio> it's the new Masaaki Yuasa anime </audio>
<audio> that was released on Netflix </audio>
<garnt> and it's basically about a giant earthquake </garnt>
<garnt> that happens in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and after that earthquake happened, </garnt>
<garnt> Japan starts sinking I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so for people living in Japan, </joey>
<joey> it is anxiety the anime, essentially. </joey>
<connor> - Dude, okay, first of all before we get into talking it, </connor>
<connor> in the very first episode they play the actual-- </connor>
<connor> - The sound they played. </connor>
<connor> The earthquake sound. </connor>
<joey> (alarm blares) </joey>
<garnt> This sound that you're hearing here. </garnt>
<joey> - Did we like, I don't know if it's just me. </joey>
<connor> - I checked my phone immediately. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I checked my phone. </joey>
<connor> I was like, where's my phone? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And I turned that shit down 'cause I was like, </connor>
<connor> Fuck, what if my neighbors hear? </connor>
<garnt> And start freaking out like, they're gonna think </garnt>
<garnt> there's an actual earthquake. </garnt>
<garnt> They're elderly you know, below me </garnt>
<garnt> but that made me shit myself. </garnt>
<connor> - That gave me so much anxiety. </connor>
<joey> - The first episode of them portraying </joey>
<joey> the earthquake happening, </joey>
<joey> I was really impressed at how realistic it felt. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I probably would have reacted the exact same way </connor>
<connor> as all the characters, right. </connor>
<connor> You know when you hear that earthquake notification now </connor>
<connor> and then you just kind of block it out, </connor>
<connor> oh whatever, it's probably a small earthquake. </connor>
<connor> 'cause once you've been through </connor>
<garnt> about 10 earthquakes in Japan-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Which you will. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, which you will. </garnt>
<garnt> You just hear this notification </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like another day of the-- </garnt>
<joey> - Unfortunately though, every time at least I have heard </joey>
<joey> that notification, it's never been </joey>
<garnt> the case of, whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> it's probably just a small earthquake, </garnt>
<garnt> because it always happens at like five in the morning </garnt>
<garnt> and it's the thing I wake up to. </garnt>
<garnt> Imagine just having, </garnt>
<garnt> you're just having a nice sleep wherever you are </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like 4:30 in the morning </garnt>
<garnt> and then suddenly you hear </garnt>
<garnt> this absolutely anxiety-inducing alarm </garnt>
<garnt> because you just hear the siren </garnt>
<garnt> but they don't say like, if it's strong </garnt>
<garnt> or if it's weak. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just says brace yourself. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Just basically brace yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor imitates alarm) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hold on to your bike, it might be strong </garnt>
<joey> and I already hate waking up to the sound of an alarm </joey>
<connor> but when it's an alarm where it's like, oh I might die, </connor>
<connor> then it's the worst. </connor>
<connor> I had, I was enjoying the first episode so much </connor>
<connor> because again, there was this, you know, as you said, </connor>
<joey> it's a really realistic portrayal </joey>
<joey> but the moment I hear that sound, I just, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't get anxiety often but-- </joey>
<connor> - I went like the Caveman SpongeBob meme. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And they do it like three times. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, stop doing this. </connor>
<connor> Please use a like, parody noise or something like... </connor>
<joey> - Could you imagine though like, </joey>
<connor> especially in that first episode, you know, </connor>
<connor> when that second big wave hits. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Do you think something like that is going to happen? </joey>
<connor> - Well, in the, it's like a lot of, </connor>
<connor> again, I should have done research for this episode </connor>
<connor> but I swear there's been a few scientific predictions </connor>
<joey> that are like, there's gonna be </joey>
<joey> a mega quake within like 30 or 50 years. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Something like that. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there has to be, right. </joey>
<joey> Because I mean the fucking planets, not planets, </joey>
<audio> the countries all Pangaead away, right. </audio>
<audio> That doesn't just happen. - [Garnt] Right, right. </audio>
<audio> - There has to be stuff that's moving constantly. </audio>
<garnt> So inevitably something big is gonna happen. </garnt>
<connor> - Inevitably, whether it's in our lifetime </connor>
<connor> or like, our children's lifetime </connor>
<connor> or fucking great, great, great grandchildren's lifetime, </connor>
<connor> it's gonna happen some way. </connor>
<connor> - Like a mega quake, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like a mega quake, you know. </connor>
<connor> It's an interesting idea to explore </connor>
<garnt> that there's probably gonna be </garnt>
<joey> some massive kind of event that's gonna happen </joey>
<joey> some time in the-- </joey>
<joey> - Because is there like, I don't know about, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure Thailand has earthquakes, right. </joey>
<garnt> - Not really. - [Joey] Oh really? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, Japan is literally on the fault line. </connor>
<connor> Like, the whole country's on the fault line. </connor>
<connor> - Like, do you guys remember </connor>
<garnt> your very first earthquake experience? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that was okay, we're from the UK. </joey>
<garnt> Like, it is literally the safest place on earth. </garnt>
<joey> - I was about to say, you guys don't get earthquakes, right? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, we're like the furthest away </garnt>
<garnt> from any fault line of like any country... </garnt>
<garnt> - We were like, natural disasters in the UK </garnt>
<connor> is like, non existent. </connor>
<connor> - It's like running out of tea. </connor>
<connor> - Like in England, England is so fucking safe. </connor>
<garnt> You have to try really hard to get yourself killed </garnt>
<garnt> in England by nature. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you really do have to go out of your way. </connor>
<audio> - Yeah, because Australia, we don't have earthquakes at all </audio>
<audio> or anything like that. </audio>
<garnt> - But everything else will just kill you. </garnt>
<audio> - Yeah, but we have you know, bush fires </audio>
<garnt> and stuff like that and of course our animals </garnt>
<connor> are just out for blood </connor>
<joey> but you guys don't even have dangerous animals, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, we don't. </joey>
<connor> - That's why I'm convinced there's so many like, </connor>
<connor> famous British explorers because they must </connor>
<connor> have been so fucking bored of the UK. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like, "Oh, it's another fucking squirrel, </connor>
<connor> who'd have thought?" </connor>
<garnt> - Like, "It's a bigger squirrel." </garnt>
<garnt> - Talking to Americans and Canadians who go camping </garnt>
<audio> and they have to worry about bears and stuff like that. </audio>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember going camping in England </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, oh yeah, I guess we have </connor>
<garnt> to worry about deers. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, deers can be dangerous. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like the biggest worry in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> is how much alcohol do I bring? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Like how much alcohol is the right amount of alcohol? </joey>
<joey> - How much alcohol and toilet paper do I bring? </joey>
<joey> - That's always the worry </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like, I've got to carry two liters of water, </joey>
<garnt> 10 liters of alcohol. </garnt>
<garnt> So we gotta like try and balance this out somehow. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I remember my very first earthquake </connor>
<audio> experience, wasn't in Japan, </audio>
<audio> it was actually in America during AX28. </audio>
<audio> - [Connor] Oh yeah. - Oh, last year? </audio>
<garnt> - AX 28, well not last year now. </garnt>
<connor> Oh no, it is last year. </connor>
<connor> - Last year, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah last year's AX, so 2019 AX </connor>
<audio> and I remember, I remember-- </audio>
<audio> - That was your first one? </audio>
<audio> - Yeah, that was my very first one. </audio>
<joey> - Yeah, that was my first one as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So yeah, to explain, when we were at AX last year, </joey>
<joey> we went through a magnitude, is it seven earthquake? </joey>
<joey> - It was six or seven. </joey>
<connor> - But it was far away, so it wasn't awful </connor>
<connor> but it was still, I mean, we were... </connor>
<garnt> - It still is the strongest earthquake I've been in. </garnt>
<connor> even after moving Japan </connor>
<connor> and I remember I was on like the 64th floor or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we all were. </connor>
<connor> - And it was like, such a humbling experience </connor>
<audio> because at first I didn't know what was going on. </audio>
<audio> 'Cause I remember standing up and I felt a bit dizzy </audio>
<joey> and I was like, what the fuck's going on? </joey>
<joey> Am I just like really fatigued, </joey>
<joey> am I hung over, what's going on? </joey>
<joey> So I go up to the window, right. </joey>
<garnt> Just imagine you're going up </garnt>
<garnt> to the window on the 64th floor of a skyscraper </garnt>
<garnt> and then you look down </garnt>
<garnt> and then you see the fucking building just shift like that </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just like this. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like I immediately, I've never felt vertical so fast </garnt>
<garnt> and I immediately just pinned myself against the wall, </garnt>
<garnt> just being like, shit, shit, this is an earthquake. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm surprised you had the balls to go towards the window. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I didn't know it was an earthquake. </garnt>
<garnt> I just thought I was just dizzy or drunk or something. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, the first one 'cause there was like, </connor>
<connor> three that weekend, was there? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, there was two. </connor>
<joey> - There was two in the, it was in the same day, wasn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, so the first one, </connor>
<connor> I was in the elevator while it was happening. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - And the elevator was shaking a lot more than I thought </connor>
<joey> it should have been shaking and I'm pretty sure there was </joey>
<joey> a Japanese woman in there who was from one of the stands </joey>
<joey> and she looked fucking terrified and I was like, </joey>
<connor> we're nearly near the bottom, I'm sure it will be fine. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> We're like 10 floors, I'm sure we got this </connor>
<joey> but then the second one was I was with you. That was so fun. </joey>
<joey> - Do you wanna tell that story? </joey>
<connor> - You should tell it, you should. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, okay, so the second earthquake that happened, </joey>
<joey> I think it was only maybe a couple </joey>
<joey> of hours after, wasn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I think it was like-- </connor>
<connor> - I think we just rushed to your hotel room </connor>
<joey> 'cause I was busy. - That's right, that's right. </joey>
<connor> - That was like, that night. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was you, me, Arcy and our friend, Navi </garnt>
<garnt> and we were just chilling in a hotel room, </garnt>
<connor> we were just talking about </connor>
<connor> what were we gonna do that night </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think it was the-- </connor>
<garnt> - We were going to go to a party. </garnt>
<garnt> - We were gonna go to a party </garnt>
<garnt> and so we were just chilling before the party started </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, the second earthquake comes through </garnt>
<garnt> and it was, I think it was </garnt>
<joey> stronger than the first one, wasn't it? </joey>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - Something like that but either way, very strongly, </joey>
<joey> at least magnitude six from what I remember. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it was the 7.1 that earthquake. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think that was the seven, wasn't it? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and of course it was an earthquake, I'm used to it, </joey>
<audio> obviously everybody else wasn't. </audio>
<audio> So we quickly ran out and we were at the </audio>
<garnt> very, very top of it, I think it was like the 68th </garnt>
<joey> or 69th floor or something of that hotel and, </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> and even amidst all the panic, </garnt>
<connor> Connor and my friend Navi, they were eating a... </connor>
<connor> - I was eating Chick-fil-A. </connor>
<connor> - Chick-fil-A like, (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Chick-fil-A nuggets and Connor and Navi just kind of looked </connor>
<connor> at each other and went, well, if I'm gonna die, </connor>
<joey> might as well finish off these nuggets. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Like everyone was panicking. </connor>
<connor> I remember there was literally </connor>
<connor> that like stereotypical American family, </connor>
<connor> it was one like, white guy with three daughters, </connor>
<connor> he's like, "Get down to the floor, </connor>
<connor> get down to the bottom floor daughters, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna direct you." </connor>
<connor> And I'm there with like, my nuggets walking past him </connor>
<connor> slowly like, I mean, it's fine. </connor>
<connor> I got about, yeah, go on, go on. </connor>
<garnt> - If I'm gonna die, at least I'm gonna die </garnt>
<garnt> with nugs in my hands. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - We were like, rushing down the stairs, </connor>
<connor> we got like 20 floors down </connor>
<connor> and I was like, I'm not, you know what, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to do any more physical exercise. </connor>
<connor> I think, I think I've done enough, so. </connor>
<connor> I did a move, which is probably not a pro gamer move. </connor>
<connor> I was like, you know what, </connor>
<connor> the shaking stopped like two minutes ago. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna get the elevator. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> There is 50 more floors and I would rather die literally, </connor>
<connor> than get these stairs and I went to the elevator </connor>
<garnt> but the weird configuration of this hotel, </garnt>
<garnt> you had to go back to the top. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, to go down again, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that means then I was like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> well the elevators are still working. </garnt>
<garnt> They should have been stopped, they were still working. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> so I go back from the 50th floor, which I just walked out </garnt>
<joey> from the 70th to the 50th, I walked all the way down </joey>
<joey> and I was like, okay, I'm going to go back up </joey>
<joey> to the 70th floor. </joey>
<joey> I go to get the elevator to go all the way down </joey>
<joey> and they're blocking it off. </joey>
<joey> They're like, you can't go until it's safe </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Meanwhile our other friend was just like, fuck it, </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna walk all the way down. </connor>
<connor> He sprinted all the way down </connor>
<connor> and he's just waiting at the bottom </connor>
<joey> and he calls me, he's like, "Are you guys alive?" </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I convinced them, I'm like, </connor>
<joey> listen guys, you guys can keep walking. </joey>
<joey> I'm getting the elevator </joey>
<joey> and then they were like, "Okay, well we'll come." </joey>
<joey> - No, I came with you, I remember. </joey>
<connor> I was like, well, great, we're back. </connor>
<joey> I guess we ran down 20 floors for no reason. </joey>
<connor> - It was so scary though 'cause I remember I was a little, </connor>
<connor> I wasn't worried because you know, the doors were closing </connor>
<connor> and opening on their own. </connor>
<audio> I thought that's okay, I can deal with that. </audio>
<audio> What I didn't like, anticipate was </audio>
<audio> when I looked out the building, </audio>
<garnt> I could literally see the building opposite us, </garnt>
<garnt> we were going like this. </garnt>
<garnt> We were like parallaxing </garnt>
<connor> and I was like, oh that's not right. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> That's not good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like buildings shouldn't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> No, 'cause I remember it was like, to me, </garnt>
<garnt> it was a really humbling experience. </garnt>
<garnt> Just at that moment, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> my life is not in my own hands. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, if this building collapses, </garnt>
<garnt> there is literally nothing I can do </garnt>
<joey> 'cause you know when you feel like something bad happens, </joey>
<joey> you feel like you have some, some kind of control. </joey>
<joey> Like you might see a car coming and you think, </joey>
<joey> maybe I can jump out of the way of this. </joey>
<joey> There was like, if the building was just not designed, </joey>
<joey> like logically I knew this building was </joey>
<joey> designed to withstand earthquakes </joey>
<joey> but in my heart I was like, okay at this moment, </joey>
<connor> I'm just putting my faith in the engineers </connor>
<connor> and the builders that they've done </connor>
<connor> their job fucking correctly, </connor>
<connor> 'cause if they haven't, I'm dead. </connor>
<connor> And there's literally nothing I can do about it </connor>
<connor> and I guess that was like a first for me, you know. </connor>
<garnt> I'd never been in that kind of situation where I had just, </garnt>
<garnt> my life was in the hands of like completely something, </garnt>
<garnt> some other external-- </garnt>
<garnt> - To be fair, I've experienced </garnt>
<joey> a lot of earthquakes in my life but </joey>
<joey> being on the 69th, 70th floor was different at first for me. </joey>
<connor> You know, I've been on, you know, apart, I've been </connor>
<connor> in apartment buildings that are like 10, 20 floors high </connor>
<connor> and that was still scary because again </connor>
<connor> the whole thing is shaking. </connor>
<connor> I have to keep telling myself it's good that it's shaking, </connor>
<connor> it's good that it's shaking. </connor>
<connor> But my first I think the scariest earthquake </connor>
<joey> experience I had was it was in Japan obviously </joey>
<joey> and it was up North where my grandma lives. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And it was where, you know the giant earthquake </joey>
<connor> of 2011 hit essentially. </connor>
<connor> So that is, that plays like a hotspot </connor>
<connor> of massive earthquakes. </connor>
<connor> And, and I was there, I was in some kind of like </connor>
<connor> DVD rental place. </connor>
<connor> There's like a really old DVD rental place </connor>
<connor> near there with my sister </connor>
<connor> and suddenly I think it was like </connor>
<connor> a magnitude seven and a half. </connor>
<joey> Something like that, really, really big. </joey>
<joey> It was so big in fact that all </joey>
<joey> of the DVDs and books on the shelves just flew out. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> - And me and I had to like grab my sister's hand </joey>
<joey> and just fucking get the hell out of there. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - And, but we couldn't go all the way out </joey>
<joey> because the shop assistant was like, </joey>
<joey> "Don't go out into the street." </joey>
<audio> because if a sheet falls, then you're dead. </audio>
<audio> - [Connor] Yeah. </audio>
<audio> - So we had to kind of stand in the doorframe of the shop </audio>
<connor> and just kind of wait for it to settle down. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, that was definitely a little scary because </connor>
<joey> it being on the, I thought being on a building was scary, </joey>
<audio> being on the ground for like on the street, </audio>
<connor> in something that big is really scary. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause people are running out </joey>
<joey> and I thought that's kind of dumb </joey>
<joey> 'cause the building's really safe. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And running out you don't know what could like. </joey>
<joey> - Could fall on you. - Exactly, </joey>
<garnt> if a traffic light or a, you know a street light </garnt>
<joey> falls on you, then, you know. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's just, it's that sense of control. </garnt>
<joey> You know, they think you have, even though </joey>
<garnt> statistically you, you are actually safer in the building. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the buildings are designed at least the newer ones, </connor>
<connor> I think like, I mean that a really big hotel </connor>
<connor> and it's mainly designed for like 13 magnitude earthquake. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - They're pretty steady. </connor>
<connor> - Speaking of sense of control though </connor>
<joey> the characters in "Japan Sinks" have none. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God, can we go back to that? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, are we gonna spoil things, </joey>
<connor> this gonna be the first spoiler warning that we need to do. </connor>
<joey> - We have had a spoiler warning before. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, well there'll be a spoiler warning on screen. </connor>
<connor> We're gonna spoil things, I guess. </connor>
<joey> - It's only 10 episodes, it's on Netflix, </joey>
<joey> go watch it, it's great. </joey>
<connor> - If you don't care about being spoiled, feel free to watch. </connor>
<connor> I hate the main girl so much. </connor>
<connor> I could not stand her. </connor>
<joey> - I don't mind her at first but then when she started </joey>
<joey> to get a bit wingy later on, </joey>
<garnt> - Can I, can I just to get my to get </garnt>
<garnt> my opinions out of the way, </garnt>
<garnt> what'd you guys think of the series overall? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm glad that we finally have some </connor>
<connor> good propaganda for YouTubers, </connor>
<audio> like is I'm glad that we need more YouTube propaganda. </audio>
<audio> YouTube is a good guys. </audio>
<garnt> - We need more YouTube, characters. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm so glad and I was like, wow </garnt>
<garnt> he's a YouTuber and he's not an asshole, this is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no 'cause, cause. - This is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so there's a character in, </garnt>
<garnt> in "Japan Sinks" that is just a YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> and he's a YouTuber who's a fucking superhuman </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he can do everything. </garnt>
<connor> - He's mad... - Why did he get a tank from? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) Where did the tank come from? </connor>
<garnt> We're just not gonna explain where he got a tank from? </garnt>
<garnt> - I love how, </garnt>
<joey> it's not even that but like the way that he enters </joey>
<garnt> in that fan propelled. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he's just like, yeah, this is mine. </garnt>
<joey> I bought it with my YouTube ad. </joey>
<garnt> And it's like, what videos are you uploading? </garnt>
<connor> - Really telling me, you're going to film </connor>
<connor> a video of Okinawa sinking </connor>
<connor> and that shit's gonna be monetized. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Come on, </garnt>
<connor> millions of people died, monetized, fuck off, no way. </connor>
<garnt> - Can we just appreciate that the character </garnt>
<garnt> is basically Felix, beautify for he just have like a. </garnt>
<joey> - He's like wide head Felix. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Like the time when Felix had the really, really blonde hair. </joey>
<connor> - Yes, I remember when I met Felix </connor>
<joey> and when he came in on his. </joey>
<connor> (murmurs) </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the idealized vision of PewDiePie </garnt>
<garnt> like this is his final form, right. </garnt>
<garnt> This is rock scene. </garnt>
<connor> - How we see PewDiePie.. </connor>
<joey> - I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised </joey>
<garnt> if he changes his profile picture to that character next </garnt>
<garnt> because it was really from. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - For the longest time. </connor>
<connor> - It's real, it's real. </connor>
<joey> - It's real, it looks like real. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but I guess when I saw that and as you said, </joey>
<connor> it was probably one of the first times </connor>
<connor> that a YouTube has been kind of viewed </connor>
<connor> a lot more of a positive life. - Any form of </connor>
<connor> a positive fashion. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it really goes to show me that I think </connor>
<joey> most like Yuasa's fan of YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it just, it just disappointed me </garnt>
<garnt> that in his final scene, he didn't, </garnt>
<garnt> he didn't send them off by going. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't forget to like and subscribe. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, very unrealistic. </connor>
<connor> There was never a pull, </connor>
<audio> there was not one sponsorship in the whole thing, come on. </audio>
<connor> No raid shutters. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I wanna imagine, him flying away, </connor>
<connor> him flying away like freezing half to death </connor>
<garnt> through the stratosphere and he's like, </garnt>
<connor> splits marriage... </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Very unrealistic YouTuber. </joey>
<joey> Okay, I'm gonna, what, out of 10, </joey>
<joey> was it, was it good or bad? </joey>
<connor> What are you guys? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I'm not going to say that it was a 10. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna give it like a solid seven. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought it was like a four or five. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really, you didn't like it? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I didn't like it either, okay here's my... </garnt>
<connor> - I couldn't stop watching it </connor>
<connor> but I didn't, I had so have so many things I hated. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, here's the thing this, </garnt>
<audio> the way, this is like a proper mixed bag for me. </audio>
<audio> - [Connor] Yeah, same. </audio>
<connor> - The way I would describe it is that </connor>
<garnt> it's a four out of 10 series with some 10 out of 10 scenes. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Okay, that's fair, that's fair. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was really weird 'cause some scenes </garnt>
<garnt> were fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like (murmurs). </garnt>
<garnt> - First two episodes, absolute bangers. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, exactly, and like some of the scenes </garnt>
<garnt> are like the last episodes, absolute bangers as well. </garnt>
<joey> Like, like the sea in the scenes where the YouTuber </joey>
<joey> and like some, some of the death scenes. </joey>
<joey> - Oh the scene where the guy's running on the thing? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I don't know why Yuasa has about making </connor>
<connor> emotional running scenes. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But it's a... </connor>
<connor> - And the father's death completely caught me off guard. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, too. - And that ruined me. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, oh cool, the one character </joey>
<connor> I liked is dead, in episode to. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I looked for thought like, wow, this </joey>
<joey> like after I finished episode two, I thought </joey>
<joey> like this could be a 10 out of 10 </joey>
<joey> if they keep off with like how good this is, and then. </joey>
<connor> - And then we went into the cult. </connor>
<connor> - And then we go to the cult, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, oh no, this is awful. </connor>
<connor> This is actually awful. </connor>
<joey> Like the cult arc for me was so bittersweet </joey>
<joey> because as a massive fan of Yuasa's stuff, </joey>
<connor> I'm like, oh this is so Yuasa. </connor>
<connor> - There's a scene when. </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck was the cult, </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck was it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, you gotta meet the 360... </garnt>
<garnt> - That was amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - That was amazing. </connor>
<audio> - That wasn't the part where I loved most, </audio>
<connor> the part I loved most was... </connor>
<connor> - When the kid die. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I was just watching a dead series </connor>
<garnt> and the kid just gets fucking destroyed by this rock </garnt>
<garnt> and I literally just let out, like a (laughs). </garnt>
<garnt> - He was just like, he was so perfect comedic timing. </garnt>
<garnt> He was just, he turns around, he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> (in foreign language) </garnt>
<connor> - It was like slap stick...what was that. </connor>
<garnt> - He was, 'cause I remember I was like properly, </garnt>
<garnt> I was properly invested in the series. </garnt>
<garnt> My first few episodes I'd properly invested </garnt>
<garnt> and then like some things just fell off like as, </garnt>
<garnt> as the, as the series went on, right. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause like I remember their father dying </joey>
<joey> and it was, he died in a really horrific fucking way. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then nobody really just acknowledged that. </joey>
<joey> They had like, they had like </joey>
<joey> - It just cuts, doesn't it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they had like one conversation, oh, </joey>
<joey> you're a forgetting dad </joey>
<joey> and then they just like, next even </joey>
<garnt> and like happy go lucky, shopping in a supermarket. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, like if that was real </garnt>
<joey> I wouldn't be able to say anything </joey>
<joey> for like the next five days. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Let alone even think about. </garnt>
<joey> - And yet, for some reason, every other character </joey>
<audio> that dies off of that, they have like </audio>
<audio> a full on emotional scene. </audio>
<garnt> That just drags out like crazy, right, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, something just felt off about the character. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what it was about how they were written but </garnt>
<garnt> it just didn't like sometimes they acted the way </garnt>
<audio> I would imagine people would act and sometimes </audio>
<audio> they just acted in a completely random way. </audio>
<audio> - Yeah. </audio>
<audio> - And then the cult arc happened and I was like, okay </audio>
<audio> okay, now, now we've gone from something feels off </audio>
<garnt> to this is just stupid. </garnt>
<connor> So much needed explaining about that, like whole thing. </connor>
<connor> Where were they getting all of this food from? </connor>
<garnt> - Where they getting all of the weed? </garnt>
<connor> - So much weed. </connor>
<garnt> - Just fields of weed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like in Japan, you just gonna grow fields of weed. </garnt>
<joey> - Also they never explained that fact that like the, </joey>
<joey> the grounds where the cult stood wasn't affected </joey>
<joey> by the tilting continental shift. </joey>
<joey> - There's just so much, there's so much stuff, </joey>
<connor> when it got to the cult arc where I was like, </connor>
<connor> this is too much, too many holes for me to just like, </connor>
<connor> be like, this is okay 'cause... </connor>
<joey> - At the end of it all I think the only reason, </joey>
<connor> I was trying to figure out, okay. </connor>
<connor> What was the point of this cult arc? </connor>
<connor> Like, like what were they trying to build </connor>
<garnt> and I think the only thing that came out of this cult arc </garnt>
<garnt> was just the fact that they got that </garnt>
<joey> Morse code talking professor out of there, right. </joey>
<connor> - But why was he there? </connor>
<joey> None of this was explained. </joey>
<garnt> - It was just a slapstick comedy. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, like I remember watching the co-talk </garnt>
<audio> and you know that points when you like really invested </audio>
<audio> in the show and then, </audio>
<audio> you go from being invested to just laughing </audio>
<audio> at how bad it's become. </audio>
<audio> That was the co-talk for me </audio>
<garnt> and I couldn't get invested back into the show after that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it hurt too much after the cult arc happened </connor>
<connor> and the fact that they just realize, </connor>
<connor> okay, if the old man is addicted to morphine, </connor>
<garnt> I'm fine with that but they didn't even build up </garnt>
<garnt> to that at all. </garnt>
<garnt> They could have showed some kind of, you know </garnt>
<connor> like they could've maybe showed him taking some pills. </connor>
<connor> - The fact that the old man shot that kid </connor>
<joey> at the end of episode four, three. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then they were like, and then, </joey>
<joey> and then he was like oh, I'm sorry and whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't mean to show you, let me fix your game boy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude you just fucking shot my kid </garnt>
<joey> with the intent to kill him. </joey>
<audio> He's like, if he didn't have his fucking DS, </audio>
<audio> like he would be dead. </audio>
<garnt> So you're just gonna let him hang around. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was actually the last PS Vita. </garnt>
<garnt> - And to be fair though, at the end of episode four </garnt>
<joey> when the kid got shot, I was like, oh, thank God, he's dead. </joey>
<connor> My God, that kid was fucking annoying. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, did you watch "The Dubbed"? </connor>
<garnt> - I watch both. </garnt>
<garnt> - I watch some. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lik I literally, I was like I watched dub, </garnt>
<garnt> something fell off I watched the sub </garnt>
<garnt> and full of first time on my fucking life, </garnt>
<garnt> I could not stand like the voice siting in the... </garnt>
<connor> - No, it was really, like I get it </connor>
<connor> that they're supposed to be like native and both </connor>
<connor> but then I feel like they should've got people </connor>
<connor> who are native and both, it's doable. </connor>
<connor> Because when they whenever he said, </connor>
<connor> let's go, it's just like that's not. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it sounds really off. </garnt>
<connor> - Dad. </connor>
<garnt> - Or they could have even have just gotten </garnt>
<connor> some with a similar voice type who speaks english, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - What is it about, you also did this in </joey>
<joey> "Devilman Crybaby" as well, where Rio's English </joey>
<garnt> was just so awkward. - Stop doing this shit, </garnt>
<garnt> stop doing this. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yet somehow they can't get, I made this joke </garnt>
<joey> on Twitter, but I think it was the second </joey>
<joey> to last episode when they were in Russia. </joey>
<audio> - [Connor] Yeah - Yeah. </audio>
<audio> - And they got those like three nurses </audio>
<audio> who could speak perfect Russian and yet they can't get </audio>
<audio> a single English speaking voice actor. </audio>
<audio> - The Russian was flawless. </audio>
<joey> - I was like, why? </joey>
<joey> How is it so hard? </joey>
<connor> - Cause in the dub, how do they deal </connor>
<connor> with the bilingual ness? </connor>
<connor> - They, they didn't really, </connor>
<connor> the boy just always spoke English, so that's why... </connor>
<connor> - Did they mentioned it at all that he could speak both? </connor>
<joey> - No, I mean like they kind of did, </joey>
<joey> - I wanted them to just be like, </joey>
<joey> oh, I wanna meet my (in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Is it like a huge plot point </connor>
<connor> 'cause then later on when they all like the barrage comes </connor>
<connor> with the Japanese only. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, the Japanese KKK. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, the whole you know, the, the dynamics of that boat, </connor>
<garnt> just the engineering standards were all horrific. </garnt>
<garnt> How did that boat which couldn't handle waves, </garnt>
<joey> like waves could just come on. </joey>
<joey> - It literally burst into flames, for no reason. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, sorry. </joey>
<joey> I just got, yeah, it was engineering. </joey>
<connor> - The more we discussing this </connor>
<joey> the more I'm regretting giving it a seven. </joey>
<connor> - The emotions it gave me we're a 10. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, like let's, let's not forget that they also added </connor>
<garnt> a woman who could speak to the dead </garnt>
<garnt> that was just never explained. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was up with that, what was up with that. </garnt>
<garnt> Why did they show us the sex scene? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like there was several points in the cult arc. </garnt>
<connor> - Why did they show her sex scene? </connor>
<garnt> I don't need to see that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was two points I bust out laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> One, one was the kid dying and the second one was </garnt>
<garnt> like the fucking Mexican standoff, </garnt>
<garnt> where she's just brings a samurai sword. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like is this "Kill Bill", </connor>
<connor> is this a "Kill Bill" scene. </connor>
<garnt> - That was such a Quentin Tarantino scene where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> there's a guy with a bag full of gold bars and a gun, </garnt>
<garnt> and she just rocks off with a samurai sword </garnt>
<joey> and the guides walks up the stairs is like. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, what am I watching, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought I was watching like a disaster movie </garnt>
<garnt> and it's turned into "Kill Bill". </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't stop taking sick, </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't stop laughing at that point. </garnt>
<connor> - What did you guys think of the last episode? </connor>
<joey> - It was a really... - I really fucking hated </joey>
<connor> the last episode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the last, the last episode </connor>
<joey> just kind of dragged out for a little bit too long. </joey>
<garnt> - The last episode was, </garnt>
<garnt> remember when the Olympics was meant to happen right now. </garnt>
<audio> (laughs) </audio>
<joey> This is, this is awkward. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't forget the Paralympics just got too, </garnt>
<joey> just gotta make sure. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm sure it would have hit harder </garnt>
<joey> because the Olympics would be happening right now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If this was released right now, I'd be like </garnt>
<garnt> oh, that's, that's a pro game of move there Yuasa. </garnt>
<garnt> So I, I see, I see you </garnt>
<garnt> but now, but now that the Olympics isn't happening. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just one giant ad for the Olympics. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh no, it was. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't wanna say that but like, it definitely </connor>
<joey> like felt little, little ad like. </joey>
<joey> Look how amazing the Olympics are and it's like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we we know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - We know how good the Olympics are </connor>
<connor> or how good it should have been. </connor>
<connor> - Because I didn't like maybe I, it was </connor>
<joey> I wasn't paying attention to this </joey>
<joey> but I saw a lot of people commenting saying </joey>
<garnt> that the show is like very political at times </garnt>
<garnt> and I was thinking like, I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if it was that political people trying to put that on it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I didn't get that. </garnt>
<garnt> Did you get that vibe? </garnt>
<joey> - No, not really. </joey>
<joey> Maybe they we're talking about the rap scene? </joey>
<joey> - Maybe. </joey>
<garnt> - Which I liked. </garnt>
<joey> - I liked the rap scene. - I like the rap scene. </joey>
<garnt> - That was a, this doesn't, this is a really random scene </garnt>
<connor> but I'm all for it. </connor>
<connor> - It was a good scene, it was random though. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I don't know what this is </connor>
<connor> but we can keep doing it. </connor>
<connor> - But it's also Yuasa move where, you know </connor>
<connor> he was just like, okay, I really want to tell people </connor>
<connor> how much I love Japan, but how much Japan sucks </connor>
<joey> but not make a super political. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Freestyle rap, baby let's do it. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - So originally was the rap in Japanese </garnt>
<joey> and the Japanese stuff? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, I didn't notice because, </joey>
<joey> at that point I was just purely watching the English dub </joey>
<joey> and it was all in English and it was really, </joey>
<joey> really done well so I didn't know if it was a case </joey>
<connor> where they just like had that one specific scene in English, </connor>
<connor> but not like I really enjoyed that. </connor>
<connor> I really enjoyed the last two episodes </connor>
<connor> not the last two episodes, like episode nine </connor>
<connor> and the one before that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, those are two really strong episodes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they had like, like I said </connor>
<connor> I wasn't invested in the characters at that point </connor>
<connor> which was really weird </connor>
<connor> because there were some scenes that like, </connor>
<audio> I felt something, even though I had zero investment </audio>
<audio> in the story and the characters </audio>
<audio> but just because of like the sheer brilliance of some, </audio>
<audio> some of the ways these scenes were directed, I was like, </audio>
<audio> man, I'm, I'm feeling something </audio>
<garnt> even though I really shouldn't be right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Did the mom have to die? - Like I was thinking, like </connor>
<connor> I was like, did she have to enter life here for this? </connor>
<connor> Cause they kind of went like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> They probably went further, but there was like </connor>
<joey> one minute on the boat, oop, it's out of fuel. </joey>
<joey> - I think it was implied though that, because her </joey>
<connor> like device hadn't run out of battery, </connor>
<joey> that she was officially going to die. </joey>
<connor> - But didn't shift then, like a solar panel. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, because like that thing hadn't become busted. </joey>
<connor> So the implication was that she was going to die anyway. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I didn't pick that up 'cause I thought, </joey>
<joey> is she just killing herself for like the (murmurs) here. </joey>
<connor> Like, she's drowning of like... </connor>
<connor> - I mean at this point. </connor>
<connor> - She's like aI have to feel in my </connor>
<joey> one death per episode quota. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, at this point it was just, </garnt>
<connor> they were just killing characters off. </connor>
<connor> - That's what it felt like. It felt like they were like </connor>
<joey> every character was going to die now </joey>
<joey> and we were just having to sit through it. </joey>
<joey> Like, it didn't feel like it was needed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the one character that should have died </joey>
<joey> a million years ago, </joey>
<joey> which is the cripple doctor, survived. </joey>
<joey> - How? Somehow, I don't know how. </joey>
<garnt> - No, like, yeah that was my biggest problem with it </garnt>
<audio> because it wasn't the fact that people were dying. </audio>
<audio> It was the fact that you just knew </audio>
<audio> that we're gonna die. </audio>
<connor> Like it was just, okay </connor>
<connor> here's the scene where this person's gonna die. </connor>
<connor> You know, there's no tension or anything. </connor>
<garnt> You're just, okay, well they're going to die </garnt>
<garnt> and they're dead and everyone's moving on now. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's sad and you should be sad </garnt>
<connor> and Japan sinking. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like... </garnt>
<connor> - But YouTuber good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, YouTuber good. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's really weird though </garnt>
<garnt> because I was having this conversation </garnt>
<audio> with Garnt earlier though. </audio>
<audio> I think we can, we can end the spoiler discussion now. </audio>
<garnt> - No more spoilers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unless, unless there's anything else </garnt>
<garnt> you guys want to discuss about the series specifically. </garnt>
<connor> - Why pro games did he become (murmurs) </connor>
<audio> (laughs) </audio>
<audio> And totally unrealistic, </audio>
<connor> and he's not a little shit. </connor>
<connor> I mean she kind of was there actually, maybe he was, </connor>
<connor> maybe he was a league player that dies, </connor>
<connor> why are you (laughs). </connor>
<garnt> Why are you, sorry, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, but so yeah, it was, it was really weird </garnt>
<garnt> because even though it was like, I would give like a four </garnt>
<connor> or five hours at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> I still ended having like good time watching your Netflix. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - I couldn't look away, like it was great. </connor>
<connor> - I don't why we're it's, I find it so </connor>
<joey> easy to watch anime on Netflix, </joey>
<garnt> as opposed to watching anime on like any other platform. </garnt>
<joey> - I've been saying this since early 2018 </joey>
<joey> ever since "Devilman Crybaby" and other, </joey>
<audio> it as around the time when Netflix had just started </audio>
<audio> to get their hands on a lot of anime, IPS that </audio>
<garnt> with at least with stuff that comes out on Netflix, </garnt>
<connor> you know Castlevania did it really well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Castlevania was good. </connor>
<connor> - I think, I think the reason why Netflix can kill it </connor>
<connor> so hard with animates because they know that </connor>
<joey> most enemy view is including probably all three of us, </joey>
<joey> we'd like to watch shows just in one big chunk. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, my God Castlevania so fucking... </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Castlevania is fucking amazing, right. </joey>
<joey> And I think what it is is that because </joey>
<connor> whenever they really something new, they just go, </connor>
<connor> "We know you can't wait an entire week </connor>
<connor> so we're just gonna give you the whole thing all in one go." </connor>
<joey> And it's perfect because Netflix is designed to binged. </joey>
<connor> - Yes to be binged. </connor>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it also feels like there's no seasonal pressure </joey>
<garnt> as well if there's just one big show that drops, </garnt>
<garnt> go and watch it right now. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not, it's not under any kind of like scheduling. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's not sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause I've had plenty of shows where </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna binge them and I wait like they're on Crunchy Roll </garnt>
<garnt> or Funimation or whatever platform. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, okay, I'm going to wait for this, </garnt>
<joey> for this to be over and then I'm gonna binge it </joey>
<joey> and then it's over, and then I don't binge it </joey>
<joey> and I just don't watch it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because by the time it ends there's another whole </joey>
<joey> new batch that you're interested in, now. </joey>
<joey> So you never have time to go back to it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and then I've watched so many </garnt>
<garnt> like mediocre anime on Netflix. </garnt>
<garnt> I have no idea why, but like... </garnt>
<connor> - You can download it, it's super easy, like </connor>
<garnt> I remember watching, I think "B: The Beginning" as well. </garnt>
<connor> I was like severely disappointed </connor>
<connor> in how that turned out but I watched it, </connor>
<connor> I watched it all in one night and I still, </connor>
<connor> there are still many shows on every other platform </connor>
<connor> that I just still have not watched </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, oh my plan to watch this. </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah I don't know what it is about watching </garnt>
<garnt> shows on Netflix, it's just makes it so... </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just painless, like it's so easy to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> Like make it way too easy for you to </garnt>
<connor> enjoy it the way you wanna enjoy it. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, they just know how the viewing habits of </joey>
<joey> people of our demographic. </joey>
<joey> - And the app works so well on your phone. </joey>
<joey> So it's easy to just chuck that shit </joey>
<joey> on the Chrome cast, or download in the phone, like, you know </joey>
<connor> saves where you want, it's just so good. </connor>
<joey> - We're not sponsored by Netflix but just letting you now. </joey>
<connor> - But if they wanna hit us up. - But if they wanna hit us up. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Good yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, how'd you feel about the skip opening button though? </garnt>
<garnt> - I love the skip opening button. </garnt>
<joey> I like the option. </joey>
<joey> - I like, I like having the option. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like, but I don't like how the default </garnt>
<garnt> is that they skip it. </garnt>
<connor> - It's default though, it's default. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't like how the default is skipping because... </joey>
<connor> - Wait they don't skip it straight away. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they do. </joey>
<garnt> - The first time you watch it, you don't have the option. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, you do have the option to skip it </garnt>
<joey> but plays it for you, it's masculine </joey>
<joey> but every time after that then... </joey>
<joey> - They just assume that you're going to skip it. </joey>
<garnt> Which sucks because when I was watching, </garnt>
<garnt> "Beastars" on Netflix, I was like </garnt>
<joey> I don't want to skip this comedy... </joey>
<joey> - "Beastars" you watch, because yeah </joey>
<garnt> you don't have to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] So I had to keep going. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to touch it Garnt, </garnt>
<connor> it's there in case you don't want it. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's not like, touch me, touch me, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Speaking of Masaaki Yuasa though like, </joey>
<joey> how much Yuasa stuff have you guys watched in the past? </joey>
<garnt> - I've watched most of this stuff except for probably Kyber. </garnt>
<connor> - "Devilman" is that his? </connor>
<audio> - Yeah, that's the one. - Yeah, "Devilman" is his. </audio>
<audio> - What else has he done? </audio>
<joey> - Oh, "Eizouken" as well. </joey>
<joey> It's it's fun, it's funny that's how I still haven't </joey>
<joey> watched "Eizouken" even though I've, </joey>
<joey> I've watched "Japan Sinks" </joey>
<connor> which I feel like is gonna be worse </connor>
<garnt> and "Eizouken" and "Eizouken" is been out for a while. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that "Eizouken" the "Ping Pong The Animation"? </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, I love "Ping Pong The Animation". </garnt>
<garnt> - He's done "Kyber". </garnt>
<garnt> - "Mindgame". </garnt>
<garnt> - "Mindgame", he's done "Kick-heart" as well </garnt>
<garnt> which was the kick start to one. </garnt>
<joey> - He's done a lot of indie films as well. </joey>
<audio> Yeah, "Your Wave". </audio>
<garnt> - Oh, I haven't seen, I haven't seen "Ride Your Wave". </garnt>
<audio> - I still haven't seen that. </audio>
<audio> I really wanna watch that. </audio>
<audio> It's about the, it's like a girlfriend, boyfriend dies, </audio>
<joey> they both love the ocean and then </joey>
<joey> boyfriend reincarnates as a wave. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - That's the only way to describe it, right. </joey>
<connor> That's the easiest way to describe it. </connor>
<connor> - Sounds like a Hentai. </connor>
<joey> - Boyfriend resurrects as a water beast essentially. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I think my favorite Yuasa work will like </joey>
<joey> is at the moment "Ping-Pong" the animation. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> - That's, it hit me on like a really fucking deep level. </joey>
<joey> - It hit different. </joey>
<connor> - I really want to stop saying that </connor>
<garnt> 'cause like every time we're on is like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, this show just hits the different. </garnt>
<connor> - It do be hitting different. </connor>
<connor> I guess 'cause it sounds like relatable in some way. </connor>
<connor> Like you've probably been good at something without trying </connor>
<connor> and you've also probably not been good at something... </connor>
<garnt> - We had a lot of comments last week. </garnt>
<garnt> That was, yeah Connor's chest stories, basically </garnt>
<joey> "Ping Pong The Animation" just with chess. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean, </joey>
<joey> but the way you just portrayed, </joey>
<connor> because to me it's not a sports anime, you know, it's, </connor>
<connor> to me "Ping Pong The Animation" is a life anime </connor>
<connor> that happens to follow characters around </connor>
<connor> one single one, single sports. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's, it's such a good metaphor for life in general. </connor>
<audio> When it, when it comes to the discussion of talent </audio>
<audio> versus hard work and just basically </audio>
<garnt> how crushingly depressing life can be sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> - Life isn't fair. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, life, life is not fair. </garnt>
<connor> - And no one's entitled to anything, unfortunately. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's the whole reason why I fucking loved </joey>
<joey> "March Comes in Like a Lion" </joey>
<connor> 'cause that's essentially the exact scene. </connor>
<connor> - Haven't seen that yet, I really wanna see that. </connor>
<connor> - It's not a show that show you. </connor>
<connor> You'll get into (in foreign language) after watching it </connor>
<connor> but it much like "Ping Pong The Animation", </connor>
<joey> it's just a story about how, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter how good you are at something. </joey>
<connor> You're still gonna be depressed as fuck </connor>
<joey> - That's the reason I've been putting it off, </joey>
<connor> I'm like, I don't want to be depressed. </connor>
<joey> - It gets pretty upsetting. - I know it does, </joey>
<connor> I know it does everyone who's watched it, </connor>
<connor> is like, yeah I loved it, I was just ruined. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so good though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think "Japan Sinks" is his worst work </garnt>
<garnt> that you've seen so far then? </garnt>
<connor> - Out of like the three I've seen, yeah, it's probably. </connor>
<joey> - I mean I haven't seen everything, </joey>
<connor> Masaaki Yuasa has to offer. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've seen a lot, but I I'd probably say it's, </garnt>
<joey> yeah, it's probably his weakness. </joey>
<garnt> - I think definitely for me it was weakest and... </garnt>
<joey> - Literally just remove the cult. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - That's good. </connor>
<joey> - So many problems will be solved if he just </joey>
<garnt> had removed the cult episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I wanna say not every problem would be solved </garnt>
<garnt> but a lot of it, it would be like a lot better </garnt>
<audio> 'Cause they still had problems with </audio>
<audio> how the characters were written. </audio>
<audio> - [Connor] Yeah. </audio>
<audio> - And how the story played out, </audio>
<audio> but removing, removing the middle arch </audio>
<connor> would have made it like an easy seven to eight or 10. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because there were still, like I said, </connor>
<connor> there was still some amazing scenes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yes, there was some plenty of amazing scenes. </connor>
<connor> - And he was like (murmurs) if I was actually invested, </connor>
<audio> I would think that the show had some </audio>
<audio> pretty amazing moments in it, </audio>
<audio> because I feel like just it got bogged down </audio>
<audio> by stories so much. </audio>
<audio> - Yeah. </audio>
<audio> - Whereas his other works, I feel it was, </audio>
<audio> it was a like a nice combination between </audio>
<audio> this Yuasa style of directing because he has a, </audio>
<audio> I don't know some of his scenes the way, </audio>
<garnt> the way he portrays and directs, </garnt>
<garnt> especially like the emotional scenes </garnt>
<garnt> they just, they can hit really hard </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know what he does. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're so close to saying that. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Shut the fuck up. </joey>
<connor> - You're so close to saying that. </connor>
<connor> - I said it in my head. </connor>
<joey> I was like, I'll fall for it. </joey>
<joey> - It like hits the source for a different. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I agree I definitely think that Yuasa </joey>
<audio> regardless of how strange it is </audio>
<audio> that the way that he portrays you know, </audio>
<connor> character designs and just movement in general. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] And just animation. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, I'm one of those enemy viewers </joey>
<connor> who does not care who the director is </connor>
<connor> or any of that stuff. </connor>
<connor> I just watch the show and that's how I watch an anime. </connor>
<joey> I do that with everything. </joey>
<joey> So, I mean, I could tell it was from the same guy </joey>
<joey> who did "Devilman" within like 10 seconds. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Just tell, that's how. </connor>
<connor> - Because Yuasa's films and series </connor>
<connor> have this really weird thing where </connor>
<connor> sometimes you look at a character design </connor>
<joey> and you think, oh wow. - They're ugly as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - That looks pretty cool </joey>
<joey> and then the next scene, it looks </joey>
<joey> like it's written by like the intern, you know. </joey>
<connor> - It changes, I think there was like a few frames in it </connor>
<connor> where it was like the characters just talking </connor>
<connor> and it was like, bro, like pain. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I was like, what? </connor>
<joey> - You can take a screenshot of that </joey>
<joey> and just be... </joey>
<garnt> - I will say out of like all his works. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like "Japan Sinks" was his most like </garnt>
<joey> normal looking work in terms of visual style. </joey>
<garnt> - Big unquotes for. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no you know you like you compare "Ping-Pong" </garnt>
<garnt> the animation and then you go to "Devilman Crybaby" </garnt>
<joey> and then "Japan Sinks". </joey>
<joey> I would, I would say he's progressively gotten </joey>
<joey> in terms of his big series. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - More, more like normal. </garnt>
<connor> - "Ping Pong" is one ugly looking show </connor>
<garnt> but in great way. </garnt>
<connor> - In a great way. </connor>
<garnt> - Like he had a very unique art style </garnt>
<connor> and some of the scenes were like </connor>
<garnt> they had a very unique animation style and some, </garnt>
<connor> I would still say sometimes it works </connor>
<connor> sometimes it doesn't work so well </connor>
<garnt> but it was definitely a very Yuasa style. </garnt>
<connor> - At least you know it's him. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - How many fucking of those generic (murmurs) </connor>
<connor> are you like, are these all animated </connor>
<joey> by the same fucking people. </joey>
<connor> They all look the same, I can't tell. </connor>
<joey> - You ask any (murmurs) and they'll probably know. </joey>
<connor> It's like this was directed by... </connor>
<connor> - I don't, I don't care. </connor>
<audio> Like I just, I see an ECI protagonists now </audio>
<joey> and it's literally a carbon copy of Kirito. </joey>
<joey> I remember doing like a copy and paste of </joey>
<garnt> seven different like ECI, protagonists </garnt>
<joey> and they all look exactly the same. </joey>
<joey> It was all that generic. </joey>
<joey> - Probably because they roll A1. </joey>
<connor> - It's the exact same art style, </connor>
<connor> the exact same animation all the time </connor>
<connor> and it's like, it's such a breath </connor>
<connor> of fresh air to even get anything different. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, no definitely. - That's what I love about </joey>
<joey> Masaaki Yuasa, because he's just so weird </joey>
<joey> that he's just instantly recognizable, especially, </joey>
<audio> you know "Japan Sinks", as you were saying </audio>
<audio> even though it looks the most normal </audio>
<audio> probably to the general anime viewing audience </audio>
<audio> they will look at those characters and be like, </audio>
<audio> oh that looks fucking weird. </audio>
<audio> But then you go back to Masaaki Yuasa's catalog. </audio>
<audio> You watch something like "Kyber"? </audio>
<audio> - [Connor] Yeah. </audio>
<connor> - Like that thing that doesn't even look like anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That thing looks like, you know </connor>
<connor> some kind of like Disney demo </connor>
<joey> that it was locked away in the Disney vault for a while. </joey>
<connor> - But let me say this about "Jojo" as well, </connor>
<connor> I like the art styles are weird, </connor>
<connor> I can't get into that, like you'll know. </connor>
<audio> (laughs) </audio>
<connor> You'll appreciate. </connor>
<connor> - It's an acquired taste. </connor>
<connor> - Once you, once you acquire that taste </connor>
<connor> there is never going back. </connor>
<garnt> - Taste acquired. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I like "Jojo" now. </connor>
<joey> - I was gonna say I completely forgot about the one show </joey>
<joey> and you're also getting one show when we're talking </joey>
<joey> about Masaaki Yuasa, "Tatami Galaxy". </joey>
<joey> "Tatami Galaxy" was fucking... </joey>
<garnt> Like you watched, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - It's "Monogatari" but on crack. </joey>
<joey> - It is "Monogatari"... </joey>
<garnt> - Like this, this will test your reading ability to the max. </garnt>
<joey> - The monologue is so fast, </joey>
<audio> that Japanese people struggle to keep up with it, </audio>
<audio> they are like hold on, hold on, hold on, </audio>
<audio> hold on, pause, pause, pause. </audio>
<audio> What the fuck did he just say, go back. </audio>
<connor> Yeah, it's the, I've never heard of monologue </connor>
<connor> and just talking scenes that go by so goddamn quickly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It is, it is "Monogatari" on crack essentially. </joey>
<garnt> It's basically like if you take "Monogatari" </garnt>
<garnt> but try to speed run the dialogue and that's, </garnt>
<garnt> that's an episode of "Tatami Galaxy" </garnt>
<joey> but it's fucking great. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And that's on top of the fucking crazy </joey>
<connor> Masaaki Yuasa visual, </connor>
<connor> where it's just like, I don't know if this </connor>
<connor> is like a dream scape or if it's just weird. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's great, it's fantastic. </joey>
<garnt> - One thing I wanted to, </garnt>
<garnt> one thing that we kind of like glossed over in terms </garnt>
<joey> of "Japan Sinks", I wanna talk about though, is the music. </joey>
<joey> I thought the music was fantastic. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was phenomenal </joey>
<joey> and I think that's definitely some of it made some it, </joey>
<garnt> it was what helped make some of the scenes for me. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That main track, </joey>
<joey> I think it played most of the first episode </joey>
<audio> when the main character was running back </audio>
<audio> to a family that kind of slow piano, I think so. </audio>
<audio> I'd love that track because it's really positive sounding </audio>
<audio> and get putting it next </audio>
<connor> to the absolutely devastating visuals. </connor>
<connor> It's just become such a creepy song, </connor>
<connor> where it's like, oh everything and everyone is dead. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like, I think like what sold me </garnt>
<garnt> on the first two episodes was just seeing some </garnt>
<audio> of these like horrific scenes, horrific landscapes </audio>
<audio> and hearing this beautiful piano track </audio>
<audio> that just gave this like juxtaposition that just like </audio>
<audio> it was really unnerving but beautiful at the same time. </audio>
<joey> Like I, the way I described it to Sydney was it felt </joey>
<joey> like I was watching some, </joey>
<joey> something that was horrifically beautiful. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I, that was... </joey>
<joey> - Was like a beautiful destruction. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly </joey>
<audio> and I don't know who the composer was. </audio>
<garnt> It sounded very similar to "Devilman Crybaby" soundtrack </garnt>
<garnt> in some scenes as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it's the same composer. </garnt>
<joey> I probably should have done my research </joey>
<joey> before talking about "Japan Sinks" on this podcast. </joey>
<joey> - I mean I'm sure, it was done by Science SARU. </joey>
<joey> who did you know, "Devilman Crybaby". </joey>
<joey> So I assume it's the same guy, but I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure someone in the comments can tell us about that but. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I love that piano track because </joey>
<garnt> I don't know, I'm not gonna lie the first time I heard it. </garnt>
<garnt> It kind of reminded me of the "Minecraft" soundtrack, </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I was like if this play during "Minecraft", </garnt>
<joey> I would not be phased in any way. </joey>
<connor> Can someone in the subreddit take that piece of music </connor>
<joey> and put it over "Minecraft", let's play </joey>
<garnt> and see if you can spot it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, God, this was such horrific beauty. </garnt>
<garnt> The juxtaposition was amazing, Garnt "Minecraft". </garnt>
<connor> - He says like "Minecraft" </connor>
<joey> but that's what I, I was like "Minecraft" </joey>
<connor> - I don't know if I'm just dumb </connor>
<garnt> but I cannot remember any of the music. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really can't? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I will sing them when sitting there. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we all did. </joey>
<joey> - Did you watch in one sitting? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I don't remember. </connor>
<joey> - We just have a bigger brain. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Clearly, I think I was preoccupied. </connor>
<connor> How do they get a tank? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, a question to you then. </garnt>
<garnt> what kind of OSTs do you remember, </garnt>
<garnt> what sticks out for you then? </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Anything where like the music </connor>
<connor> is like a huge selling point, I guess. </connor>
<connor> - What, what do you mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I mean, I don't want to be that guy </garnt>
<garnt> but like the one that sticks out immediately is like, </garnt>
<garnt> do you remember "Cowboy Bebop", like the super jazzy thing, </garnt>
<joey> like but I wouldn't listen to jazz on its own. </joey>
<connor> I'm like something like this just sounds like a mess. </connor>
<joey> - I mean I've come to understand that when it comes to music </joey>
<audio> you're a little bit brain dead, </audio>
<audio> because you don't, you don't really listen to </audio>
<garnt> because you know, Garnt and I </garnt>
<garnt> can have a conversation of, oh, this band is awesome </garnt>
<garnt> or this artist is awesome. </garnt>
<audio> And yet I remember I asked Connor once. </audio>
<audio> I was like, well, who's your favorite band? </audio>
<joey> And he was just like I don't really have one, I'm like. </joey>
<connor> - I like, I like Daft Punk you know why, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just noise, most of the time. </connor>
<connor> Like, I, I hate like I never listen to lyrics. </connor>
<connor> Like I love like listen to, like, I think I listened </connor>
<connor> to like pumped up kicks like a thousand times. </connor>
<connor> So someone was like, it's </connor>
<connor> about school shooting and I actually listened to it. </connor>
<connor> They are like, oh yeah yes it is, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what's wrong with me. </garnt>
<connor> - You are monkey brain? </connor>
<garnt> It's a monkey brain coming back, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I have like half monkey brain, half giant brain </connor>
<connor> depending on like what a... </connor>
<connor> - Do you have a single composer? </connor>
<connor> - Kevin Penkin. </connor>
<garnt> - I was about to say aside from Kevin Penkin </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he's our fucking mate. </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, he's, he's not composing our minds. </garnt>
<joey> He's just some better... </joey>
<joey> - Do you know what he composed of the "Made in Abyss"? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he did... </joey>
<joey> - And all of them "Tower of God"? </joey>
<joey> - "Shield Hero". </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Shield hero is pretty, the boys is not completely </garnt>
<garnt> branded, that's good. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess, because I focus more on the </connor>
<garnt> voice acting than anything </garnt>
<connor> and that's like taking up all the </connor>
<connor> noise input I can take, right. </connor>
<connor> Like I don't really give a shit about the music. </connor>
<connor> To me, the music is just like. </connor>
<connor> - Does the music not enhance your viewing experience? </connor>
<connor> - The music to me is so fucking important. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - No, not really. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, if, if there's a series with a good soundtrack </garnt>
<joey> I'm still gonna remember that soundtrack. </joey>
<joey> - I absolutely agree. </joey>
<garnt> - To this day, like I will never forget "Guilty Crown" </garnt>
<joey> despite how shit "Guilty Crown" turned into. </joey>
<joey> - Sawano fucking killed it with that sound. </joey>
<connor> That is a fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> - There some songs that like will invoke an emotion </connor>
<connor> in me from like, if they've been a soundtrack bus. </connor>
<connor> As far as it goes, it's like no. </connor>
<joey> - Have you ever listened to a Sawano soundtrack </joey>
<connor> and just gotten pumped up? </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Not at all? </connor>
<connor> - Like maybe at the gym </connor>
<connor> like I'll put anime soundtrack to get hyped to </connor>
<connor> and maybe, you know, a song, </connor>
<joey> a song will come on. </joey>
<joey> - But say for example, "Promare". </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You fucking love that movie, right. </connor>
<connor> - It was a great movie. </connor>
<connor> - Do you remember the soundtrack? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - How? </garnt>
<joey> - What how, how is it that the most in your face composer </joey>
<garnt> that has ever existed in anime, Connor's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "No.", no impression. </garnt>
<connor> - If you were like, if you were like, if you were like, </connor>
<connor> describe a song to me from, from happy life... </connor>
<garnt> no fucking idea, no clue. </garnt>
<connor> - If you watch "Promare", you watch "Attack on Titan" </connor>
<garnt> what other, what other sound. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, "Attack on Titan" the one that goes, </garnt>
<connor> I remember wanting from "Attack on Titan", </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what... </garnt>
<connor> - "Kill to Kill", you remember "Kill to Kill"? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, "Kill to Kill". </connor>
<garnt> - That's all, Sawano, that's all, Sawano. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember like individual songs </connor>
<connor> but if you ask me to like describe them </connor>
<audio> or what I like about them, I'd be like </audio>
<audio> but like crayon colors to me. </audio>
<audio> Like I don't know, for all I care you could put like </audio>
<joey> fucking Kevin MaCleod music, whatever he's called. </joey>
<audio> - Kevin MaCleod? </audio>
<audio> - MaCleod, that's what is called. </audio>
<connor> Like if you put Kevin MaCleod background. </connor>
<joey> - The creative...composer. </joey>
<garnt> (upbeat music) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> You can put those fucking songs, I don't give a fuck. </joey>
<connor> - To be fair, some of the best shows I've listened to </connor>
<connor> have sounded like some Kevin MaCleod music. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, no there's like, there's definitely been </joey>
<joey> some generic sounding soundtracks that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But they're normally like for generic shows, right </connor>
<connor> but I don't know a soundtrack can easily sell me a series. </connor>
<connor> - I wish I could give a fuck, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's with music as well, I love Daft Punk. </connor>
<joey> I was just like, wow. </joey>
<connor> The, the noise sounds nice. </connor>
<connor> Like I like the noise, you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> Is that weird? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Is that weird? </joey>
<connor> - Yes, it is weird. </connor>
<garnt> - Am I weird? - It is very weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know I think you just basically described music in, </garnt>
<garnt> in the most like I think bare bones monkey brains terms. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is a bunch of noises put together. </garnt>
<connor> - Think I actually am like a caveman when it comes </connor>
<garnt> to music, I'm like, ooh, beeps and boops are very pleasing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Music goes, boop. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah music goes boop. </connor>
<connor> - I mean that's a huge reason why when it comes </connor>
<audio> to soundtracks that's a huge reason why I love anything </audio>
<audio> made by Key Studios, right </audio>
<audio> because Maeda Jun is a fucking amazing composer </audio>
<audio> and he's like just subtle piano tracks </audio>
<joey> or any of the openings and everything's just </joey>
<joey> it builds on the scene so fucking nicely </joey>
<connor> and it adds like a whole, like. </connor>
<connor> - Totally. </connor>
<connor> - At least to me, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I'm the only one </connor>
<joey> but I could just listen to say any track </joey>
<joey> from "Clannad" or "Air" or "Little busters". </joey>
<joey> Yeah, and it could be a specific song </joey>
<joey> that can evoke a specific scene </joey>
<joey> and I could easily shed a tear just from listening to it. </joey>
<garnt> - Like his work is basically </garnt>
<joey> if you wanna hit the emotional G-spot. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> Like you, you hear it and you're like, oh, oh shit no. </garnt>
<joey> - How does a single piano put this much emotion behind it. </joey>
<connor> I have no fucking idea. </connor>
<audio> - I feel like the Mike Wazowski meme where </audio>
<audio> he's just standing there, right. </audio>
<connor> Just listening to this conversation. </connor>
<joey> He goes...I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - You are the first person to ever describe </joey>
<connor> Daft Punk as noise. </connor>
<connor> - It's like. - I'm just saying. </connor>
<garnt> - Pleasant noise is the way I like it. </garnt>
<joey> - Pleasant, you mean music? </joey>
<joey> - "Interstellar Three", whatever it's called. </joey>
<garnt> What is it, Interstellar? </garnt>
<garnt> - "5555" </garnt>
<garnt> - "5555" that's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I love that. </garnt>
<connor> - It's great I love that. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Has a track never evoked emotions from you though? </garnt>
<joey> - Have you never listened too... </joey>
<garnt> - Like actual, actual emotion? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, what's your favorite Daft Punk track? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's hard. </joey>
<connor> I have to run. I really like "Face to Face". </connor>
<joey> - Okay, why is it your favorite track? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> - Is it because it evokes an emotion or? </joey>
<garnt> - You can see in his face he's never thought about this, </garnt>
<garnt> this deeply before. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is this, my favorite song. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I like all the sampling in it </garnt>
<connor> and it gets like crazy how creative they were sampling. </connor>
<joey> - Right, so you're looking at them. </joey>
<joey> So is there like a think about the one Daft Punk song, </joey>
<connor> it doesn't have to be Daft Punk, </connor>
<joey> just think about the one song that has evoked </joey>
<joey> like any kind of emotion in you. </joey>
<joey> What song would that be and what emotion would that be? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't think there is. </connor>
<joey> I think there was a song that evoked emotions in me. </joey>
<joey> Is that, right? </joey>
<connor> What does it mean, what does that mean about me as a person? </connor>
<garnt> - I'm talking to a fucking brick wall here. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - It's like trying to explain to, you know </garnt>
<connor> Peppa the android, what music is, </connor>
<connor> it's just like, it says not compute. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I'm alien right now. </connor>
<joey> - What is emotion? </joey>
<joey> - What is culture, </joey>
<connor> what is this? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I guess like for me, </connor>
<garnt> maybe that's why like I focus or I feel like I'm really </garnt>
<garnt> strong in being able to really break down voice acting </garnt>
<garnt> and shares and really like get into it </garnt>
<garnt> but I think that's cause I'm completely fucking ignoring. </garnt>
<garnt> - What like brings emotions to you? </garnt>
<connor> - The story and the characters and performances. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, but does not, but does voice acting not </joey>
<connor> give you emotion? - Yeah, the voice acting does. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so how come music can't do that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I guess I can't like, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> It doesn't connect, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you know a medium where you can feel emotion </garnt>
<connor> just by a story and characters? </connor>
<connor> - Books. </connor>
<connor> - Books, I wish we was... </connor>
<connor> - But I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna read the book. </connor>
<audio> I want someone to read it for me. </audio>
<joey> The music for me is something that like ties it together </joey>
<audio> and it's something that if it's done well, I don't notice </audio>
<joey> and if it's done badly, I will notice. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, no I agree with that. - Which is the way I think </joey>
<connor> that most people view like voice acting. </connor>
<joey> - No, no I agree with how, </joey>
<connor> if music is done well, if it's done so well </connor>
<connor> then sometimes you can't notice it but, </connor>
<connor> but then there's a level. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I don't, I don't look out for it. </connor>
<connor> Like I don't seek that. </connor>
<connor> - No, no when I say, when I say good </connor>
<connor> I mean like just like satisfactory. </connor>
<connor> Like satisfactory music you don't notice it </connor>
<connor> but you will definitely hear </connor>
<joey> when a soundtrack is really funny. </joey>
<connor> - What is attracted that using amazing ways. </connor>
<garnt> I'll notice that track and I'll like, </garnt>
<garnt> have like a little... </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, but does that not give you emotion or? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you've definitely heard the Sawano? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and I'm like, yeah, I get a little hype, </connor>
<garnt> just about it. </garnt>
<connor> Unlike, I'm excited from this one </connor>
<connor> and I, (laughs) </connor>
<connor> go protagonist. </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever watched like, okay. </connor>
<garnt> My favorite soundtrack of all time </garnt>
<garnt> is probably (murmurs). </garnt>
<connor> - I remember enjoying that show a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - So good. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember the music was sad. I don't know about... </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, this hurts me so a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> The music was sad, yes. </garnt>
<joey> - The music was sad, </joey>
<joey> is like saying peppers are hot. </joey>
<connor> - The way I see it like when you, </connor>
<connor> when you talk about music to me </connor>
<joey> you need to filter it through like </joey>
<connor> the YouTube audio, library tags </connor>
<connor> Like genre and mood, that's the only thing </connor>
<joey> I understand about music. </joey>
<joey> Tell me the genre of music and the mood it wants. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, you watched (murmurs)? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I loved it. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, it had the whole Icelandic </connor>
<joey> like kind of post rock drums... </joey>
<garnt> - The, the motorbike scene where they're </garnt>
<garnt> on like the motor and it's nothing but just no, </garnt>
<garnt> no dialogue, it's just them riding on a motorbike </garnt>
<garnt> with beautiful visual and beautiful music. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you remember that scene? - No. </garnt>
<connor> I remember them being terrorists. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, this is I'm feeling so fucking frustrated now. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, my God. </garnt>
<connor> - I just remember them being like terrorists, right </connor>
<connor> and it was fun anime. </connor>
<connor> - You remember them being terrorists. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I remember them blowing up shit. </connor>
<joey> - That's like saying at "Attack on Titan", </joey>
<joey> I remember the big Titans. </joey>
<connor> There's time, dude. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah... dude I remember enjoying that show </connor>
<connor> but like when I finished it's gone. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, then let's steer away, let's go down. </joey>
<connor> Let's go down to the most like rudimentary level here. </connor>
<connor> Let's let's go to, okay. </connor>
<joey> What is your favorite anime opening? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, that's good. </connor>
<joey> I really liked the (murmurs). </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<connor> - It's hype as fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, but what makes it, </joey>
<joey> like, like what emotions do you feel when listening to it, </joey>
<connor> is it excitement? </connor>
<connor> Is it like? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, so how come you can put emotion into that song but. </garnt>
<garnt> - What, what makes, what makes that memorable? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, what makes that memorable? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, the opening part is pretty hype. </connor>
<connor> You know, the... </connor>
<connor> - That's just a meme. </connor>
<connor> - I love it though, it's good. </connor>
<connor> What else do I like? </connor>
<connor> I mean, the "Jojo", the "Jojo" opening is hype as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Which one? </connor>
<connor> (murmurs). </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, no, no Jawani Steve </garnt>
<garnt> - Why does that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Why do you, why do you like Jawani Steve? </garnt>
<garnt> - When did that stand up? </garnt>
<connor> - As I said, I think I tweeted it. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, it's the "Bohemian Rhapsody". </garnt>
<garnt> - What does that mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - What does that mean? - What does that mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause there's so much going on. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a five minute song and it's just like so </garnt>
<connor> many things happening and I'm like, wow, this is amazing. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know if it's the coffee or this conversation </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm actually getting a headache. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm getting like a brain aneurism right now. </garnt>
<connor> - I imagine the viewers at home were like </connor>
<connor> what is wrong with this kid? </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like dying inside just listening to this. </garnt>
<garnt> How have I never had this conversation with you before? </garnt>
<connor> - I guess cause every time you bring a music, </connor>
<connor> I think I just go like, yeah okay. </connor>
<joey> - If we went to school together you'd be </joey>
<joey> that one kid who would wear a cocoa bean T-shirt </joey>
<joey> not knowing who Navon was, you know what I mean. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And be like be like, yeah, I like his face. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I like that team spirit song. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, team spirit, what is, it? </joey>
<garnt> Looks like team spirit... </garnt>
<garnt> So, okay what else do you value </garnt>
<connor> anything else in the anime, </connor>
<garnt> aside from like stories and characters then. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean the visuals are really important, right. </connor>
<connor> Like, I feel that it's like, </connor>
<joey> it's not so much that I don't appreciate music. </joey>
<joey> It's again, like I said, like, if it's done well </joey>
<joey> it blends in and I don't really pay much attention to it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, but you remember the "Cowboy Bebop" sound track? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, why do you remember that? </joey>
<connor> - I remember it went like really well with all the carrier. </connor>
<joey> Like what, all the movements </joey>
<joey> in that show like blended so well music </joey>
<joey> and I remember it like made them both stand </joey>
<connor> out more than anything at the time when I was watching it. </connor>
<joey> Because the carrier... </joey>
<joey> - So your argument is that because </joey>
<connor> the feeling of the soundtrack is... </connor>
<connor> - Is not an argument. - Is so completely. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just saying, like I'm not trying to argue or anything. </joey>
<connor> I'm just saying that's what I remember is cause... </connor>
<joey> - No, no because, because you kind of </joey>
<garnt> because your logic, from what I'm understanding </garnt>
<garnt> your logic is that I don't think about this too much. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you're logic is that "Cowboy Bepop" </connor>
<connor> soundtrack you remember, </connor>
<connor> because the feeling and vibe you got </connor>
<joey> from the musical so different to the visuals, right? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, because I can't put the visuals </connor>
<connor> without the music there. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so how come you don't remember (murmurs)? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Because it does the exact same thing. </connor>
<connor> - I remember like, maybe like </connor>
<connor> two scenes from (murmurs), literally. </connor>
<connor> - And do they involve any music? </connor>
<connor> - No, I remember seeing the building explode. </connor>
<garnt> - I was about to say, I was about to say. </garnt>
<garnt> The only scene you remember. </garnt>
<connor> - And I remember someone getting sniped </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> and I remember being sad by the snipped. </connor>
<joey> - I was expecting to say that you were very impressed </joey>
<connor> with the nose... </connor>
<connor> - Who this man's aim in a helicopter, </connor>
<connor> very impressed you know, must have some very... </connor>
<connor> All right, like, when I watch a show that was good </connor>
<connor> but not like, life-changing </connor>
<connor> it kind of just goes in the back </connor>
<connor> of my head and I remember like... </connor>
<garnt> - Apparently if you watch life-changing shows </garnt>
<garnt> you don't remember the music anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember "Bokurano" theme. </connor>
<joey> I remember a book around a theme. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone knows that song. </joey>
<connor> - That's who I remember from "Bokurano" the music. </connor>
<joey> - See you don't remember the soundtrack? </joey>
<connor> - No, not at all. </connor>
<joey> - I remember the soundtrack being pretty good to "Bokurano". </joey>
<connor> - No clue. </connor>
<joey> - I actually, I don't remember that. </joey>
<garnt> I just remember the opening. </garnt>
<garnt> - This man doesn't remember one single soundtrack, </garnt>
<connor> how dare? </connor>
<garnt> - Because after the last episode or sorry, </garnt>
<garnt> a couple of episodes back, </garnt>
<joey> I went and re watched a couple of episodes of "Bokurano" </joey>
<joey> just because I haven't seen it in such a long time </joey>
<connor> and the sound, I remember the soundtrack. </connor>
<connor> I was like, wow, this soundtrack </connor>
<joey> is really fucking good. </joey>
<connor> - It's like for some reason I cannot, for the life of me, </connor>
<connor> remember character names after the end of the show. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm just like, it's the blue head one </connor>
<connor> and he does something. </connor>
<joey> - It's not even monkey bar this is... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I genuinely like, it's so weird </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'll remember so many things vividly in my life </joey>
<joey> but when it comes to entertainment and stuff that I consume </joey>
<joey> it's like, already goes. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I guess that's good because you probably </joey>
<joey> just infinite rematch ability, right. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I can rematch shows on that, getting driven out, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I forget because I forget half the shit, </joey>
<connor> that I've seen. </connor>
<connor> Like what are they re watched something recently </connor>
<connor> and I remember being like very impressed. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I forgot all, I re watched "Breaking Bad" </connor>
<joey> and I was like, I forgot how all of this shit. </joey>
<joey> Through seasons one through five, I don't remember anything. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's a long show so that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - But yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's I don't know, </joey>
<joey> is that weird I'm sure that people in the comments </joey>
<connor> who are the same but like don't remember any characters, </connor>
<connor> don't remember the soundtracks. </connor>
<joey> - I've I've met, I've met someone. </joey>
<joey> - Why are you watching... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I love the experience, </joey>
<connor> it's like leave me alone. I get what I get out of it. </connor>
<connor> - Do you enjoy the experience </connor>
<joey> but you don't remember after it. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you remember everything that you consumed? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've legitimately never had this conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> Like this, this compensation is a first to me. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never, I've never had to explain </garnt>
<garnt> to someone why music is like a good thing. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] I know. </connor>
<garnt> - In terms of entertainment. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not arguing that it's not a good thing, </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't remember it. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, I am convinced right that people lie </connor>
<connor> about like when you have discussions with them </connor>
<garnt> and you're like, yeah you remember the soundtrack? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just convinced that, just like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, it was totally great. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean like the sound... </garnt>
<garnt> - Definitely people would do that all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, but like to say this not a single soundtrack </garnt>
<garnt> from like some of your favorite series that you remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't remember anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - But if you hear it, you'll... </garnt>
<garnt> - If I hear it I will recognize, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be able to pull out that memory from </garnt>
<connor> the dusty old cabinet. </connor>
<joey> - Right, but then you'll pull it out </joey>
<joey> and what you'll pull out a file that's just as good. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like nice. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> But it's like, okay, it's like, </connor>
<audio> I can remember voice performances quite well </audio>
<audio> but that's because I an active interest in </audio>
<connor> really learning those and really studying that. </connor>
<garnt> - So what do you sell makes a good voice performance then </garnt>
<garnt> and is it something that has to be in English </garnt>
<garnt> or does it how can you recognize it </garnt>
<garnt> in like Japanese as well? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Japanese too but I think that's </connor>
<connor> just from watching a lot of Japanese media. </connor>
<connor> It's something that you can, </connor>
<garnt> because the way you deliver a line, anything, right. </garnt>
<garnt> The way I vision, the align, there's a </garnt>
<garnt> when you deliver a singular line </garnt>
<connor> there's like a visualization to it. </connor>
<connor> If you imagine the pacing and the pitch like that, </connor>
<connor> in my head with a good line, </connor>
<connor> there's a set way it should be delivered, right </connor>
<joey> and that's the way the director wants it to </joey>
<joey> and then I imagined like someone like Quentin Tarantino </joey>
<audio> has the same idea where it's like the line is delivered </audio>
<audio> the way I see it. </audio>
<audio> And so it's like, I just visualize </audio>
<audio> in my head the way it should go, </audio>
<audio> like if you should raise your voice, </audio>
<audio> how you should raise your pitch </audio>
<audio> and then what when you should take it down, </audio>
<audio> when you should slow it down, when you start a pause </audio>
<audio> and it's really interesting seeing how like </audio>
<joey> some of the actors will deliver a certain line </joey>
<joey> and where they'll choose a...pauses </joey>
<joey> or how those choose to slow it down. </joey>
<joey> I think that's really interesting. </joey>
<joey> - No, I'm just saying like you know, </joey>
<joey> I haven't done as much voicing as you </joey>
<joey> but I definitely take a keen eye to voice acting as well </joey>
<connor> because I also wanna get better at it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I totally get what you mean with the cult casting. </joey>
<connor> - There's a way I wish that like, </connor>
<connor> I wish I figured out a way where I could definitively </connor>
<joey> show people what I mean in my head about that because </joey>
<joey> if you put the line on like an axis of Y on the like X, </joey>
<joey> you know, would, it would go like that, right. </joey>
<connor> It'd be like, you need to pause here. </connor>
<connor> You need to take a break here, slow down this word </connor>
<garnt> this words in italics. So please put emphasis on it </garnt>
<garnt> but not too much emphasis, let it be bold. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like really loads of nuances that we don't see </garnt>
<audio> as the audience that I'm trying to in my head </audio>
<garnt> when I'm listening to something, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm imagining how they saw the script. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to think back to what they were thinking. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, depending on what medium we're in now, </garnt>
<garnt> like and also ever since I got way too into voice acting </garnt>
<joey> I see so much ADL and it puts me the fuck off in films. </joey>
<joey> When you can hear one line that's delivered in the room </joey>
<joey> and one line, whether you did it in post, </joey>
<joey> it's so grating, when you hear just like so many sitcoms </joey>
<garnt> do this where they like have the line done in post. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't realize how many movies have done in post as well. </garnt>
<connor> I know they've done so well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've definitely noticed it recently when. </connor>
<connor> - It's so grating. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like when you notice it once </connor>
<garnt> you can't stop noticing it, I noticed. </garnt>
<connor> - And that's the problem I have with </connor>
<audio> watching shows that are dubbed in languages like, </audio>
<audio> you know, Italian or whatever or Dutch </audio>
<audio> normally they're, they'd have to dub so many shows </audio>
<joey> where they're just pumping this out </joey>
<joey> and there's not really much given to the sound of it </joey>
<connor> and it sounds like everyone's in a studio. </connor>
<connor> Every single TV show they're in no matter where they go </connor>
<connor> when I hear this Italian or this Dutch guy speak </connor>
<connor> it always sounds like they're in a studio </connor>
<audio> when they're outside, it's like, what the fuck. </audio>
<audio> I hate that so much </audio>
<audio> and that's the reason why when people are like, </audio>
<audio> oh, I watch I had a German friend who watched </audio>
<audio> "Game of Thrones" in Dutch or a German, sorry, dubbed </audio>
<audio> and I was like, why? It sounds like everyone's in a studio, </audio>
<garnt> they want a battlefield. </garnt>
<connor> - It's exactly, it's exactly the same as Ty dubs, </connor>
<garnt> when I was talking about sharing Ty dubs </garnt>
<garnt> and they just don't know audio mixing. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's sort of like making it sound </garnt>
<garnt> like they're in the environment they're in </garnt>
<garnt> it's always in the same studio </garnt>
<garnt> and instead of like mixing in the voices </garnt>
<garnt> they just like quiet every other voice </garnt>
<joey> and every other sound, every other sound. </joey>
<joey> So the voices are just like 10 times louder </joey>
<joey> than every sound effect every time someone talks </joey>
<joey> and then the sound effects get louder again. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the worst kind of audio mixing. </joey>
<connor> - That's lazy as fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I mean, now I'm not sure </garnt>
<garnt> if they did it back then, but now commonly the Japanese </garnt>
<audio> studios will just give basically a track </audio>
<audio> which is the voice is taken out. </audio>
<audio> And they are like, "Here's everything, </audio>
<joey> we've done it all for you just add the voices." </joey>
<joey> Normally quite easy, but yeah in terms of dubbing </joey>
<connor> or voice performances and anime cartoons, </connor>
<connor> that's a whole different like. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like, I feel like one unsung hero in terms </garnt>
<garnt> of like voice acting and dubbing is the voice director </garnt>
<connor> because I feel like obviously, you know, actors get a lot </connor>
<connor> of the credits but I feel. </connor>
<connor> - They also got all the shit. </connor>
<audio> - They also got all the shit though </audio>
<audio> and like the voice director has so much control </audio>
<audio> over how good this voice performance is gonna be. </audio>
<audio> Cause I've, I've definitely worked with voice actors </audio>
<connor> and actresses in my own, a bridge series </connor>
<connor> where they've they've done a great fucking job. </connor>
<connor> - And then I see them voice in like other projects and. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It's terrible. </connor>
<connor> - It's bad, it hurts me 'cause I know the potential </connor>
<garnt> that these voice actors have and I know that's </garnt>
<connor> it's probably just bad voice direction, you know and, </connor>
<connor> and a lot of people don't think </connor>
<garnt> about that or don't know that because they just think, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, it's a voice actor, you know what I mean. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's a real shame. </joey>
<connor> - It's difficult because unless you've been </connor>
<audio> in an environment where you've worked with a director </audio>
<audio> or had someone directing you in any way </audio>
<garnt> it's really hard to understand the role of a director. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't quite get it until I'd worked in that space </garnt>
<garnt> and it's kind of the person who like </garnt>
<joey> 'cause when you're doing it for yourself and you're acting </joey>
<audio> you're in your own head you're your worst enemy </audio>
<audio> 'cause you're like, fuck I should've done it this way. </audio>
<audio> 'Cause when I recorded for one of my own videos, 20 takes. </audio>
<joey> I record for someone else with a director, </joey>
<joey> one or two takes because they tell me what they want </joey>
<joey> and they help me get there </joey>
<joey> and a lot of people like there's 10% of voice actors </joey>
<joey> who can deliver lines amazingly without a director. </joey>
<joey> But then there's like 50% who need a director </joey>
<joey> and there's like 30, 40% let's be honest, </joey>
<joey> they're never gonna get any where with it. </joey>
<connor> But it's hard to say that but it's one of those things where </connor>
<connor> you do need like a good ear somewhat skill. </connor>
<joey> - It's a skill, absolutely. - It's definitely a skill </joey>
<joey> 'cause I, I personally think I'm a much better </joey>
<joey> voice director than I am a voice actor. </joey>
<joey> Even though I've done both. </joey>
<joey> I tried to like insert my own voice as little </joey>
<connor> as possible whenever I'm doing kind </connor>
<connor> of any kind of voice work that I've done before </connor>
<connor> but I really enjoyed directing because it's, </connor>
<connor> it's definitely a unique skill </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've seen how other people direct their </connor>
<connor> their work as well and it's everyone has a different style. </connor>
<audio> Some are just not effective at all. </audio>
<audio> Some, some, voice directors, you know, they </audio>
<audio> they have no idea what they want, you know. </audio>
<audio> And it's just on the voice actor to save, </audio>
<audio> to save the performance somehow, </audio>
<audio> even though the director has no idea what they wants. </audio>
<audio> Do you ever get that moment though, </audio>
<garnt> when you're directing someone and you, </garnt>
<garnt> they've not delivered the line exactly the way you want it </garnt>
<garnt> and so you have to explain it to them </garnt>
<garnt> and you get to the third point, the third </garnt>
<garnt> it's the third time, the third time you've tried </garnt>
<garnt> and they still haven't done it the way you wanted to. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you, do you continue? </garnt>
<garnt> Like do, do, do you continue trying to explain it to them </garnt>
<garnt> or do you just go with one of the takes? </garnt>
<connor> - Normally I will do, </connor>
<connor> I would try my best to explain it to them. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Worst case scenario, I'll do a line read </connor>
<audio> which a line read is you don't normally do it. </audio>
<audio> It's kind of, it's not unprofessional </audio>
<audio> but it wastes a lot of time which is where the director </audio>
<audio> will deliver the line and I'll be like, </audio>
<audio> just copy what I just did. </audio>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that's what I'll do on the worst case scenario </joey>
<joey> and if they can't do that, then it's like, fuck. </joey>
<connor> This is going to be bad. </connor>
<connor> Like if they, if they can't hear one, like what I just did </connor>
<garnt> and then they can't replicate it </garnt>
<garnt> that means that they have no idea what I just did. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - In my head I'm like, okay. They don't even see what I did, </garnt>
<connor> they don't know what they are doing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's the worst beginning in the world, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty awful. </connor>
<connor> - Today video is sponsored by Xenon Zod </connor>
<garnt> is a unique AI based animated card game </garnt>
<garnt> for the mobile that's just been recently released. </garnt>
<joey> - So do you guys know what the AI card game entitled? </joey>
<garnt> - I have no idea what an AI card is. </garnt>
<joey> - So basically the AI card game, </joey>
<joey> so in the game you get an AI buddy that you can choose from </joey>
<joey> and the choice of the AI buddy </joey>
<joey> I think there's 16 different AI characters </joey>
<joey> that you can choose from </joey>
<joey> and it's based off of this interview </joey>
<joey> that you do at the beginning of the game </joey>
<joey> that dictates your personality. </joey>
<joey> You pick the AI that best suits your personality </joey>
<joey> but basically you have an AI buddy that plays along </joey>
<connor> and helps you strategize to play Xenon Zod </connor>
<connor> which is this card game </connor>
<connor> and the AI buddy like gives you legitimate advice </connor>
<connor> on the games, like how you can beat the game </connor>
<connor> and like different strategies </connor>
<connor> and you don't have to follow the AI but you know, </connor>
<connor> a lot of the AI's are acute goals </connor>
<connor> and sometimes they're just like really cool characters </connor>
<connor> and you're like, okay, you know what you're, you're an AI. </connor>
<connor> - I'll listen to you. </connor>
<joey> - I'll listen to you, I'll listen to you. </joey>
<joey> - So as I understand it, there's also 500 different cards </joey>
<connor> with seven different categories </connor>
<connor> and I've also seen a few clips of the game </connor>
<connor> and the visuals look pretty damn </connor>
<connor> impressive for a mobile game. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] So the actual game play involves three phases. </joey>
<joey> You have the monument phase, the flash phase </joey>
<joey> and the main phase and the unique feature about Xenon Zod </joey>
<joey> is the modern movement system where you can move </joey>
<joey> summoned minions to and from mana in kind of </joey>
<joey> a really interesting recycling mechanism. </joey>
<garnt> - So as you play against an AI opponent, you can easily </garnt>
<garnt> take breaks whenever you want </garnt>
<garnt> but you can also play against PVP as well. </garnt>
<joey> - So if you download the game right now </joey>
<joey> then you can actually get your hands on 240 of the 500 cards </joey>
<joey> available in the game, just off of ongoing events </joey>
<joey> and if you use the hashtags and are ACI </joey>
<joey> on Facebook and Twitter, you can use that to connect </joey>
<joey> with other players in the game or to just battle </joey>
<joey> and flex your hot AI... </joey>
<connor> - So if that sounds interesting to you go down </connor>

<connor> today and you could get up to 240 </connor>
<connor> of the exclusive 500 cards. </connor>
<joey> - Thank you to Xenon Zod for sponsoring today's episode </joey>
<joey> and back to the video. </joey>
<connor> - I did a video series where I like fixed games, </connor>
<connor> Hentai anime I redid all the, the voice acting </connor>
<connor> from the ground up and the only rule was that </connor>
<connor> I wasn't allowed to change. </connor>
<connor> I was, I was not change anything about the voice acting. </connor>
<connor> The whole point of that was to like, </connor>
<audio> prove to the viewers that like, </audio>
<audio> listen, you could you can fix the bad voice acting </audio>
<audio> but more often than not it's not the bad voice acting </audio>
<audio> that is terrible about this series or thing that you watch. </audio>
<audio> Like it's normally just cause like </audio>
<audio> everything else is terrible. </audio>
<audio> - Yeah. </audio>
<audio> - And the one thing that stands out is this dude </audio>
<joey> who's delivering a line, like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<audio> - But that's normally as a result of everything else being </audio>
<audio> 'cause voice actors are the last priority for most things. </audio>
<audio> Because then normally the thing that you do at the end, </audio>
<audio> at some games and stuff like games are normally the worst, </audio>
<audio> worst culprit of terrible voice acting. </audio>
<audio> Especially Japanese games that get translated </audio>
<connor> into English normally have God fucking awful voice acting. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, definitely. - Yeah, A lot of those </joey>
<joey> games as well just have absolutely horrible localization. </joey>
<joey> Just the dialogue, clearly the person who was translating it </joey>
<joey> does not have the firmest grasp of both languages. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and 'cause normally they're not given like </connor>
<connor> an amazing budget to do it. </connor>
<connor> These games are long. </connor>
<connor> - They get pretty underpaid, unfortunately, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So they're just like, whatever I'll just do the bare minimum </connor>
<connor> run it through Google translate if need be. </connor>
<connor> You know, fuck it no one's gonna notice the voice </connor>
<joey> actors are shit anyway who cares. </joey>
<connor> - The Japanese wording with like, (in foreign language), </connor>
<connor> you know, (in foreign language) means mum in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - All according to (murmurs). </joey>
<garnt> - Speaking about voice actors and voice acting </garnt>
<audio> like the only person who's actually been </audio>
<connor> in an anime here is you Garnt. - Yeah, I am. </connor>
<joey> - Or like an actual Japanese anime. </joey>
<joey> Like what, what was the experience like for you then? </joey>
<joey> - That was really cool because. </joey>
<garnt> - Garnt explain like you were on "Pop Team Epic" </garnt>
<garnt> and what you have to do. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes, so just purely by coincidence, </joey>
<joey> I got to voice in "Pop Team Epic" </joey>
<garnt> even though all my lines I did were in English. </garnt>
<garnt> It was technically, it was technically Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - You were in the sub. - I'm in the sub. </garnt>
<garnt> I know because Funimation dubbed "Pop Team Epic" </garnt>
<joey> and they didn't use me. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think they're allowed to though, legally. </connor>
<joey> - No they weren't but you know </joey>
<garnt> Funimation you could hit me up bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - My DMs were open. - My DMs were open, </garnt>
<garnt> we follow each other on Twitter, </garnt>
<audio> you could have DM me anyway. </audio>
<audio> So I voiced this it was this entire episode </audio>
<joey> that was voiced in English because "Pop Team Epic" just </joey>
<joey> no rules, right. </joey>
<joey> And it was really cool because I got to voice act </joey>
<garnt> with the guy who voiced Rio in "Devilman Crybaby". </garnt>
<audio> - Oh, wow. - Awesome. </audio>
<garnt> - Because he's also fluent in English. </garnt>
<joey> He's pretty good at English. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so he and he delivered obviously </joey>
<joey> in the English part as well </joey>
<joey> and it was really cool because it, you know, it's </joey>
<connor> a lot of the portrayals is all voice acting is that, </connor>
<connor> you know one person goes into the booth, </connor>
<connor> they do their lines. </connor>
<connor> Next person comes in </connor>
<connor> and that's normally how it is </connor>
<connor> but I don't know if this is only in the Japanese industry </connor>
<connor> but at least with the anime </connor>
<joey> they put all the voice actors that are in the one episode </joey>
<joey> all into the same room </joey>
<joey> and there are four or five microphones lined up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I saw, I saw that with some like </garnt>
<joey> behind the scenes documentary. </joey>
<joey> I think how I understand the dubbing </joey>
<joey> in like the English speaking world </joey>
<garnt> is that you get one booth or one voice actor. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's one after the other. - One after the other. </garnt>
<audio> - But in anime it's you, they do it all in one go. </audio>
<audio> So if there's a current scene where there are </audio>
<joey> four voice actors, then all four voice actors </joey>
<joey> will go up to the mics and basically while holding </joey>
<joey> the script in the hand take it in turns </joey>
<joey> to deliver their line and when they're not doing their line, </joey>
<joey> they pull away from the microphone. </joey>
<connor> - I think all cartoons used to be that way in the West </connor>
<connor> but I think recently it's changed. </connor>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think one series you'd definitely see that effect in </garnt>
<audio> in is Connor Seba. </audio>
<connor> Where you can, you can tell that all of the characters </connor>
<connor> are just like bouncing off each other. </connor>
<connor> - That helps so much. </connor>
<connor> - Unlike the dub, the dub for Connor Seba </connor>
<connor> is actually great and I commend them for being </connor>
<connor> able to like recreate this energy </connor>
<joey> while not being in the same room because, </joey>
<joey> because you can definitely the energy </joey>
<joey> in the Japanese dub I mean, Connor Seba. </joey>
<joey> - That's what makes one events that... </joey>
<joey> - That's why it's so good because you can tell that </joey>
<joey> these aren't just characters that are fucking </joey>
<joey> around with one another but voice actors </joey>
<connor> that are just having a great time together. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - And you need that dynamic in a show like that </joey>
<joey> and, but it was really cool because with "Pop Team Epic" </joey>
<joey> you know, we would all come onto one scene. </joey>
<garnt> You know, there was me, you know, the main voice actor </garnt>
<garnt> and then there was like three or four voice actors </garnt>
<garnt> who were doing the, you know just side characters. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was really cool because once a scene would finish, </garnt>
<garnt> then if one of us needed to retake </garnt>
<garnt> or it was really cool because all of the voice actors </garnt>
<audio> would come together and basically critique </audio>
<audio> what we all just did in that one set. </audio>
<audio> So that we would all come together </audio>
<joey> and I would get professional advice from the voice actor, </joey>
<joey> do you feel being like, </joey>
<joey> okay that line delivered was really cool </joey>
<garnt> but maybe if you deliver this next line like this </garnt>
<garnt> then I could respond in this kind of way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And while all of this conversation is happening </garnt>
<audio> the voice director is also listening in. </audio>
<audio> So he can put in the input of his writing if need be. </audio>
<joey> So, I mean, I didn't have to do too many retakes </joey>
<joey> with "Pop Team Epic" because </joey>
<joey> the voice actor was just like, "Yeah, that's good." </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> He just did not give a shit, right. </joey>
<joey> He was just like, yeah, good enough. Fucking what ever. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean like you, you were speaking in English. </garnt>
<garnt> So he was like, yeah, this </garnt>
<garnt> this probably sounds better than most of the English... </garnt>
<joey> - The only time that the voice actor asked me to do so, </joey>
<garnt> the voice director asks me to do something super specific </garnt>
<audio> was when I had to do the narrator voice </audio>
<audio> for the "Guilty Gear" parody scene where </audio>
<joey> I had to say heaven or hell like in "Guilty Gear" </joey>
<audio> and he was like, no cause the voice director </audio>
<joey> was like a massive fan of "Guilty Gear" </joey>
<joey> so he was like, "No, no, that's not how you say it. </joey>
<joey> You have to say it like this." </joey>
<garnt> And you just broom it over the PR system. </garnt>
<garnt> All of us just sitting there, </garnt>
<joey> "Okay, I'll do it like that I guess. </joey>
<joey> - That's always such a fan experience. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it was super fun. </garnt>
<connor> - Were you nervous doing it? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Because literally everybody else around me are </joey>
<audio> professional Japanese voice actors, but it was really cool </audio>
<audio> because all of the voice actors were like, </audio>
<connor> wow how long have you been doing voice acting? </connor>
<connor> - I was like, this is my... </connor>
<connor> - This is my first Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Technically speaking this is my first Joey </connor>
<garnt> and they were like, "You're really fucking good." </garnt>
<joey> I was like, well, call your boy back. </joey>
<connor> - And then everyone cheered. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Everyone lifted Garnt up, yay. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, subscribe. </connor>
<connor> - Damn dude, oh I've had some terrible fucking clients </connor>
<joey> when I did a lot of commercials </joey>
<audio> 'cause they would bring in like a business executive </audio>
<audio> to come in and critique and they don't know anything. </audio>
<audio> They would, I remember one time there was a guy </audio>
<audio> and I did this whole take, I thought I killed it </audio>
<joey> and he was like, yeah, something's like off with it. </joey>
<joey> This wasn't the director. </joey>
<joey> This was just the guy who was paying for it to be made </joey>
<joey> and he was like, yeah </joey>
<joey> could you just try something different? </joey>
<joey> I did the exact same thing again, no different </joey>
<connor> and he was like that was perfect. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, I was like, I fucking knew it </connor>
<connor> 'cause like, I know I might head I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I know I can get away with doing the same thing </connor>
<connor> one more time but like maybe not a second time. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, I'll just try once to see </connor>
<connor> if he notices, he had no idea. </connor>
<connor> At that point on with any time he said anything. </connor>
<connor> I would just look at the voice director over there, </connor>
<connor> I'm like I would look at him. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, should I listen to this, like. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he was the engineer and the director of the thing. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So he normally does the delivery, </joey>
<joey> the way, the way it was set up for me was </joey>
<audio> he normally directed me and the client </audio>
<audio> would just stand there and go like, "Yes, yes.". </audio>
<connor> Like I was always doing business stuff, </connor>
<joey> I was like, it was like perseverance, </joey>
<connor> inspiration, shit like that. </connor>
<joey> - Did you do like a Gillette commercial, right? </joey>
<connor> Or like a, like a shaving cream commercial, </connor>
<joey> whatever it was. </joey>
<connor> - Something else ages ago. </connor>
<connor> I was doing like boats for like a year. </connor>
<connor> - You did boats? - You did boats? </connor>
<connor> - I did like, there was some, oh, I can't </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the corporation is </connor>
<connor> and I also don't know if I should say. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I'm allowed. I don't know what I signed. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Once a week I would go in for three hours </connor>
<connor> and I would talk about boats. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, how old were you? </connor>
<joey> - This was like last year? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, really? </connor>
<connor> - Every week I went in and talked about... </connor>
<connor> - This is in London, right? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - I got paid like, like fuck how much was it? </connor>
<connor> They were paying me 250 pounds an hour. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, wow. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is like 300 something bucks. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Just talking about boats. </connor>
<connor> - Which is probably like a lot better </connor>
<garnt> than what voice actors get paid to voice anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, definitely </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, anime rates aren't that great. </connor>
<joey> I mean, I don't know if you know I'm gonna, </joey>
<joey> I'll just say like... </joey>
<joey> - I mean definitely didn't get paid. </joey>
<joey> - I have heard things and you know, you get paid </joey>
<joey> on Funimation from what I've been told. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know if this is true. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but it's not, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not great, it's not. </garnt>
<garnt> Less than what I was getting. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I it's like, I think it's always </connor>
<connor> just been known that the voice acting industry </connor>
<connor> and anime specifically just like... </connor>
<connor> - You get paid the least. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you get paid the least out of any commercial </connor>
<connor> which is why you see a lot of dub voice actors </connor>
<garnt> going on to do gaming now and other industries. </garnt>
<connor> - The, the way it goes is like, it's like </connor>
<connor> normally commercials pay the most because </connor>
<joey> commercials you get paid normally a premium </joey>
<joey> and then you also get what's called a buyout fee. </joey>
<joey> So if your ad is going to be played over X amount of places </joey>
<joey> with radios, TV, that gets calculated in the cost of that </joey>
<audio> and you could get like one commercial </audio>
<audio> that takes you 20 minutes, which it often did. </audio>
<audio> These commercials are 30 seconds long, honestly </audio>
<audio> and I would never be there for more than 30 minutes </audio>
<joey> but they would maybe pay you like 15 grand for the biopsy. </joey>
<joey> So your session fee was like 250 pounds and then </joey>
<connor> you might get 15 grand or 10 depending on why they play it </connor>
<connor> and how much, because I know the guy who did McDonald's ads </connor>
<joey> in the UK, that was his whole career just doing McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Really. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you know you get paid so fucking much. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> - And then used to get like six figures, every commercial </joey>
<joey> 'cause you know that's luckily how the industry was </joey>
<connor> that you got paid if your voice is being shared. </connor>
<joey> - Can you imagine when you're paid </joey>
<joey> six figures by going, (gibberish). </joey>
<connor> - I wish man, here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> - He was like imagine, how much, </connor>
<garnt> how much money McDonald's made off of... </garnt>
<connor> - Right, because the, normally how it is with commercials </connor>
<connor> is that if your, normally with voices, </connor>
<connor> if a corporation gets one voice actor, </connor>
<connor> it's normally always that one voice actor </connor>
<garnt> who does everything. </garnt>
<connor> So in the industry where, when I was in London </connor>
<connor> it was mainly commercial stuff. </connor>
<connor> So it came up a lot and it was always like people </connor>
<connor> were competing to get that one commercial Joey </connor>
<connor> that kept coming. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, - And so I got this boat Joey. </connor>
<connor> I didn't think anything of it 'cause I didn't audition. </connor>
<connor> They like requested me. So I went in, I did a read of it.. </connor>
<connor> I was talking about, I had to explain a ton </connor>
<connor> of different things about large ships. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> For a corporation thing. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And I had to go in every week and do something ballasting. </connor>
<garnt> That was what, I did like four weeks </garnt>
<garnt> of thing called ballasting, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Ballasting is a thing and I know this </garnt>
<garnt> because I did four scripts on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, tell us then, what is ballasting, sir? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like, it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> God, I wish I remembered the words </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember every time I would go into deliver it </garnt>
<audio> 'cause my accent is English, right </audio>
<audio> but it's not a received pronunciation </audio>
<audio> which is the typical accent, which is </audio>
<audio> I say grass, but it's grass. </audio>
<audio> So every time I would do anything, he's like, </audio>
<joey> "You didn't, you didn't say the receive presentation, </joey>
<joey> do it again." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh yes of course ballasting, </joey>
<joey> you know, is the, you know, like that </joey>
<joey> and it was basically where water goes </joey>
<audio> in the ships and they dunk it, dump it out later on </audio>
<garnt> but there was like so many scientific words and I was like </garnt>
<audio> he was the sodium hydrosis collage oxide oxygenation thing </audio>
<audio> and I was like, all right. </audio>
<connor> And know, the hard thing about that is that </connor>
<joey> you could do a thing called line reading </joey>
<joey> where they're paying you to get this right first time. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So the first time I see the script is when </connor>
<joey> I go in there. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm sure that was that the same </joey>
<joey> for you with "Pop Team Epic"? - No. </joey>
<connor> - You couldn't see the full hand? </connor>
<joey> - With "Pop Team Epic" I got sent not only the script </joey>
<joey> about three weeks before I went in </joey>
<joey> but I also got a CD with. - Fuck. </joey>
<connor> - The actual visual. </connor>
<connor> - That's like amazing. </connor>
<connor> - So I can practice this ahead of time </connor>
<joey> And apparently that's normally in the anime industry. </joey>
<garnt> - But that's just like the Japanese trust system. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like, we trust that </joey>
<joey> you will not leak this anyway. </joey>
<joey> - That just sounds like a leak waiting to happen, </joey>
<joey> in any other industry. </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't sign a contract either. </garnt>
<garnt> - What, they just got to send this without an end. </garnt>
<joey> - They just sent it to me hoping that I wouldn't leave this. </joey>
<connor> - Bro, I, I can maybe count on my hands. </connor>
<joey> The amount of time I received the script </joey>
<joey> before I got that, like, </joey>
<joey> it was like never. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Really. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and so I would get the script in front of me, </joey>
<joey> I'd maybe have two minutes to quickly go over it </joey>
<joey> but they immediately expected me to like nail it first time </joey>
<joey> and again, there's words I've never even seen </joey>
<connor> in the English language the company scripts, right. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what these words are </connor>
<connor> but I'm expected to like nail it </connor>
<connor> whilst I'm also reading it for the first time </connor>
<connor> and that's what they're paying you an absurd amount for. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I, I know people who've run like official discourse, </garnt>
<connor> like...something I have to sign NDAs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Here you are to just actually, </joey>
<joey> get getting you the entire script before hand. </joey>
<joey> - Here's episode nine, six months before it comes out. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> No, it was crazy like I got it in the mail </joey>
<audio> they didn't even tell me then we're gonna send it </audio>
<connor> because I was also assuming that I was going to see </connor>
<connor> the script and everything when I got there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that normally how it is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right that's what I heard as well. </connor>
<connor> - Dubbing do that as well. - It's the same with dubbing. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I heard but not only that </connor>
<joey> but when I, when I also...in the </joey>
<connor> "Grisaia Phantom Trigger" game, they also </connor>
<connor> send me the script like two weeks beforehand as well. </connor>
<connor> They didn't send me the visuals </connor>
<connor> but they sent me the script, like the physical script </connor>
<joey> and I had to go in with the physical script. </joey>
<connor> - I think the difference is normally </connor>
<joey> in the Western industries, they're still editing the script. </joey>
<joey> Like the day off, like said normally the script </joey>
<connor> that you get might not even be the final draft, </connor>
<connor> the one that you are recording. </connor>
<connor> - It's also people don't trust anyone in this. </connor>
<connor> Which is, which is, of course, you know, </connor>
<connor> this is, this is the country the way you can leave </connor>
<garnt> like your fucking laptop in the middle of a diner, </garnt>
<garnt> go to the bathroom and then come back </garnt>
<garnt> and just trust that nobody's going to take it. </garnt>
<connor> - I just wanted to leak the poke stuff. </connor>
<joey> I don't even care, I just wanna leak it. </joey>
<audio> - Don't tell anybody about the sodium hydroxide. </audio>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that it's crazy but I mean, you know. </connor>
<joey> - Did you get paid well for the boat thing though? </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I got paid really well </connor>
<joey> but that's like that's like the voice actors dream, </joey>
<joey> is I didn't, I didn't do it for the money I shoot it </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was fun. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's same with me. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like people who go into especially </garnt>
<garnt> like the anime industry too who wants to be a voice actor, </garnt>
<garnt> they do it for the passion. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get paid nothing for those sessions. </garnt>
<audio> I mean maybe unless you're a sag actor in LA </audio>
<audio> you get paid a decent amount. </audio>
<connor> I think it's $250 minimum for a session, two hour session. </connor>
<connor> But yeah it's you get the notoriety, </connor>
<garnt> which allows you to do a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. - Right, I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I feel like nowadays there's less notoriety </garnt>
<audio> in like big voice sites names </audio>
<audio> in dubbing at least than, than they used to. </audio>
<connor> - True, they used to be cons, right. </connor>
<connor> That's what you want It. </connor>
<audio> - Yeah, yeah, exactly </audio>
<audio> but now like if, even if you get to voice a dub </audio>
<joey> in like a huge, huge show, there's like </joey>
<joey> you still don't get as much notoriety </joey>
<joey> as like say back in like the mid two thousands </joey>
<joey> we had voice sites like Steve Bloom, </joey>
<joey> Johnny Yong Bosch, Crispin Freeman </joey>
<joey> who just like those those like the triple a </joey>
<joey> voice acting voice. </joey>
<joey> - Everybody knew who they were, exactly. </joey>
<joey> But it's a lot harder in this climate </joey>
<connor> and industry just because there's so many dubs now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Everything gets slammed with like, </connor>
<connor> if it's on Funimation it's probably </connor>
<connor> gonna be signed with dubbed </connor>
<connor> and everyone watches anime like very different ways now. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean like, </connor>
<joey> like even, even going back to "Japan Sinks" where </joey>
<joey> I didn't know who any of the voice actors </joey>
<joey> who voiced in this anime where, because I was like, </joey>
<joey> I was literally switching between dub and sub </joey>
<joey> depending on which one I like to listen to. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like the voice acting </joey>
<joey> for dubs in general has gotten to like a passable quality. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] That's great. - And almost every show. </joey>
<joey> Like there, there, there are some shows that are like </joey>
<connor> this is, this is just a funny dub </connor>
<joey> but for the most part if I wanna just shut my brain off </joey>
<connor> and just listen to what the language that I want, </connor>
<connor> that I speak then I just I'll just put on dub </connor>
<connor> and I can, I can I have the trust </connor>
<connor> that it will be like a decent experience. </connor>
<connor> - Dub have definitely gotten to that point, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there's there's certainly no like </connor>
<connor> '90s quality like hilarious dub. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, which is what I feel like the whole argument </connor>
<connor> of sub versus dub is kind of like you to this place. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like the counterpoint to that is that </garnt>
<garnt> there are less dubs that just stand out now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think of some of my favorite dubs, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Something like "Baccano" and "Cowboy Bebop". </garnt>
<garnt> You know, these are dubs that stand out. </garnt>
<garnt> Like literally, like I remember how good they were just </garnt>
<garnt> because of how they quality but </garnt>
<garnt> nowadays I don't know, I can't think, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't think of like many dubs that literally just, </garnt>
<joey> okay, this everything's good. </joey>
<joey> Everything's decent quality but I can't think of anything </joey>
<garnt> that like truly stands out as this is a dub experience. </garnt>
<joey> - To me the last, I think the newest, newest quote unquote </joey>
<joey> anime where the dub was like, wow </joey>
<joey> was probably "Panty & Stocking". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that was like 2008. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that why I'm saying (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> newest in quotations. </connor>
<joey> - It's how the industry was back then, right. </joey>
<joey> You had like two weeks to just cast people, </joey>
<joey> like you had two weeks just for that, </joey>
<connor> let alone everything else but now, </connor>
<connor> you have two weeks to, not even two weeks like one week, </connor>
<connor> to cast translate and get these actors in the booth </connor>
<connor> and get a recording. </connor>
<connor> Like it's you, you can't expect </connor>
<connor> that anything good come out of that. </connor>
<connor> You can, we get the good products, right. </connor>
<connor> It's decent but we're not gonna get anything </connor>
<garnt> that blows us away from it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the last, the last dub </garnt>
<audio> that blew me away it was probably "Stein's Gate" </audio>
<audio> because it's, it was one of those shows where I actually, </audio>
<connor> I could appreciate the work that went into translating </connor>
<connor> and just scripting it. </connor>
<connor> Not just like the voice acting but like everything </connor>
<garnt> was just really polished. </garnt>
<garnt> - I believe that was scripted by. </garnt>
<garnt> (murmurs). </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the one... </connor>
<audio> - Which is why he absolutely killed it. </audio>
<audio> - That's amazing. </audio>
<audio> - Came as well, so like, because I think </audio>
<audio> with the era of dubbing, it's just </audio>
<garnt> it's a lot harder to recreate that same quality </garnt>
<connor> and that same height because they just don't have </connor>
<garnt> as much time anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - I also think at least for Funimation </garnt>
<garnt> I think when Sony took over, </garnt>
<garnt> I think they restructured a lot of it to make it </garnt>
<connor> less focused on giving a writer's time and more giving, </connor>
<connor> like getting the whole thing out sooner. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which, you know, it's understandable, I guess </connor>
<connor> but also at the same time, you kind of lose a bit </connor>
<connor> of that magic that, you know, maybe a double beep, whoa. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually here's, here's a question for you, Garnt </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you, you, you could probably judge us the best </garnt>
<garnt> but ever since the beginning of time, there's always </garnt>
<garnt> been this debate of subs versus dubs, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> The Japanese, Japanese voice citing is always great. </garnt>
<garnt> Has there been any show or any anime from your experience </garnt>
<garnt> that it's just bad voice acting </garnt>
<garnt> from like a Japanese side of things? </garnt>
<joey> - Man, that's hard to say because </joey>
<joey> at least with voice, from my understanding and my experience </joey>
<audio> at least Japanese voice acting in anime </audio>
<audio> has just had an insanely high bar to jump over now, </audio>
<connor> even ever since even you know, </connor>
<joey> like I could obviously go back to, you know </joey>
<joey> an enemy from the '70s. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And probably find some bad voice acting there </joey>
<joey> but that's because it was a medium that was still getting </joey>
<joey> refined since the '60s. </joey>
<audio> - Yeah. </audio>
<audio> - But I think honestly, every anime I've seen </audio>
<audio> since you know, the late '80s, early '90s, </audio>
<audio> I don't think there's been a, maybe there's been like one </audio>
<audio> or two bad voices or one or two maybe like </audio>
<audio> under qualified voices compared to everybody else </audio>
<garnt> in that same show. </garnt>
<garnt> But I wouldn't say there's an entire show </garnt>
<garnt> that has like bad voice acting because. </garnt>
<garnt> - The same way that there are bad dubs... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly but, and I don't know </garnt>
<joey> maybe that's like a cultural thing, maybe it's just. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's cause they've set up a system here </connor>
<audio> that ensures they're getting voice talent, right. </audio>
<audio> They have schools specifically for voice acting. </audio>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - We don't really have that in the West. </joey>
<joey> It's you go to acting school and </joey>
<joey> maybe stumbled into voiceover, right. </joey>
<joey> If that's what you like. </joey>
<connor> There's not really a system </connor>
<joey> - But their entire, you know like four year universities... </joey>
<connor> - No right, exactly it's the same reason why like </connor>
<joey> (murmurs) amazing at e-sports </joey>
<joey> they have the infrastructure there to support </joey>
<joey> like making this talent. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, in Japan, obviously they've been </joey>
<joey> having their schools for awhile where the bar is </joey>
<joey> getting pushed constantly and constantly. </joey>
<connor> Whereas it's not really like that in the West. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And you know the great thing as well with the structure </joey>
<joey> of, at least with Japanese voice acting and animate </joey>
<audio> is that if there is a new voice actor or actress </audio>
<audio> that comes into the industry, </audio>
<audio> they usually start them off with very, very small roles. </audio>
<connor> Maybe like one line or even just background noise </connor>
<audio> to kind of get them used to that environment </audio>
<audio> and give them as much experience as possible </audio>
<audio> and then maybe after they do it, you know, 10 rolls </audio>
<audio> of playing, you know, a person passing behind </audio>
<audio> the main character after the 10th time, </audio>
<audio> then they can give them a role where... </audio>
<connor> - That's like the Japanese... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, here's two more lines. </connor>
<connor> Okay, the next one we'll give you five lines, </connor>
<connor> the next one we'll give you 10 lines </connor>
<connor> and then it just builds and builds from there. </connor>
<joey> Unless if it's someone that just has insane amount </joey>
<joey> of talent from the get-go </joey>
<joey> and they're just confident enough to put them </joey>
<joey> into a show and then they make a name for themselves. </joey>
<connor> - Some of the best performances have been from actors </connor>
<connor> where like they weren't acting in any other animated shows. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I think, I think, I think Johnny Yong Bosch </garnt>
<connor> like stumbled into his first dub role by accident. </connor>
<audio> I think same would Steve Bloom as well. </audio>
<connor> - Yeah, I think so. - Yeah. </connor>
<audio> - From what I probably remember. </audio>
<audio> - It's been a while since I heard the stories. </audio>
<garnt> - Both fantastic voice acts. </garnt>
<joey> - God, I think it was the guy who did </joey>
<audio> light in (murmurs), </audio>
<connor> he did a lot of the ocean dubs in Canada, he did like... </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause he did Rock from "Black Lagoon" as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I think he was doing "My Little Pony" before. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Or he did after, I think he did after </garnt>
<audio> but before that I think he'd done anything, </audio>
<connor> I knew the guy voices was elaborate so and back in though, </connor>
<connor> I hadn't done any anime. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no I remember a lot of like back then, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the voice actors he voiced in "Baccano" </garnt>
<connor> was that, that was like the first roll. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because everyone fucking killed it, you know. </connor>
<connor> - It's really, there's a lot of unknown voice actors </connor>
<connor> and actresses in that, in our show. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Great show - Yeah, questions to you, </connor>
<connor> questions to you guys then, we've so we've the ridiculously </connor>
<connor> high bar that Japanese voice acting has. </connor>
<connor> What, what are some shows that you know, </connor>
<joey> that even stand up for you with like the </joey>
<joey> Japanese voice talent and the voice acting? </joey>
<joey> I'll tell you the show that stands out to me most recently </joey>
<joey> and that's "Beastars". </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - "Beastars" has absolutely like insane voice acting </connor>
<connor> and it's a very different because it doesn't, </connor>
<joey> it didn't sound like your typical </joey>
<joey> anime kind of voice acting, it sounded very grounded. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know who the voice actor for "Legacy" is, </joey>
<garnt> but his his acting was so good. </garnt>
<joey> - That was so good. </joey>
<garnt> - Like "Legacy" and "Lewis". </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<audio> - Was like, they both had like the voice acting performances </audio>
<joey> of that year, in any anime. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, easily, easily. </joey>
<joey> - In my, in my opinion, like even, even with shows </joey>
<joey> like "Attack on Titan Three" coming out </joey>
<garnt> that had some great voice. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I still think "Beastars" was like </garnt>
<garnt> just a cut above the rest. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's just because "Beastars" as a show </joey>
<connor> was just a cut above the rest. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like it was just such a fucking amazing show. </joey>
<connor> - I'm trying to think of any Japanese shows </connor>
<joey> that really blew me away with voice acting. </joey>
<connor> - "Jojo"? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I mean, my man Dio kills it...like that performance. </connor>
<connor> I spoke about it before, like his performance </connor>
<connor> like this Dio, like I'm not in memes a side like, </connor>
<joey> it's fucking amazing. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. - He's fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - And everyone in part five, </connor>
<joey> I would argue as well has fantastic voices. </joey>
<joey> I think the thing with Japanese voice as well is that </joey>
<connor> they can just do casting so well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they get it. </connor>
<connor> - Like they understand how important </connor>
<joey> casting is for our character. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I'm working on a video right now. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I've watched the "Clannad" dub </connor>
<connor> and there is one scene where a female teacher </connor>
<connor> is just voiced by a dude. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) - What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like I'm it's I obviously can't show this </connor>
<connor> but I'll show you guys later... </connor>
<connor> - I mean, this is why I didn't watch a dog. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It just like a scene and I watched it damn, </connor>
<connor> I don't remember this but I watched someone sent me the clip </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, that's just a dude. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> kind of like, "Hi boys." </connor>
<audio> (laughs) </audio>
<audio> "Like that, how're you doing? </audio>
<garnt> I'll get this pass." all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean there's a lot of weird things that happened </garnt>
<garnt> with dubbing back in the day. </garnt>
<garnt> We're gonna talk about bad dubs, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> You know, we have to talk about, you know, </garnt>
<joey> like "Ghost Stories" and stuff like that. </joey>
<garnt> - "Ghost Stories" is that a bad dub or is that just... </garnt>
<joey> - It's so bad that it's good dub. </joey>
<connor> - People always act, 'cause when I, when I tweet up, </connor>
<connor> you're like, hey I'm gonna fix bad anime scenes </connor>
<garnt> for a YouTube video, </garnt>
<garnt> people always be like, yeah, fixed "Ghost Stories". </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, what is there to fix? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's nothing to fix. - That thing is amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - It's fucking great. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it's just 'cause, from what I've heard about how </garnt>
<joey> "Ghost Stories" came to be made, it was "Ghost Stories" </joey>
<joey> just sold horribly in Japan. </joey>
<joey> So when they'd licenses, licensing over, </joey>
<joey> they were like do what you need to do to make this sell. </joey>
<joey> Like, dude you have. </joey>
<joey> - There is some rules, there is some rules. </joey>
<joey> - Creative control, yeah, there was some rules. </joey>
<joey> Where you basically, you basically </joey>
<joey> had full creative control and from what I heard like, </joey>
<audio> they were just, the voice actors would just try to rush in </audio>
<audio> the booth first and they would just like add live the scenes </audio>
<audio> and everyone else would have to like play </audio>
<garnt> off what they said. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It was like the first of bridge. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, essentially - Essentially. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah it's, it's weird to think right, </joey>
<joey> that dubs back in the '70s were done, </joey>
<audio> there was no email. </audio>
<audio> Like how did they do this? </audio>
<audio> There was literally a guy was given this DVD </audio>
<joey> and they would just kind of made it </joey>
<joey> and he just had the jacket. - They just figure it out. </joey>
<joey> - Just hope they did it well, like it's weird, right. </joey>
<joey> Do you think there was... </joey>
<joey> - Even then, there was a trial system. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just so weird. </joey>
<connor> You know like I guess just take this DVD </connor>
<garnt> and go home, VHS, Betamax. </garnt>
<connor> - DVD, what existed before DVD? </connor>
<connor> - Take this cassette. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Laser disk. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, laser disk. </connor>
<audio> Laser disk never took off in the West </audio>
<audio> but in Japan, they were like, God, yeah, no, it's weird. </audio>
<audio> But even then I think that's also why some dubs </audio>
<audio> now are a bit strange 'cause they were still done </audio>
<joey> on that system where if you go first, you dub it </joey>
<joey> and then the person who comes next has to dub </joey>
<joey> but they get to hear just your character </joey>
<joey> who's been before you, so. </joey>
<joey> It was last, normally is easiest time. </joey>
<joey> - Right, and that because they have to kind of go along </joey>
<connor> with oh, they perform this character in this way. </connor>
<connor> So I kind of have to do it the same </connor>
<joey> but if the first one sucks. </joey>
<connor> - It's a bit unfortunate 'cause I think it makes this weird </connor>
<connor> kind of feeling sometimes by accident </connor>
<connor> but this is again, why a director should be </connor>
<connor> on top of that show. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's, that's what, that's why like </garnt>
<audio> the director has control over how this sounds </audio>
<audio> 'cause there are definitely some dubs where </audio>
<audio> it definitely sounds like people </audio>
<garnt> aren't having a conversation. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - A voice over, I think a director's job is like 10% </connor>
<connor> to get the best performance out of you </connor>
<audio> and like 90% to make sure everyone sounds </audio>
<audio> like they're in the same world. </audio>
<connor> Like that's the hardest part </connor>
<connor> 'cause you're constantly thinking like, </connor>
<audio> okay that was a great line but does it fit with what </audio>
<audio> the other person just delivered? </audio>
<garnt> Like I need to think about that. </garnt>
<audio> - Yeah, it's a really hard skill. </audio>
<audio> It's definitely hard 'cause you have to be on top </audio>
<audio> of what everyone is saying and how everyone's sounds </audio>
<audio> and it's, it's definitely like, </audio>
<audio> you can definitely see some of the nuances </audio>
<audio> that people don't normally think about but if you </audio>
<garnt> if you play a conversation and it's just like, </garnt>
<joey> man these people just sound like they're reading lines </joey>
<garnt> to each other and not actually having a conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's really, it just sounds it's the uncanny valley. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it sounds like they're kind of </garnt>
<joey> talking through dimensions. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> One's living in one world and the other one's </joey>
<joey> living in the other world then </joey>
<joey> the rift just happened to open up where it's like, oh hello. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Hello, hi Mark. - Hi, Mark. </joey>
<connor> - God, I could sit here and talk all day about </connor>
<garnt> dubbed anime and voice acting and all that </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause obviously that's what I'm cripplingly </garnt>
<garnt> addicted to that and all that shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Probably not music. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not music. </connor>
<connor> - We're gonna get this boy on some like, </connor>
<joey> we gotta make him understand emotions use, </joey>
<garnt> I never thought I'd say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just, I wish like I wish Kevin was here. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish Kevin was like guessing in this one episode. </garnt>
<connor> - I think Kevin can convince me but like this is... </connor>
<garnt> - No, no I just wanna, I just wanna see his reaction </garnt>
<garnt> when you were just saying all this </garnt>
<garnt> stuff as a fucking composer. </garnt>
<garnt> Kevin if you're watching this, </garnt>
<garnt> I want you to just like, if if we ever get Kevin </garnt>
<garnt> on the show and we will get Kevin on the show, </garnt>
<garnt> just, I want to just hear the conversation... </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll dead ass look him in the eye. </garnt>
<garnt> - I want you to dead ass look him in the eye </garnt>
<joey> and just be like, "Made in Abyss" soundtrack </joey>
<joey> made me feel good. </joey>
<joey> - I'll do it. </joey>
<joey> - Just dead ass looking at me and just be like, </joey>
<garnt> I don't remember any of your music </garnt>
<garnt> but it made me feel good. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I heard it, I heard the sounds. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like I have the opposite brain </connor>
<audio> to like a composer though in like every aspect, </audio>
<audio> like when I talked to Kevin, I feel </audio>
<audio> like I'm on like the complete opposite mind in every way. </audio>
<audio> It's crazy, it's so weird. </audio>
<connor> I think I just have that, that kind of mind </connor>
<connor> that isn't, isn't like that. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if we can't even like relate to, </joey>
<connor> we're not exactly composers. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like you're, you're very musical though, right. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, but I'm no Kevin Penkin. </joey>
<connor> - No right, but you have an appreciation for music </connor>
<joey> something that I don't have. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can't make music, it doesn't make sense to me. </joey>
<joey> I don't understand any of that. </joey>
<connor> Like I tried to learn drums as a kid </connor>
<connor> and I was like, yes, this just doesn't work. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you follow along with like different </garnt>
<garnt> animate directors and like? </garnt>
<connor> - If you say their names, maybe. </connor>
<connor> - So if I said Hosoda Mamoru? </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<audio> - If I said Shinkai Makoto? </audio>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Your name. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> I know that one. </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, you don't know Hosoda Mamoru?? </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Have you never seen "Wolf Children"? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] "Summer Wars". </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] I've seen "Summer Wars". </joey>
<joey> - The "Digimon Movie" </joey>
<joey> - I didn't watch that, who the fuck </joey>
<joey> watched the "Digimon Movie" </joey>
<joey> - The "Digimon Movie" is fucking awesome. </joey>
<connor> - I'm joking, I'm joking. </connor>
<connor> Don't kill me, "Summer Wars" and. </connor>
<connor> - "Boy and the Beast"? </connor>
<joey> - "Boy and the Beast". </joey>
<connor> - He also did a "One Piece" movie. </connor>
<connor> - What's the jumping through time or something. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what's that one? </joey>
<joey> - He also did you know, he also directed </joey>
<joey> "The Samurai Champloo Opening?" </joey>
<garnt> - Really? - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, he also directed a "One Piece" movie as well. </joey>
<audio> "One Piece" movie, six, I think. </audio>
<audio> - That was such good fucking movie. </audio>
<audio> - I know, that was fucking great. </audio>
<audio> - I loved it. </audio>
<joey> - Did you watch the "Digimon Movie" movie, </joey>
<joey> when you were a kid? - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you remember the soundtrack for that? </garnt>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<garnt> - The hard fucking bare naked ladies, </garnt>
<garnt> and "Less Than Jake" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fatboy Slim, like whoa is this soundtrack. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was screaming '90s. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it ain't...do you remember that scene was all star? </garnt>
<connor> Fucking all star in it. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm totally serious. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking smash mouth. </connor>
<garnt> - He had smash mouth. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do they get these rights? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he was back in the day. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like back in the day of like '90s movies. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't like they had a completely different sound track </garnt>
<garnt> from the Japanese release. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So when they, when they like dubbed it westernized </garnt>
<garnt> there they put all of these like Western bands. </garnt>
<joey> - I couldn't because I watched the Japanese movie first, </joey>
<garnt> obviously but then I went to a friend's place </garnt>
<audio> and he only had the dub for it. </audio>
<joey> I was like, I've never seen the dubs. </joey>
<audio> I might as well, watch it </audio>
<garnt> and then when I heard Smashmouth I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you was playing a prank on me? </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Did you overdub this was Shrek. </joey>
<connor> - I want to now just watch this movie, </connor>
<connor> Gesture experience "Smash Mouth" and Fatboy Slim, </connor>
<joey> - Hearing Fatboy slim I was like, what was... </joey>
<connor> - It was so surreal. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was cause I didn't realize how special was </joey>
<joey> when I was watching as a kid, but now growing up </joey>
<connor> I think back and I realized, </connor>
<connor> man this was a really weird, sounds... </connor>
<connor> - It's like turning up to like kindergarten. </connor>
<garnt> They've got Coke on the table. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> All right, I would do this. </connor>
<garnt> - Fatboy slim song, was it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right here, right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was that or was it weapon of choice? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was a weapon of choice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was weapon of choice. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was weapon of choice. </garnt>
<joey> - Just hearing weapon of choice in "Digimon Movie" </joey>
<joey> - Dude just hearing Fatboy Slim, </joey>
<connor> like takes me back 10 years. </connor>
<joey> - I fucking love fat boy slim dude. </joey>
<joey> - Fatboy slim is fucking great. </joey>
<garnt> - From Brighton by the way, </garnt>
<garnt> as a born and bred Brightonian, yeah from my home. </garnt>
<garnt> Any famous people from where you're from Connor? </garnt>
<connor> - I think there was a Lost Profits, that band </connor>
<connor> but then I think they were like pedophiles, so. </connor>
<connor> We quickly, quickly abandoned that word. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> There was a band called Leo, it's called Lost Profits </connor>
<connor> and I think they were like a fucking, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> They were like kind of like a knockoff of like some way. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I remember the Lost Profits. </garnt>
<garnt> Were like the rock band that like was </garnt>
<connor> like British fallout boys sort of ish. </connor>
<joey> - Like panic at the disco kind of vibe. </joey>
<connor> - A little more Rocky I think of but yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, okay I was actually, I was watching a new anime </garnt>
<garnt> recently have you guys heard of "The Great Pretender"? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have heard of it, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Song? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no the anime, the anime. </joey>
<joey> - There's there's an anime called the "Great Pretender". </joey>
<joey> Fucking, I've only seen the first three episodes. </joey>
<joey> It's like a Netflix exclusive anime </joey>
<joey> but it seems like it's, it's fucking great. </joey>
<connor> - I saw a preview for that, I wanna watch that. </connor>
<joey> - It's a heist show that sets in America. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, exactly you're like when you think of </garnt>
<joey> heist show in anime I think of "Lupin The Third", right. </joey>
<joey> Like this I can't think of many other heist shows </joey>
<joey> but they actually, the ending for that song </joey>

<joey> - Fuck how did the get that? - I know, right, I know. </joey>
<garnt> - I sometimes wonder that because there's, </garnt>
<joey> there's a few anime series where </joey>
<joey> they've gotten Western songs, right, like. </joey>
<garnt> - "Paradise Kiss". </garnt>
<garnt> - Franz Ferdinand, yeah. </garnt>
<audio> - Did they? - Yeah, yeah. </audio>
<connor> - "Paradise Kiss" - Do you want to </connor>

<connor> - There's gotta be some, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know if there's like, </connor>

<connor> or there's been Japanese bands that have sunk English. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>

<garnt> in any anime where it's a really hype scene </garnt>
<garnt> and they play the opening song? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, good if you notice that, then you're not, </garnt>

<connor> - It's type, you, you play the opening song </connor>
<garnt> in any hype scene and it just brings </garnt>
<garnt> it from like a 10 to a 20. </garnt>

<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every time it like, every episode opens with that </garnt>
<joey> but then there are a few episodes near the end. </joey>
<joey> - Is that a bush name? - Yeah, from the future world, </joey>
<audio> it's like really good. </audio>
<joey> It's 10 out of 10 coming </joey>
<joey> but the opening that series didn't have an opening. </joey>
<joey> It just had like this chorus of kids just going. </joey>

<connor> guitar opening, platinum disco. </connor>
<joey> - Platinum disco. - Platinum disco. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, platinum disco. </garnt>
<connor> Platinum disco is really fucking great. </connor>

<joey> they were actually Changing the endings, </joey>
<joey> like to every all arc, every arc in a different ending. </joey>
<joey> I thought that was like... </joey>
<joey> - Every arch had a different opening, as well. </joey>

<joey> I thought he was like a really nice touch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like little things like that. </joey>
<joey> - That "Monogatari" policy. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I know there have been other series </garnt>

<garnt> off the top of my head. </garnt>
