<SPEAKER_00> I guess we sure used to the normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dynamics in anime yeah rather like a hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> girl turns up and he wants to have sex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with her but then he actually just start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] [ __ ] you know I'm like who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this charge like I've never seen such </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a big child in anime that's what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> welcome to trash taste I'm your host </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor and I'm tired as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we just we all just hit a very strong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> coffee but I'm again with Joey ah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no nicknames today oh I just didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think to do that or I'm keeping it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> simple I mean that's who we are right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm very tired every every day before we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> do an episode I wake up at 7 a.m. to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to a Japanese class for two hours I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like going for you it's going it's going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> forward sometimes you're too tired to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learn things and I remember being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this in university I would be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> asleep basis yeah but then they make you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> talk so I kind of yeah like how's it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> going for you cuz like me and Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have gone very different routes in terms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of our how we've approached learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese because you've taken classes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like completely like self-taught </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I realized in university how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> classes really like slowed me down in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terms of my learning process yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the biggest problem I've encountered is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> self-discipline that's exactly what I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted laughs because cuz the way I see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it right lessons are like okay if I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> keeping up with these lessons these are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the bare minimum that someone at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> any mental capacity can learn Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right so if I'm learning it at this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> structured course that anyone can do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right I should learn X amount of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese yeah because we know that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone who's like homeschooled doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like do anything and also I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a liar dude I lie to myself a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when I say I'm gonna learn Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I will do everything in my power to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think that I'm learning Japanese like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like during the quarantine because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at this point in the episode it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's pretty much done it's pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> open but like during the quarantine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know Connor you can go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese lessons really you had to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like zoom lessons I hated you and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you were telling you that like most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the time you were just playing arc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yes I am listening teachers like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah problem was right is that I was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a my class is mainly like housewives and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like people who are much older than me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right so a lot of them wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> weren't tech savvy so they were all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spending ten minutes saying hello hello </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can you hear me hello meanwhile I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> already set up I've got my whole YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is set up right okay yeah two monitors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> three mobile phones you know what I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you got the green screen yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pro streamer said like you know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like when when I'm at my PC mmm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm doing everything but what I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> supposed to be doing right so I got two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> monitors right so I can also put my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> webcam over the [ __ ] out one so and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like are you looking and I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a family yeah doing work on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other monitor yeah yeah like and I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like well Connor you're paying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for those lessons why would you not do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it I don't know I paid to be in class </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know yeah that's like that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> University in a nutshell yeah I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're you're paying to be here you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> paying to learn right oh why do I have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to get a class yeah I can just study </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from home I hate going to the class and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> having to do that and be back in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> environment cuz you know yeah how do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they get out of that but at the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time I am learning stuff like it is slow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I do a lot of study a minor in time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mainly khan sheikh sayed own teachers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kanji yeah it's it's practical japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's all supposed to be for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speaking because it's my to reiterate I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I say classes I think most people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> will assume like everyday ah I do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> classes two times a week for two hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's it yeah so not a lot of time to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learn a language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really right right so it's better than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing I guess it's much better than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> doing nothing right exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cuz for me like I've tried to focus less </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on the reading and just pure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> conversational for me yeah and actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one thing that's really helped with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is not watching anime actually but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but watching virtual youtubers so I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like I've like really gotten into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching virtual youtubers last few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> months yeah who are you into um hasta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Coco is probably my favorite on earth at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the time of right now she just had a 3d </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> debut I'm sounding like a total [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> determiner is that the one you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> seemed over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah we show that all over Twitter was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> gone I was very drunk at the time and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought she was like she was having like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> her first 3d debut and I'm like I'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] throw it throw like 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bucks whatever and then like as soon as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did like my Twitter notifications </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine getting called simple whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> virtual you know because like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually really helped my Japanese way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more than watching anime because with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching anime like I don't know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime watching experience has been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you Connor since you start learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but for me I found it a lot more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difficult to watch anime now that I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> learning Japanese because you know you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know when you like read the subtitles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then you kind of understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's going on so you want to like try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to listen in to what's what's being said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but but because you do that you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just miss what's what's on the subtitles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like been my anime watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience recently and well I imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey sit on his throne here being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yes tell me more about your struggle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what are these subtitles and speak oh hi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay one thing that I noticed that bugs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me is that now that I know like I'd say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a very basic amount right very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minute yeah like not not enough to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> an episode and be like yep I understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all that but I have to like get some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sentences right is that when I read the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subtitles and all supercruise in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese sometimes the subject at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> end of the sentence in English right yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I only the start Japanese so sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll see a subtitle that comes with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the other half of the sentence so you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing the it's gonna come out yes like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Johnson Joestar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your next line is gonna be yaki and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of messes with you and then also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just watching any hentai it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really pretty frustrating because I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more like I've realized like two minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in I'm starting to be like okay like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> guess though it makes sense to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> watch v tubers though to like learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese because like you know this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> these are real people like speaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right they just look like anime but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their mannerisms and their phrasing even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though you know they might be playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a character right yeah it's still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a real pub cause it feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're having an actual conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know like watching watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> an anime and hear conversation you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like know what I've never seen a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> real converse is in a real conversation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's happening right now and I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zoning most of it out whereas when I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching a youtuber it feels like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> genuine like a Japanese conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're actually hearing a story the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> way like any any person you talk to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan yeah look like yeah so it's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like way more useful for me in learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese than it has been watching anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> also because I guess like with features </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> again they're like real people right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the the speed that they talk at is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well is very real yes like not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overly accentuated so it actually makes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> more sense to like get used to that kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of speech yes speed then like no cuz you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know like it's it's like the anime voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think voice yeah I mean which is which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is not how real people talk like and is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is true in like I'd say dub as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you hear like a double act ER </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a dub performance and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like this this isn't how real people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk this is how kids it's very anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know so yeah so it's like it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more like watching a live stream oh so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been like I'm not gonna say that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna I'm not gonna say that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only reason I've been into you v tubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's actually if you're trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learn Japanese I'd say V tubing is much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more useful the learning is educational </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I swear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because watching anime now for me has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> become a lot harder and you get the joy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of finding that 1v2 but you can see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a little bit annoying to watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anime sometimes but then also now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I can look away just for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> second and I can still understand what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they said roughly because I'll know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> three of the the five words that they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say and yeah I had a piece together what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was being so yeah that's such a like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gratifying moment it really is and as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> well like one thing that I found really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> helpful then I thought I would dread is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like learning kanji I think learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kanji is so interesting I know you love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your conscience yeah yeah but learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been so fun because when it slowly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> starts to make sense it feels like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> RPG where you're unlocking the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you live right yeah I can slowly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> start to read stuff and then there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like multiple different like ways to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> read a kanji and then when you like know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> both it's like yeah I like that you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one is Sakai protag right right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes in is like what does this say like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> twelve episodes in it's like yeah I get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah it's been really helpful for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just learning like speaking it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> general because a lot of the words have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the same pronunciation and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously kanji is there like way to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> differentiate kanji like holds the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> meaning right yeah yeah and sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reading a whole sentence and hero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Donner's it's like it is a nightmare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's weirdly enough like if for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people who'd like to have no idea about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese it might be hard to like think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about but yeah a full-on like hiragana </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or katakana sentence is so difficult to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> read sometimes yeah whereas countries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like oh yeah I know exactly what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that means I know exactly how to read it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the way I see it is that in English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is that how we don't need to read the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> word we know the shape of the wood you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know you can see a word I know the shape </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the wood I can read it right and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think that's how kanji is the Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people where they they don't necessarily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> read it but they recognize that a shape </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they just know what's being said in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the sentence so you see in that video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can read like an entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> paragraph where you fits if it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> word is the first letter is the same the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> last letter say and you swap all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> letters in the middle you can still read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah just because of how your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fluency works yeah and I feel like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would be the same with kanji as well I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think so yeah yeah it is the same but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> instead of the first and last letters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like does this have one line in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or two like you just have to like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that but just squinting really hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay yeah there's some where there's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many lines or I'm like how the factory </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just like read it this fast like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's I mean the more difficulty is going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to start to write it right yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have like an app and then it like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like vibrates my phone if you do the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong stroke order because whenever I do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> write a kanji out in my class in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the right stroke order the teachers like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in the TV show what [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like you never really think about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like stroke order you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which stroke order is basically well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've writes it in yeah cause like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> write my asses the wrong way in English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and people freaking tell people how you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> write your asses I do push there from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> top to bottom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah most people don't yeah I do if I do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from the bottom up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like swish down with the cursive I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know why I'm like like how did you love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I I I was like I was so bad at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> English in school so to clarify right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like okay I'll just I'll just start the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> story with this we'll start strong right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was so bad at English that they like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put me with the kids who you know were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not good at anything you know like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah with I was in like the English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> class for one year would like kids with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> learning disabilities Yeah right and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember being like dude what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay I've always been like really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at most subjects in school and okay to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clarify the reason why my English was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad cuz the only reading and writing I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever did was in Welsh my schools watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> today or everything I I spoke in school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and read was in watch but I also see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knew how to spell English I speak </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> English obviously and then yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember I we did like an English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spelling test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got like everything wrong but bear in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mind I was like eight and I couldn't I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember they said like are can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> spell the word said for us I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just put like a CD but like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Zed Edie yeah and and then there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then my parents like oh no mind like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never read anything in English the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reading at all it should always video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> games so so yeah and I've got one was at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wider this story come up I forgot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saying this is weird yeah so I think I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> learned how to write because in English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is well they they in school they teach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you the stroke order I just I can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> remember this I mean I I learnt it when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we had to I don't know if this is only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Australia but like yeah I think I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in like fourth grade also I should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those papers which are half-width and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> forward yeah yeah I learned how to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when we want to write cursive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because we've already incur Civ and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it kind of became thing where for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason I just started writing some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them weirdly and no one ever stopped me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so so I just have always done like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll go into like the a and then I'll go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down and do the s up and then slash down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you write your little item number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> five do you go from the bottom or do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from the top it depends I guess like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if it depends yeah I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like sometimes how does that time I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would do it from the top but I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> distinctively I was doing it from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bottom for a while and then I stopped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that but I also used to write my falls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the correct way being for wait do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you how do you learn right for such I do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do it this way I do it that's the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I learn but then I remember I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> playing brain training and they wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accept that way of writing for this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was like eleven so then I started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> having to write falls in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Americanized way which is doing that way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then like that that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Americanized way well it's uh well I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think so yeah well you do like if looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'd like a kind of like spiky nine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right I don't think I write any letters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> starting from the bottom no no I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always how are you do your force fought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like this oh yeah I do it the opposite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way I think yeah yeah so you do from the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bottom yeah from the bottom and then I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go what do you do that I don't know some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> weird so in school did you have to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> English literature and language what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they different like this because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were two different subjects for us in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school oh no we just said English Irish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it could see I had to learn English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literature English language Welsh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literature and wash language I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hated doing that man okay cuz I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for us like maybe this is my school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maleic it depended on the day of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> week so like unlike it was like on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mondays we go through like a literature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the turn that we have to study </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then on like Wednesdays we like got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like do something else like watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like study a different text for like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> certain thing or like how to read an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> essay and write an essay on Fridays and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> she like that's a yeah we didn't I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because though just my school is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just very small as well so I probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't enough English teachers in our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> schools your the literature one and your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the comprehension one you know yeah how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> does it feel like learning a new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> language as your order now though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to when you're a kid because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I remember we had to learn a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other languages when we're when we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in school and then vanish French didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take any of that Shin arm but it's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a very different challenge learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese as like a grown adult I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say because I don't know has the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you were very much into Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> culture and watching anime helped you at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all from your perspective definitely I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think it's made it easier but like easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with an asterisk right yes like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easier to understand some concepts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> culturally that might explain some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the language right which is great but at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the end of the day it doesn't help me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in a crazy amount yeah I think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just helps me understand why certain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things are the way they are in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> language yeah you know why is it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know while you can't be direct to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> someone why why toy sue my senel yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's never you know and then I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes in your learning a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> language you're like why can't I just be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like direct yeah that's not a thing you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can't do that that's it that's true yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think learning Japanese for me I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't realize how much I kind of just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> zoned out Japanese when I watched anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> before yeah you do you filter it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're like that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nonsense to me I'm yeah yeah you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like absorbing the subtitles and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of just mute out the Japanese and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't realize that until I started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learning when I when I actually picked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out individual like how the sentence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> works and how how the language actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> works that I realize oh oh this didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> help me a lot at all but I find it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really hard in my head to recommend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learning language to people because I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like if you're not gonna like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually do it mm-hmm it's kind of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waste of time I know it takes commit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's what I said to people though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about Japanese and it's one of those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things where like learning Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you're not if you're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to do it full-time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like at least a five year thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have to commit to and if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> quick two and a half years in you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's the private rights that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so many people I get cracking emails </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about it all - god damn being what's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> easiest way to learn Japanese there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no easy way to learn Japanese no you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just have to sit down and just be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> am I about to commit five to ten years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of my life to learn this [ __ ] yes it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like any like skill chart right where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the first like real getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> over the first real difficult like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yes the hardest and once you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> past that you've gone through a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> challenge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah overcome it normally you can keep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going let's say with any craft right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like voice acting as well like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> photography anything right YouTube thank </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you yeah there's always like gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that first point where you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're starting to understand it then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get to that point we all like [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know nothing about yeah and it's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> point where if you keep going and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like starting you know really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> put in the work you'll probably see some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> results but a lot people quit at that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> point cuz like I'm always really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> paranoid and this is true in my life and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever I'm like doing a playthrough of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the game right when I'm doing something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just sub optimized yes like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes I like paralyzed myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm just like what if I'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> doing this most optimal ways this waste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of time I'm so scared of wasting my time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so when I first I'd learning Japanese I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> spent more time trying to figure out the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> best way to learn Japanese yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> guess you're the opposite sorry in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sense like I do video games I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll maximize the [ __ ] out of video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> games but everything else in my life I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's kind of the opposite with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> video games I'm just like yeah you are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> games just made to be like fun and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> timely yeah cuz cuz I'll talk to Jerry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about videos are both playing and I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like you know this is like 2% more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> efficient to dislike this method right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Jerry's like oh I don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've already put CCI learning a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> language there I'm like as long as I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> learning something in the language that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I can view is somewhat useful I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sure it's it's not a waste yeah I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's Philip there's no route to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learning a language any bit you learn of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it is like it's putting the jigsaw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> together like like everyone has a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> different path everyone learns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> differently and you're not gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discover the best way you learn unless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you actually just go out and fail at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know if I don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know I would waste like a month on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> duolingo there's a lot of time on Julie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't use foot like other languages </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> European languages I'm pretty sure it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty good but I took Japanese it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not very useful yeah yeah it was very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can get you right from the get-go light </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and not explaining why you need to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it or why what this has sounds efficient </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> teaching me the kanji for window like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's one of the first things yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was hard and like seat kanji for seat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I thought like why you teach you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this [ __ ] like I don't even know the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kanji for Monday like like why would you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> teach me winter I don't need to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this like if I do everything Windows in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the the top 100 most used kanji so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why you teach yeah yeah it's pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uncommon to say like what like I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the way it when dueling or went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it I'm at we're never gonna get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dueling respond to [ __ ] by the way yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was yeah not good I mean if we do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can call us our Julie is a wait it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tricks you into thinking you're learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no no you you know a lot of like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> useless parotid like pieces of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> information that you can never piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> together as a whole to use anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> basically yeah and it's a shame cause I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> feel you don't really realize that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're being marked off by dueling or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until like you actually start learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it properly and you like I literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have no use for anything I learn on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dueling because it was such it was such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a mess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember distinctively right like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't even know how to say any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sentences but they were teaching me how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to read the kanji of Kyoto and Tokyo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's cool but like I don't need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to know this I genuinely done if you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to Tokyo and Kyoto it's written in fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like this is something that I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need to know what I would like to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is how do I say like oh I recommend this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah I think it's I think you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I didn't know how to say I think or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that right it's like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't need to know if this is a pen okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know this is I know what an apple you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know there's some good stuff down also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all bad but I just felt like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> structure was all over the place yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cuz I remember when we first moved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before we move to Japan we were on me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and Connor were on duolingo for like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good month month and a half yeah before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moving to Japan and then we got there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more like oh oh we don't know [ __ ] so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need we need to start off by learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hiragana and cats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and I remember we just like I sat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> down and I googled like what the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> memorization techniques were and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ice I found this memorization techniques </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I can't remember what it's called I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think well link it will link it in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> description exordium onyx icon um these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i pronouncing shin over and then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> learned all of hiragana and katakana in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like one day yeah and then I told Connor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yo this this this [ __ ] was I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about this and then I linked him to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Moscow and he comes back to me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> three four hours later I'm like brah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can read it was crazy it was like I said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> earlier like when you go outside and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you've unlocked the world yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd stop suddenly reading McDonald's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> menus with nerve is that the one where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's is the mnemonics thing where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like you yeah we shape yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> would make you a sign like and and to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fair this is helic memory champions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> memorize stuff they design stories and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and shapes and objects to the memory and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that way they can recall them much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easier so it would say like ku which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one that's like that they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a chef's hat yeah give a chef's hat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you see this symbol </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like cooky it was like yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like a sign because then then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remember that's kind of dumb but then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you remember when you see it oh it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that dumb thing yeah it's really stupid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it made you remember it is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> contra counterintuitive right because by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> by remembering more stuff you remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one stuff better as a note is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> repeating the same thing over and over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the best way I've heard an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> explanation of for a is that it's kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like a your memories that kinda like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a filing cabinet right yeah so you if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just have one random piece of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> information that you just randomly file </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know they're very hard to just find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that random piece of information but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have if if that information is got a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bunch of other information that relates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah then it's much easier for you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to like find it in your memory so that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why you can just makes all things a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> easier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's I definitely feel like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I find that learning symbols for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like way easier than learning like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything else like that's why like kanji </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> has been pretty fun so yeah definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a person who like for my stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> visually right yeah yeah when I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like if you give me like a set of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> numbers I can normally remember the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> numbers like decently well like so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learning kanji is great cuz like I love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just putting like a hundred symbols in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a program and just making it test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me over and over and I'll do that for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like hours until I can remember all 100 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah yeah that's what I do and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find that pretty easy I see at the end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the day that's what is probably the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most effective right it's just right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you literally just need to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> force that [ __ ] in your head I just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing it doing it doing it and at least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the good thing about doing that here in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan is that if you then force yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to learn all those symbols is it you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just walk outside you're like yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can like use it like practically all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah yeah yeah like there's some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where I'm like I'm never gonna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't need to know this kanji and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then like two seconds later I'm on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> train and that the place has one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> colleges and then yeah I get it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like question for you Joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is I have voice man curious like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much studying have you done because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people assume that Joey's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese is like a second language right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's completely wrong Joey has a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> second first language like a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people don't know this but Joey's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese is better than most Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people yeah it's I had no idea how good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your Japanese was I just kind of thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that you were like decent huh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd like but then I came here and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were teaching kanji to like 40 year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> old people and they were like what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] I was a party and late we had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> three people from our company Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like teaching them about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different kanji structures in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that were like I'd never heard this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I'm like yeah um I did a lot like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> write a lot a lot like when I say I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said it in videos but like when I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said like I've studied my entire life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm not joking I've studied my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire life um just to put it in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective when I was like like maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 years old I know what I used to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for fun whoa I used to read the kanji </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dictionary I would literally I was that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one kid I like my parents probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought I was like borderline autistic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cuz like I would like to sit in my room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a ten-year-old and I'm like I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing better to do and I would just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to my mom's bookshelf just take out this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> massive like you know 2000 page country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and just open up to a random </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> page and just read it yeah well like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours on in and like I don't know maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how much that actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> helped me in the long run but definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it kind of got me like - like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> familiarize myself with different shapes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know in that sense I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely a lot like Conaway yeah I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> very good at learning things with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only yeah I need visuals I had learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sentences and stuff doesn't do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah no but like another huge thing for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me was probably the fact that like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mom had like this like kind of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> unspoken rule where if I spoke to her in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> English I would usually get ignored and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is really cruel especially when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a four-year-old is really talk to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> their mom about something and like but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quickly picked up on it because like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like four or five years old and I'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like to be like hey mom can I do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know blah blah should just straight-up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ignore me I'm like all right she's in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pissed-off mood but then but then the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> more times you experience I'm like oh I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to ask her in Japanese and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> moment I also in Japanese she's like yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's a genius way to make you yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my mom my mom was exactly the same okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like thank I'm like now she's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can appreciate with this when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> older but if you are you know you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting this now mom I appreciate that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that's also because like if she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't do that then I wouldn't have just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like I would have forced myself to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Thai or to use Thai you know setting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is very hard when you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> living in the country that you're using </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly you know like everybody around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> me spoke English right because I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living in Australia and like I had a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like childhood friends who spoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese but because all my childhood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends were also hafiz like me yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes we just spoke in English to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one another so like I need it away I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess my mom was like all right I need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to find like a consistent way my son is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you keep speaking the language just keep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> improving and like it really helps as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> well because my mom was like exceedingly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good at Japanese and kanji and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like that especially so like whenever I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had like a question or like I learned a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> new word I always went to my mom and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try to force myself to use that new word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a sentence and she would be like she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would either say like oh that's not how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you use that word this is how you use it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dumb little she tell you how to use this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately no when I was trying to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where's like I you just want that word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't you because she'd be like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not quite how you use it this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how you use it and then I use it again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she'd be like okay perfect and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just how I learn from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> practicality you know one big reason I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really want to learn Japanese is one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> specific series I want to experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after having learned Japanese yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the monogatari see oh yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really really want to experience the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> monogatari series after learning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese because like I love the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> monogatari series now yeah but I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I'm getting like maybe half the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoyment I could be guessing and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all the appreciation I could get there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this video I've been trying to write for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the longest time called you'll never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand initiation where because as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you said the monogatari series and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everything nice uation writes is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> phenomenon wait he's an amazing author a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of it translates pretty well in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> English right but the thing that makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> initiation so amazing is the subtleties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the way that he plays around with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the Japanese language and that [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] impossible to translate yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to make that video because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] love nishu is you know monetary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> series like more than anybody yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like how do I explain to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> english-speaking audience about how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll never understand it if you're an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> English speaker you have like a basic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understanding of kanji right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> understand not just kanji it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everything he does would play in a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I have never seen any Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> author noon and I think that's the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why so many people loved him it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like it's like wow I didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you could like he makes Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people's Japanese look Tom will read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them be like wow it's like I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this language cuz like have you ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seen the morning Qatari series yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was learning kanji the day and I came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> across one I got three country is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> four is it like Hana say all oh cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which kanji czar the one where you it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to speak or to tell a tale is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Holika i'll go yeah yeah go is like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of the meanings is to tell a tale right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and so it's I cook and one of the Tauri </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just means like thing tale yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what I saw Alec that's pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cool yeah because like because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing right with the Mona </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Vitara series that even the titles are a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> woods right because [ __ ] Momo and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> monogatari is two different words right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] mashes those two words </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> together to just turn it into one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay and like that's that's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brilliant subtlety of any show Asia I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't want to say the whole thing cuz I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wanna save it for our video okay so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was gonna ask how is it reading the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> light novel compared to watching the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime because that's something I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always been curious about how well the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime has been able to translate his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> writing right into a visual format I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think with like that's the one thing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love about shaft right is that they do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hold this like really weird appreciation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for initiations writing and yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why like you know other doggies like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> monologues are way longer than any anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> monologue Hanoi like there's so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why I would you know being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] like we just end like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like acid and ammonia Atari episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like 95% dialogue yeah but it needs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be because everything that initiation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rights is so important to the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it is really convoluted and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> does add a lot of character and like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like if you've seen one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Atari episodes you know Holly every now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there were just like these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> flashing images oh yeah that's all text </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ripped straight out of the novels yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was really confused no time yeah I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> confused a lot during about every series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of the monitor yeah yeah it is it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> very surprised how big monogatari got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it like I remember when I first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watched it and I'm like this breaks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> basically every rule of like filmmaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conventions that I know yeah it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh you know show don't tell it what a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guitar is like how about we tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everybody and show basically nothing and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just gonna enjoy this 20 minute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> long dialogue yeah and you're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] in and and it's it turns out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing and I'm like why'd why does this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work I have never seen something work so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eloquently as the monogatari series and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what surprised me is that it just became </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like for the otaku culture back then it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kinda mechanic became like a cultural </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> phenomenon it did especially in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was just unlike anything and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean you know caught on a got that he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in a sense as well I was gonna say like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I had to if I was a betting man I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would have put my money on cut on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gut that I being way bigger than yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it's kind of weird that in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> West it was like the other way around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people still don't really watch I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> capitana got to be because of maybe it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't know where you can watch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> illegally yeah yeah I have no idea how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to buy like a $400 blu-ray oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a shame it is it's got nothing to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do with the monogatari so you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a good thing recently um there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was an OVA adaptation of the first novel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that initially she never wrote it could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be Kitty cycle that's what it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like a four episode of Yale that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that came out and I was like okay it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an issue Asian it's essentially the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> series that inspired the monogatari </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> series yeah so I'm like this has to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like you know of course every morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Atari fans gonna watch it no one [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> watch that OVA </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was really sad because it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> screaming monogatari vibes it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird cuz I liked the Monica three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've watched I don't know which part I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> got up to her just a lot of it is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] many and I'm like a monkey when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I watch anime I'm like I don't want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to like think about like order and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a [ __ ] and you just put something on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and sometimes you'd like the I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know what happened in between the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> series sometimes yeah and because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so confusing there was so many times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I would start a season of one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that franchise I don't know which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] one and I was like am I on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right one or am I just confused because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's this series look I didn't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> easily the most like that is the number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one question I get past probably the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most what's the old what order should I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watch even that it's not even that comp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay but even even though if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching in the right order it's such a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> confusing show that normally you can get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> halfway through the first episode like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> season two right and you're like season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 2 I really like don't know what's going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on like what am I guess and I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have any idea what's going on the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time so right that's the thing right is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the monetary series like one season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is already confusing enough as it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in a enclosed story yeah and when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you look at it on the grand scale of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things it's even more confusing because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically initiation pull the Quentin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tarantino pull fictions yeah we like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everything is out of order but it's in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the same universe yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh I mean I don't think it matters that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much honestly as long as you just get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this it's just [ __ ] Google with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the release order it's stressful there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man it's I've somehow [ __ ] did I how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many times like when I watched the thus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Spoke Rohan cachet of EA's yeah for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> reason he Iraqi when he wrote them gave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them episode numbers in the right of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing alright so when you're watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the OVA s they don't do them in order </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and but Iraqi never do them in order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyway if I remember correctly so your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> turn episode 1 they'll be like episode 6 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like please stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you like spacebar right [ __ ] Google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right which episode is episode 1 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah episode 1 is episode 6 episode 2 is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> episode 9 episode 3 is like episode 4 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you're like why they like full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people like a George Lucas Star Wars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's like episode 4 is the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one yeah at least it's ghost episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what like three four five six one two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not even that it's just like four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nine to seven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's like why it's like this not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just how he Suzumiya like did you watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you sorry when it was airing yes so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how he season Mia had like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> broadcast order and it was it was full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely no reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just broadcasted in this random </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> order and people like I remember when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was when I was airing people were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh this is like a genius move because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like you're piecing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> together the puzzle each episode and now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's like all aired now like I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty [ __ ] sure that they aired out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the order because the [ __ ] last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode chronologically was just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most anticlimactic episode of the entire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> series so they're like are the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> episode is episode 6 fix it up just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mix up the order and people gonna call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that genius crew so it wasn't genius </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tiny Colnago was just on crew way resist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the original Japanese broadcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah cuz tiny corner girl was on a crack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know that I see I only watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it years after and now you mentioned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this before but I watched the movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> first by accident yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dumb mistake yeah this this guy can I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think you mentioned in episode zero so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most people have seen this person watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the disappearance of haruhi suzumiya </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> first which is like I wish I was still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> less confused watching that movie then I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was watching most them on igano so if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know the they made a movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right of like the thing that like tied </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole hat excuse me it was yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> disappearance of suzumiya haruhi which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fourth boy novel I don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no I don't [ __ ] know right oh I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I was in I just got into anime I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to watch the best rated anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movie you know no one told me and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> really is the best no one who told me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I needed backstory you know and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went into it I I I watched it all and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like well you know what did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it did you think it was a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> movie [ __ ] I bet kono just watch this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right after school days ten or ten ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hours and what the [ __ ] is going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well I'm like I am I'm on crack I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the school days as well like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know broke the camel's back yeah it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely the Hannah here Suzumiya </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> movie watching thing that definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like made me think like reviews gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back to like watch them yes since then I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watched the first season in the TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> series I got like two episodes into the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> second TV series where they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> repeating everything okay I would say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've already he still is very much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worth watching yeah in this day and age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of disappearance disappearance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is still my it's probably my favorite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime franchise film of all time I agree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and up up there is one of my favorite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime films of all time and this this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy apparently [ __ ] hates it so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think that the whole series just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mediocre I don't really I'd the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> season was just fine right I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching it and I was like okay I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a terrible comparison but I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like man this just feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Toradora but like worse this zero </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> romance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh cuz the whole setting reminded me so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much of like Toradora and the way that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was said that it was set in a school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I know this is like complete soup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and opinion oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I recognize this is a garbage opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the whole time I was just like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guess cuz he was just okay I was very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bored a lot of the time what she had is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only thing that made me want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch it was the fact that uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Crispin Freeman voice kion yeah he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing I would use a tree watching him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah what you said he's like saying oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I know Hana was kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another because they have ghosts what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> show can you compare Harris use Amir to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you had to the closest comparison </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the thing like Harry Suzumiya </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inspired a lot of like III came after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that that huge way I became an anime fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after that huge thing that had its </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> impact right so I think I came into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like zero attachment to it any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sense yeah because I think the thing was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hierarchy that I find really interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fact that it's one of those anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that is like really weirdly tied to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> period that it came out in much like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lucky star I feel because like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why I don't give a [ __ ] about a unit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right because like the thing the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is like I [ __ ] love both lucky star </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> especially lucky star I think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] amazing but like the problem is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that the references in lucky star and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the whole fact that it really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reflected the otaku culture of yeah is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what made that show really funny in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mid-2000s but yeah as much as I love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lucky star I can't really recommend it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to people today no and because the scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is just completely changed yeah but does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that mean you can recommend how he sees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> him here today yes I can yeah because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think I think I ruined it for myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah I think you you basically just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched the climax you you watch the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> climax before like watching any of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> build-up yeah so now you that's why I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of don't feel bad for being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I think it's not that good because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like I know I ruined it for myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it might have been the only way to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like top that experiences if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> committed to reading all the light novel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that and like the final final volume of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he was like pretty [ __ ] good so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just have to sit every night early I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have no I have no interest in reading a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> light novel ever cuz I remember like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of the elements in herre he have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been done another place in that cause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> self-referential humor in herre he I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember when that was like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> innovative thing like everyone every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] light novel wasn't wasn't trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to parody every [ __ ] every other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> light novel yeah ya know it's just it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just gotten so [ __ ] lazy with its </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> self-referential humor again like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole thing where it comes to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the time period I like animate boomers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we had it better back in oh six when her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he and lucky star came out like as you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said like the whole like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> self-referential thing and I think the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whole meta aspect yeah anime was just so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> new like I remember it was such waste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> modernism at the time because like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> remember like at the end of every lucky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> star beside while the credits were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rolling there was no ending song for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lucky stuff what it was was it was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scenes of all of the lucky star </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> characters in a karaoke booth but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were outside of the karaoke booth so you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could only hear them but the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conversations that they were having in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the karaoke booth weren't characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a conversation with characters it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was voice actresses having a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conversation with voice actresses yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and people like of course they're voiced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by voice actresses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these aren't just characters on a screen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're real people and that meta was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that was [ __ ] cool because no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other anime did that laughing sit down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna sit down and you're gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> respect this culture matter anime like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still think meta anime peaked with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monogatari like in terms of like light </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> novel light novel yeah shows adaptations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it kind of like Pete with mornig Atari </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's there's been another good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> light novel shows as well I've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better but I'd say you know Hera he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really was the first time I noticed it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Harry it was Harry he and Lucky Star and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then monogatari was the one that came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> afterwards and then it kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing out did it and now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now you see a lot of lazy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attempts a meta humor and meta jokes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like there was what one and one anime I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw recently which was like such an eye </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rolling moment is the the milfy sekai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for ads last year okay okay because it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was you know everyone thought and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it kind of marketed itself as like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a parody of the easy right because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh it's the east like a genre but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know there's a mom this time and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can eat it's different it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different because there's a mom this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time and I remember there was one joke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay they're in like they're at there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were in a hot springs right and this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one single a that's in the hot springs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then she like she like stands up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's naked in front of the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> character and then the main character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally says ah this is the scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're about to hit me right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there goes our but how about if I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hit you I bet you weren't expecting that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were you and the main character goes ah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't expecting that and the cinder a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just goes off crying and that was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> joke wow that was the joke I remember I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> remember we have this exact same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> conversation that is the kaity Liz video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like [ __ ] lights fuming a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> white this is not how you write a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> message ugh you basically explained that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the meds are before you told the mental </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> first of all I want all my anime scenes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> acted out by God like that yeah second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of all I just like where as you said you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tend to watch the trash Lisa Chi I could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give a less with [ __ ] about the East can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see I'm right there it's so like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> iterates on itself and then changes one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing it's like yeah it's like I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wouldn't be surprised this is another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slime one except he's like a green slime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next right it's just like that's gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be the next base just season two yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a green and it's just like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just I just struggle to give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about any of these are kinda come on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I wanted to watch the mum one just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the memes yeah I couldn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> muster up to like tighten up in yes it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't even that good for the memes like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was it was it was you saw the title </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like haha I can make him email </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this and if I did yeah and then I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched two episodes I'm like now I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I won't watch these Sherry's so I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about them but then I realized like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I now maybe I don't even know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> six months after that shares add that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that meme is long dead and no one's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna mention it's like by the time the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> next season comes around three months </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time no one's [ __ ] and then maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll be like a factoid one day George </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> some mommy's okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you need to watch it because for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> watching trash ISA guy or just trash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anime in general because apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's my brand or whatever it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reason I do it is because it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's just the easy turn your brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off show the season right now you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I have to be in a certain mood to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> watch something like Monogatari you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enemy like I'll just be like oh and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like casually sit down having having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like my lunch or something I'm like I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna I'm always like the antithesis of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just gonna put something on yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas whereas we've with the trashy so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy like I just sit down for lunch and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just put it on you know and I just don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to think I watch every week and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I just end and those the shows end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up watching because then they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the easiest watch cuz I I know I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting into I'm not being challenged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know I'm just like okay this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> characters gonna do that whatever how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> much of a brain did you know which which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is why I can watch them because they are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> brains I don't have to think yes you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you know sometimes where you watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a good show right and something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you just really want to be in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that right mood to watch something good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but with some with the trash shows I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> never have to be in a certain mood the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sriracha you know which is why I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> found I found that I've watched more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trash shows because like like sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know I I get ink I get anxiety </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes when if I know it's not sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's a good show but a mood do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know what I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what was the show keep your hands off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> okay right right like that was one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> those shows where I'm like I can't just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not like I can't just like watch this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah you have to commit to it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such a passionate thing where I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah just half ask this so it's one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> episode and I liked what I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but because of that I I just never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched episode two because yeah I had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be in that mood to watch it never was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard to like him stop and then get back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into yeah and it sucks because I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was a good show I know it was but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just I didn't care enough to like find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that time to be like I want to keep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching this and I thought no bad kiss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone was like this is the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show of the season yeah I'm just sitting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there like watching like the 100th </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> documentary on Netflix you know right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because a lot more with anime recent I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel this this is the reason this is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] reason I still haven't watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fullmetal alchemist okay yeah no it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> good I know it's good and I like because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's the thing I can go years without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching or reading a manga over of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> series that I know I'm going to love I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I want to be in the right mood and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it might take years it might take a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] decade okay like last year I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> finally read 20th century boys okay and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it went from like I know I was gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> read this since I basically started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting into manga - okay yeah this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like I thought one of my favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mongers of all time yeah and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] incredible it's what I had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait like so many years to experience it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I just wanted to be in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfect zone to read it and I'm so glad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did because there are some shows you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jeff some shows that you think if you re </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it you won't enjoy as much oh you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what the same heads 90% I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah because I feel like that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I caught and I can never get behind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching anime weekly cuz me can I can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I can't because it's because like I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> always in a different headspace </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes oh there's some shows that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like transcend that and like you they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so hype such as attack on Titan watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Weekly was like - [ __ ] every single </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> week no matter what that one day it came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out I was hyped as [ __ ] for that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cuz I binge that Halsey right yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was such a good episode by episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like even though it sucked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it sucked have to wait a week it was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good cuz that one day in the week you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got like a tree and didn't matter how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad your mood was away your headspace is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that for 25 minutes you just shut your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brain off and just have a [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a man I used to be able to do that so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> easily when I was in my high school in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uni but and is well joining inin like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this the discourse online you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about I feel I feel like that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a different side that I never got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> growing up with anime which is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> social aspects because for me it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just I watch a show and I'm like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was an amazing show and happy I want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> talk has quickly become one of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite parts of like watching anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's why I like I caught up to demon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slayer on episode 19 yeah like I wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to get involved with the the social </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> discourse good the great like it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> made of so if a show has like a bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ending or something I still enjoy it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because like I remember when darling the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Franks ended and there was this shift at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like episode 18 or 20 icon room the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> exact episode and then everyone lost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their [ __ ] and like it's not a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ending but I had a blast watching it you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know I just realized something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember that you know when Big Ed was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> the if if Yuri watch the sharing on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right headspace yeah I just for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason I was like I'm pretty sure if I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rewatched darker than black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't think it's that kind of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show but I remember very well I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really liking this yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm happy to leave that memory like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows like that of that like oh go proxy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for me is one of those yeah I rewatched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go proxy I don't think I'd like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think I'd like it as much but when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it I was in that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfectly writing steel like big brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> boy Moe was like yep there's there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of shows that I'm just leaving in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that bubble yeah I'm happy to talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> these shows but I never want to rewatch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> them no cuz like for me that what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one big show for me is cutting a cut on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no Kyoukai yeah I watched it when I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like in a really dark headspace I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched this one with the blood sword no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not that's beyond the battery he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said beyond the boundary yeah I'm a cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> guy yeah it's a cool kind of Canada is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> beyond the boundaries oh yeah what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] the Japanese title of yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the one with the pink haired girl in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> glasses it's about it's the one with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> assassin who yeah I was in a really dark </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> headspace when I watched that and no but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it like it was one of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> series that's I don't want to be that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy but it was like kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> life-changing for me like because okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now we need him there please please well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I was I was like I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanna get too much in the detail but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like in a headspace that I was I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like the lowest I've ever been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my life and then I watched this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> series and it connected me connected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with me on a level that's nothing else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> could at the time and it kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really changed my perception of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world and everything like that and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of this like one of my favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime of all time but because I'm not in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same head space that I am now that I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was back then I'm so [ __ ] terrified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of rewatching it because if I we watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and I just don't get that same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> connection that I'm like III don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to lose that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to lose what that series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gave to me at that time at that time of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my life and that was that's that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one series that I I really hold like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really close to me yeah and another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> series is actually Evangelion because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Evangelion I I think is one show that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just infinitely rewatchable right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah every time that I've watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Evangelion I've got a different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> experience out of a hundred percent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> agree I've watched it first time when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> came on Netflix first time I were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watching it I'd really how do you find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> her it was good I mean I think because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the mega hype showed that it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mickey Cohen expecting too much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah I mean I was I was happy with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what I what I got it was just very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> confusing it was great and I liked how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he built the world is a very very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrifying one and I feel like it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of animation struggle to do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and like a truly terrifying do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have like that one anime that as Gahan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> said is like life-changing for you yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I I mean we spoke about it last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> episode which [ __ ] up the recording </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right but yeah Bo Khurana is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely one of those shows that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely changed yeah yeah cuz it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again I think it was a similar thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was at a point where I think I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was really confused with what I wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my life yeah and it really helped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like ground me a lot and really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> understand a lot of emotions that I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> perhaps feeling we can we talk about Bo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Corrado because I want the audience to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know but yeah it's one of those shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's not the best sure but it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very important one that I think people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> should watch yeah and I don't know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to describe that's very eloquently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> disturbing but not for like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conventional reason for it being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> disturbed yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so what Bo Carano is about is there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this group of kids this is gonna sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> awesome by the way even Gillian Ripa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Veronica because there's these group of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kids and then the like I think we're on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this school trip or something school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trip yeah and then they find this all I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> remember is they find his cave with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talking head or something like no so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a guy in a cave and he's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> middle-aged man working on like a PC </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's really weird setup yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he basically asked them do you want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play a game would you like to play a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which you know anyone asking me that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever with a bunch of kids in immediate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no name and then I think they all get on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a scale or something they all turns he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> messes them and then you know they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever happens and suddenly they go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> outside or happens later on in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> evening because they're all weave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kitchen know these characters a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bit that's like how many kids is there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 12 like 12 30 years something like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around that many kids and then they get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teleported into this huge Mac and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a scary floating head that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like talking to them and and one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> children has to pilot the mech and now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna go into spoilers a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit but yeah it's it's episode one so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna spoil the premise a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to you but yeah so one of the kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pilots the mech and they're fighting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another Mac and it's to save the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then they're told </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes floating head character very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> intimidating character so they win the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> battle hurray they all win they all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> celebrate and they go outside they stand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the Mac and then one of the kids just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> drops dead and falls off the Mac then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they find out that each time this mech </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes back and they're summoned one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the kids has to pilot the mech and when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they do they're gonna die immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> after yeah but it's to save the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and what the the real beauty of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this show isn't really the mech battles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or the mech fights it's more of the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that these kids who have to pilot the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mech to save the world like every is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's kept basically kind of like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monster of the week on a show right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every week and you monster comes along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the new kids and another kid from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that group has to pilot the mech but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's about the backstory of each of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kids and just having to deal with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fact that they're gonna die yes they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just gonna die and in like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realistic ways as well like these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> characters are very believable it makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> me like uncomfortable even like thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> back to like the emotions that poured </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> out and me yeah they're like I get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very like it's really really brutally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honest look into like the human </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> condition and yeah life and especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how it's you know a lot of these kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from a lot of different backgrounds some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of them have it easier I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a one kid who's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stereotypical piece of [ __ ] but there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the kids you know who I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's one kid who's like 16 or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever nice looking after two is two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> siblings yeah and it's brutal because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this he's the one who's raising these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two his two sisters I think yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's horrible seeing him after like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> come to terms with that he's not gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> better look after his sister it's rude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something that just disturbs you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unlike a level that you can't really do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so raw it's so realistic yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know filters yeah whatsoever I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's something that already was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like not many people have watched it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's something I was really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uncomfortable it's really uncomfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to like sit down and sit through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> III admit I definitely like did not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it when I was first came out like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I definitely gave us some time yo cuz I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cuz I think the problem with boquerón on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason why so many people didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it when it came I was because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way that they marketed it was not that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good not that angle like oh it's a mecca </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> must just be in a tank yelling rip off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no world where it's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> number one anime because it's just too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uncomfortable yeah yeah but it also came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out in the time period cuz I think it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like the early to mid-2000s it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't where there was just so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Evangelion ripple eyes and like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're of like varying quality as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's another show that I [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as well which is rahxephon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh that's good that's just the revine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gilliam cool it's a ripoff but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> still really good it's it's really it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really good it's like it totally rips </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> off but it goes about it in a totally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different way from the Evangel yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and boqueron oh also sits in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> category of just shows that people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really looked over cuz premise alone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds like an Evangelion room it does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it does but the way the way they go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it is just absolutely harrowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just seeing these stories of these kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who have to come to terms with their own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mortality because it's a [ __ ] tragedy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know I mean it's different from even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get even Gilly one to me is just a nose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> raw cry for help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean that's like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't watched like everyone's analyzed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the last two episodes of Evangelion and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I I think it's I think it's going back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to that meme about the blue cut I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] sure that I know had no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> clue everyone's like oh okay the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that these lines move and the way that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like very sketchy is like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reflective of Shinji's like mental state </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meanwhile I know it's just like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't have much of a budget just just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> want to put back fairly because because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like but that's why I love that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've an kalium </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone come everyone comes out of even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting on with something different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because his message was so raw and he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put so much for himself into the series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's impossible not to like come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out with it feeling something with even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Gillian especially that I don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just uh no is just like trolling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like crazy but there were moments where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the Evangelion fanbase and like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the like super hardcore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> analysts of Evangelion I like just so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> committed to this idea of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everything and even gaily on every piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of imagery everything has to have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> meaning there I remember when uh no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> finally came out in an interview about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the meaning behind Evangelion and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just straight-up said there is no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meaning it's just the show I wanted to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make and people like but what about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that every time the Angels die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it turns into a cross and he's like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought that looked cool and all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> analysts like no no he's lying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it has to be a meaning behind I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like if the creator says there's no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> meaning what is no meaning what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Occam's razor where the simplest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> simplest solution is the best solution </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally the the actual sleep yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's like it even goin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely made me uncomfortable and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> feel bad for a lot of the characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like boqueron are just just would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I mean I'd say like even Gideon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't from like a story it's it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even remotely similar boqueron </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh like I feel like has more of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> structure around its plots where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think anyone just you ended on this you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know as I said Rourke rifle for help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from Anna yeah but Bo Khurana was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely here's here's a group of kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dealing with something that's very very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uncomfortable and you're gonna feel fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or for work and it's like it's not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the worst part that like kids are gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> die it's like sometimes it's their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] back stories of [ __ ] horrific </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and I'm not gonna say it's a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spoiler Lex it's really at all but that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was one episode in particular and uh it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like after I finished it was one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> things I had to like just sit there for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like five minutes and be like [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you can remember all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode there's one a few plots that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like one of the stories are ours just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah right at the end you think that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> expected everything right yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I love though about these like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> human drama shows is that like sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they may just be like the simplest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like just a story between two people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah one person but if it's done really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] well it can be some of the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> powerful [ __ ] storytelling yeah well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's more relatable than at most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things and it's really uncomfortable to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think that you could be in a situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you have to come to terms with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your death that's why that's why I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know I'll say this till the end of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time believe that's the whole reason why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my favorite manga artist of all time is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> any asana I was I was gonna say the one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> series that the one manga series that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like that I'm still waiting on to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the right headspace to read is oh yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> me boy yeah I've read that I've reread </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that like two or three times like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way through and every time I'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh no the only way it's just oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because it's just so like and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not just pinpoint as well like any other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sanne is just so good at writing these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> characters that are just so believable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's really disturbing when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see these characters these very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> believable characters run into these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> very believable and horrifying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> situations and you're just like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like based off like a real person's life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's just scary in and of itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this guy can just think of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like this yeah yeah and present it in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> way that is just so terrifying I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like when people like man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> danganronpa is really like despair for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please shut the it's got pink blood for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] bag like like real despair is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uncomfortable pissed off so many Duncan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Rouleau fans don't you see these </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> it's sadness and despair are just two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> totally different emotions right cuz cuz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of like those kinds of shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where you know I used the oh it changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my life kind of kind of which is really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> corny when you say it yeah but it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of those shows when you finish and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you just sit down and you just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> staring at a blank Warren you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's that big scientist you can't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like listen to the ending song so I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't listen to being silenced right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I remember being very sad and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a similar feeling watching Bojack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> horseman and it taps in the same areas I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know you're laughing by the way last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last last time we recorded this I said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an analogy we're amazing Carano right to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sum it up to you if you're familiar with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Bojack horseman Bo Khurana is imagine if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bojack horseman had 12 kids and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were all equally as [ __ ] up as Bo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jackson and then and then they all had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get sacrificed and you slowly got to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hear the backstory of these fucked-up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Bojack horseman and the children it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] up and it's it's it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different because in Bojack it's his own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fault right and yeah and it whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very very sad okay well it hits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this episode of trash taste is sponsored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> by expressvpn Wow we've changed shirts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jerry how amazing I'm here to tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> today about expressvpn now I'm sure a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of your thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I caught up how you think of me to merge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the FBI can't see me and you'd be wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in thinking well call me out like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> corner me wrong it doesn't save you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> only expressvpn can save you and your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> browsing history as a lot of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> websites can still see your browsing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> history or your internet service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> provider can see what websites you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> visiting because of your IP address and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly that's why I never go online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> without expressvpn also the good thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about expressvpn is that you can bypass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> geo restrictions so say for example I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to go onto Netflix and watch I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Harry Potter but it's not available on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese Netflix so what do I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I tap on expressvpn i rerouted to the US </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Netflix and boom there it is all of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Harry Potter because sometimes I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to watch anything I want to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> some goddamn hair good thing is if it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't matter if you're on Verizon or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Comcast or whatever ISP you're on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expressvpn will hide all the information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all the traffic that routes through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your router from them so even the ISPs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't see your browsing history and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing is it runs so smoothly that most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the time you don't even realize that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you have expressvpn on and the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing is expressvpn is available on all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> devices of </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> taste - line more links in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> description below </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back to the video cuz I think one other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> series that I watched that just hit like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really deep is this for like for episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ova based on this novel called no longer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> human which is like a classic Japanese I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all summer yeah yeah yeah that is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably one of the most harrowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> things that I've watched never heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about that what is it rights what it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> written by this guy called docile summer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who is consider like one of the three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> greats okay traditional Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> literature he was like a guy for the big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> three what's the story on this one um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's been a while since I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched it but I'm not sure if it's his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like water biography or if it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> based on his life story but it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> based on his life style okay so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just based on this life story about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy who just who just keeps taking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Elle's man like imagining four days take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine if you just take elves your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire life and you're just looking for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one win but no you just you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just keep taking LS your entire life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it sounds like the Joker it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy just gets more and more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depressed as his life goes on because - </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is based on his life story so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this character it's someone who's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clinically depressed you know and he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so depressed that's you know he tries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking his life multiple times I were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with with you know woman that he's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with or just people that he finds and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then he just he just keeps living which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is actually true like the author </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tried committing suicide one or several </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times and then he succeeded yeah he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually succeeded so that's round </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> himself yeah so that's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> headspace of the author who wrote this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and like it's like it's this the story's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I can't wait so he died yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he finished after finishing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this door that he finished this was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> last novel here oh yeah yeah so it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] it's the most like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one long suicide no then yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yes cuz it's just like a raw peek into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the headspace of someone's is almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> depressing absolutely good that's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really good piece yeah because like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's just this it's just based on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his life story and all the shitty things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that happens to him and then it ends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with just you you think that you think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's found like of this ray of hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you think he's he's fine his ray </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of hope and then he just gets [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> once again like imagine if someone has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stage 4 leukemia and then you just find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out he has AIDS as well and then he gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kicked on and then you just kick on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kick him while he was going yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like how it ends is that he's like he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like so like he he doesn't even think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that died like if he commits suicide </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not even the right way to end it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's called no longer human because he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like he's so he's so low that he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just doesn't he's no longer human </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like he's no he's no longer is in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> human world and it is the most harrowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing I've used harrowing a lot because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know I don't know why I mean the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> only way to describe the tone I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if you you're essentially reading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the default right yeah yeah that's that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like yeah yeah it's it's brutal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the only way to describe it I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I like those experiences but they are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like you said over there you have to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the right headspace because I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you go into it like already like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty [ __ ] up like you're not feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's yes talking to do great for your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mental I think I think the one problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is well with no longer human and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason why probably not a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> late know about it yeah is that not just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because of its like subject matter but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just the fact that anime fans today know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does I or some movie for that one boom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go stray dogs character like a people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh does I yeah he was my husband Oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in bingo stray dogs not knowing that the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> real does I was the most depressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] over in like all of Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literature and he wrote some not just no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> longer human but he writes a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing pieces of literature yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because again he based it so much on his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> real life in the fact that he was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] depressed as hell yeah and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cause like I feel like you have to be in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the head space to write something that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> powerful is that raw that just hits and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just cuts that deeply it's like an Edgar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Allan Poe situation yeah yeah like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't write dark poetry like that unless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you had a [ __ ] up life growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry sorry to bring a downer of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> episode people watch bottom line is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know regardless of the fact that we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did like talk about a lot of light </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depressing pieces of literature and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> media like just because it like puts you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down at the end of the day it doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean it's something that people should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> skip over I think that it's equally as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> important to experience those kinds of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm anime and I like to do that so that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm comfortable with having those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> emotions prop up sometimes right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I can I feel like I haven't be some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience dealing with them maybe when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's someone else is a lot easier but if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you do get to that point where you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starting to feel like that it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay I can I understand where this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> coming from yeah yeah maybe I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better how to processor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like question to you guys going off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this then but it's a bit less depressing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has there been any shows or any anime in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your in your history that has like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> affected you in any way not just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not just like in the negative aspect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously or just rethinking I would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like black but I think me like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one as much as I hate to use the word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> change my life for me was like and this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is gonna sound cliche as [ __ ] but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Clannad was one I totally understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I laughed it comes from I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a handful of people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> laughed at the same time right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so cliche now to say that climate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> change I play when I watch that like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way through it like straight up cuz </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was not a story [ __ ] me out that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was the first time that I'd like in not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just an enemy but in any piece of media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I just [ __ ] broke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah because especially that second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> half of Clannad after story it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most brutal power yeah those two the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> longest build-up right and just I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think I'll be able to that's again like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going back like milling topics that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another show I don't think I'll be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just because again I'm not in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> headspace and it's just something it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not just like the fact that it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a sad anime but I think it's just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fact that again you've been kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> following these characters lives all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> way through where like where as like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most you know visual novels or like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> romance stories would end with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> couple getting together yeah why med </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> took that one step further and showed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you as the title says the after story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right of like what happens and I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just seeing that made these characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even more relatable to me and that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time where I was like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what family family is cool man like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> family's [ __ ] door like before that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> family was just like a Christian man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know concept of like family was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just very much like everybody else was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah of course family's cool like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah everyone wants a family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like Clan that was that one show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that really dug into like just how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> important family is and I think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I mean as weird as it is to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I watch Clannad I became way close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to my family and I think that's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be pretty wholesome that just it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wholesome and I'm like and that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really changed my life I feel really bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now cuz you're talking about how can I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> change your life I couldn't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> finish the first thing yeah and after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> saw yeah and I said oh the whole time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm watching cloud I'm like when's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna get good I am don't [ __ ] sing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that dango song I dare you to sing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> song cuz like I remember watching the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first eight episodes and I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this this is trying really hard it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> very boring yes but that's the problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right is that like the thing was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first season of Clan I never say to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people hey you should watch the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> season recliner yeah because I know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on the grand scale of things the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> season [ __ ] appreciate the second season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the problem you can't jump into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> off the story without having experienced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these characters yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it is important because a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> these characters do make a very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> significant impact in after story but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess you know it's really hard I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> especially now like baby back then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could make so much 25 episodes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] to get a good payoff but now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't do that I just don't think you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> can recommend dirty right because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the story structure and the joke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> structures that help in it's just so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> overdone now that laying down it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seems like an aged version of everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can see today but back when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Klein I first came out in like 2009 I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> believe yeah that's about 2007 mm what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are you choosing me or the first season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember thinking like this is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like shittier a school dynamic which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> garbage do you just watch every high </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school and a man just like yeah it's in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> high school yeah it's the same I like to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compare the high school animes since you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> won't like dynamics they got going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and see what all the uniform is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> difference okay I like going off topic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I remember the first time I watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sarah from the end and I remember it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was like a show with a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> post-apocalyptic show right about like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how vampires had taken over the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and then for like four episodes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just a [ __ ] high school and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like well why is there a high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that if there's one show that doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need a high school dynamic [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> show I'm like guilty cuz like I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only guy I think you read is read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all of that manga so far lizards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know I'm the complete opposite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> guilty I've never consumed anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it which is so weird because for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the longest time I don't know if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys got these messages so many people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were asking me to make a video right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got a really big female fault yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah you notice I don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's been a single an achiever that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> made a video on it cuz we use they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all because they're all dudes you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> females we have the first episode of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> zeref the end was like I wanted like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> best first episodes yeah I remember for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a while the we'd had is such a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first episode in the Rye not even the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lines really good world ending Wars and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then at Yale except high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it gets really good again when they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leave high school it does quickly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> abandoned man I'd like to think that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the artist the other author being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yes it got really good and I'd say well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like about two-thirds through the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I hasn't finished yet but about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two-thirds for the manga artist right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now it gets amazing yeah and then it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> goes like not so good yeah cuz did the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manga deviate from the anime because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember watching all of the anime and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it was one of those shows where I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> had a good time watching it if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> remember correctly the manga was really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really similar to the show right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they build on a lot of the things that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thought were really interesting on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show amazingly in the in the manga as it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes on yeah but then it became really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird and world ending what kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trigger II Ryan it's yeah I don't really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the main main like the final </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> villain that they have as well it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a fine it's fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's is one of those shows where I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I had a good time watching you I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna really watch it I'm probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not gonna remember most would you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recommend people to read it or watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I haven't done either yeah if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you I would say watch it and if you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what you watched and continue onwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I'm gonna probably enjoy it I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah okay up to a certain point and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll start to be like confused and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's good there it's good I like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they did a lot of things and like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> much Trump said in seventh I like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they did things I like the things I did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I totally get it because I actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> agree view like oh yeah it was good IIIi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> had a good time it's it's like it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most six out of ten ever it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's very decent and I have no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minimal complaints yeah there's not much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to it and you're just kind of like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happy I'm happy with what happened I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't want anymore it was before I had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like five II sakai to watch every season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but and this is took the space of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when this came after right after the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hyper-v someone attack yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember everyone was Hyper's fought for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this and yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like so off even though I thought about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the alley was pretty [ __ ] high </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just kind of just it just didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> take off and I don't know why that's it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right it is well because the anime had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an amazing like fight scene it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like a like an orchestrated like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fight like they were hunting down these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vampires really cool episode and for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some reason that wasn't enough it's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of those shows that weirdly like I hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> some people talk about talk about but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really see anything about you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what I mean yeah because I think people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who read it are really really into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah it's good I think the problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with it is that I just kind of liked its </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> own identity when it first aired because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when it first night I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I made a joke that I was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a taco and blue exes with gay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vampires very much is like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> amalgamation of a lot of different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aspects yeah yeah and the main character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is kind of annoying yeah that's true as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well that's never good it's annoying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like I like all of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're getting a lot of this one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm just kind of wish would just be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a little less like potent you know yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there's a lot of shows like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there where I've read the manga after it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and no one really spoke about it and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like I don't really know I like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> certain black clover </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like low I didn't repay man hey man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> black clover is good I'm repping black </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> go off for 40 minutes about it my monkey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> brains like taking over now some reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I always end up reading the manga that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no one [ __ ] talks about or gives a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] about and I don't know why I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cuz because I don't know anything I find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it more interesting because no one told </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm definitely in that phase right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I'm just like I just want to find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the weirdest [ __ ] like unknown manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and just like talk about okay like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know that I know it's not unknown at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I read terraformers just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like no one speaks about it and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember liking what I saw of the anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which like is the anime adaptation was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> horrible or but I remember enjoying the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> concept so I went back and read all of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it I had a [ __ ] great time yeah their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> form is also amazing you should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely read it if you get the chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> super gory terrifying cockroaches yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> great time really good if you've seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thumbnail that Connor is made about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his cockroach story that that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> terraform a [ __ ] well let me give you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a 30-second pitch right on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terraform is sir.you these as an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expedition to Mars and as these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cockroaches </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are like absolute Giga Chad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cochrane like the most but like Jim bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cockroaches and then they want to bring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> them back to earth to see why they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like this who made these cockroaches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like this because there must be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something and then they then it turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out that yo these guys can fight and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then the humans get injected with an bug </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> DNA insect DNA to become superhumans but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then they still keep getting destroyed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the Giga Chad cockroaches and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just a great war it's a great time in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> politics lots of game of throne politics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ask things involved yeah it's fantastic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lots of deaths yeah it's great because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would think that a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> straightforward plot way it's about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> action big cockroach fight big bug boy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and but then it's just certainly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then it really quickly why you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> big boy because you'll never feel as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> excited for learning one bug like cuz I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember right I remember thinking when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was in like high school the mantis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shrimp coolest bug in the world the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mantis shrimp is is that he's not the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one that like pun they can punch it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the speed of sound oh yeah it punches so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hard that it can't be contained and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aquarium this thing is like like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then when they made like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> human formed with a mantis shrimp out he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was our P but uh I've gone off topic but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember think you you read </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like a vide any chapters of this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking that it's just gonna be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big man punch bug man like you down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fripp then it quickly turns into like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the weight if f was trying to take over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Mars and get these samples there would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be a lot of [ __ ] up politics involved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with what your country is gonna want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah and so it devolves into a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of that it's really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interests wall buildings done really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] super [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really recommend it sorry they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned from a 30-second pitch into a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> full discussion but there's a great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manga and if you if you like something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like dance something like that yeah boy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel right at home for you yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think I've rented just after I read guns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cuz I was looking for something very low </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> effect for that kind of yeah I was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the I was in like that edgy teenager </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I resisted living my edgy teenager face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like six months ago I read yes I read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> terraformers like yo sometimes sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the edgy teenager phase like you never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grow out of it you know I I [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going back to my edgy teenager phase cuz </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I I really want to reread Gant's as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ganses [ __ ] great that's like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> defines what I was into as like as like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a late teen it's like really it's a sexy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> girls cool yeah when he starts just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay this is scenic dance and like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> guess we sure used to the normal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> dynamics in anime yeah rather like a hot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> girl turns up and he wants to have sex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with her but then he actually just start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] [ __ ] you know I'm like who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this Chad like I've never seen such a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big child in animated Oh what the [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was on the train reading this as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a terrible manga to read on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> trains every time I flick the panel or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just be naked tits yeah it's so weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's like not even remotely like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> realistic depiction of it's so because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then suddenly she's obsessed with him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after it's yeah but the one thing that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing about gansan and I could I would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like to sell people on is one the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monster drawings and the same do not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> want you do not want to watch the I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what that's awfully good because Gantz </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is like like peak mid-2000 gonzo CG it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you think CG today's bad watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> watch Ganz and you just see how bad CG </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was back there so remember the I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely just messed up CG of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even the opening is like let's see how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> many times we can rotate this camera </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> heads we make everybody sick hopefully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have it on screen right now so you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> suppose you'd saw everything was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] banging oh that song was so good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> my rip slime a drip signed by every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched it I was like I'm about to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> throw up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so amazing if you enjoyed the good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> parts of darling in the Franks like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mystery and not knowing anything about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the world and wondering like oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how does this all function yeah if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like that aspect of world building your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> love dance yeah I was really impressed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the world building in Gant's because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not not to spoil how it ends but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the actual ending of Gans itself was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like very very antique </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> questionable but the actual answers was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like that that kind of like that wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like that you know that big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> brain like me felt like oh my god like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it it's [ __ ] great like it's one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the few series that I've seen that has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> built up this huge mystery and has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> delivered on it and has delivered on an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> answer though that like I said it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> satisfying the actual ending is not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> great but the answers for the main </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mysteries were very satisfying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and amazingly yeah the explanation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for all the stuff that was happening is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very cool yeah and I thought it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting but there's also some stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the manga everybody's read it will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know what I mean there's a part where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a character does blackface and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> suddenly like - oh my god I completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forgot six months ago and that's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scene where one of the characters goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to shoot up a thing in public goes to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a public shooting that's oh my god now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> though it's like really breathe at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that is the most don't cancel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the it's a normal Japanese guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he wears black face but then he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just is drawn like an actual black guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's really really unkind yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes you're like and then that was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> moment where I went online you like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is anyone else realized how [ __ ] up it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they immediately everyone was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we you know it's good but we kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> turnable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the one thing that makes it really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hard to recommend because it's a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting series and that does a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of cool things but then it's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] like that part is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you could recommend it to edge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people yeah yeah yeah it's just too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just it's just like a example of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that hasn't aged well because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I when I've read that as a kid I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know there's a lot of nuance that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> lost a Japanese called yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still even for Japanese standards is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty awful it was like when Gant's was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like serializing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was very like lopsided in terms of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like is not I care if the Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> audience is concerned with it being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> racist yes like it's it's like it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's definitely the one giant stain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on like Gantz in general I think so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other than 3d CG that's a pretty damn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing I mean that's just the stain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just like the [ __ ] stain on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a Hannah live-action movie didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they yeah but the live-action was not as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> horrible as a lot of people thought it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was going to because I watched the live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> action and I was like it wasn't amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> late solid 5 out of tango but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's definitely a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> questionable CG about it because of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> course Japanese live-action is Lee right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the way that they actually like did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole Gant's thing in the whole feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of it the flag the whole like despair of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh [ __ ] this wall we don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] is having yeah it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really well in the live-action what do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think is like the best live-action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> animated movie cuz that's hard one is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Gintama oh yeah a live-action I was I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> never laughed that hard watching a live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> action and late not even like I'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about like Dragonball Evolution </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like ironic laughing like it's genuinely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> funny thief it's genuine it brings out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the Gintama spirit so [ __ ] well and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know how the hell they did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you read a Mongol against i'ma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch anime like in telling you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no way this can be live-action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah no [ __ ] way Lee you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> translate this comedy into live-action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but they somehow did it lad to do it I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the casting was perfect the Cossack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your tricks I've no idea even the action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scenes because the second half of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes into like the first story arc of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Gandia yeah and concludes it and I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like wow this is actually like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good CG really good choreography and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like very believable Gintama be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I would watch that again that's how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good I was pleasantly surprised with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Jojo part for maybe really it was like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't like him yeah he was like fine I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't like some of the scenes that are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty good I mean that's that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing it was live-action anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movies right the bar is so low that just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah listen is it good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all of these other [ __ ] morosely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being passable is like the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> compliment you can give an anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live-action I remember watching the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ghost in the shell' live action and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> remember how offensively average it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like it was like like like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't form an opinion in there cuz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like it's okay it's like it the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ghost in the shell' was really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like if you watched it as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ghost in the show live-action it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a four out of ten yeah but if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just watched it it's like if you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thought like okay this is just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> standalone like sci-fi complex you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish Aleta the battle angel was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really good and you told I forget that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a yeah I think that's one of the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I like anime or manga movies we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> had really I mean it was the ending was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just whack but I mean everything up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> until the ending for me Aleta was very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much like goes in the show whereas like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as I put it higher than ghosts in this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you have you read Aleta why I watch the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> show he's read everything that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've watched the movie right yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess I bet if I watch the manga I'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah very much like ghosts in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> show eat them hug haha but I read the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> manga I'd appreciate but I'd like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moan room if you it's like goes on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> show right like people who are fans of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ghosts on the show before there was live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> action were like that was a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adaptation of goes on the show yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Elite is the exact same as good as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> standalone movie but as an adaptation of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a leader it was pretty weak but at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least the Hollywood ones are better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than their Japanese being like Nazis I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> got invited by madman in Australia as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you go to the cinemas on the date like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can bring a plus-one so I brought my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> best friend quite a huge anime fan and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we watched it and we just kind of sat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there as the credits were rolling and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just looked around like how was that my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends like I know you got me in for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> free but I want my money I'm like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I kind of have to agree with you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there man right no because I like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cousin who I've been trying to get into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> an life like ages biggest Norma you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of think of and then I was working </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I was like I was like recommitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> attack on Titan because that's like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the perfect game yeah yeah its attack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on Titan and then he [ __ ] ends up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching the attack on Titan live-action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he is like yeah that wasn't very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good I'm like why why oh you were almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there you are this close and now like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now whenever I recommend attack when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tight I'm like no no no trust me the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime is so much better he's like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like is it the same story but like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah hey my son no but there's this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> character called Levi he wasn't in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> live-action because they couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pronounce his name oh really the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why Levi is not in the live-action is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they were like these are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese actors I don't think they can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pronounce the V sound and I'm like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't realize this was written by a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese oh yeah yeah people like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason why microwaves come with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> instructions they need a hand to hold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] movie stay away from the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> movies though I say from all our movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the only one I should enjoy it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is edge of tomorrow which I didn't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one was really good Tom Cruise Tom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cruise Tom Hanks out yeah I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really cuz I didn't even realize that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was based on a manga yeah all you need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is kill just like the edgiest title ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah all you need is kill all you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> see it's actually based off a novel that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was later adapted into a manga that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> written by about the takishi Oh Oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> straight for death night right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah which is also very good manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well so when I saw cuz like I picked up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the novel walls in Japan because I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like all you need to secure [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah dude that's awesome and I read it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the novel is really good but then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like when they were promoting in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bookstore they were like Tom Cruise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movie coming out soon I was just like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no oh don't be one please please Tom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't do this but of course I had to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch because I'm like alright this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna be pretty it's probably gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] let's go watch it was like oh good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give you this one Holly was good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you didn't do it you do it was it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it and I was like oh I gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go read the source material now and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was quite different from the source </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> material wasn't exactly the same but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how you adapt a live-action movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in my opinion gonna change some things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there is something that is just if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a concept in a story that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know will never work in live-action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't put it in yeah it's so simple and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yet there are so many [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> productions and directors who are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh we can do it yeah we definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> assassination classroom giant yellow guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] man CG we'll fix that is a weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> adaptation I I don't know why but I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slowly started to find myself like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching live action anime movies why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would you do this to your thing cuz it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just gonna give me [ __ ] watching trashy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> secure huh it's just a guilty pleasure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me now even if it's because I watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the erase live-action as well and even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> though I didn't like erased Len that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Netflix right yeah but purely just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was like oh it's it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's the puffy example of curiosity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> killed the cat right because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so curious to be like this how could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they possibly adapt this and then I go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into it I'm like amazing I just wasted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an hour and a half just some anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adaptions you just know we're gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yeah there's some you watch for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> train wreck but not all of them like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oratio need to watch The Full Metal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Alchemist live-action I don't need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watch that to know it's gonna be [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's the one I that's the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing I still haven't you know I'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> do guys alchemist isn't that good [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you talk talks for Metallica miss sucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what we guys on in the story yeah run </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> story it's just awful I mean the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> reason I watch The Death Note one is cuz </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know wow I know I wanted to be you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know able to help with the discussion on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Twitter and then oh yeah yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean I got a great video out of it but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if you call it yeah exactly right you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can clown on it it's great cuz </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's gonna be waiting for it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't clown the already strong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because no one gives a [ __ ] well that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why I didn't make a video of you well I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> watch you while they sit down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hi-y I mean I've done that I've done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that with more I think there are more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime live actions that I haven't made a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> video on than ones that I have made a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video on just because no one needs to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know this is [ __ ] I just need to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this because everybody already knows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's [ __ ] like I didn't have to make a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video on the parasite live action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because everybody knew was gonna be [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I needed to know that it was gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be [ __ ] and sure enough and I found out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was absolutely gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't blows my mind that sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they may only make the anime to promote </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the garbage movie yeah like with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> parasite one of those situations I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kaiji The Gambler one yeah that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely that anime was just made to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> promote the movie yeah yeah and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> movie with Ali I actually like I enjoyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the kaiju movie in this like really can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> peek on away you know I mean it's kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of but in what world would you choose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the movie over the anime oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right because like watching watching the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Kaiji live-action was kind of just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching like some you know k drama or j </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> drama so you want to show work ideas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly so V yes so it's it's it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a gambling what it's a gambling story so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy racks up this massive massive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> debt I forgot what why he backed up this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massive debts oh come on why did her for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some reason yeah so so basically he gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an offer from this like mysterious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> company that can that can clear his debt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just says you need to go on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ship and you're gonna play a bunch of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> games and you if you win these games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then we will clear your debts or you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go into even greater depth yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the basic premise is just Kaiji on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ship or just like after after the ship </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hawkes over it's just him going through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bunch of different gambling games and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just trying to clear his debts and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he's not Opie so that's like the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> part yes genuinely he loses a lot very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much as he wears and it's great because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you generally don't know if he's gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lose a winner yeah it's a very quotable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> job it's really a lot of watch it I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> think mainly because for some reason it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was only published in 480p really yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah he was only published yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> came out in 2000 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well it was only 480p and I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like when I was watching him like West </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was what's this like so just know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you watch it it's gonna be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that but it's definitely worth your time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought the reason why people didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch car shows because of the art style </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think is that and I think um I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a ton of reasons why because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's got like zero female </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters in there I think yeah I can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> remember a single - got a lot of ugly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bastards that's cozy right imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine an NCR plot but instead of sex </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just watching a guy it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gambling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just NCR gambling that's just crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> okay but it's [ __ ] great so good I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> going from watching Kaiji to I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know how you pronounce it caca guru it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was like how can I watch this [ __ ] when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this gambling is so fake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah yeah it's all just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gambling to serve the plot so I was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Chi Chi it felt like real gamble it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like this through if they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay how do we make these hot girls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> orgasm yeah gambling let's just throw it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the main character always wins </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless it doesn't really matter then she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't win and it's like haha you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't expect well that's like yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it didn't matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah exactly it's like like there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was a one dumb moment that's apart I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dropped the series when the girl with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the gun playing Russian roulette and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's obvious no one is going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to die in this situation don't pretend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like someone is going to die because I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not stupid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then I couldn't watch it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> further somebody this is just dumb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas if that wasn't IG well it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's gonna die yeah which is great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because but then it wasn't sure maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> both of them could die we don't here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the best part about Chi Chi is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that like you just genuinely don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the melodic IG is the narrator's voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah why is that why is that just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that narrator in like every [ __ ] show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that time because you know epic I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> lost I already see it's an anime you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know you eating like you know watch you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this Netflix show this narrator comes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> out you know a nude what's the follow-up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> series the spin-off one with the middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> management whatever tonegawa </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> very disappointed yes if you want if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want kaisi then you it's better if you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> then after I watch much comes on like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to learn show I mean show uses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese chess er I don't even know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to play chess and yet I was like sure </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> to play chess right yeah I know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> basics that's good [ __ ] sock it if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm playing weight a chess anime but of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seekers no because I I actually really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> want a chess on amigo chance you'd be so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> good a Nana might be so [ __ ] - I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surprised there hasn't been one year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because like how big is chair how big is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chess in Japan isn't it's not very big I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mean I guess if you're gonna play chess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it's there's plenty of knocks I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think a lot of the grandmasters are from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan oh yeah that's true actually but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah I feel like chess because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember I go like sucked into this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube hole of just like watching a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of chess I had no interest in chess I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like wow this is actually like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting cuz the history and just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entire premise of the chess is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really really interesting the fact that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd like a lot of history yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like off plate like it's basically like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this massive tournement hog you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enemies times there's like reading about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of like some like the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> historical chess games it was like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I have no interest in chess but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was [ __ ] hype and I was I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember thinking man listen works so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well in an anime or manga setting so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> went out to try and find a single chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime or manga and there just wasn't one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all right I was really really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> disappointed it's it's surprising </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly because like I think the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> state </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with chess in anime is like you know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] like transfer student who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also happens to be like the daughter of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the German company like the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> chess is used in anime is to make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> someone look smart yeah like there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason for a leash to play chess you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever lead with the king corner for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> example do it you wanna tell people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about your hidden like [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yellow chess champion sir why is 13 no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 12 I just started high schools after I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> left primary school I was playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> professional chess yeah and like parama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like how I ended up in playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> professional chess is we had to begin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with because I never like played it much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just liked video games along yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video it was the only video game that my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dad would play with me yes yeah no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal chess right but like I remember I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was playing it like year three how old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you in year three in the UK like eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nine eight nine and the chess club is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only for the like the last year which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like all the 12 year olds yeah and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember they wouldn't let me play with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them but one they let me play with them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and this is so anime right because yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because after outside of the Chess Club </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd beat their best player in a game of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chess right and then they'd like no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you gotta let this guy play with us yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so I beat them all and then I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing happened for like three years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> until is my time to join the Chess Club </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was allowed to join the tribe yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I was let I joined the Chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Club and our school had lost like every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> single chess tournament ever right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because yeah it was like a local I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even know we had this there's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> local circuit right between all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> schools played each other like football </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah the other sport right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's one for chess and uh I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that we started playing in that and also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy who is number two in our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> testings I have number one we were both </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like equal yeah which is also very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> animated everything on par with mine my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> whole chess like experience its genuine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like an anime I'm gonna keep talking on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's more stuff to it yeah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just started like winning everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like against every other school like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't even close I remember like these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kids were bad and I remember every time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like wait they would be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shocked at how quickly we would beat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these kids yes yeah it's very different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a professional chance to playing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody doesn't in professional chess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's a long thing and I'll get more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into it later but and and these were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> games I could win in 20 minutes all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like I could see how they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up and I would take it and I to me it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just made sense right I didn't practice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just good at games and it made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sense and then one time there was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> school and these guys have been like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> number one for like ten years in a row </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something because they had a guy who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was someone's parent and he's obsessed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with chess knows like he's very very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good chess and we beat his team and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like shocked they were like nany </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you beat like the prodigy like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a sports anime this is a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sports anime good bass a chess Mong off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of your wife I remember thinking like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was weird because this guy was making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a whole come up bear mine I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 12 I don't know what the [ __ ] was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on and this guy's making like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> whole commotion he was like shocked and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was sitting then he was like walking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me through everything you did and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't know I didn't write it down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cuz know she's gonna write it down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> national chess and he was running it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down and I thought that was weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I said why would you write down your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moves you did you did them yeah you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna go back and he was like which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one which moved why did you move here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how did you know how to do that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff and I was like I don't know I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like did it yeah and then he spoke to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mom and was like you should come to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing yeah it's like it's weird it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 200 kids come to a place yeah by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way chess for like kids is a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird kind of thing that's it's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just adults pushing a bunch of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> young bridge kids yeah so I went to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> location and there was like two three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hundred kids all just playing chess then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you would get like an opponent and if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanna lost you would then play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone who is like one yeah and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> more you kept winning the more you would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> go up and then eventually people who won </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all their games go on to play for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the area is the best horn Hawkeye was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> killing all my games right and I had won </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like four X you play 7-iron by won four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in a row they were really easy my friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is well he'd lost like two and then he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was already out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [Applause] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> see you in the finals like it's weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I never had any like a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these kids as well they would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> studying it in between games but I would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just whip out like Pokemon and start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing it yeah oh it's my time to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and save play but I remember said like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my 5th game was against the guy I beat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my school my prodigy team whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and I took play him again and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drew it was really like anticlimactic I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like [ __ ] I beat him last time I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to beat him again anyway I got on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the team and I was ok I was struggling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cuz this is where it was getting really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> serious like I was decent enough where I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could win like 70% of my games but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was still starting to get like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> long cuz chess games never went more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than an hour yeah and then they start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> becoming like two hours yeah and I'm 13 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like this is Tana taken I just want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to play [ __ ] but I start winning and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I got content they're like hey do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to play for your country and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like sure I guess I'll play for my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> country why not yeah I'm doing good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough so I turn up I go to the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tournament you won't believe because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was number 10 so there's 10 seats right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah one is the best 10th was so I was I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was the worst on their country what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the country 13 yeah yeah guess who was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> number one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've told you guys this yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was like the main bully at my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school called make this [ __ ] or not it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was like the main bully at my school who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like no one knew he did this he pointed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] we're like the flash back he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the main rival </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally was the kid that everyone was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> scared of and I remember thinking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> man he was really good at halo wars mm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that was weird right and then then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> suddenly like he's really [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at chess he's amazing and he was winning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a law against like uh like really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wicked good players bare mind when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> got to this point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was pretty much me him and eight kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are gonna go to Cambridge know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean the environment was really weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well and I remember just that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I really started to not enjoy chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anymore is that when I remember woman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I lost a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got [ __ ] bollocks by [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the coaches they were furious at me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they would take your sheep right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you had to start riding at them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they would take your sheet and they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> would rinse you for your moves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they wouldn't they would watch you the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whole game so that's like always an area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of path where they can watch you yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember if you made a move that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was under five minutes that was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mistake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you got [ __ ] rinsed Frisch's they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were like you didn't you didn't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> long enough I've got to go through the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> options cuz it gets to the point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like you know that they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking just as many moves ahead as you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are yes I just get really difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like [ __ ] like I haven't studied </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> enough at this point because I never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> studied chess yeah but this is where I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was getting to the point where I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> against people who are naturally pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good but also was studying all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah alright and it's just a really bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> environment I really didn't like it it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like like where I would finish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my games and I play pokemon they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to talk about so why did you move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rook to you know f2 you know why did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do that did he was really impressive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when he moved his guys I was like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we are playing chess for eight hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> today I do not want to talk about Jesse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just yeah it was really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> environment and I could I think if I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> came into chess later in my life I would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have had a more healthy enjoyment of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chess yeah I still like to play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> occasionally but I think I'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scarred from yeah the anime experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I had yes was like that's what I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> found to find so fascinating about chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like like here like talk talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to you hear your chest doing like hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it like reading up and watching like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Magnus Carlson's I think yeah his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stories and and how you were just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were just born and you just got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game there like there are people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just studied the game yeah and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there are just people who just like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> genius is it and they don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's it's like it's [ __ ] family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> horn blows it's [ __ ] fascinating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it was weird because you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like no matter how good you aren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something and like how much raw talent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have it's something when you start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> competing at such a high level you start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to realize that like it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as much but also you meet people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also like yeah you know there might be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like ten people in that country you also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have that same raw talent yeah right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's like [ __ ] yeah cuz then it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starts to come it's like who can put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them cuz I didn't care about chess I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> never cared about chess I was good at it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just played it because such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing that our protagonist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where where is the protagonist were to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> go to my point lost and then been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna dedicate my life dude I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like Pokemon Ranger just came spinning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just kind of like it gets to that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point when your life or you're like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just I don't need this anymore and I and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember my parents are so sad because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I don't know why my parents were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so invested and I think that it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mixture of proud and also they love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bragging about it of course your series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got canceled for failure at a spinoff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right so what happened is about when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like 15 16 or 17 I had like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rejuvenation of my mind enjoyment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember a website called MLG game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> battles remember that I remember that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's where you could like compete </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> against carpet jiya hooch s I remember I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would compete against like fully grown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> men and beat them on Yahoo chastened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gets her pissed off and then I I joined </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the local pub and that was a weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience so I joined the local pub </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> chess team and I remember Behrman they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were all like 80 to 40 year old men yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never won one time I was playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> against a guy who looked like Ross Kemp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the baby's like a skinhead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terrifying dude like he's like this over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the table like a brick [ __ ] every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> every bouncer you see at a nightclub and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like well I'm like like 15 16 like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this with my coke and he had like a pint </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like smoking like coke like Casey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> checking my phone I don't know if that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that pissed him off but in between moves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't look at what he was doing I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would just check my phone and I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm normally thinking in my move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't really pay much attention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and I remember when I beat him and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he looked really [ __ ] angry I was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> scared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like believe you've done this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people people didn't like losing to a 15 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> year old battle for the law I mean yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can understand I'm just really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> committed to making this a manga Nelly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah please cuz like from a narrative </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective there's so many interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ways you could tackle just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yes how come I want to take like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> concept of like you know your friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being beaten in the preliminary just cut </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the scene where you're like in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> final and your friend is like that one </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> remember they try to teach us they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like why don't he use the Indian prince </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opening of 1970 I was like yes they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would they would when I would do an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> opening move mmm I always did the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opening moves I just liked it it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah nice and central reactant and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would they would always say why did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you use that this person like yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I said like the Indian prince move of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 1764 yeah I was like I just like how the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bishop ghost just feels nice you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just feel it don't you explain it when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're a kid cuz you're just like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just thinking four moves heading you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if this goes here and this goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here and this goes here then you go that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know I mean I just it's like any any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sport I imagine where kids are really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good at it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah adults are really pushy and kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like almost borderline some of the kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd say they'd like a predatory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> relationship with it yeah yeah because a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of them again like I said there they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were very rich parents whose kids went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to very good private schools and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were destined to go to Cambridge or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oxford no matter what and they would you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know exactly what I mean what kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kids I'm talking about yeah you spoke to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them you're like we're from a different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really awesome yes despite their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> entire wall to them yeah it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that was forced upon them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was you know it's something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that looks good on the resume when right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah yeah I'm very like yeah I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be fair it got me a few good jobs or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> helped a lot I remember some job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interviews where they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing chess and they would bring it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like oh that's cute you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> good that's already you know I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like a really interesting story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have yeah bottom line we need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to turn this into an anime yeah if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone was like I want to like make a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chess anime I would absolutely find out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like talk dr. Khanna has a very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three stories race because like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just it's the perfect chance to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teach people about how to play chess as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well I think it's a really good game and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's one of my favorite things to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sit down and talk to someone about just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk and then VHS yeah it's a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good way to and I just have exactly and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's also fun beating people who think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that good a chance you'll meet people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who have just been like studying chess I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mean it's getting really big on twitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right now yeah exactly white people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are like you know they're like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> getting into it yeah and just like Tom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thumb yeah it's like well you cuz okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the thing right here's the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> part about chess professionally is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you normally know like five or six moves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in if you've lost or not but I have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> play it for another two and a half hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and all it is the difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> casual chat and professional chess is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the casually you always think you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> win if you outsmart them yeah personal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chess it's just like how do I drag this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> out enough so that maybe they'll make a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mistake yeah yeah that's all God is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> horrible it was awful I hated it cuz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just got to the point right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the [ __ ] point in this it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like been control online it's just I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just I'm literally just being awkward </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you just go along in the inevitable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah yeah and it's like I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up I [ __ ] up thirty minutes in I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna put up with this but you know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like loading a game of League and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five minutes in like your own sighting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is someone sensing the jungle is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> afk are you like can I just can I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can I just F F now we just F F like is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like a diamond like a diamond </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> game right now I know no one's gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make a mistake you know I never got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> praised for winning games they would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> always be like good job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when they would praise me when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I made it [ __ ] hell for the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I this poor girl I I dragged it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she made a mistake to a stalemate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Barrett this game went on for like three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours and 20 minutes or so it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> something [ __ ] long and I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd lost like an hour in a hundred </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> percent yeah and I just made it awkward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't playing to win anymore I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing to make it awkward for her yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so I did things that you wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally do to try and win would you do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it to cock-block everything still annoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> them but she was getting so stressed and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember being like this is kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fun but also like I hate this whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jurors when I got back it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coming back into the football locker </SPEAKER_03>
