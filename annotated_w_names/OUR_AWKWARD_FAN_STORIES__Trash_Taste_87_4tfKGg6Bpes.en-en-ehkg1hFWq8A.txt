<joey> - It's time for dinner! </joey>
<garnt> - Back in my day, people talked face to face! </garnt>
<connor> - Ass to ass! </connor>
<connor> - Ass to ass! </connor>
<connor> (soft music) </connor>
<garnt> - All right, Joey, do the intro. </garnt>
<joey> - All right, hello, my bass boosted brethren. </joey>
<garnt> Welcome to another episode of Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that was- - That one sounded so sad. </garnt>
<joey> What the fuck? - That was an old school </joey>
<garnt> Joey intro. - I know! </garnt>
<garnt> I'm bringing back the alliteration. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] For one episode! </garnt>
<joey> - Even though that was not alliterated at all. </joey>
<joey> - You sounded so depressed, though. </joey>
<joey> You sounded so depressed. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, Mudan let's do this again. </joey>
<joey> Mudan, base boost me when I say this. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back my bass boosted brethren brothers! </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<joey> I'm bass boosted boy number one, </joey>
<joey> with bass boosted boy number two and three. </joey>
<joey> - Hello. - Hi. </joey>
<connor> - Hi. </connor>
<connor> - My permanent life is bass boost. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I was going to say, </connor>
<garnt> that's just your voice, isn't it? </garnt>
<joey> - It never got turned off. </joey>
<connor> It just got left on. </connor>
<joey> - Put up the treble on Connor, like, really high. </joey>
<garnt> How you boys been? </garnt>
<garnt> - We're good. - We're all tired as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my... - What? </garnt>
<connor> - "How are you doing?" </connor>
<joey> - What, am I not allowed to ask how your day's been? </joey>
<garnt> - I just kinda wish you'd asked me </garnt>
<connor> with a little more enthusiasm. </connor>
<joey> - How you guys doing? </joey>
<joey> How was your weekend? - How have you been Connor? </joey>
<garnt> - How have you been? </garnt>
<joey> - How have you been? I'll be a therapist for this week. </joey>
<garnt> - Thank you, Joey. I appreciate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] How are you feeling? </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like you need a therapist, Joey. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel like you've almost been canceled again </garnt>
<connor> on Twitter for saying more hot takes. </connor>
<garnt> - Is this gonna be the weekly thing </garnt>
<connor> or it's just like review possible cancellations? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Cancellation of the week. </connor>
<garnt> - Cancellation of the week! </garnt>
<garnt> - And today, on the chopping block today! </garnt>
<garnt> - I just found it funny that after all this time </garnt>
<joey> you actually go out your way to watch Anime again. </joey>
<joey> - The one time I tweet about Anime, </joey>
<joey> and I almost get canceled. </joey>
<garnt> - Joey has the first Anime take in what, like, six months? </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the take? </garnt>
<connor> - The take- (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Remind me. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> So let me bring you up to speed, right? </connor>
<garnt> Because this is a multi-layered thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is like a multi-layered meme. </garnt>
<connor> - Multiple angles to cancel. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so it started off, </connor>
<connor> the layer first starts at the Kson episode, right? </connor>
<garnt> Which pictures of us recording, it just went up, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Thankfully, a lot of people loved it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a great episode, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But on one segment of that show, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's a highlight clip of it, </garnt>
<garnt> is where we talk about the "Jujutsu Kaisen" Anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's because we were talking to Kson </garnt>
<garnt> about what Anime she's watched recently </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, right. - It was weeks ago for us. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, after me finally having seen it </garnt>
<garnt> a while back, I was like, "Oh, I think this might be </garnt>
<garnt> a perfect time right now, </garnt>
<joey> since we're already talking about the Anime, </joey>
<joey> to kind of go into it a little bit, talk about it, right?" </joey>
<joey> Give our thoughts on it. </joey>
<joey> Our hot takes, if you will. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And my hot take of "Jujutsu Kaisen" was me saying, </joey>
<joey> "I thought it was okay." </joey>
<garnt> (Connor and Garnt giggling) </garnt>
<joey> And then followed by, "I just prefer "Demon Slayer"." </joey>
<connor> As an show, right? </connor>
<connor> And there's a fucking highlight clip. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you are clown for that opinion. </joey>
<connor> I gotta admit, right? </connor>
<garnt> Maybe, I don't know, the new season though is kind of tough. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, at the time of recording though, </garnt>
<connor> that was a clown take, but now, okay, maybe not. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, was it clown take though? </connor>
<connor> Because it's literally... </connor>
<joey> 'Cause in the clip, I'm pretty sure I said something </joey>
<garnt> along the lines of, "Jujutsu Kaisen" had everything that </garnt>
<garnt> I thought I was going to like." </garnt>
<garnt> But for some reason, whatever it was, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't even give a proper, viable reason for it </garnt>
<garnt> to just say that for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> it just didn't really click in my head. </garnt>
<garnt> Never did I say that the show was like mid </garnt>
<garnt> or that the show was bad in any way. </garnt>
<connor> I just said, "I thought it was okay." </connor>
<joey> Twitter went ballistic over that. </joey>
<joey> And there were a couple of videos- </joey>
<joey> - How ballistic are we talking? </joey>
<connor> Just a few angry people or? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, Twitter does what Twitter does best, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Just over blows everything outta proportion, </garnt>
<garnt> but I even had a couple of people tweeting at me </garnt>
<garnt> videos from small AniTubers being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Joey, you're getting canceled." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Oh, God, what now? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it for something I liked on Twitter? I don't know." </garnt>
<garnt> And I went to look at it and it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Joey's hottest take on "Jujutsu Kaisen"." </garnt>
<garnt> And on the thumbnail, it just says, </garnt>
<garnt> "He thought it was okay." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh, my God!" </garnt>
<garnt> I can't even call a show okay anymore </garnt>
<garnt> without being canceled! </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<garnt> So that's layer one, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Layer two is when I started watching </garnt>
<garnt> "Demon Slayer" season two recently, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I made a tweet, first tweet in six months about Anime, </garnt>
<garnt> where I said something along the lines of, </garnt>
<garnt> Started watching season two of "Demon Slayer" </garnt>
<garnt> happy to say Zenitsu is still </garnt>
<garnt> the worst character in the show. </garnt>
<garnt> All the Zenitsu fans went ballistic, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> As they do. - Of course they do. </garnt>
<joey> - As they do, calling him best boy and whatever. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] They stand up, wearing those diapers... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> Just pooping violently with rage. </connor>
<garnt> "How dare you-" </garnt>
<garnt> (imitating sharting noises) </garnt>
<connor> You know? (Garnt and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> But then some people took it back </connor>
<connor> to that recent fucking clip </connor>
<joey> of me talking about "Jujutsu Kaisen", </joey>
<joey> saying that "Demon Slayer" is better than "Jujutsu Kaisen." </joey>
<joey> And they had the audacity to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, now he's backpedaling! </joey>
<joey> Now he's backpedaling! </joey>
<joey> He hyped up "Demon Slayer" so much, </joey>
<garnt> even comparing it to "Jujutsu Kaisen", </garnt>
<garnt> saying it was better than "Jujutsu Kaisen", </garnt>
<garnt> and now he's saying that 'Demon Slayer' is not a good show." </garnt>
<garnt> Which I never said, mind you. </garnt>
<garnt> I just said Zenitsu fucking sucks because he does. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, he does. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's like, if anything, </garnt>
<connor> I'm fucking enjoying season two right now. </connor>
<connor> Season two's been great. </connor>
<connor> I feel season two's kind of brought back </connor>
<joey> the hype for "Demon Slayer" for a lot of people, right? </joey>
<connor> - I wasn't that hyped, </connor>
<connor> but season two has made me definitely hyped. </connor>
<joey> - Like the like movie, as... </joey>
<joey> Oh, God, is this gonna be another fucking hot take? </joey>
<joey> As okay as I thought the movie was. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - No, okay, okay, I'll agree with you. </connor>
<connor> I thought that season two </connor>
<connor> has blown the movie out of the water. </connor>
<connor> - Do you know what? I'm gonna say. </connor>
<garnt> Because I recently just finished my Anime of the year video, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like Anime has gotten so much better now </garnt>
<connor> that just saying something is okay </connor>
<connor> is now detrimental to the Anime. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right? </connor>
<connor> It's not even bad anymore. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Calling something mid is an insult </connor>
<connor> and calling something okay is an insult. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like it's a copy paste now, </connor>
<garnt> where everyone is like, "'Attack on Titan' is mid." </garnt>
<connor> It's basically a copy paste. </connor>
<joey> Everyone that keeps saying that exact phrase. </joey>
<joey> No elaboration. </joey>
<joey> "Attack on Titan is mid." </joey>
<connor> - Because it's such easy bait. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is! </connor>
<connor> It's literally bait, but everyone does it. </connor>
<connor> - But the thing is, I didn't even say </connor>
<connor> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is okay for bait. </connor>
<connor> I just legitimately think it's just okay. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I really like "Jujutsu Kaisen". </connor>
<connor> - And that's fine, right? </connor>
<connor> There were parts of "Jujutsu Kaisen" I really enjoyed, </connor>
<joey> but I personally didn't enjoy it as much as other people </joey>
<joey> or as I thought I was going to. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, do you feel like saying something is okay or mid </garnt>
<joey> is even more of an insult </joey>
<joey> than saying something is bad nowadays? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Maybe. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I've just, at least in discussing shows </joey>
<joey> or Anime or whatever, or Manga, </joey>
<joey> I feel like you don't see as many people </joey>
<joey> just saying something is straight up bad anymore. </joey>
<joey> People just say, "Oh, it's mid. It's just mid." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, okay, I get the word mid. </joey>
<garnt> - Mid is insulting. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause mid is so little effort </joey>
<joey> to articulate how you feel about a show </joey>
<connor> that you can't even get the energy </connor>
<connor> to even describe what you don't like about it. </connor>
<joey> It's so annoying. - I feel like the word average </joey>
<connor> when talking about a show, </connor>
<connor> there's like a contention between </connor>
<connor> okay being taken more in a positive way, </connor>
<connor> and then mid being taken in a negative way, right? </connor>
<connor> But they both mean the same thing, technically speaking. </connor>
<garnt> Mid is just short for middle! </garnt>
<garnt> Which is okay! </garnt>
<garnt> Neither good or bad, just okay, right? </garnt>
<joey> But I feel now people take the word okay </joey>
<joey> and put a negative spin on it, which I don't- </joey>
<joey> - I get it. I get it. </joey>
<connor> It's like, let's say you had a wedding, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Mom, did you like the wedding?" </connor>
<connor> She's like, "It was okay." </connor>
<connor> - I would be annoyed. </connor>
<connor> I would be like, "What do you mean my wedding was just okay? </connor>
<connor> I invited you I put on a spread! You said it's okay? </connor>
<connor> The bar was free!" </connor>
<connor> - But I feel it's kind of on you to compare </connor>
<connor> your own wedding to "Jujutsu Kaisen". </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna say! </connor>
<connor> - That's, how strongly I feel about my best friend, okay! </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, "How do we get from "Jujutsu Kaisen" </garnt>
<connor> to a wedding?" </connor>
<connor> - I'm just thinking, let's just say you pour your heart </connor>
<connor> and soul out into something you like. </connor>
<connor> "Eh, it's okay." </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna go to Sydney today and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Sydney, I know we're getting married this year, </garnt>
<joey> but like just "Jujutsu Kaisen", right? </joey>
<garnt> I mean, it's kind of more important than the wedding. </garnt>
<connor> I pour my heart into "Jujutsu Kaisen" </connor>
<connor> more than I did the wedding and the planning." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] You know that there are people out there </connor>
<garnt> that would say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hope somebody asked me, "How was Garnt's wedding?" </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I know what I'm gonna say. </connor>
<garnt> I already know what I'm gonna say. </garnt>
<garnt> - "I preferred "Jujutsu Kaisen" over it." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, "I wish I could've watched the new season." </connor>
<connor> - "I feel like he poured his heart more into "Demon Slayer". </connor>
<joey> Honestly, he is more passionate about that." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> So my advice to all of you </joey>
<garnt> who perhaps want to share your opinion about Anime, </garnt>
<garnt> don't use the word okay from now on. </garnt>
<joey> It can get you canceled. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's just 'cause of who we are, right? </joey>
<joey> It's 'cause now we have this little show, </joey>
<joey> we do this little thing. </joey>
<garnt> - This little show, yeah. - This little show. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think there's a lot more eyes on us, </garnt>
<garnt> so people wanna get angry at what we say. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause a lot of the times the people </garnt>
<garnt> who get annoyed at this stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> aren't the people who actually watch Trash Taste. </garnt>
<connor> There's people outside of Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> who maybe have some followers who've watched Trash Taste. </connor>
<garnt> Maybe seen some of the clips or whatever and they're like, </garnt>
<joey> "You won't believe what these guys </joey>
<joey> who I don't already watch or engage with said." </joey>
<garnt> They don't know how we behave </garnt>
<garnt> or how we go towards a topic or how we tackle it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, he just said this thing. </garnt>
<connor> I disagree with it. I'm gonna get angry. </connor>
<joey> - What's really weird, </joey>
<joey> especially about my "Jujutsu Kaisen" hot take, </joey>
<garnt> "hot take", is the fact that I called "Jujutsu Kaisen" okay </garnt>
<garnt> months ago on my own channel. </garnt>
<garnt> No one fucking batted an eye. </garnt>
<connor> I say it on Trash Taste, everyone loses their minds. </connor>
<connor> - I think 'cause it's Trash Taste, right? </connor>
<connor> It's weird, 'cause I feel we've got to that point now </connor>
<connor> where not super small Twitter accounts, </connor>
<garnt> but some Twitter accounts with some decent followings </garnt>
<garnt> will be like, "This clown take on Trash Taste XXX." </garnt>
<garnt> But I think that's also kind of cool. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh, that's awesome that people feel like </garnt>
<connor> we're big enough where they could just openly criticize us." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Go ahead, man!" </connor>
<joey> - It is humbling to think that my offhand comment </joey>
<connor> about an Anime has stirred up this much controversy. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's kinda cool, but at the same time, it's like, </connor>
<joey> can you not cancel me for saying that a show is okay? </joey>
<connor> I could candidly sleep over it if somebody </connor>
<joey> gets angry at me on Twitter. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I not sleeping over it. </connor>
<joey> I think it's a little like, you know. </joey>
<connor> - I'm glad. </connor>
<connor> Imagine back four or five years ago </connor>
<connor> if I'd said the same shit, no one would give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - No one would care. </connor>
<connor> - I'm glad that people care! </connor>
<connor> Sometimes it's annoying. </connor>
<joey> - It's a little too much. - But I love it. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you for caring about my dumb opinion about a show. </joey>
<connor> - I don't care about Joey's opinion, so you shouldn't! </connor>
<garnt> - I don't even care about my opinion! </garnt>
<joey> I just said it! </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I think the argument is that we are creators </garnt>
<garnt> who have a platform and an influence. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, that's why they call people like us </garnt>
<connor> influencers, right? (Joey retching) </connor>
<garnt> Even though we fucking hate the word. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm allergic to that word. </connor>
<connor> - I love it, actually. </connor>
<connor> I've got that evil voice going for me, </connor>
<connor> so I feel like it works </connor>
<connor> when someone calls me an influencer, you know? </connor>
<joey> - It's just the one thing I don't like about out that word </joey>
<connor> is that it can apply to so many things, you know? </connor>
<connor> A cult leader is technically an influencer as well. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Those are the OG influencers. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're the OG influencers, right? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know if I wanna be bunched up </joey>
<connor> in those kinds of people. - I'm kidding, by the way. </connor>
<joey> I don't actually like the word. </joey>
<joey> I like to think that I make something </joey>
<connor> that's somewhat entertaining and good. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm just a dude on the internet. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] I don't know, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - With a bunch of hot takes. </joey>
<garnt> - I get it to a certain extent, </garnt>
<garnt> where we do have to be careful about </garnt>
<garnt> some of the stuff we say </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there are some topics that I feel </garnt>
<joey> we do have to navigate very carefully. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course. </joey>
<joey> - Because there are other creators out there </joey>
<joey> who do have a platform, and their words, </joey>
<joey> they say shit and their words have a tangible effect </joey>
<garnt> on the real world and the community they talk to, </garnt>
<garnt> but at the same time, there are some things that </garnt>
<garnt> blows my mind that people care this much about, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And one of the biggest things that I don't understand is </garnt>
<garnt> people will take this one minute, two minute clip </garnt>
<garnt> from Trash Taste or from one of our streams. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause this happened to me a bunch of times, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where I will see this clip being circulated. </garnt>
<garnt> where it's a one or two minute clip </garnt>
<garnt> from the podcast or my stream that's not scripted, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just in a conversation that's most of the time </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't even have anything to do </garnt>
<garnt> with the take that I'm saying in that one clip </garnt>
<garnt> because it's one or two minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> And they will take this clip </garnt>
<garnt> and then spin it to a whole new level of- </garnt>
<connor> - I get it, like you've planned it all out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! </connor>
<connor> - It's a fucking mastermind move. </connor>
<connor> - And I think of this in context, right? </connor>
<connor> And I'm thinking, I don't think people who watch our show </connor>
<connor> or people who are super fans of the show </connor>
<connor> is going to be influenced by a one minute clip </connor>
<connor> of us talking about this one subject </connor>
<connor> that most of the time doesn't even </connor>
<connor> have to do with the overall conversation, </connor>
<connor> it's just most of the time </connor>
<connor> just an offhand comment something. </connor>
<garnt> I don't think that's gonna fucking influence anybody. </garnt>
<connor> - But on that segment, Joey, </connor>
<connor> where you spoke about "Jujutsu Kaisen" and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "No, you're a clown. It's good." </connor>
<connor> If you're a viewer, it's like, </connor>
<garnt> how can you argue that you are being influenced to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is mid or okay." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's an active argument going on </garnt>
<garnt> where we're saying, "No, it's not. You're wrong." </garnt>
<connor> So as the viewer, what would you take away from that? </connor>
<connor> It's not, "Oh, I'm gonna think "Jujutsu Kaisen" is mid." </connor>
<joey> Even if you're a super fan. </joey>
<connor> It's so stupid. </connor>
<connor> - But that's what I think I like about </connor>
<connor> those kinds of discussions on the show, </connor>
<connor> especially when two or all of us </connor>
<garnt> are arguing against each other, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that it gives so many different points of views, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's up to the viewers now </garnt>
<garnt> who you want to agree with, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's not so much me saying, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, because I think "Jujutsu Kaisen" is okay, </garnt>
<garnt> you should also think that way." </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, if you want to think that way that's on you, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But it's not like I'm coming out here </garnt>
<garnt> fucking starting a demo of being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Everybody, stand up and rise! </garnt>
<garnt> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is just okay!" </garnt>
<garnt> And start a fucking coup d'etat over it, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's like I'm just some fucking- </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I just don't get it. </connor>
<garnt> It's fine to be influenced by certain things, </garnt>
<garnt> but at the same time, it's like, it's just a show, bro. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's a good problem to have in our job. </joey>
<garnt> - Of course </garnt>
<garnt> - People would spend many years </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get to the point where, </garnt>
<garnt> well, we're very fortunate where people watch Trash Taste </garnt>
<garnt> and people care. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel very lucky that people wanna get angry </garnt>
<connor> about small things I joke about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's fine. </connor>
<joey> Is it a contention for cancellation, though? </joey>
<connor> Not sure about that. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, it goes back to my online hate days. </joey>
<connor> I've gone to the point now where </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't really bother me that much at all, really. </garnt>
<garnt> It's interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> I think this is just 'cause I've been online for so long now </garnt>
<garnt> where now I'm just kind of in equilibrium with it. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I wouldn't even say it's because </joey>
<garnt> I'm okay with it now or I'm numb to it. </garnt>
<garnt> I think Jessica Nigri said it best. </garnt>
<garnt> She said, when someone asked her about like, </garnt>
<garnt> "How do you deal with internet hate? </garnt>
<garnt> How do you get over it?" </garnt>
<garnt> And she said like, "You never get over it. </garnt>
<joey> It still hurts, but you just learn to live with it." </joey>
<garnt> - To me, 'cause we have talked about this a few times, </garnt>
<garnt> but to me, without getting to the online hate thing, </garnt>
<garnt> the one thing that annoys me </garnt>
<garnt> than just people actually just hating on me </garnt>
<garnt> and hating on my content, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> is just when people are trying to put words in my mouth. </garnt>
<garnt> To be like, "Garnt said this, </garnt>
<garnt> or Garnt said this and that means X </garnt>
<garnt> or that means X, Y, Z." </garnt>
<connor> And to me, there's nothing that wants to make me reply more </connor>
<connor> than people who are spreading this idea that- </connor>
<connor> - That's the greatest bait of all though. </connor>
<garnt> - It is, right? It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because at that point, I've seen some instances </garnt>
<garnt> where I say one thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And then it just spirals out into this insane story </garnt>
<garnt> about how I fucking killed a child or some shit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's that level of how did you take </garnt>
<garnt> this one little piece of information </garnt>
<garnt> and spin it in a way </garnt>
<garnt> that just couldn't be further from the truth? </garnt>
<garnt> You are basically writing a fan fiction at that point. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> And then there are people who look at that and be like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, yeah. That sounds like something he'd say." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, what? </joey>
<joey> - I've been thinking about that a lot. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I swear to God, I don't know if the Anime community </garnt>
<garnt> was always like this. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, to me, there are some topics </garnt>
<garnt> that I always used to love arguing about, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I felt like, to me, </garnt>
<garnt> there's some things where you really have to be careful </garnt>
<joey> about what you say in terms of religion, </joey>
<joey> politics and stuff like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Hence the reason why we never talk about it on the show. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've spoken about a little bit on Trash Taste. </garnt>
<joey> - But we try and avoid it as much as we can. </joey>
<joey> - But you know, sometimes you just want to have </joey>
<joey> a fun argument with someone </joey>
<joey> where you can just shit on their opinion </joey>
<joey> and you don't have to worry about it </joey>
<joey> 'cause you know that, at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> the topic doesn't really matter that much. </joey>
<joey> And to me, as an Anime fan, </joey>
<joey> Anime was always one of those topics for me </joey>
<joey> until quite recently. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know if that's just my perception. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause another topic I would say </garnt>
<garnt> you can easily argue with anyone about is food. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone loves arguing about food, </garnt>
<garnt> we do it all of the fucking time, 'cause it's fun. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's fun because people understand </garnt>
<garnt> that people have different tastes and opinion, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And to me, Anime was always at that same level, </garnt>
<garnt> as I can easily argue about anyone with Anime </garnt>
<garnt> and not have to worry about hurting their feelings too much </garnt>
<garnt> because I just assume everyone in our community </garnt>
<garnt> has an understanding that, </garnt>
<joey> Dude, you can have your own taste. </joey>
<joey> You can have your own opinion. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a mutual agreement that at the end of the day, </garnt>
<joey> even if this one random internet person </joey>
<connor> doesn't think that your favorite shows as good as it is, </connor>
<connor> it's like, "Well, that's not gonna deter me </connor>
<joey> from the fact that I still like this show, right?" </joey>
<joey> - It's really just changed </joey>
<connor> just 'cause of the scale of Trash Taste, right? </connor>
<joey> There was nothing like this back in the day. </joey>
<joey> Back on "PodTaku", what was the average viewer count? </joey>
<garnt> - I think our most viewed podcast ever was 100K. </garnt>
<connor> - Which back then was crazy </connor>
<garnt> for a podcast, that's insane. - Yeah, it was crazy. </garnt>
<joey> - Obviously the scale is completely different now. </joey>
<joey> Anime has also been somewhat more democratized in a way. </joey>
<garnt> - Democratized. - It's more readily available. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's more available to more eyes now. </joey>
<connor> - It's a lot easier to get ahold of. </connor>
<joey> And discourse about it is way more open </joey>
<joey> and people are way more open to talk about it. </joey>
<joey> So I think that's some of the reasons why. </joey>
<joey> - So the problem is it's getting to popular. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) - Well, essentially! </connor>
<joey> - You could almost say it's becoming mainstream. </joey>
<garnt> - Kinda. </garnt>
<garnt> I always had this image that </garnt>
<garnt> the Anime community felt like it was about 10, </garnt>
<garnt> five, 10 years behind hat we saw </garnt>
<garnt> with the gaming community, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it felt like maybe the gaming industry </garnt>
<garnt> also had this shift where games used to be </garnt>
<garnt> just these fun things you numb your brain out to, </garnt>
<garnt> it didn't really matter that much. </garnt>
<garnt> You could just have your have fun with it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then now games are a big business. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the same essentially. </connor>
<garnt> I know that some people gave "Zelda: Breath of the Wild" </garnt>
<garnt> a seven out of 10 when it came out </garnt>
<garnt> and they got controversy for that, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause they didn't give it a nine or 10 or something. </connor>
<joey> - So basically they got canceled for saying </joey>
<connor> "Breath of the Wild" was just okay? </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - No, they said it was just good. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's just good! - Okay would be five! </connor>
<joey> We've had the same thing. </joey>
<connor> It's the same thing again, right? </connor>
<connor> - Isn't it incredible how one word </connor>
<connor> can completely change everything? </connor>
<joey> There's such a huge difference in like insinuation </joey>
<joey> between calling something good </joey>
<joey> and calling something just good. </joey>
<connor> - It could be the attitude towards it as well. </connor>
<connor> I think sometimes... </connor>
<connor> I can understand sometimes the way you talk about Anime </connor>
<connor> could definitely... </connor>
<connor> You're like, "Yeah, it's mid." </connor>
<connor> And I can understand why you piss people off </connor>
<garnt> because you sound like you won't even </garnt>
<garnt> entertain the conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, I fucking hate the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that you even brought this up to me. </garnt>
<connor> It was mid. Stop talking to me about it. </connor>
<connor> So I can understand why sometimes people can get </connor>
<connor> annoyed by that. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they're like, "I wish Joey just even listened to me." </connor>
<connor> It's like me trying to get approval for my parents. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> it's like, "I wish my parents just gave it a chance." </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "No. </connor>
<connor> It's shit. No." - You're like, "It's mid." </connor>
<connor> I think maybe that's what annoys people. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and look, I can completely get that as well. </joey>
<connor> And that is my bad, to be fair. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time, sometimes I don't even bother </connor>
<garnt> engaging in these conversations </garnt>
<joey> because I already know how it's gonna end. </joey>
<garnt> - I get you, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's just happened so many times that- </garnt>
<joey> - I've done this for almost nine years. </joey>
<joey> I know how a conversation like this is gonna end. </joey>
<joey> - I've known you for ages, </joey>
<joey> so I know how you are with these conversations. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I could say I could give out all these </connor>
<joey> well thought out constructed arguments </joey>
<joey> about why I think the show is okay, </joey>
<joey> and people would be like. </joey>
<connor> "But, but, but, but, but, but, but! </connor>
<joey> But I don't agree!" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Oh my God, what more can I say?" </joey>
<joey> - So what you're saying is </joey>
<joey> if Trash Taste started six years ago, </joey>
<connor> you might have got more enthusiastic debate out of Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, this would actually be an Anime podcast. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) If it started six years ago. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I don't want an Anime podcast! </garnt>
<joey> - But no, it's not. </joey>
<joey> It's not now. - Its not now. </joey>
<garnt> - Great. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Thank God! </garnt>
<garnt> - Going back to the hate thing, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause you always get asked by new creators or something </connor>
<connor> or anyone, how do you deal with online hate? </connor>
<garnt> What's the advice that you give someone? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I've been mulling this over a lot recently, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I think my opinion on it has changed quite a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> - Since the last time we talked about this? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> I had this perspective shift recently and I don't know why, </garnt>
<garnt> but I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> the whole thing of living with it and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> is totally valid advice and I think that's also good, </garnt>
<garnt> but I dunno what happened, </garnt>
<connor> but now I look at it and I don't really care at all </connor>
<connor> when I see it, because to me in my head, </connor>
<connor> they're never angry at me as an individual person </connor>
<connor> when I read that. </connor>
<connor> They're angry at like what they think is me. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right? </connor>
<connor> They're not angry at.. </connor>
<garnt> If they sat with me and spoke with me, </garnt>
<garnt> they probably wouldn't feel that way, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But they're angry at the idea of me, </garnt>
<garnt> and more often than not, it's like, </garnt>
<connor> they were never gonna give me a chance anyway, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I must be a personality they don't like. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, see, but I feel that way of thinking about things </joey>
<connor> has only been constructed </connor>
<connor> because you've been doing this for so long, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, definitely. - And I don't think, </connor>
<garnt> there are very, very few people </garnt>
<connor> who can come right into this industry from the jump </connor>
<connor> and have this enough self confidence in themselves </connor>
<garnt> and their content and their self image on the internet </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, "Well, that's not about me. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just about their image of me." </garnt>
<connor> And I feel like, especially when I started off, </connor>
<connor> I didn't have that kind of fucking confidence, right? </connor>
<connor> And I'm sure a lot of people didn't. </connor>
<garnt> So anything, the moment your name gets mentioned </garnt>
<garnt> in something, and even if it's not exactly </garnt>
<garnt> the most detrimental thing, </garnt>
<garnt> jab at your personality or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> I think people just not used to this </garnt>
<garnt> and having this random amount of people coming up to you </garnt>
<garnt> and being like, "By the way, you're kind of shit" </garnt>
<garnt> is a thing that we're not really used to, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the human wasn't evolved to deal with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - How many people just walk down the street </garnt>
<connor> and have a random person be like, "Excuse me, you're shit." </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't happen, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But on the internet, that's normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's like New York. </garnt>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Who was it that said people on the internet </connor>
<connor> have gotten way too used to saying things </connor>
<joey> and not getting punched in the face for it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! No, absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> There's no repercussion for it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> They just think, "Oh, it's just free range </garnt>
<garnt> to say whatever the fuck I want." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, sorry. Go ahead. - Oh, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was about to say, </garnt>
<garnt> and yes, in a sense, it is kind of free range </garnt>
<garnt> to say whatever you want, but with repercussions. </garnt>
<garnt> You can say whatever you want, </garnt>
<garnt> as long as you are willing to pay for the repercussions </garnt>
<garnt> if they come back to you, right? </garnt>
<joey> And they very may well might, </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I actually had to train my mum up for this, </garnt>
<joey> recently, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Course she's not getting hate, </joey>
<joey> but sometimes she goes through the Trash Taste videos </joey>
<joey> and some of the streams and the comments </joey>
<joey> and she finds these comments. </joey>
<connor> And like, "Garnt, I want to reply right now. </connor>
<connor> I wanna tell them that they're wrong!" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Mum. </connor>
<connor> Do not do that, Mum. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's even worse, Mum!" </connor>
<connor> - Your mum wants to call out the haters? </connor>
<connor> - My Mom does that. Cause my Mom, </connor>
<connor> my Mom reads like so many comments and like, </connor>
<connor> she doesn't understand how to like how to deal with online </connor>
<joey> hate, especially to like her own son. </joey>
<joey> So she's just, she just like, </joey>
<garnt> well sometimes she'll just like, send me, </garnt>
<garnt> like a bunch of comments being like, </garnt>
<garnt> look at all these people saying wrong information about you. </garnt>
<joey> I wanna reply, I wanna reply- </joey>
<garnt> - Is that like a Southeast Asian Mom thing. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause Archie's Mom does exactly the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where she had to be like, Mom, stop sending me this shit. </garnt>
<joey> Stop replying to this shit. </joey>
<joey> Just leave it. </joey>
<joey> I'm fine. </joey>
<garnt> - I literally love to explain to her. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, if a school bully said something to me </garnt>
<joey> and you come up to the school bully in front of everyone in </joey>
<garnt> the school, and be like, don't talk about my son like that, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, Mom, this looks even worse. </garnt>
<garnt> And even if I replied to her personally, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh no, no. </connor>
<connor> How did she take it? </connor>
<garnt> - I told her not to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, just don't read it, Mom. </garnt>
<joey> I understand what you're going through. </joey>
<joey> Everyone who's a content creator </joey>
<joey> goes through this at the beginning, </joey>
<garnt> but you just gotta understand that people are just gonna </garnt>
<garnt> say stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - And actually couldn't be more the opposite of that. </joey>
<joey> Like my parents would be like, oh, </joey>
<joey> my dad would be like, oh yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Some people are saying about your last video. And I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> really? He's like, yeah, but they're all dicks. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't worry about it. </garnt>
<joey> - You'll be all right mate. </joey>
<joey> Perhaps I'm just waiting for the day where I wake up on </joey>
<connor> Twitter one day and then I wake up to like a screenshot. </connor>
<connor> That's been spread viral about my Mom replying to like one </connor>
<connor> of my haters coming, be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, have you seen what Garnt's Mom said to this person?" </connor>
<garnt> I'm like for fuck's sake. </garnt>
<joey> - I just wanna see a tweet from your Mom being like, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck did you say you little shit? </joey>
<connor> (mumbles indistinctly) </connor>
<connor> - Now you know, I have three hundred confirmed kills. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. I love that. </joey>
<joey> - I think we should read some comments from your Mom. </joey>
<joey> I think that's- - That yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - I think that'd be good. We should have a segment. </joey>
<connor> We read out your mom's reply comments. </connor>
<garnt> - Have your parents ever like looked through your comments </garnt>
<garnt> or looked through your videos? </garnt>
<garnt> See what people are saying about you? </garnt>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<garnt> I think my Mom one time was like really sad about it. </garnt>
<garnt> She's like, </garnt>
<garnt> why are they saying mean things there's on this one thing </garnt>
<garnt> about you. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, don't worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not a big deal. </garnt>
<joey> - She's like, - It's so cute though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. She was way more upset about it than I was. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I was like, don't give a shit. </joey>
<garnt> But obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's not normal to see people bad mouth your son. </garnt>
<garnt> - Son. Right? </garnt>
<joey> - Of course. - Of course </joey>
<joey> It's not a normal thing. You get to experience. </joey>
<connor> - Of course - It's quite a visceral emotion. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I'd be lying if I said if, </connor>
<joey> my kid was in that situation, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't do the same thing, all right. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. I probably want to punch someone. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<garnt> - I'd be like, don't worry they're just dicks </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like honestly I kind of get it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm the same, I guess, because I feel like more anger </garnt>
<joey> when I see you people shit talking Sydney (mumbles) </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. Same. Like if I- </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like if I see one persons shit talking </connor>
<joey> one of my bros, I'm just like fuck that guy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna fucking call them out now. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I guess like if in that vein, </garnt>
<garnt> I think the one thing I hate more than people taking my shit </garnt>
<garnt> outta context, right </garnt>
<garnt> and trying to cancel me for something completely unrelated </garnt>
<garnt> is when they just like drag my friend into it. </garnt>
<garnt> And especially people who like don't matter at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, okay, you can say shit about me, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'll take care of that. </garnt>
<garnt> That'll be my problem. </garnt>
<garnt> But don't drag people who have nothing to do with this shit </garnt>
<garnt> don't drag in my girlfriend or my friends or like my fucking </garnt>
<garnt> Mom or anything like this. </garnt>
<garnt> It's got nothing to do with them. </garnt>
<garnt> If you hate my opinion, just shit talk me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll deal with it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll cry into my own pillow </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't want people shit talking other people. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like the one thing I hate, don't do that. </garnt>
<connor> You're a dick if you do that. </connor>
<joey> - You're a dick if you do that. </joey>

<connor> YouTube Twitch ran podcast I'd say. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah. I know a lot of people might not empathize </garnt>
<garnt> with us 'cause we do talk about it a lot. </garnt>
<connor> And I dunno if for an audience is tiring ever, </connor>
<connor> but I kind of feel like we- </connor>
<connor> - It's therapy session. </connor>
<connor> - We need this every once in a while. </connor>
<connor> Otherwise we do gonna have like this half emotion in us. </connor>
<joey> And we just every so often I just need to let out. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Of course I just need to let out, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like for content creators, it's healthy </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like to me being able to talk </garnt>
<garnt> to other content creators about it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a healthy way to get all of this like toxicity out of </garnt>
<garnt> yourself and just get on with your life. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think before Trash Taste definitely would need </connor>
<garnt> to talk to another content creator every now and then </garnt>
<garnt> just rant. Just needed it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's better to rant to another content creator </garnt>
<connor> than do it on a video or on a stream. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah definitely. </joey>
<joey> - I got a question. </joey>
<joey> Have you guys ever like tried to explain when you're like </joey>
<connor> going through some controversy or something's going on, </connor>
<connor> you have to try and explain it to someone who just does not </connor>
<connor> understand YouTube and it's just more involved in- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. - It doesn't work. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, don't worry about it. </garnt>
<connor> It's a little annoying right now. </connor>
<connor> It'll pass. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> No, like, no hate against anyone. </garnt>
<garnt> We explain this to, because to their credit, </garnt>
<garnt> they tried their hardest to understand what's going on, </garnt>
<joey> but like- </joey>
<garnt> - I don't get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I remember I had to like pretty early on in my career when </joey>
<joey> I was getting that first initial wave of like, </joey>
<connor> you're notable enough in the community now where people </connor>
<connor> outside of your community </connor>
<connor> you'll find people some people shit talking you- </connor>
<connor> - Part of it was me. - Something like that, yeah </connor>
<connor> - What did you say Joey. - I mean it is </connor>
<connor> - Just kidding. But like when you first start to get that </connor>
<garnt> first wave and you're like, Oh fuck, I don't know who to </garnt>
<garnt> talk to about... </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno, I'm getting canceled. </garnt>
<garnt> Blah, blah, blah. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though it was like barely nothing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I was talking to one of my schoolmates about it </garnt>
<garnt> being like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So like these bunch of people like coming </garnt>
<garnt> into my comment section saying that I suck </garnt>
<joey> and blah, blah, blah. </joey>
<joey> And I remember one of them was just straight up, like, </joey>
<joey> "Just tell 'em to fuck off!" </joey>
<garnt> I was like, yeah, thought about that. </garnt>
<joey> Not an option unfortunately, </joey>
<garnt> when it's one of me and many others, </garnt>
<joey> who I'm up against not really that easy, Is it? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause- </garnt>
<joey> - If only it was that easy- </joey>
<joey> - If only 'cause like, </joey>
<joey> I remember like every time I've tried to explain something </joey>
<joey> that's been going on in this YouTube's field, </joey>
<joey> some controversy, you're just like, oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> So this person said this and it's pissing a bunch of people </joey>
<connor> off like, holy shit, Twitter's getting angry. </connor>
<connor> And then you talk to the person they're like, oh, </connor>
<connor> why people getting angry? </connor>
<connor> - And you just, like- - I said, this Anime was bad. </connor>
<connor> - Well so this person said this Anime was bad </connor>
<connor> and these group of people got pissed off about it. </connor>
<connor> And then they goes, so why are they pissed off about it? </connor>
<garnt> And then you keep going layers and layers deep until you get </garnt>
<garnt> to a point where they just forget what the original </garnt>
<joey> like what people are getting angry for about- </joey>
<joey> - Or it's to the point where you're like the more arguments </joey>
<garnt> come through and the more layers down it goes, </garnt>
<garnt> you just start to realize, wait, it's not a problem. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah (chuckles) </garnt>
<joey> - There's no problem to begin with. I'm just making it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, like I remember back in the day where drama </garnt>
<garnt> could be addressed with just one short Tweet longer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And now it's got to a point where you need like a four hour </garnt>
<garnt> breakdown to understand like the full depth </garnt>
<garnt> of some of this drama. </garnt>
<garnt> And I dunno when that shift happened, </garnt>
<garnt> when it was just like, okay, now you need a fucking thesis. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's a full on dissertation to break down the... </garnt>
<garnt> like a play by play of like the entire month leading up </garnt>
<garnt> to this one tweet. </garnt>
<joey> - Except instead of one professor like marking it down. </joey>
<joey> It's the entirety of the internet being like, </joey>
<joey> But did you use correct citations for it? </joey>
<garnt> No marks. </garnt>
<joey> - Do we have the receipts? - Do you have the receipts? </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's crazy how, especially that side of the internet </joey>
<joey> has evolved, especially like, I think, drama culture is kind </joey>
<joey> of a thing now where- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's definitely. </joey>
<joey> Well, I see some content creators who start off </joey>
<joey> doing their own thing... </joey>
<joey> and a lot of people I've seen, have just slowly shifted into </joey>
<joey> just like drama channels, </joey>
<joey> maybe intentionally maybe not intentionally, </joey>
<joey> but it seems like every other lot blow seems to be talking </joey>
<connor> about some kind of drama or some kind of controversy that's </connor>
<garnt> going on. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's very good for business though. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - It's one of those things where if you are in drama </joey>
<joey> that isn't really drama, </joey>
<garnt> Like you said you have a bad take on Anime </garnt>
<garnt> or something, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> Those kind of drama are just generally just good for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because there's no real downside 'cause nobody </garnt>
<garnt> who actually watches you gives a fuck </garnt>
<garnt> that you said a show is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Like when I said 86, I didn't like 86 right? </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of people mad about that. </garnt>
<garnt> But I doubt there was many people who are like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't watch Trash Taste or Connor ever again. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you said my favorite show is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> But maybe other people who are watching you </garnt>
<garnt> or some people outside of it, </garnt>
<garnt> see this drama and think this is really fucking stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna check them out or </garnt>
<garnt> I'm more familiar with their name through this drama. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause drama is a really good way of... </garnt>
<joey> I feel like a click on a drama video is like much more </joey>
<joey> engaging than a normal clip. </joey>
<joey> - Oh definitely. </joey>
<joey> - So when you get like a million views on a drama </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The million views on that drama video and maybe that's </joey>
<joey> such a generic gaming video, they're not equal </joey>
<connor> the drama engagement and how much people are invested is so </connor>
<connor> much more. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And especially if it's something that paints you in a good </connor>
<connor> light or paints you in a way that makes it look like you </connor>
<connor> didn't really do anything. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Then it's just great for you because then now </connor>
<connor> you're just gonna get people who are more invested in you. </connor>
<connor> People who think that you've been done wrong. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then they're gonna support you more. </connor>
<connor> - So when these people do this shit they try and drag you in </connor>
<connor> the drama, this is why a lot of big Twitch streamers </connor>
<connor> get into this kind of drama very often. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's really good for solidifying your base viewership </connor>
<connor> They wanna support you. </connor>
<connor> They they will help you. </connor>
<connor> And then people who see it and think, oh, </connor>
<connor> they weren't really in the wrong. </connor>
<connor> They might come and check you out and feel a bit more </connor>
<connor> strongly about you. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they wanna support you. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they feel like this is some bullshit </connor>
<connor> that was done to you. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like a drama video is like, </joey>
<garnt> especially in multiple successions, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Of the same drama, like every day </garnt>
<garnt> it's almost like the world's most engaging Let's play. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> In a sense where you are more likely, </garnt>
<garnt> if you are really into like a drama video, </garnt>
<joey> you are more likely to come back to that part than a regular </joey>
<joey> gaming video. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's just the modern day reality TV show. </joey>
<joey> - Oh definitely. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like here's the thing. </joey>
<garnt> Do you think people actually care about drama? </garnt>
<joey> Do you think people like- </joey>
<joey> - Only when it's like clearly like there is a wrong person </joey>
<joey> who did a shit thing, right. </joey>
<joey> Like 90% of YouTube drama's not. </joey>
<connor> - I think there will be a core audience that does feel </connor>
<garnt> betrayed but I think the majority people are there </garnt>
<garnt> just for the popcorn. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah - I mean, of course. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause, I remember like the most recent drama </garnt>
<garnt> I can remember happening off the top of my head right now </garnt>
<garnt> is the one that involved "Pokemon" and "Ninja" right? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah </joey>
<joey> - And obviously that got like a lot of views </joey>
<joey> when it came out and a lot of people were discussing it. </joey>
<joey> But I remember like my first initial reaction to hearing </joey>
<connor> about this drama that was going on was okay, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck happened? </connor>
<connor> - It really hard to figure out what was going on. </connor>
<connor> - It was so hard. </connor>
<connor> - As a content creator, I was like trying to fucking </connor>
<garnt> piece it together who was mad at who, </garnt>
<garnt> who did wrong to who, how did it lead to this situation? </garnt>
<joey> And they were like- </joey>
<joey> - Like it took Philly D five minutes to explain it. </joey>
<joey> And that's a lot for Philly D. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm just thinking- </garnt>
<connor> - One minute Russia's invading one minute for that- </connor>
<garnt> - Then five minutes of "Pokemon" and "Ninja" </garnt>
<connor> Legit, it was like that. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh my God. </connor>
<joey> It was like the majority of the video. It was crazy. </joey>
<garnt> - I had like an easier time understanding some of the </garnt>
<garnt> world situation going on right now and the world politics </garnt>
<garnt> than like how this drama started and the evolution of this </garnt>
<joey> drama. </joey>
<garnt> It was like, so surreal like trying to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> what was going on ,right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because if me as a content creator who knows the content </garnt>
<joey> creators within this drama was like having trouble figuring </joey>
<joey> out because I wasn't there right at the beginning. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can't imagine how a general audience feels, </joey>
<joey> where they're it seems like people are just seeing people </joey>
<joey> talk about this on their timeline and they don't even know </joey>
<joey> you get to a point where you kind of are waiting for someone </joey>
<joey> to tell you who you should be angry at, </joey>
<joey> - Right? - Or who's in the wrong- </joey>
<joey> - And that's the problem. </joey>
<joey> I feel 90% of drama is not so much about trying to </joey>
<joey> uncover the details, gathering the receipts </joey>
<garnt> and doing like a fucking criminal investigation to who </garnt>
<garnt> started it and who's the culprit, who's the victim. </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally just you see a piece of drama, </garnt>
<garnt> like the "Pokemon" and "Ninja" one right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And 90% of the audience just goes, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> so who am I rooting for? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gimme two people to root for. </garnt>
<garnt> Gimme two people to fight for. </garnt>
<joey> All right, it's "Ninja" and "Pokemon" </joey>
<joey> Well, I like that person better just from the one thing </joey>
<joey> I've heard about them so I'll just root for them. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause it's not always the case, but yeah. </joey>
<connor> - A lot of it is like that though. </connor>
<garnt> You have to admit a lot of it's like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially if you're not in that community or don't give a </garnt>
<garnt> shit about that community. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know like if a bunch of fucking fashion YouTubers </garnt>
<garnt> get into some drama, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that's what they want though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. But that's what they want. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not going to care about the details. </garnt>
<garnt> All I'm going to care about is okay, </garnt>
<garnt> So who are the two people in question? </garnt>
<garnt> And what is the general consensus on these two people who </garnt>
<garnt> are fighting? </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's all it is to me. Like other than that, </garnt>
<joey> I don't give a shit personally. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Even though it's good for business, </connor>
<connor> I don't think a lot of these Twitch streamers </connor>
<garnt> try to get into this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> Some of them maybe do... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know that. I don't try to but I'm just brash </garnt>
<garnt> with my words and also not very good at explaining </garnt>
<garnt> my arguments on the spot as we all know from Trash Taste </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So I end up getting into these things. </connor>
<garnt> - A lot of people aren't good at explaining </garnt>
<garnt> their arguments on the spot, which I think is where </garnt>
<joey> the problem stems from. </joey>
<joey> 'cause, I would like to think that we're all very </joey>
<connor> well spoken and are on the board- </connor>
<connor> - I can be well spoken but like- </connor>
<garnt> - When I want to be. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can be, you can be. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> It's hard where you have so many hours of content around </garnt>
<garnt> yourself, just talking and just not just Trash Taste, </garnt>
<garnt> but Twitch streamers as well, </garnt>
<garnt> especially with Twitch streamers where they are basically on </garnt>
<garnt> camera, live in an audience like eight hours a day plus, </garnt>
<garnt> there's going to be a time where you are not as careful </garnt>
<garnt> with your words where you slip up a bit, </garnt>
<garnt> and that's just going to happen. </garnt>
<connor> it will happen to anyone in the same situation. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's deep. </garnt>
<connor> - That deep (laughs), </connor>
<connor> - That's deep Man </connor>
<garnt> - That hit me right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - That deep. </garnt>
<connor> - Damn that's deep. God. </connor>
<connor> That's deep. </connor>
<connor> You know something that Twitch streaming is made me feel </connor>
<connor> a lot more. </connor>
<garnt> I really feel a lot more strong about the viewers who like </garnt>
<garnt> turn up like every day to the shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you when you're YouTubing, </garnt>
<garnt> I see that fucking... </garnt>
<garnt> who's that ninja guy who comments on every video? </garnt>
<garnt> - The guy without (mumbles)- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like there's like 500 of these channels right? </garnt>
<garnt> You're like the same people can't whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> But like on the Twitch I know a bunch of the names of people </garnt>
<garnt> who like turn up every single time. </garnt>
<garnt> There's this person called BlueSkyDays who every </garnt>
<garnt> single stream gives me five subs. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like they've made it into a ritual. </garnt>
<garnt> I swear there you go. </garnt>
<garnt> This is your shout out, </garnt>
<connor> Thank you, I really appreciate it. </connor>
<connor> Again, going back to the hate stuff it's like, all right. </connor>
<garnt> When I think about getting sad about some people not liking </garnt>
<garnt> what you do or whatever, I'm like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> But like how much more would it hurt me If I had to explain, </garnt>
<garnt> to say that person who maybe turns up all the time, </garnt>
<garnt> Hey, by the way, I'm quitting. I don't like this. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause some people said mean things about me. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like seeing that person be like, </joey>
<joey> oh, you're gonna quit, but I like watching your stuff. </joey>
<joey> That would hurt me way more than anything anyone could say </joey>
<joey> like, oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> - Of course, - Connor's fell off ratio, </joey>
<connor> whatever that nothing, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Of course. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean to me, I feel the same with like some of my patrons </garnt>
<garnt> because I have patrons who have been fans of me, </garnt>
<joey> who have been watching me since like 10 years ago </joey>
<joey> or something and they've been there since the start </joey>
<joey> of when I opened my patron and they're still with me </joey>
<joey> to this day. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like that's fucking insane </joey>
<joey> Shout out to all you guys in the patron discord server, </joey>
<joey> I like having my patron and discord server because it's just </joey>
<joey> like a very close knit community and it's nice having </joey>
<connor> just familiar faces that have just, stuck with you for that </connor>
<connor> long </connor>
<connor> It makes you feel, what's the word not validated, </connor>
<garnt> but just happy that you kind of do what you do </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Very much. </joey>
<joey> - I definitely feel that way as well about YouTuber friends </joey>
<garnt> who were there since the very beginning, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I have a couple who were still around back when I had </garnt>
<connor> fucking less than a thousand subs, right? </connor>
<connor> I was doing like gaming videos and shit like that... </connor>
<connor> Again, same thing. </connor>
<garnt> If I were to just one day, be like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of just fucking hate this. </garnt>
<garnt> People are shitting on me, blah, blah, blah. </garnt>
<connor> It's like betraying a family member at this point. </connor>
<garnt> They've been there, they've seen thick and thin of me </garnt>
<garnt> and being like, nah, dude, you got this. </garnt>
<garnt> And they've believed in me the entire time. </garnt>
<garnt> And then for me to just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't take a bunch of people giving me shit for saying </garnt>
<joey> that "Jujutsu Kaisen" was okay then I'm sorry- </joey>
<connor> - I was considering it in the podcast. </connor>
<joey> I was like fuck Joey- </joey>
<joey> - I have to go I'm sorry - He's ignorant as fuck </joey>
<connor> - Didn't like "Jujutsu Kaisen". I'm done. It's over with. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't say I didn't like it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, It's okay. </joey>
<connor> - You didn't come. </connor>
<garnt> - It's it's just okay. </garnt>
<connor> - That is offensive to everything I hold dear. </connor>
<garnt> - The more you say it, the more offensive it sounds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Stop, stop. </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno how this is happening. </garnt>
<joey> - Am I supposed to rephrase? It was average. </joey>
<connor> - It wasn't average. </connor>
<connor> I'm not even gonna entertain you on this, it was better than </connor>
<connor> average, come on. </connor>
<joey> - Why do you think I don't wanna start these conversations? </joey>
<connor> - These are the kind of people that'll say it's average and </connor>
<connor> then give "Love Life" a seven out 10 you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I can't stand this. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even want get into "Love Life" </joey>
<connor> dude, are you kidding me? Fuck that! </connor>
<garnt> - That is the conversation. - All the "Love Life" fans- </garnt>
<connor> - That is the conversation. </connor>
<joey> I'm not gonna engage in for good reason. </joey>
<connor> - I know a lot of "Love Life" fans I'm hating on you guys. </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry- </connor>
<joey> - They won't take it that way. </joey>
<joey> They'll be like, I can't believe you took this as a joke. </joey>
<garnt> - Here goes my L this week. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's your cancellation for the week </garnt>
<connor> - I was gonna say we're very fortunate that in YouTube, </connor>
<joey> it's quite difficult to have good friendship with other </joey>
<joey> YouTubers for a long period of time, just 'cause of </joey>
<joey> the nature of the job. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - It just, things change, people get busy, people move, </joey>
<garnt> people get on with their life, do different content, </garnt>
<garnt> fall off ratio, all that kind of stuff </garnt>
<garnt> like the work. So, we're very very lucky </garnt>
<garnt> there were some good friends and we've been </garnt>
<garnt> friends with a very long time. </garnt>
<garnt> We all happen to kind of be around the same kind of sphere </garnt>
<garnt> and do the same thing, same time. </garnt>
<connor> And it all kind of worked out very lucky. </connor>
<joey> - And I think that's like another thing as well. </joey>
<garnt> If we're going back to helpful advice for people </garnt>
<garnt> starting off, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like another one that I get often, as well </garnt>
<garnt> Oh what do I do about collabing and stuff? </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel that's like the easiest way to grow out </garnt>
<garnt> your channel from an early stage. And I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> yes, in a sense, if you do it right. </garnt>
<connor> But you shouldn't be like a channel with 200 subs </connor>
<connor> and fucking DM-ing Felix, to collab with you, right? </connor>
<connor> You gotta know your boundaries and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> And also like another piece of advice that I saw on Twitter </connor>
<connor> the other day which I thought was very true. </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of YouTubers especially those starting off </connor>
<garnt> have this weird misunderstanding that they think everyone </garnt>
<garnt> who collabs with them is also a friend of theirs. </garnt>
<garnt> And that is just, unfortunately not true. </garnt>
<garnt> There are a lot of people who just see it as business who </garnt>
<connor> just want to do this one time thing or just to do this thing </connor>
<garnt> to benefit themselves. But also, </garnt>
<garnt> the person they're collaborating with. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's almost unhealthy to see a person who you collab </garnt>
<garnt> with as just your mate, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like there's a very big difference between a collaborator </garnt>
<garnt> and an actual friend. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think once you've really fully started to understand </garnt>
<garnt> at an early stage and really gone and thought to yourself, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, who is actually my friend? </garnt>
<joey> Like someone who will hang out with me when the cameras are </joey>
<joey> not rolling. </joey>
<joey> And who is someone that is just there for the clout? </joey>
<garnt> - Do you have a hard time drawing that line? </garnt>
<garnt> - No - No </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, I- </connor>
<joey> - I've done this for long enough now where I know- </joey>
<joey> - It's like being an adult. </joey>
<joey> God forbid, I've become an adult, </joey>
<joey> you kind of learn to just vibe with people. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you don't vibe with people. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you really love what they make </joey>
<joey> and you really like how they go about it. </joey>
<joey> And sometimes you hang out with them </joey>
<garnt> and it just didn't click, it's kind of weird. </garnt>
<garnt> The conversation wast little, Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> And other times it's like, holy shit, </garnt>
<garnt> I gotten so well with this person, </garnt>
<garnt> but then maybe you feel that way and they don't, </garnt>
<garnt> which is this is experience thing we have to learn. </garnt>
<garnt> All right. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Even if I really like that person, I liked hanging out </garnt>
<garnt> with them, I want to talk to them again. </garnt>
<garnt> You gotta be like normal about it. </garnt>
<joey> Don't be like, let's hang out next day. Let's do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - I space it out of it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I don't know how we got to like that. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how we became super close, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I remember there was definitely a time when I was </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, these guys are cool, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't wanna like burden them. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't wanna text them too much. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember when I met Garnt we didn't really talk </garnt>
<garnt> in between hanging out. </garnt>
<connor> It was kind of like we'd hang out. </connor>
<connor> And then it was like a thing, I don't really know. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you sent me a fucking email. </joey>
<garnt> - An email, I dunno how that work. </garnt>
<garnt> I would've put that right in the trash. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm the type of guy who really connects with someone </garnt>
<garnt> hanging out. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, same. </connor>
<connor> - Hanging out personally or physically- </connor>
<connor> - Garnt needs to touch your face, make your sweat suck your- </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I don't know the fuck you're talking about that. </joey>
<connor> - I was sexually harassing you. </connor>
<joey> - You are not a friend of mine until I suck your dick. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt is Harvey white. </connor>
<garnt> - I was going to mention I'm the type of guy who might not </garnt>
<connor> talk so much like online or on the phone- </connor>
<connor> - No, I was joking. </connor>
<connor> Garnt does not sexually harass people. </connor>
<garnt> - It was just visual, like whiplash for me. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I was trying to make this poignant point </garnt>
<connor> and it just kind of goes, </connor>
<garnt> "Garnt sucks dick, he's like sweat" </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just what did I say? </garnt>
<garnt> What did I say? </garnt>
<garnt> - I can confirm that was a weird time at the onset. </garnt>
<connor> Pretty sure I was told that what he did </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because I remember we didn't message too much, </garnt>
<joey> but I had a fun time hanging out whenever we did hang out </joey>
<joey> in person and we just ended up hanging more times in person. </joey>
<joey> I guess it just happened naturally, right? </joey>
<joey> Going from what you said about being friends versus </joey>
<joey> collaborators, even me as someone who doesn't collab </joey>
<joey> too much, I barely collab at all, as a content creator... </joey>
<joey> There are some content creators who you enjoy that content </joey>
<joey> and you really respect the work that they do. </joey>
<joey> But there are some people that you just think, </joey>
<connor> I probably wouldn't get along with you. </connor>
<connor> I love the work you do, </connor>
<connor> but I probably would not get along with you. </connor>
<connor> And on the opposite end, there are also other people </connor>
<joey> who you don't like their content, </joey>
<joey> but maybe I can get along with this guy. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - Seems like it seems like a chill dude or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's that whole thing of like separating the artist </garnt>
<garnt> from the art. </garnt>
<garnt> Which is way easier said than done in a lot of cases. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. It's just tough. </connor>
<garnt> - It just feels like it's been so long since I've been able </garnt>
<joey> to meet a lot of new content creators who I've watched </joey>
<joey> because of the past two years. </joey>
<joey> Because we've only been able to meet people in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> And I feel normally like you get a point every year </garnt>
<garnt> where you get to this opportunity to fly out out to America </garnt>
<garnt> or fly out to somewhere, fly out to conventions </garnt>
<joey> and actually meet fellow content creators. </joey>
<joey> And I've forgotten what that feels like now. </joey>
<joey> I've forgotten what it feels like to have the first awkward </joey>
<garnt> meeting of oh, hey I watch your stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I like what you do </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean like, thanks. Wanna take a photo? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just getting to speak English to people. </garnt>
<connor> I just wanna speak English to someone. </connor>
<connor> - Do you remember the first time you met someone online? </connor>
<garnt> Who you knew online? </garnt>
<joey> But you'd never like met in real life. </joey>
<garnt> Do you remember what that feeling's like? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause one of the biggest things I first noticed it's </garnt>
<joey> always height. Always Heights. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They are never the height you expect them to be. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - That's true on my end as well, because every time someone </joey>
<garnt> meets me that's the first comment. Every time. </garnt>
<joey> - It's either height or depending on if you're a content </joey>
<garnt> creator who shows their face or not. </garnt>
<garnt> It's also like how they look as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I definitely got that when I first met John Super Eyepatch </garnt>
<garnt> Wolf because almost all his videos </garnt>
<garnt> he never shows his face. </garnt>
<garnt> So for the longest time people didn't know what he looked </garnt>
<garnt> like and then obviously when he first blew up, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone was like, all the AnimeTubers were like this guy's, </garnt>
<garnt> content's fucking amazing. It's great. </garnt>
<garnt> I would love to meet him. </garnt>
<garnt> And then when we heard that he was coming to AX, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a fucking AX guest. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, yo hype, Super Eyepatch Wolf is coming to AX </garnt>
<garnt> dude, let's fucking go. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you go to the gathering. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's a bunch of faces there that you think might be </garnt>
<garnt> Super Eyepatch Wolf, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> But you don't know who, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you've never seen his face. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then when you meet him, finally </garnt>
<joey> I remember the first I said to John, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I'm sorry if this is weird, </joey>
<joey> but you are like really hot." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, he is. </garnt>
<joey> - If I was a chick, I would be head over heels for him. </joey>
<garnt> - He's the Sigma male. </garnt>
<garnt> - He really is. </garnt>
<joey> And luckily he took it in like a good way. </joey>
<garnt> - That fucking jaw line man dude, John, please that man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, he could break bricks with that jaw. </garnt>
<joey> it's crazy how hot he is. </joey>
<garnt> - Why aren't you not more on camera? </garnt>
<joey> - I Know. </joey>
<joey> - You need to show your face more John. </joey>
<connor> You're a good looking dude. </connor>
<connor> - Although he did buy a Dell computer that was gonna- </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That was a great video. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine buying a Dell computer. </joey>
<garnt> It couldn't be me. </garnt>
<garnt> - When it comes to like looks as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but also like physique and as you said height. </garnt>
<garnt> I get my height pointed at all the goddamn time </garnt>
<joey> and I never thought that would be a weird thing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Did you ever meet up with people online often </connor>
<connor> before YouTube was ever that a thing you ever used to do? </connor>
<joey> - No, not really. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause I feel like I made online friends because of </garnt>
<joey> YouTube </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah same. </joey>
<joey> - And not the other way around. </joey>
<joey> So especially during the pandemic with more people, </joey>
<garnt> making friends online, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure a lot more people are going to be experiencing this </garnt>
<garnt> experience, but it was like an alien experience to me </garnt>
<garnt> the first times I did. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, it's still weird. </garnt>
<garnt> I never get used to meeting someone who I know online. </garnt>
<garnt> And especially if they're like a content creator, </garnt>
<garnt> it feels so weird now 'cause I'm a content creator and </garnt>
<garnt> I've been on the other side of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And sometimes I just don't know how to approach someone who </garnt>
<garnt> whomst I know that's- </garnt>
<joey> - It's so weird. </joey>
<joey> It's that feeling of meeting that content creator that </joey>
<garnt> you've only seen in video in person and, </garnt>
<garnt> and the first thing that pops into your mind is. </garnt>
<garnt> I've only ever seen you behind a screen. </garnt>
<joey> That mentality never dies. </joey>
<joey> It's so weird. </joey>
<joey> Even though I'm also in that same position now to that </joey>
<joey> other person. </joey>
<garnt> - It's so weird. One of my first thoughts is, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, that's what the back of their head looks like." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I dunno why. </connor>
<connor> Because it's just not an angle you've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> So it's just weird. </connor>
<connor> It's so surreal seeing this angle, I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> " Is that that person?" </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like, Oh wait, no, it is that person. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - I kinda get what you mean </connor>
<joey> - I had this really painful fucking cringe thing I did. </joey>
<garnt> - All right. - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was at an AX party, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was chilling and you kind of bump into people that you </garnt>
<garnt> somewhat recognize or maybe you know them, </garnt>
<garnt> you've spoke to them once, </garnt>
<garnt> you go over and say hi and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was at this party and there was a group of people </garnt>
<garnt> like five content creators, influencers, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you wanna call them. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That I didn't really know, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's one person who I saw them and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I know that person. I had just met them in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> so I went over to go say hi. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh hi, nice to see you, how you doing? </connor>
<connor> we hung out in the UK" </connor>
<connor> Turns out it wasn't that person. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I had mistaken them. And I thought it was them and I shit </connor>
<connor> You not... </connor>
<connor> I hadn't even drank that much. </connor>
<garnt> It was like one, one or two drinks. </garnt>
<garnt> And even though I like wasn't drunk at all, </garnt>
<garnt> I somehow sobered up, even though I'm still sober. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like sorry about that. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, yeah, I know you and stuff </connor>
<connor> and she's like it's not me. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, Oh, you really look like this person. </connor>
<connor> I really thought you this person. </connor>
<connor> I could have maybe died on this sword and get out my </connor>
<connor> phone and be like, you look really like this, </connor>
<garnt> but no, it wasn't. </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, it was a really awkward thing where I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, that's really embarrassing. </garnt>
<connor> I'm really sorry about that, - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - I hope you guys have a good time. Ignore me. </connor>
<connor> And then I walked away really awkwardly </connor>
<connor> like, why am I so cringe? </connor>
<joey> - Have you met fans who have kind of been like that as </joey>
<connor> well? Like- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I don't care. </connor>
<connor> I'm indifferent towards it, but I know it's- </connor>
<joey> - I guess that's how they feel, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It was like five content creators. It's like, great. </connor>
<connor> Now they're all gonna think, I'm this fucking weirdo. </connor>
<connor> That just approaches people and goes, "Are you this person?" </connor>
<connor> And then- </connor>
<joey> - It's me, look. </joey>
<joey> - Gotta think I'm blind. (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> And then when I went home, whatever, I followed the- </connor>
<garnt> - So was it another content creator or was it? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was another content creator, </garnt>
<connor> I was mistaking them with another content creator </connor>
<connor> who happened to be in like the same field and stuff as well. </connor>
<connor> And it was also really awkward 'cause I'm sure... </connor>
<connor> they recently followed me on Twitter and I wonder if they </connor>
<connor> remember me going up to them like three years ago doing </connor>
<connor> this. </connor>
<connor> If I ever meet them, I'm gonna ask them again </connor>
<joey> if they remember. </joey>
<joey> - My favorite interaction of that that's kind of similar, </joey>
<garnt> I was on the opposite end though. </garnt>
<garnt> Was in Singapore AFA when I went with Garnt and there was </garnt>
<garnt> this one moment. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll never fucking forget. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sorry if you watch this show. </garnt>
<garnt> I was walking with Garnt and Allen and Sydney through the </garnt>
<garnt> convention hall. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I was on my way to something and this dude spots me </garnt>
<garnt> from across the hallway. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's looking me dead in the fucking eyes. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, Oh, he clearly knows me. </garnt>
<garnt> So I just kind of waved to him or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And he came up to me and he was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh my God. Are you GiggUK?" </joey>
<connor> - I remember that I was standing right behind you </connor>
<garnt> - And imagine me this kid so excited calling me GiggUK </garnt>
<joey> and me having to go, No, but he is. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt mumbles indistinctly) I totally forgot about that </joey>
<joey> - And Garnt's was just like, Yep. I'm GiggUK. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember thinking, I don't even know </garnt>
<garnt> how to feel about this. </garnt>
<joey> There was a split second where I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> this is a bit right? </garnt>
<joey> This is a joke </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, should I be happy or offended? </joey>
<joey> I'm not sure. But I kind of feel both right now. </joey>
<garnt> Happy that obviously someone recognized me </garnt>
<garnt> but someone knows me. </garnt>
<garnt> But unhappy that I was literally standing right here and </garnt>
<garnt> they go to Joey and goes, love you, watch Joey, love you, </garnt>
<connor> Watch Garnt </connor>
<garnt> - I love your videos. </garnt>
<connor> - Love your videos GiggUK. </connor>
<connor> - Love those Anime minutes. </connor>
<joey> - I was like yeah, you supposed to talk to him about it. </joey>
<connor> - What did they do when you talk to him? </connor>
<joey> - At first I thought it was like kind of a joke, right? </joey>
<garnt> Being like, Oh, I'll just say it's Joey ha ha ha funny. </garnt>
<garnt> I was waiting for him to be like, Nah, I'm just kidding </garnt>
<garnt> And then actually turned towards Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But the moment I kind of pointed to Garnt </garnt>
<joey> and he looked at Garnt his smile just dropped. </joey>
<garnt> - He was like, Oh God, I have made a horrible mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> I am so was sorry to the both of you. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean he still knew me though, </garnt>
<garnt> but I guess he just mixed me and Garnt's usernames up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, he might have- - Yeah, he might. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's a was nice kid so whatever. </garnt>
<joey> But it was one of the funniest interactions I've seen just </joey>
<joey> experienced as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you ever had that point where you told your fan </garnt>
<garnt> or something and they said, </garnt>
<joey> Oh, I loved when you did X video </joey>
<joey> and you think to yourself I didn't do that video. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't do that video. </joey>
<joey> - My favorite is when they're like- </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes I do - Sometimes I do </joey>
<garnt> - If we're like having more than a five minute conversation, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like I didn't make that video. </garnt>
<joey> But sometimes they just say this one comment </joey>
<garnt> and they leave and I'm just like, I won't ruin their day. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna think they messed up, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> I don't want- </connor>
<joey> - My favorite for those that I never have the heart to tell </joey>
<joey> them is when they're really trying to sell you on the point </joey>
<connor> that they've been a fan for a really long time. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, Oh Joey, I love your stuff, man. </connor>
<connor> I've been watching you since 2010 man, Like </connor>
<connor> it's great and I'm like, all right, bye. </connor>
<connor> And then at the back of my head, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I started in 2013. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah </connor>
<connor> - I don't really have the heart. </connor>
<connor> I was in high school in 2010. </connor>
<connor> So it would be scary if you knew me back then Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> But I don't have the heart to tell. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna be that guy, right? </joey>
<joey> To be like fake fan. </joey>
<connor> I don't wanna to do that to them. </connor>
<connor> - Dunno if I told this story. </connor>
<connor> I know I've told you guys this story. </connor>
<joey> I dunno if I said on the podcast </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<garnt> - It was the meetup I did with Book Walker at AX. </garnt>
<garnt> Where I just signed and took pictures, the one Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> he got like (mumbles) interrupting. </garnt>
<connor> And the line was pretty long. </connor>
<garnt> I was very happy with myself. I was like, wow. </garnt>
<garnt> People actually want to come and hang out with me? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how long the line took. </garnt>
<connor> Maybe like 30 minutes. I don't know how... </connor>
<joey> - I think it was capped. </joey>
<joey> I think we all capped like an hour, right? </joey>
<connor> Something like that. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah. </connor>
<connor> Whatever study minutes and I'm doing that. </connor>
<joey> And one guy comes up to me and I'm like, holy shit. </joey>
<joey> There's a guy here. He's like- </joey>
<joey> - This is back in your (mumbles) </joey>
<garnt> - It was like it wasn't guys, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I appreciate it. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh thanks man. </garnt>
<connor> And so I'm like, Yo, hi, how you doing, man? </connor>
<connor> He was like, oh, I'm good. </connor>
<connor> And then we take a photo and he is like, </connor>
<connor> Yeah man, could you sign this "Goblin Slayer" book? </connor>
<garnt> I really like the work you did on it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like coming in, he's like, </garnt>
<connor> Are you not the author for "Goblin Slayer"? </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, (Garnt laughing) No </garnt>
<connor> He was like, Oh, but I thought this was like </connor>
<connor> a "Goblin Slayer" booth. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, No, I'm a YouTuber. </connor>
<garnt> And in my head I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Did this guy like look at the name on it? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know who the author of "Goblin Slayer" is, </joey>
<joey> but I'm guessing he doesn't look like a Connor. </joey>
<joey> - His name's Kagyu Kumo. So it's very different, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe this guy was like, I do not judge. </connor>
<connor> - I do not see race. </connor>
<garnt> - I do not see country, race, ethnic background. </garnt>
<connor> He's like, I'm open to all walks of life. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe a white guy from Wales could have written </joey>
<joey> a light novel and- </joey>
<garnt> - This boy is very new. </garnt>
<joey> Homegrown (mumbles) if that's the case. Holy shit. </joey>
<connor> - I felt so bad for this kid because </connor>
<connor> I didn't care that he confused me, </connor>
<connor> but this guy was so embarrassed </connor>
<connor> I'd never seen a face drop that fast. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we'd taken the photo shit and too on his phone </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, you can go delete that. I won't be mad. </joey>
<connor> I signed this thing as well. </connor>
<connor> I signed his "Goblin Slayer" book </connor>
<connor> and then he tells me he loved my work on "Goblin Slayer" </connor>
<garnt> What was that a Goblin? or something </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know what I did on "Goblin Slayer" </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if I should be the defender or not. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so funny. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember having this one conversation once </garnt>
<garnt> with a fan, sometimes you get into like pretty intense </garnt>
<garnt> conversation with fans about some of your videos </garnt>
<garnt> or something when you have the time to. </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember this one fan I think it was like AX </garnt>
<garnt> or one of the Anime conventions. </garnt>
<joey> And we got into this conversation about "Bleach" right? </joey>
<joey> And at this point I've said my takes about "Bleach" a lot. </joey>
<joey> Whether on my videos, my first video was a "Bleach" video </joey>
<joey> in other videos and podcasts (mumbles) </joey>
<joey> - But was just okay. - Huh? </joey>
<joey> - Did you say it was just okay? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not gonna open that box of worms right now, </garnt>
<garnt> but like I remember- </garnt>
<garnt> - Can of worms. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Connor chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gonna open that kind of worms. </joey>
<joey> So now, I remember were having this fucking intense </joey>
<joey> conversation about "Bleach" </joey>
<joey> And he kept saying things like, </joey>
<joey> I remember when you said this about the quick (mumbles) </joey>
<joey> and like this about Tite Kubo, can you expand on that? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't agree with this. </joey>
<joey> And we were like having this full debate about this. </joey>
<joey> And I remember thinking, </joey>
<garnt> I don't remember saying this about "Bleach" </garnt>
<garnt> but I might have said that about "Bleach". </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just going to entertain the idea of this debate </garnt>
<garnt> that he's having about me. </garnt>
<garnt> And so we go into this like 10 minute fucking debate about </garnt>
<garnt> "Bleach" right? - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then at the end, I'm just like, yeah, I finally </garnt>
<garnt> understand your Fall of "Bleach" video now </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, that was John's video. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - And at that point, I didn't even have the heart to tell </connor>
<garnt> him 'cause I'm just like, we've been talking about a video </garnt>
<garnt> that I didn't make for 10 fucking minutes </garnt>
<joey> and having a strong debate about it. </joey>
<joey> - How did he not realize that your voice </joey>
<joey> and John's voice is like completely different? </joey>
<garnt> - Like how did I not realize that he was talking about a </garnt>
<garnt> video that I didn't make? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the thing is, I've talked so much shit about "Bleach" </garnt>
<garnt> that sounds like something I might have said. </garnt>
<garnt> I've talked a lot of things about "Bleach". </garnt>
<garnt> I might have said that. </garnt>
<joey> - It wasn't you arguing your opinions. </joey>
<garnt> It was you agreeing with John. </garnt>
<connor> - I was arguing John's opinion without me being involved. </connor>
<connor> - Step aside John, I got this. </connor>
<joey> I got your back bro. </joey>
<connor> - I hope John appreciates that. </connor>
<garnt> - You showed that guy out last year. </garnt>
<connor> - I did. I did. </connor>
<connor> John, I'm fighting the good fight. </connor>
<garnt> John, I'm fighting the fucking good fight. </garnt>
<joey> - He's got his boxing gloves on for you. </joey>
<joey> Like he's fighting back. </joey>
<connor> Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - It's also that thing where I have said so much stuff in </connor>
<connor> my years of being online that I have forgotten a good chunk </connor>
<connor> of any jokes or anything I've made. </connor>
<garnt> And I've had those awkward moments where someone will make </garnt>
<connor> a reference a video of mine from like five, four years ago. </connor>
<connor> And I'll be like, What did you say? </connor>
<garnt> - They said the thing and I'm like. </garnt>
<connor> Why did did I say that? </connor>
<joey> - Now the worst is when they ask you to say it. </joey>
<connor> Be like, I love this video that you made. </connor>
<connor> Can you say that one line? And I was like. </connor>
<connor> - I know I say it. - No, but it's when </connor>
<garnt> you don't remember what they're talking about when it's </garnt>
<garnt> a video from a Let's Play from six years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, say that one thing you said in "Corpse Party" </garnt>
<joey> in episode 42. </joey>
<joey> Remind me how it goes again. </joey>
<connor> - That's oddly specific. </connor>
<joey> Why would someone ask you that? </joey>
<joey> - I've had that before in the past, yeah. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I've made over a thousand videos. </connor>
<joey> I don't remember every single one I made. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's been extrapolated even fucking more </garnt>
<connor> with Trash Taste now. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where I will get comments or I'll get like people- </connor>
<connor> - I'm so excited to have people bring up my opinions </connor>
<garnt> and I've totally forgotten. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause, I've had conversations with people I've met here </garnt>
<garnt> who obviously watch Trash Taste and they were like, </garnt>
<joey> and they say to me, remember when you said this </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, did I say that? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that kind of sounds like something I said, </joey>
<joey> I don't remember when I said it, but like the "Bleach" </joey>
<joey> video, I'm just going to assume that you are right. </joey>
<joey> And I did say that. </joey>
<joey> So let's just, entertain this idea </joey>
<joey> and have this conversation. - Of course. </joey>
<joey> - Basically if you meet me in a convention and you said, </joey>
<garnt> Oh, you said this, what's your opinion about it? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm probably just gonna entertain that idea regardless of </garnt>
<garnt> whether I said it or not. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) - Let's talk about that. </garnt>
<connor> - I love conventions so much, man. </connor>
<connor> This is my weekly reminder that I miss conventions. </connor>
<garnt> - God. I miss conventions so much. </garnt>
<joey> I'm hoping out hope that we can- </joey>
<connor> - Well this year, be the year. </connor>
<garnt> - This year be the year I'm hoping- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm praying this of the year we finally </garnt>
<connor> get to go to conventions. - Let's find out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - One day. </connor>

<joey> - Back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause we have a lot of things planned for this year </garnt>
<garnt> that's outside of Japan, not spawning anything more </garnt>
<garnt> than just that, but I'm hoping that I get to interact with </garnt>
<garnt> people again </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the biggest thing, </garnt>
<garnt> I missed the vibe of conventions, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't realize how much I missed it until </garnt>
<garnt> you couldn't go to it anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I just missed that whole convention vibe and the positive </garnt>
<garnt> air and the positive attitude and having fun for a weekend. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I just love the ambiance of a convention hall </joey>
<garnt> the low murmur everywhere and it's like- </garnt>
<connor> - Like everyone's just excited- </connor>
<connor> - So everyone's just there and excited and it's like, </connor>
<connor> you can feel the hype of the room and it's like- </connor>
<connor> - I love the energy. </connor>
<garnt> - It's smells. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I was gonna say I didn't think I would miss the smell </garnt>
<garnt> of stale sweats that you like smell when like </garnt>
<joey> the convention- </joey>
<joey> - Speak for yourself. I don't miss that, God- </joey>
<joey> - I don't miss it. </joey>
<garnt> I just miss that that reminds me that I am at a convention </garnt>
<garnt> and this is the smell of a convention. </garnt>
<joey> - When you walk into like a clean room and you're like, </joey>
<joey> damn it man, it ain't that AX smell though. </joey>
<garnt> It ain't that AX smell - Air's too clean right now </garnt>
<garnt> - It's too clean right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - It definitely ain't the gaming area. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah, there's not enough precipitation in the air. </garnt>
<joey> There's not enough game of precipitation in the air. </joey>
<connor> - I should miss it so much. </connor>
<connor> So especially when you get those it'll be like a few months </connor>
<garnt> or even like a year later and someone they'll be like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh I met Connor at X and X. He was so nice. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, that makes my day, man, </garnt>
<garnt> even though that might become a meme now someone will be </garnt>
<connor> I met Connor at his Twitch chat, he was so nice. </connor>
<connor> He called me an idiot. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I like being a dick online. </connor>
<connor> But then in person I'm like, </connor>
<connor> Oh man, I just wanna be nice to everyone. </connor>
<joey> - I want the opposite of that to be like, </joey>
<connor> Oh I met Joey at a (mumbles). He was so nice. </connor>
<connor> I have subscribed </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I think I've had that one time actually. </garnt>
<connor> Someone's like, Oh, Connor was so rude or something. </connor>
<joey> And I don't think I was though I rarely would be rude. </joey>
<joey> I can scarcely be rude to myself. </joey>
<garnt> Let alone like someone else. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm only rude to my best mates. </garnt>
<garnt> That's basically it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean sometimes you have to, </garnt>
<joey> if you're being ushered to somewhere, </joey>
<joey> - Of course </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes people will start like, </joey>
<joey> Oh Joey, can I take a picture? </joey>
<joey> and I'll be like, </joey>
<connor> Oh, I can't right now actually I have to have to go. </connor>
<joey> - There's only one of me and many people who thankfully want </joey>
<joey> to hang with me- </joey>
<connor> - I hate being like, no, I can't take a picture. </connor>
<joey> - I want to, but handlers and staff and what not and- </joey>
<connor> - 1% Problems, eh? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You're living a good life. </joey>
<joey> - Duty calls you sometimes- </joey>
<joey> - It's so hard. </joey>
<connor> Just people wanting to take a photo with me, God. </connor>
<joey> Oh, I'll wake up in the morning. </joey>
<connor> - I can't imagine. </connor>
<joey> What do I do with all this attention? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm very, very grateful. </garnt>
<connor> I'm very grateful. </connor>
<garnt> - Connor you've changed. </garnt>
<connor> You've changed Connor. </connor>
<garnt> - I fell off the plus ratio. </garnt>
<garnt> - Before you moved to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> did you guys get called out by your username more </garnt>
<garnt> or by your real names? </garnt>
<garnt> Did anyone actually call you by like Connor, Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was always CDawg or Sebastian occasionally </garnt>
<connor> - They were like, "Yo Sebastian" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Remember that one time we were in little Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> We were in L.A in little Tokyo and we were chilling. </connor>
<garnt> And then like, we were all done with our delicious... </garnt>
<garnt> I think I didn't even have Japanese food. </garnt>
<connor> I remember I had beeb and bub which is- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It was like the like Korean barbecue place, right? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So we were leaving and it was good. </connor>
<connor> We were chatting and some girls screamed like, "Sebastian" </connor>
<garnt> and I was like, Oh God. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I was really just embarrassed </connor>
<connor> 'cause you guys were fucking laughing at me </connor>
<connor> 'cause they called me Sebastian. </connor>
<garnt> - Because it was that moment of like we all turn around and </garnt>
<joey> we were like, "Oh I wonder which Seba.... Oh!" </joey>
<joey> - And Connor's just like... </joey>
<connor> - This is like been the period where I was trying my </connor>
<joey> goddamn hardest to get away from it. </joey>
<joey> So it was like a reminder. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, definitely- </joey>
<joey> - I don't care if someone did it, </joey>
<connor> you can call me Sebastian. I don't give a shit. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it happened early on where people at first were </garnt>
<garnt> calling me Anime man or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I from really early on because too many </garnt>
<connor> people were getting my usernames wrong. </connor>
<connor> And also the fact that I didn't like my username- </connor>
<connor> - What were they calling you then? If it was wrong </connor>
<joey> - Oh, there was Anime guy, Anime dude. </joey>
<connor> - It's not that hard. </connor>
<garnt> - That's so true. </garnt>
<garnt> Like every time I hang out, I was next to Joey. </garnt>
<joey> I swear he would get like Anime man maybe only like 70% </joey>
<joey> of the time. - Yeah, If that. </joey>
<joey> - There's been so many variations of your name. </joey>
<joey> - How that even hard to remember? </joey>
<joey> - But there were people who would like get my actual name </joey>
<garnt> wrong as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I've, I've been called John. </garnt>
<joey> I've been called the one that I couldn't fucking believe. </joey>
<joey> And I remember to this day was (mumbles) </joey>
<joey> Some dude legit came up to me and said, "Hey Josh" </joey>
<connor> - With like a hundred percent confidence. </connor>
<connor> - With hundred percent confidence. And I was- </connor>
<joey> - Man, respect to that guy </joey>
<joey> - I couldn't even be like, it's Joey because </joey>
<joey> I was actually just dumbfounded. </joey>
<joey> I'm like you did not just fucking call me that. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know like Josh? </connor>
<connor> Do you have a vendetta against Josh? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, nothing against Josh. </joey>
<joey> I've got mates called Josh, but I'm not Josh. </joey>
<connor> - Why did the name Josh specifically </connor>
<connor> annoy you more than John? </connor>
<joey> - I think it's because there's only ever been </joey>
<connor> that one guy who called me, Josh. </connor>
<joey> - Watch it now, next day, ex or whatever, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be Josh, the Anime guy. </joey>
<joey> - I understand like Anime guy or like Anime dude </joey>
<connor> or like a different derivative of the word man, right? </connor>
<joey> Because it's a pretty generic name, right? </joey>
<garnt> - The Anime man, it's pretty fucking easy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I'd like to think so. </garnt>
<connor> - But actually like- </connor>
<garnt> - I think people have gotten my internet handle </garnt>
<joey> wrong almost as much times as </joey>
<joey> they've got as they got it right </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, probably. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Because I think the biggest thing is obviously </joey>
<joey> people think my name's GiggUK. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. They're like, oh, I love you. </joey>
<joey> I love your word GiggUK. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm just like, how long have you been watching my stuff? </garnt>
<connor> - I think YouTube, should implement those pronunciation </connor>
<connor> brackets that they have on those like Merriam dictionary? </connor>
<joey> - They like the Google translate, like say the word- </joey>
<garnt> - Is my name that hard to pronounce because I swear I've had </garnt>
<garnt> so many mispronunciations of my name and it doesn't even </garnt>
<garnt> piss me off. I just find it funny, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't ever say anything. I'm just like, whatever. </connor>
<connor> Well just- </connor>
<connor> - At least yours is just a mispronunciation. </connor>
<connor> Mine is literally just not the correct word, </connor>
<garnt> - Josh (Connor and Garnt giggling) </garnt>
<garnt> There's only so many ways you could, like... </garnt>
<joey> I didn't know you could pronounce man as dude or guy. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's just because my entire life </garnt>
<garnt> is a mispronunciation of my name. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just fucking GiggUK. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the weirdest mispronunciation of my real name </garnt>
<garnt> actually when I was in university. </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember in university, in Freshers week especially </garnt>
<garnt> you meet a lot of new people very quickly and obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> as you all know Garnt is not a common name at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I've heard like every fucking </garnt>
<garnt> mispronunciations of my name by then. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember my first day of uni, I heard a new one. </garnt>
<garnt> So I go up to a person and I say, "Hi, my name's Garnt" </garnt>
<garnt> thinking they'd say Grant, or Garnet or </garnt>
<garnt> one of like, something like that. </garnt>
<joey> That happens a lot. Garnet happens a lot </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And he goes "God, your name's God?" </joey>
<connor> I'm like what? How did you mishear that? </connor>
<connor> No, I almost said Grant, it's Garnt </connor>
<connor> - It's been confirmed, it's Garnet. </connor>
<connor> - It's Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause how I explain it, it's Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> Think of Grants, but swap the R and the A over. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah. So that's how I like speed run explaining my name. </joey>
<joey> And he was just like, "Oh, Garnt" and I'm thinking </joey>
<joey> in my head, what a fucking damn ass, </joey>
<joey> how would you hear God from Garnt, right? </joey>
<joey> That's just like the anomaly. </joey>
<joey> He's the glitch in the matrix. </joey>
<garnt> And then literally like two people later. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like introducing myself. </garnt>
<garnt> And so like later in the day I say, "Hi, my name's Garnt." </garnt>
<garnt> And the second time, "God, your name's God?" </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, what the fuck is going on? </garnt>
<connor> What is going on right now? </connor>
<connor> - I think it would be a very bold move of a parent </connor>
<garnt> to name their kid, God. </garnt>
<garnt> So very bold name. </garnt>
<connor> You gotta have high hopes to that kid. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember somehow in freshers week, </garnt>
<garnt> even though I did introduce myself to a lot of people within </garnt>
<garnt> that short timeframe, probably more than I have in my life </garnt>
<connor> in that like one week or two period, three people thought my </connor>
<connor> name was God when I first introduced myself (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - No, why? - It just like blew my mind. </joey>
<garnt> - I just love it when people just absolutely butcher my name </garnt>
<garnt> in ways that I just wasn't expecting. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that is like my favorite thing ever. </garnt>
<connor> Now that I am like this public figure where even </connor>
<connor> my full name is public now. </connor>
<garnt> Like, oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> There hasn't been a single person who's pronounced my </connor>
<connor> surname correct. - Really? </connor>
<connor> - It's the first time. </connor>
<connor> - Bizinger - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's Bizinger, right. </connor>
<connor> But like my favorite was the FCCJ panel that we did. </connor>
<connor> I think the guy called me something like, </connor>
<joey> "And here at the end of the table, </joey>
<joey> is Joey the Anime Bizinger" </joey>
<joey> I was like, first of all, you forgot the man. </joey>
<joey> Second of all, I did an interview with you. </joey>
<connor> - You should be, you should be the Anime. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the Anime, Joey the Anime (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Drop the man, drop the guy, just the Anime, </joey>
<joey> - The Anime. </joey>
<joey> - I am Anime. </joey>
<connor> - You are the Anime. Not the man, the Anime. </connor>
<garnt> - I think what I loved about that live stream with FCCJ is </garnt>
<garnt> when he was introducing my name. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember he like introduced you. </garnt>
<garnt> He introduced Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, I think he got to me. </garnt>
<connor> And I could see the fucking word processing in his mind. </connor>
<connor> And there was like this brief pause before he said my name. </connor>
<connor> And I remember like the chat going, he's gonna say, Grant. </connor>
<garnt> He's gonna mispronounce it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, it was just like a slight pause. </garnt>
<garnt> But that felt like an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> That felt like an entire death note scene. </garnt>
<garnt> That fucking pause, man. </garnt>
<joey> - You could've edited in like the AOL loading sound like- </joey>
<connor> - (mumbles) One second, three seconds. </connor>
<connor> - Has anyone ever mispronounced CDawg or gotten your </connor>
<connor> internet handle wrong? </connor>
<connor> - No, CDawg- - Well, your surname </connor>
<connor> is pretty difficult to pronounce. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my surname, </connor>
<garnt> but I dunno- </garnt>
<garnt> - Also CDawg is very easy as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. CDawg, I'm really glad I chose that. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, we said this before, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Smart, It's an easy smart- </connor>
<joey> - Unintentionally. </joey>
<joey> I chose it to sound cool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Doesn't actually sound that cool. </garnt>
<connor> But now everyone just calls me Connor I'd say that easy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Well that's what I like about Trash Taste is that now we </joey>
<joey> just known as Joey, Garnt and Connor yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I have a request to anyone watching this who will meet us </garnt>
<garnt> in conventions. </garnt>
<garnt> I know Grant is a meme and it doesn't piss me off when </garnt>
<garnt> people call me Grant but please call me Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it will get to a point where I literally will not </garnt>
<garnt> know if you just don't know who I am or </garnt>
<garnt> you are a Trash Taste viewer. </garnt>
<garnt> So please, at least call me Garnt the first time before you </garnt>
<garnt> start memeing it up. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise I will generally not know. </garnt>
<garnt> If you just are that deep into the Trash Taste law, </garnt>
<garnt> or if you just generally think my name's Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Genuinely won't be able to- </garnt>
<joey> - Likewise with me, Josh is not my name. </joey>
<garnt> - It is - It is now </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] John is also not my name it is. </garnt>
<joey> - (Connor mumbles indistinctly) </joey>
<joey> - If you call him Josh, now everyone's gonna know that you </joey>
<garnt> watch this episode of Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, God. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> How come I'm not allowed to get away with it, but you are, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, Garnt's like, don't do this to me, </connor>
<connor> but do it to Joey, he'll be fine. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Don't do it to me. </connor>
<joey> - Don't do the exact same thing - As long as it's not to me. </joey>
<connor> - Bully Joey, just don't bully me. I'm begging you. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't believe it. </garnt>
<connor> - So people just spell my name incorrectly that's all. </connor>
<connor> They don't say it wrong. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, there's only so many ways </joey>
<connor> you can fucking pronounce Connor. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Oh, it's all 'con air' maybe. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] 'con air'. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'con-air' </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] 'con air'. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's a movie- - My favorite movie </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I think that's in a movie. </garnt>
<connor> - Great movie. </connor>
<connor> - My favorite Nicholas Cage movie. </connor>
<garnt> - It's an honor to be confused with "Con Air" </garnt>
<garnt> - Fantastic. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds like the cursive Conner </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Conner. </garnt>
<connor> - Just like if Sebastian pronounces could be as Conner. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) - Maybe. </connor>
<joey> - That's what you should be like. </joey>
<joey> If someone at a convention stops you being like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey Sebastian" they should be like, "It's Con Air" </joey>
<connor> - I never saw in my life until like I got on </connor>
<connor> the internet that you could spell Connor with an E-R. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Conner. </joey>
<connor> - Conner. </connor>
<connor> - C-O-N-N-E-R </connor>
<connor> I never saw that but a friend of my school who was </connor>
<connor> called Connah, but it was spelled C-O-N-N-A-H. </connor>
<connor> - Connah - Connah </connor>
<connor> - Connah - Connah </connor>
<connor> - There- - What's the Australian- </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause there was also a place near me </joey>
<joey> that was called Connor something. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> But lemme spell that one- </connor>
<joey> - That is like a very phonetic Connor isn't it Connah. </joey>
<connor> - Connah </connor>
<connor> - It's Connah Mate. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Connah. </joey>
<connor> - It was interesting. </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, am I the weird? </connor>
<garnt> No, I've got the normal. </garnt>
<garnt> I have the normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yours is the normal one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have the normal Connor, I'm pretty sure </garnt>
<garnt> I am the real one. </garnt>
<connor> This is all a joke. You're all lying. </connor>
<connor> None of you are the real Connor. </connor>
<joey> - Who's the person who had the weirdest name that you knew </joey>
<joey> personally in your life? </joey>
<connor> - What do you judge as weird? - Okay </connor>
<joey> - Like obscure or just like, </joey>
<connor> why would you choose that? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, for me I knew a guy in my school whose first name, </joey>
<joey> whose real name was Gameron </joey>
<connor> - Gameron - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Not Cameron, Gameron with a G. </garnt>
<garnt> - I kind of like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds cool. - I thought was fucking cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds cool. - But it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> in my head, I was like, first of all, </garnt>
<garnt> where does that come from? </garnt>
<garnt> And second of all was like their parents' handwriting </garnt>
<garnt> so shit at the birth certificate that the doctor was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, that's an interesting, way to spell Cameron." </joey>
<connor> - There was a kid from another school. </connor>
<connor> I always was so jealous. </connor>
<joey> They'd called that kid, Zeus. </joey>
<joey> - Zeus? - That was his first name. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck you, dude. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like- - God. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, again, the fun with really badass names </connor>
<garnt> is that if you don't live up to a badass name, </garnt>
<garnt> it looks pathetic. </garnt>
<garnt> Like imagine like you're like a kind of super shy person </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like, what's your name? </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, it's Zeus" </garnt>
<joey> you need to be larger than life </joey>
<joey> if you're called Zeus, right? </joey>
<joey> - That's like in school when you had that one surname, </joey>
<garnt> I knew a guy whose surname was Champion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - And unfortunately- - Was he a champion? </garnt>
<garnt> - Unfortunately no. </garnt>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - He didn't quite live up to his surname. </connor>
<joey> - It was a surname though. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause if it was your first name everyone's calling you... </joey>
<joey> - Oh, right. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - The parents must have been confident. </joey>
<joey> They'd be like, you better live up to this name </joey>
<connor> or you're a failure. - You are a literal champion. </connor>
<garnt> - They must have gone to like </garnt>
<garnt> the sperm bank got the highest grade sperm. </garnt>
<joey> They're like nine foot guy, went to Harvard, 10,000 IQ. </joey>
<joey> They're like this guy's a Zeus from a 100%. </joey>
<joey> - Was it actually spelled like the god? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. - Exact same way. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, that's so badass. </joey>
<garnt> - And I remember 'cause I threw javelin against him </garnt>
<garnt> and I beat him and I was like, I beat the Zeus javelin. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] That's so ironic. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, this is amazing. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, this is great. I beat Zeus. </garnt>
<garnt> At the time I didn't care though. </garnt>
<garnt> But now I'm like, I beat Zeus at javelin. </garnt>
<joey> It's not a big deal. - No biggie. </joey>
<joey> - It's not a big deal, but it is </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, one of my mates who used to live here in Japan, </joey>
<garnt> Australian guy, his real full name was Storm Angus. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is the most Australian name I've ever heard. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is the most badass... </garnt>
<joey> When he introduced himself as that, </joey>
<joey> I was like, no, you're not. </joey>
<garnt> - That's just an Australian superhero name. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Look it's Storm Angus. </garnt>
<connor> - Ah, yeah- </connor>
<connor> (Joey shrieking) </connor>
<connor> - Sounds like a superhero </connor>
<joey> - He just shoots down lightning (shrieking) </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - He just throws down like fosters or something. </garnt>
<garnt> ( Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, my God. - Love you Storm. </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I want go to Australia, man. </joey>
<joey> I've never been to Australia. </joey>
<garnt> I just really want to go. </garnt>
<garnt> Sounds like a laugh. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, - It's all right. </joey>
<joey> Australia's that one place where you're like, </joey>
<joey> I can't believe people like this exist. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah </joey>
<garnt> - Like unironically, </garnt>
<garnt> - I've always wondered what are Australian conventions like? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. I mean there isn't really a lot. </joey>
<garnt> I've been to two different ones. </garnt>
<garnt> There is Supernova which is more like a Comic Con. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then there is SMASH, which is the big Anime Con </garnt>
<joey> in Sydney. - Right </joey>
<connor> The SMASH stand for anything? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. The Sydney Manga Anime Show. </joey>
<connor> - Good name. - Okay, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So the first time I went was in like 2013, '14 </connor>
<garnt> something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And there was maybe like 3000 people, 4,000 people. </garnt>
<garnt> It was tiny convention. </garnt>
<connor> But the year that I went before the pandemic where I was </connor>
<connor> a guest at there was like almost like 30, 40,000 people. </connor>
<garnt> So it's like clearly grown massively. </garnt>
<garnt> I honestly think like in terms of like the actual, </garnt>
<garnt> like vibe of the Con and stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't really see it as that much different to like a U.S </garnt>
<garnt> Con or any other like English-speaking convention, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like everyone- - Can speak- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I actually can't spell the word- </garnt>
<connor> - Not actual cuts, but yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So we're not throwing Cons. - But like Australian Cons </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously I felt a little more at home because </garnt>
<garnt> I was talking to people with the same accent as me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like that was like my first Con ever, right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like my home tuff, but yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> In terms of like a Con experience, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't really see it as that much more different to like a </garnt>
<garnt> standard American Con I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel just like weebs in general </garnt>
<garnt> or like Anime fans in general, </garnt>
<garnt> they kind of all give off like the same vibe. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of them are just kind of like chill and down to earth </garnt>
<garnt> and just wanna like chat with you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause like in Australia, a lot like America where is like </connor>
<connor> a lot of stranger friendliness is still pretty prevalent, </connor>
<garnt> right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So a lot of people didn't really have problems, </garnt>
<garnt> coming up to me and talking to me and stuff like that just </garnt>
<garnt> as like, Hey, Joey what's up man? </garnt>
<garnt> that kind of stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean you guys will definitely have a fucking great time </garnt>
<garnt> if we ever end up going to SMASH </garnt>
<garnt> or an Australian convention, </garnt>
<garnt> every now and then you will meet those like very </garnt>
<garnt> stereotypical, loud Aussies who, </garnt>
<garnt> (mumbles indistinctly) that level, right? </garnt>
<joey> - But- - That sounds good to me. </joey>
<garnt> - That sounds like a laugh. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I feel though, those kinds of people, </joey>
<garnt> you wouldn't really find in a lot of like Anime Cons, </garnt>
<garnt> you'll see them at the pub. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - But you know, very rarely have I seen an Anime fan </joey>
<connor> - Those conventions you love going to the pub after, </connor>
<joey> that's close by you just see like Curito </joey>
<joey> downing like a Stellar. </joey>
<connor> You're like what's going on? I don't remember this part. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you know, chicken, like in an Alcohol Cosplay, </connor>
<garnt> like doing a shoey it's like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You like to drink with us (mumbles) </garnt>
<joey> - I unfortunately didn't see that, I wish I did </joey>
<garnt> - Do a lot of people get drunk at Aussie conventions? </garnt>
<connor> 'cause that's the big thing about British conventions, </connor>
<connor> way more than like- - So much. </connor>
<connor> It is like- - all they do. </connor>
<joey> - It's more than the actual convention itself. </joey>
<joey> It's just people are just like, oh, there's Anime here. </joey>
<garnt> Cool, Let's get a fucking pint. </garnt>
<joey> - It's hard to say at least in Sydney, </joey>
<joey> I don't think it's would be as much as in the UK just </joey>
<garnt> because like drinking or eating out in Sydney is really </garnt>
<garnt> fucking expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a pint of beer is like fucking $10 Australian </garnt>
<garnt> and like a lot of like places in Sydney, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like in the city. </garnt>
<garnt> - 10 Aussie dollars or- - 10 Real dollars, </garnt>
<connor> $10 is real currency show. </connor>
<connor> - $10 Reduced. </connor>
<connor> So I think to like a lot of kids who come to these </connor>
<garnt> conventions like $10 is a lot of money. </garnt>
<connor> That's $10 you could spend on Anime Merge at the Con. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - So I didn't see as many drunk people as I thought there </connor>
<connor> was gonna be. </connor>
<connor> But a lot of the parents were getting drunk that's for sure. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> They were like they've had a hard day. </connor>
<joey> - They probably drove like an hour to get into the city </joey>
<joey> and be like hey kids have fun at your Japanese convention. </joey>
<garnt> Daddy and I are gonna go over to the pub </garnt>
<garnt> and get shitfaced while we wait for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> So like- - I've taken care of the kids. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so like in between like signings and stuff, </connor>
<garnt> I'd take a step outside and you look over at the terrace </garnt>
<garnt> of some of these like pubs, on the water and there's just </garnt>
<joey> a lot of parents clearly just like waiting for their kids, </joey>
<joey> just being like (mumbles) yeah? </joey>
<connor> - I can't blame them. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly. I'd probably do the same when I have kids, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm like an only child, </garnt>
<garnt> so I never had this experience, </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember like Sydney talking about it all the time </garnt>
<garnt> where your parents would just take you to events </garnt>
<garnt> and then you would just give all the responsibility </garnt>
<garnt> to the older sibling to take care of the younger siblings. </garnt>
<joey> And just like, here's a bunch of money fuck off. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Have fun, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - I definitely have that. That's for sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I can't remember really maybe I was a little shy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I've very rarely had experiences like that. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I think like me </garnt>
<garnt> and my sister didn't really like share a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> the same like interests when we were growing up. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel as adults now, we are like starting to like share </garnt>
<garnt> more of like the same likes on things. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't really like remember going </garnt>
<joey> to a lot of events with my sister. </joey>
<joey> Maybe we went to like a few concerts, but that's- </joey>
<garnt> - Did your parents ever take you to an event that you just </garnt>
<connor> didn't wanna fucking go to? </connor>
<connor> But you had to go to 'cause your parents were going to. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Football matches. </connor>
<garnt> - Football matches (giggles) </garnt>
<garnt> - My dad used to drag me to football matches. </garnt>
<garnt> He's gonna love this bit now. </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "I didn't drag you, you wanted to go?" </garnt>
<garnt> No, he would bribe me with chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> He would be like, I'll buy you like a Galaxy bar, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like this chocolate in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> Not like the small bars. - Yeah (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Like this sized block one, it's like, we got some serious </connor>
<connor> chocolate Malach here. </connor>
<connor> He's like I'll buy it for you. </connor>
<connor> And then the worst part my dad would laugh at this. </connor>
<garnt> When I was like eight, he would take me to like pub before </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where it was literally like a football club, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So it's cheap. It's dirty. </garnt>
<garnt> It's absolutely rammed. It stinks. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like everyone is eating like pork scratchings and </garnt>
<garnt> downing like really cheap pints. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually remember just sitting there just like not </garnt>
<garnt> understanding anything although that they would just ask me </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes stuff about football and I'd be like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Wayne Rooney. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just remember I never understood anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And one time I went to a match and Everton, </garnt>
<garnt> my dad's obsessed with like Everton family and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember they'd won because I was there </garnt>
<garnt> and my dad was like convinced </garnt>
<garnt> that I was the good luck charm. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I got dragged to more, I told him, I hate it. </garnt>
<joey> I do not want to go. </joey>
<joey> I absolutely despise this 'cause I would just stand there. </joey>
<joey> And I remember it was cold and it was so loud </joey>
<joey> and I just wanted to play my Game Boy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I had to watch these people kick </joey>
<joey> and I was like, why is it 90 minutes long? </joey>
<connor> That's so long. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) - So yeah. </joey>
<joey> To a child, 90 minutes is long. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. And I would always be like, can I get some like... </connor>
<joey> 'cause I don't know why as a kid, I just wanted to eat. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just wanted to eat. </joey>
<garnt> And they would sell those like stupidly long hot dogs </garnt>
<garnt> at these football events. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember one time I had one and my dad let me like, </garnt>
<garnt> just like hold onto it for like two seconds and someone </garnt>
<garnt> bumped into me and I dropped it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was so mortified. </garnt>
<joey> And I remember, I think that ruined football for me. </joey>
<joey> I was like, no, I'm done. </joey>
<connor> - I can't even eat a hotdog in peace </connor>
<connor> - This guy didn't even buy me a new one. </connor>
<connor> He like knocked me over. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But I was like eight, I dunno how to articulate. </connor>
<garnt> All I remember was I was just really sad that I dropped this </garnt>
<garnt> hot dog. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you couldn't buy a new one </garnt>
<garnt> - So my dad had just given me like enough money to buy it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like he'd like, let me have it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then all the other food was like steak kidney pies from </garnt>
<joey> this thing called Pukka Pies in the UK. </joey>
<garnt> That's was so bad, really bad. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I sorta liked it, </garnt>
<garnt> but just remember being like totally confused and not really </garnt>
<garnt> understanding it. </garnt>
<joey> And I never really liked football. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - My brothers did though. </joey>
<joey> They liked going. </joey>
<joey> And my older brother liked it a lot, </joey>
<joey> but I just never liked it. </joey>
<joey> And I felt like I was a failure to my dad </joey>
<connor> 'cause he was like, I just want you to like sports. </connor>
<connor> Why can't you like sports? </connor>
<garnt> - Like be a normal person and like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Football </garnt>
<connor> I'm like the only kid in the UK that didn't like football. </connor>
<connor> I was like, why? </connor>
<joey> - I remember 'cause my parents were like really into like </joey>
<connor> looking at property, right? </connor>
<connor> - Like what? (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And for the longest time I was like, </connor>
<garnt> are we gonna move house? </garnt>
<garnt> I would get excited </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, no, we're just looking? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like, we're literally window shopping houses. </garnt>
<connor> And they're like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I was like two to like a 10 year old. </connor>
<connor> I was like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Like the most non privileged thing I've ever heard. </connor>
<joey> - Well, because my dad is heavily into stocks </joey>
<garnt> and investing. </garnt>
<connor> - He's investment. - He's an investor. </connor>
<connor> - I'm watching a home in the sun </connor>
<connor> because it's for investment. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. He was an investor, right? </joey>
<joey> And also like my parents used to go a lot as well </joey>
<garnt> so that they could get inspirations for like interior design </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that because my dad loved doing renovations </garnt>
<connor> into the house and stuff. </connor>
<connor> So he would get a lot of like good ideas from that, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] That makes more sense. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. But to a 10 year old, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck like all that shit is. </connor>
<connor> You would think if your parents came up to you and said, </connor>
<connor> "Son, we're gonna go check out some houses today." </connor>
<garnt> The first thing you would think of as a 10 year old is, </garnt>
<garnt> Yay, we're moving. </garnt>
<garnt> And my sister who's three years younger than me </garnt>
<garnt> was like we're moving houses, that's so exciting, yay! </garnt>
<garnt> So really for the first couple of times, </garnt>
<garnt> we'd go along with them. </garnt>
<garnt> Until we realized, we're not moving, </garnt>
<garnt> - we're just looking at houses - Just looking at them. </garnt>
<joey> - I have a question, actually, this just came out. </joey>
<joey> You can't answer it Garnt unfortunately. </joey>
<garnt> It's about brothers and sisters. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So obviously let's say there's two siblings </connor>
<connor> or three siblings in my house. </connor>
<connor> How was it decided, who gets which bedroom in your house? </connor>
<connor> - That's a good question. </connor>
<joey> Well. - Did you ever ask. </joey>
<connor> - "Mad Royale Squid Game" </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I am the middle son. </joey>
<connor> And I got the tiniest room. </connor>
<garnt> - Ah, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, I think for us, we got lucky because the house </garnt>
<garnt> that I grew up in or I was born in was like bought </garnt>
<connor> just at the same time as they got that house. </connor>
<connor> So I basically got first dips. </connor>
<connor> Because my sister wasn't born yet. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, so you got to choose? </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't like a three year old being like, </connor>
<joey> Father, this room is a little larger than the other one. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you know, what's funny. </connor>
<connor> That's exactly what my parents fucking did. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - They asked me when I was like two or whatever, </connor>
<connor> which room I wanted. </connor>
<connor> - Gosh, when you were two, </connor>
<connor> - I don't know at an age </connor>
<connor> where I cannot comprehend what I am doing. </connor>
<joey> - It's a big space either way for a kid. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I'm like, this is fine. </joey>
<joey> This is great. </joey>
<connor> I think I literally chose like the Harry Potter closet and </connor>
<connor> I'm like Mom don't fucking believe what two or </connor>
<connor> three-year old Connor choose. </connor>
<connor> Why would you do that? </connor>
<connor> - Mom comes out with a contractor. Is this you, </connor>
<connor> this your name? </connor>
<garnt> - I've got the receipt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you sign this? - You signed by blood. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you sign this? I'm. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<connor> I would never choose it. </connor>
<connor> You know, I would've never chosen. </connor>
<joey> - I got the room, which was right next to my parents' room </joey>
<garnt> because obviously I was the firstborn child </garnt>
<garnt> - And then my sister, got the lost room. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which just so happened to be next to the toilet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember she would complain because I think our rooms </garnt>
<garnt> were pretty much the same size. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it might have been minor differences, </garnt>
<garnt> but it didn't really matter. </garnt>
<garnt> It was roughly the same size. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember my sister used to complain being like, </garnt>
<garnt> at least you're not fucking in a room where every time </garnt>
<joey> someone wanna take a shit in the middle of the night, </joey>
<joey> you get woken up by it. </joey>
<joey> And that sounds like you problem </joey>
<connor> - But also you're closest to the toilet. </connor>
<garnt> - That's that's what I said. </garnt>
<connor> That's an advantage. </connor>
<garnt> That's a perk. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm wondering comments. </garnt>
<joey> If you have brothers and sisters or what, whatever, </joey>
<connor> how was it decided which room was given to who </connor>
<joey> - Can't relate </joey>
<connor> - or you were all shoved into one room? </connor>
<connor> - Can't relate. </connor>
<joey> - Well actually, yeah. </joey>
<joey> When we were really little, my sister and I </joey>
<garnt> obviously just slept in the same room, in the same bed. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it was probably maybe when I was six or seven </garnt>
<connor> that I finally got to pick one of the rooms, </connor>
<connor> I don't remember there being like a ritualistic "Squid Game" </connor>
<connor> of like, well now fight to the death. </connor>
<connor> - It was just, apparently I chose this room, which is- </connor>
<connor> - You remember choosing the room? </connor>
<garnt> - No, of course not. </garnt>
<connor> I don't. I remember I'd asked my parents later on. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, well, I chose it. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, why would you listen to me? </connor>
<connor> Why? I am not in the right mind. </connor>
<connor> I cannot make good decisions. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was probably massive to you when you chose it, </garnt>
<garnt> - It was tiny. </garnt>
<garnt> There was no place to put more than like a single bed. </garnt>
<garnt> Not that I would ever need more than a single bed. </garnt>
<connor> - Like even if I wanted bigger, </connor>
<connor> there was actually no space to put it anywhere. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And so it was just like- </connor>
<connor> - Of course you talking about that, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like you obviously remember it different to your parents. </garnt>
<garnt> So I guarantee your parents are gonna remember it and recall </garnt>
<garnt> all are differently being like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I specifically remember Connor fucking </garnt>
<garnt> volunteering his tribute. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes, I will take the smallest room for the family. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Going back to like weird events your parents </garnt>
<garnt> are taking you to. </garnt>
<garnt> The thing that sticks out to my mind right now is my </garnt>
<garnt> parents or my Mom once took me to a meditation meetup. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was a meditation meetup. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - So my Mom's like Buddhist. </joey>
<joey> This was before I became like a monk or a kid monk or </joey>
<joey> anything like that. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you pray or you meditate for good karma </joey>
<joey> and all that stuff. </joey>
<connor> So sometimes when Mom would go to like these, </connor>
<connor> Buddhist meetups or these meditation meets up. </connor>
<connor> What you do at this meetup is you go there and you meditate </connor>
<connor> for about an hour in like darkness. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - With a bunch of other people or like? </connor>
<garnt> - With a bunch of other people. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was about seven years old when this happened. </garnt>
<garnt> I think like at time there was no one to take care </garnt>
<garnt> at home or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> But my Mom's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Garnt you're coming with me, we're gonna meditate" </garnt>
<garnt> I remember her framing it in a way where we're just gonna </garnt>
<garnt> meditate for a little bit, like five minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it was in my head. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know how long, </garnt>
<garnt> I would be sitting still for at this meet up. </garnt>
<garnt> She taught me how to meditate and we'd do it for </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 to like 15 minutes at most. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I thought I was getting into. So we get there. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the head guy was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, thank you all for coming. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're gonna be sitting here. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna hit the gong and we're gonna turn off lights </garnt>
<garnt> and we're gonna just sit here for an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> And after the hours on, I'm gonna hit the gong again." </garnt>
<connor> - "Squid Game" </connor>
<connor> After you turn the lights off, half people are dead there. </connor>
<connor> - And so I remember thinking, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> I've got to sit here in silence for an hour. </connor>
<joey> What? I was seven years old. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't like sit still for five minutes let alone a hour. </joey>
<joey> - Like solving the God equation. </joey>
<joey> So I remember sitting down, I'm like fucking panicking. </joey>
<joey> Trying to figure out. </joey>
<garnt> How the fuck I am going to sit here for an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> I look over to my Mom. </garnt>
<garnt> My Mom's just like already like in the zone. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - She's already gone - She's long gone. </joey>
<garnt> - She's in another fucking dimension right now. </garnt>
<garnt> And so he hits the gong. </garnt>
<garnt> Luckily they have a clock in the room so you can see how </garnt>
<garnt> much time goes past. </garnt>
<garnt> Now what you're meant to do during meditation is like, </garnt>
<garnt> you are meant to just clear your mind, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The point of an hour is that it shouldn't feel like an hour </garnt>
<garnt> because to your minds, it should be as empty as possible. </garnt>
<garnt> So you shouldn't really feel the passage of time or you </garnt>
<garnt> should feel it less than usual. Right? </garnt>
<connor> That's the entire like "zone" </connor>
<connor> you're supposed to get with meditation. </connor>
<connor> So I remember thinking, all right Garnt, you got this, </connor>
<connor> you've meditated for 15 minutes. </connor>
<connor> You can do an hour. </connor>
<connor> And I remember sitting there and to me, </connor>
<connor> I think about 40 minutes has past, </connor>
<connor> let me sneak over at the clock. </connor>
<connor> I look over five minutes has gone by. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, oh, I start fucking sweating. </connor>
<connor> I look around- </connor>
<connor> - How are you seeing the clock in the dark? - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - It was like one of the glow in the dark - Oh, Okay. </connor>
<connor> - With like luminescence. </connor>
<connor> - That makes it even harder not to look as a kid. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna look at the glow. </connor>
<joey> - So I come up with this five head strategy. </joey>
<joey> Because at that point I was obsessed with "Pokemon" </joey>
<garnt> - Who wasn't? - Yeah. Who wasn't? </garnt>
<garnt> I remember like back in the day I had like recorded like an </garnt>
<garnt> entire season of Pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> and that was like my only entertainment. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had like watched this VHS </garnt>
<garnt> on this recording of "Pokemon" like fucking 10, 20 times. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you should </garnt>
<joey> So I think to myself, how am I going to get through an hour? </joey>
<garnt> I got a five head idea. </garnt>
<garnt> What if I just watched three episodes of Pokemon in my mind? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And if I watched three episodes of Pokemon in my mind an </garnt>
<garnt> hour went up fast. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I remember this- </garnt>
<garnt> - This fucking serially experiments lane. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I like escape. It's either casual in my mind. </garnt>
<connor> - Is this the metaverse? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Like entered the metaverse in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just start watching, I just start playing </garnt>
<garnt> the episodes of Pokemon that I can remember. </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately, I think some gaps were missed off </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember like watching in my mind. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Three episodes looking at the clock </connor>
<connor> and half an hour had gone by. </connor>
<connor> Maybe time moves differently in my mind </connor>
<connor> - Garnt got a gold sprint on for watching "Pokemon" </connor>
<garnt> - So I think I watched an entire season of "Pokemon" </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind. </garnt>
<joey> - Your mind was just like, all right. </joey>
<joey> - Cutting out all the filler right now. </joey>
<joey> Only the important information. </joey>
<joey> - I think I got through an entire fucking season. </joey>
<joey> And then I finally hear the gong and I'm like thank fuck. </joey>
<joey> And I remember afterwards some of my Mom's friends comes </joey>
<joey> over to her and be like, </joey>
<joey> I'm like so impressed with your son. </joey>
<joey> Like, how do you sit there for an hour? </joey>
<joey> Like my son can't concentrate anything for five minutes. </joey>
<joey> I'm so impressed with your son. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm just like, they dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> I just watched "Pokemon" one for an hour. </garnt>
<joey> - Meanwhile you are drenching in sweat. </joey>
<joey> - What does Ash say again in this episode, </joey>
<joey> - No, Ash was about to get into the indigo league. </joey>
<garnt> At least you stopped at a fucking good point, man. </garnt>
<connor> - How the fuck did you do that? That's insane. </connor>
<connor> - This man literally opened up his third eye by reciting </connor>
<joey> "Pokemon" in his head. </joey>
<connor> - Anime companies hate this one trick to letting you rewatch </connor>
<connor> the Anime in your mind. </connor>
<joey> - You wanna recite "Pokemon"? </joey>
<joey> - That's the real secret to like reaching in Lightman. </joey>
<joey> You don't empty your mind. </joey>
<garnt> You just watch one piece in your mind and you just reach </garnt>
<garnt> enlightenment </garnt>
<garnt> - Could you do that now? </garnt>
<garnt> - I could not do that now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I could watch a show and then </garnt>
<connor> couldn't do that immediately after. </connor>
<garnt> - Because that was back in the day when you were a kid </garnt>
<connor> and you had like that one thing that you watched overnight. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - You could just like recite it. </joey>
<garnt> I remember I could probably like recite the entire movie of </garnt>
<joey> "Toy Story" or something in my mind, </joey>
<joey> just because like I watched it so many times. </joey>
<garnt> - Damn </garnt>
<joey> - There are some movies like that too. </joey>
<garnt> I could probably recite the entirety of "Pulp Fiction" </garnt>
<garnt> it's 'cause I've seen it so many fucking times right now, </garnt>
<garnt> three and a half hour movie, let's go </garnt>
<garnt> - What you need to better meditate for that long? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, when I need to meditate </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like- </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] So what again? </garnt>
<garnt> So what again </garnt>
<garnt> - I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - You know what they call quarter pounder </joey>
<joey> with cheese in France? </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But Connor did you never have that as a kid? </garnt>
<garnt> Just like some, a game or something that you played </garnt>
<garnt> so many times that you could just like recite it for memory? </garnt>
<garnt> - No - Never. </garnt>
<connor> - Not recite here. I'd probably played SAFA Bunch, </connor>
<connor> but never seen I had to recite from memory. </connor>
<joey> - But are you the kind of person who remembers </joey>
<joey> song lyrics easily? </joey>
<connor> - Not, not at all. - [Joey] Okay. </connor>
<joey> - I actually cannot remember song lyrics without looking at </joey>
<joey> the sheet. - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And even then it's like, it'll last like a day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because it's really interesting. </joey>
<joey> There's two types of people where there's like, </joey>
<joey> there's ones who are like, </joey>
<joey> you can listen to a song once and you just like </joey>
<garnt> miraculously just remember how the lyrics go. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there are people who are just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I could listen to this song 50 times and it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll recognize the lyrics if someone tells me, </garnt>
<joey> but I can't recite. - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> So I had this realization the other day because I've </garnt>
<garnt> obviously given Connor a lot of shit for like </garnt>
<garnt> hearing the beeps and the boops. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I just had this realization that I think I listen </garnt>
<garnt> to music like beeps and beeps as well, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Lyrics mean nothing to me. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so weird. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where I listen to a song and if lyrics aren't there </garnt>
<connor> I feel like something's missing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I do think lyrics need is a part of the song. </connor>
<connor> But to me, lyrics are almost like another instrument to me. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird. - [Joey] Oh, yeah </connor>
<connor> - Where I don't listen to what they're saying. </connor>
<garnt> You can take a song that I love and you lay the lyrics out </garnt>
<garnt> in front of me and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never heard this song in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) What is the song? </garnt>
<joey> - Well I would argue that best artists and the best singers </joey>
<joey> and the best bands, as you said, use their voice as an </joey>
<joey> instrument. </joey>
<joey> But then if you want to read into the lyrics, </joey>
<joey> the lyrics are also profound. </joey>
<joey> where unfortunately, very few artists can do that. </joey>
<joey> Where it's either you concentrate fully on </joey>
<joey> the lyrics to be like, here's a deep, poetic meaning behind. </joey>
<connor> - If I'm understanding this, you're saying </connor>
<connor> the voice is a part of the song. </connor>
<connor> Is that what you're saying? (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Well, yeah, no shit. </connor>
<connor> - But there are a lot of artists who don't see it </connor>
<connor> that way and it also depends on how the song's mixed. </connor>
<joey> But like some artists you hear and it's just like, oh, </joey>
<joey> I wish I could hear the instruments because it's just being </joey>
<joey> drowned out by the singing. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know </joey>
<garnt> - Have you ever properly listened to the lyrics of </garnt>
<garnt> a song and it's changed the way you think about a song </garnt>
<connor> because you properly actually read into it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like the new Weekend album's really good. </connor>
<garnt> But if you just actually listen to what he's saying, </garnt>
<garnt> it's depressing as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that rarely ever- </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like vibing. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, dude, this song is so good. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> ♪ I'm fucking depressed ♪ </garnt>
<connor> and shit is going wrong. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, yeah, fuck this is so good. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Wait, what'd you say? </joey>
<garnt> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You like listening and it's like, wait, hold on. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. He de... what? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I can't even get to that moment. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's really weird. </garnt>
<connor> But like sometimes if there's like a disconnect between how </connor>
<connor> the song makes me feel versus what the lyrics are saying, </connor>
<connor> I always like go towards what the song makes me feel. </connor>
<garnt> - Same </garnt>
<joey> - And it's so weird </joey>
<connor> because I dunno how much of this is bullshit. </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to the beeps and boops day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. That's it. </connor>
<connor> I hear the beeps and the boops. </connor>
<connor> The beeps and the boobs make me feel something. </connor>
<garnt> And that's what I feel towards a song that I hardly ever </garnt>
<garnt> listen to lyrics at all, </garnt>
<joey> because it never changes how I feel towards the song. </joey>
<joey> It's so weird. </joey>
<garnt> - I just- </garnt>
<garnt> - You guys are literally that type of people who would make </garnt>
<joey> a fucking art Buzzfeed article being like top 10 songs that </joey>
<connor> have a dark meaning. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] We're engineers. </joey>
<connor> - And be like, did you know? </connor>
<connor> - I hear the fucking music it comes in and it just comes in </connor>
<garnt> like a fucking graph in my head. </garnt>
<garnt> It comes in like- </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] The thing is, I get that. I totally get that. </joey>
<garnt> - But I feel it I do have emotions towards it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't give a shit what he's talking about. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just in taking the noise. </joey>
<connor> And the noise either makes me feel something or it doesn't. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Which is why I think for a lot of songs where there is like </joey>
<garnt> a stark contrast between how the song makes you feel versus </garnt>
<garnt> how the lyrics make you feel. - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is like a big whiplash for people like you guys </garnt>
<connor> oh, what the fuck?. - Preface live. </connor>
<joey> It is different though. </joey>
<connor> Definitely there's a lot more to it when its a recorded </connor>
<connor> album. - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like that's why I find it so easy to listen to </joey>
<joey> a lot of Japanese music or a lot of like music in </joey>
<joey> a language that I don't understand. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I have no idea what the lyrics they are spitting </joey>
<joey> most of the time, but you know, part of me is like, </joey>
<joey> I feel the emotions hard. - But this goes had </joey>
<garnt> - I feel the emotion that they're singing right now. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah. Definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - I kind get it, even though I probably don't get it. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like I get it. </joey>
<joey> - I can tell you I take 90% of Anime openings. </joey>
<garnt> The lyrics are depressing as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> But just weaves that are kind of like (mumbles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Which I find it's cool. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I find really interesting though about people </garnt>
<garnt> who can do that - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the reason why I feel that in and of itself, </garnt>
<garnt> that discovery of when people find out this really bright </garnt>
<joey> and colorful and very positive sounding song </joey>
<joey> actually has a really fucking dark meaning. </joey>
<joey> And it's that realization of like, oh, shit </joey>
<joey> I just got played because I wasn't listening to the lyrics. </joey>
<garnt> - That's why 'cause we like had this idea to do a music </garnt>
<garnt> three by three, for like ages and I've like low key actually </garnt>
<garnt> been shitting myself at the- - [Joey] Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because one of the mediums </garnt>
<garnt> I find hardest to fucking explain </garnt>
<garnt> - Is music - Is music </garnt>
<garnt> Because I literally hear this song- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] This sounds good </garnt>
<garnt> - This song made me feel things. </garnt>
<garnt> I just really like it. </garnt>
<garnt> And people are like oh, </garnt>
<garnt> did you know the meaning of that song? </garnt>
<garnt> I have no idea of the meaning of that song. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it made me feel things. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It make me feel things. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] I get that. </joey>
<garnt> - Welcome to the beeps and the boops ladies and gentlemen </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought you were in my team. </garnt>
<connor> I feel betrayed. </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to the beeps and boops. </connor>
<joey> - I feel absolutely betrayed goddamnit </joey>
<connor> - The music episode would be Joey talking with you out. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then me and Garnt go, I like this one. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That why I almost don't want to do it. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I think I'd rather just make a video. </connor>
<joey> - You carry the episode. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Which might be the shortest Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> episode of all time. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, probably </connor>
<connor> - Like 40 minutes in and we're like, and that's it? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. All right. Thanks for joining Trash Taste </connor>
<garnt> - Do you have an example of like a song where </garnt>
<garnt> you found more like reading into the lyrics </garnt>
<garnt> and the deeper meaning of that song, as opposed to just </garnt>
<garnt> listening to the initial beats, the beeps and boops. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll go into like- - Pink Floyd, The wall. </connor>
<connor> - Well, yes, that too. </connor>
<connor> I think there's a lot of like artists that, you know... </connor>
<connor> it's that brilliance of using the lead singer as just like </connor>
<garnt> an instrument it where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> if you're not listening to the lyrics or anything like that, </garnt>
<garnt> it still sounds great. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's still like sticky in your head. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then one day you're like, I've listened to this song </garnt>
<garnt> like three or four times, </garnt>
<garnt> but I've never actually read the lyrics, </garnt>
<garnt> let me read into the lyrics and then you read into it </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of it's very like poetic and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> completely changes the way you view that song. </garnt>
<garnt> Like Turning Japanese, you know that song? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - No </garnt>
<garnt> ♪Turning Japanese ♪ </garnt>
<garnt> ♪I think I'm turning... ♪ </garnt>
<garnt> (mimicking the song beat) </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't know that song? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know that song. </garnt>
<garnt> - That song's about masturbation. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But no one knows it because no one reads into the lyrics. </garnt>
<joey> They just hear the (mimicking the song beat) </joey>
<joey> and I was like, oh yeah, love that song. </joey>
<garnt> - Is that what Turning Japanese is about? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - It's about masturbation. </joey>
<connor> - I've never heard of this song. </connor>
<joey> - Well like how Pumped Up Kicks is about school shootings </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I know that one. </connor>
<garnt> - Like when people first discovered that they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God, I've been fucking gebaited. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's catchy as shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's catchy as fuck. </garnt>
<connor> It's a jam of a song </connor>
<garnt> I find that to be like... </garnt>
<garnt> As someone who also writes music that is so much fucking </garnt>
<garnt> harder than it looks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. No, I can imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel bad that I don't, </garnt>
<garnt> or I have the inability to appreciate it because like, but- </garnt>
<joey> - But I feel that's fine because, </joey>
<joey> I feel with those kinds of songs they're taking into account </joey>
<joey> how it sounds first, </joey>
<joey> and then they think about the meaning afterwards. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I think the only exception is with rap music, </joey>
<joey> where it is just like basically just lyrical poems </joey>
<garnt> to a beat. </garnt>
<joey> So that's where I actually have more of an understanding or </joey>
<joey> like an image in my head of, oh man, </joey>
<connor> these lyrics go fucking hard so- </connor>
<connor> - I do listen to the lyrics of rap, try to, at least. </connor>
<connor> It's hard though. </connor>
<connor> - But like most of the times I actually see the lyrics </connor>
<joey> sheets and it almost transforms it that to a point </joey>
<joey> where I don't even recognize the song anymore. </joey>
<joey> It was always like separate from the song itself. </joey>
<joey> It's so weird. </joey>
<joey> If someone can explain this to me, </joey>
<joey> I'm super curious because I am incapable of like getting </joey>
<garnt> the meaning of lyrics as I'm listening to the song </garnt>
<garnt> at the same time. </garnt>
<joey> - You recognize it has anything to do with the fact that </joey>
<joey> I'm the only musical trained one outta the three of us? </joey>
<connor> - No, probably pretty appreciate it more. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, - Maybe </garnt>
<garnt> - To me it's all noise. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I like it. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But it's noise. - I can play musical instruments, </joey>
<joey> but I've never been like professionally trained. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that's just what it is. </joey>
<garnt> I feel it's just because you've been trained to listen </garnt>
<garnt> to music in a different way. - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That you can just perceive these smaller points that other </garnt>
<garnt> people would just perceive as just the beeps and the boops. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, to me, like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like people who go to a gallery and look at art. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of them have just been trained to look at this thing </garnt>
<garnt> in a completely different way that you otherwise would've </garnt>
<garnt> a very hard time grasping. </garnt>
<garnt> You go to an art gallery with an art critic and they'd be </garnt>
<joey> like, yes, I love the flow and the texture and the feelings </joey>
<garnt> that I get from it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's making me feel this way. </garnt>
<joey> And the average person looking it be like, oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> I like the color red as well. </joey>
<joey> I think it's just based on how you are trained. </joey>
<garnt> - I can play musical instruments and stuff like that, </garnt>
<joey> but I've never like studied music theory or </joey>
<joey> anything like that. </joey>
<joey> So when I like wrote songs before it was more like </joey>
<joey> (mumbles) sound nice or something like that </joey>
<joey> Chord sound nice. </joey>
<joey> That was just like my process. </joey>
<joey> (Joey indistinctly speaking) </joey>
<connor> - Musically trained. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, musically trained. </garnt>
<garnt> - Goddamn. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, at this rate, I don't know if we'll ever </garnt>
<joey> actually end up doing a music three by three. </joey>
<connor> - I'm down. I just gotta think of nine albums </connor>
<connor> I like right now- </connor>
<joey> - Are we doing albums or artists? That's the question. </joey>
<connor> - we should do artists. </connor>
<connor> - Artists, okay- </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like- </connor>
<connor> - I think of 4, 5 that I feel like I could strongly say </connor>
<garnt> I've listened to everything. I like everything. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of others I'm like I like this one album. </garnt>
<joey> Like Arctic Monkeys, I like a lot, but not every album. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right </joey>
<joey> - And I get it. </joey>
<joey> You wanna be experimental to your thing, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know how I can sit there and be like, </joey>
<joey> this is one of my favorite artists, by the way, </joey>
<joey> this one album's shit I don't like. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I think that's a valid- </joey>
<connor> - I mean like- </connor>
<joey> - A lot of my favorite artists have a shit album or two. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, I dunno if I'm a anomaly in this as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't normally listen to albums as a whole. </garnt>
<joey> - You just listen to a song </joey>
<joey> - That's very normal. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like shitting myself, thinking of nine albums. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like, how many four albums have I listened to? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I mean it's just- </joey>
<joey> - We'll do it eventually. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. We'll do it eventually. </joey>
<joey> - I gotta figure out how to like talk about music first. </joey>
<joey> - You guys deal with that. </joey>
<joey> And then when you guys are ready, </joey>
<joey> come back and then we can do it. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like he was trying to say something with this song. </joey>
<garnt> I could feel it. I don't know what it was exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> But I feel like- - I like these words. </garnt>
<garnt> - In the song he said he felt it coming many times </garnt>
<connor> and I believe he did feel it coming. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I was definitely coming as well. </joey>
<garnt> My God. </garnt>
<connor> - But anyway, that's been this week's Trash Taste episode </connor>
