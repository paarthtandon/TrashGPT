<joey> Come on, let's be real here. </joey>
<garnt> - Shut up. </garnt>
<joey> (gentle music) </joey>
<garnt> - Welcome to this episode of "Trash Taste", </garnt>
<garnt> I am the boy, the big boy. </garnt>
<connor> And with me I have big boy chungus and small boy chungus. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - Why am I suddenly the fattest one here? </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I was gonna call... Okay, right? </connor>
<connor> I haven't seen either of you at the gym lately, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what's been going on with that, </connor>
<connor> but, you know, I am very disappointed. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, who was the one that got a C in cholesterol </garnt>
<garnt> at the fucking like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Are we gonna start adding each other that, really? </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, let's do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanted to open on that, 'cause you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I was doing my usual "Trash Taste" schedule </garnt>
<garnt> and shitting on the toilet, literally before recording, </garnt>
<garnt> I get a phone call from Sydney, </garnt>
<connor> and she said, oh, "I finally got my health results back in," </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Congratulations, what'd you get Sydney?" </connor>
<garnt> And she got all A's. </garnt>
<garnt> - How the fuck is Sydney's liver an A? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like fuck off Sydney, fuck off you got all A's. </garnt>
<joey> - How is it that she gets all A's </joey>
<garnt> and yet I got a C on my liver? </garnt>
<garnt> When I'm probably the one out of the four of us </garnt>
<garnt> who drinks the least. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so to give context to this conversation. </garnt>
<joey> So a few weeks ago, </joey>
<joey> if you are a regular "Trash Taste" viewer </joey>
<joey> you would know that we had our, </joey>
<joey> biannual or annual health check? </joey>
<joey> - Annual. </joey>
<joey> - Annual health check, and I didn't know- </joey>
<connor> - Which is something that a Japanese company </connor>
<connor> forces every employee to do, </connor>
<connor> they have to go for a checkup </connor>
<connor> and the company also gets the results. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<garnt> - And so we did our health checkup a few weeks ago, </garnt>
<connor> I talked about it on "Trash Taste", </connor>
<garnt> and we just got our results back. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is the first time I've ever gotten results back </garnt>
<connor> from like, you know, getting my health checkup </connor>
<connor> in a foreign company, country sorry, </connor>
<connor> and I did not know that you get graded. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm used to seeing numbers </garnt>
<joey> and them saying like, "Oh, this is bad." </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, oh well, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's just a funny number, isn't it? 220 </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Literally, I got my health checkup </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, wait, they are literally grading you ABC? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like an end of year school report. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I felt like I was doing my GCSEs again, </garnt>
<garnt> or A levels, I'm like, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> And normally I don't really care too much </garnt>
<garnt> about my health checkup 'cause- </garnt>
<garnt> - Unless it's bad. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unless it bad, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You see numbers, you see the doctor's suggestions, </garnt>
<garnt> and they're just that, they're just doctor's suggestions. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't know why, </garnt>
<garnt> seeing my health being graded like a school test, </garnt>
<connor> it just brought the Asian blood out of me, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I definitely felt more competitive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - With my body. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I was going through my health checkup </connor>
<connor> and overall I got a B, so I was like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I am a straight A student, what the fuck did I do wrong? </connor>
<joey> - There's no B Asian, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - No, deadass. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - In Asia B means bad. </joey>
<joey> - Deadass, the first thing I did when I got my results </joey>
<joey> was I phoned up my mom and told her how well I scored </joey>
<joey> in this exam, like a good Asian son would. </joey>
<joey> - I called up the doctor, and I was like, just to check, </joey>
<connor> this wasn't ranked, was it? </connor>
<connor> This was casual, right? </connor>
<connor> This is free play, right? </connor>
<connor> Please say this was psyche, please. </connor>
<connor> No, but I mean my results, I got like all As, </connor>
<joey> which was great, </joey>
<garnt> I should expect from someone who is under the age of 30, </garnt>
<garnt> you're generally supposed to be quite healthy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But I got a B on BMI, </connor>
<connor> which, I mean, obviously I'm built a little different, </connor>
<connor> and this is Japanese BMI </connor>
<connor> which I believe is slightly different, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I'm led to believe that's correct. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, BMI is bullshit anyway, a load of shit, </connor>
<connor> this is 100% muscle not fat, don't at me. </connor>
<garnt> And I got a C on my cholesterol. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Ooh. </connor>
<connor> - But I got like a... </connor>
<garnt> Well, I'm not sure how cholesterol works exactly, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I don't know shit, I'm dumb. </connor>
<connor> So they have like three different collaterals, </connor>
<connor> and all of them were like a little, you know, </connor>
<garnt> all of them were kinds out of touch, if you will. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Right - [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<garnt> - But I was like, in my head I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> well they gave me three Cs now for my cholesterol, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, but what are the odds </garnt>
<joey> of one of these cholesterol being good </joey>
<garnt> and the others not being good, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I had amazing cholesterol, </garnt>
<garnt> the other two aren't gonna be like, </garnt>
<joey> well, fuck, we better pick it up. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I don't know, to me it was odd. </connor>
<garnt> - Mine was worse because I got a C on my liver, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think a B on my heart rate monitoring or something? </garnt>
<connor> - Right. - Oh, really? </connor>
<garnt> - And everything else was an A. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. - What does that mean? </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing. It's like, usually on your thing, </joey>
<connor> I think you too got like a doctor's note, right? </connor>
<connor> - Mh-hm. </connor>
<connor> - Did you guys get a doctor's summary? </connor>
<connor> - So you can ask when you get the thing, </connor>
<joey> I don't know if you said yes or no. </joey>
<joey> You can ask if you want advice, </joey>
<joey> and I said, no, I don't want advice. </joey>
<joey> - I said no either, but I still got like... </joey>
<connor> I don't know if it's the same doctor's note </connor>
<connor> that we're talking about, but it was just like a summation </connor>
<garnt> of the test results. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which didn't explain anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it didn't explain. </garnt>
<connor> It just said some of the values are a bit, </connor>
<garnt> you know, abnormal, which is, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> higher or lower than we expect, </garnt>
<garnt> but there shouldn't be anything to worry about. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't even get a summation. </garnt>
<joey> - Did you not? </joey>
<joey> - Mine literally, like overall, </joey>
<connor> I got a C and the summation box was just blank. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, mine too. </joey>
<garnt> - So what, you're just gonna tell me </garnt>
<connor> that my liver is bad and that's it? </connor>
<joey> - Should I be worried? </joey>
<joey> - I feel like context would help, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you get a note that said you had to come in </connor>
<connor> three months later as well? Like Connor did. </connor>
<connor> - I did, I got that. </connor>
<garnt> They told me to go back in three months, but it's optional. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, on the thing it says, like if you get a C, </garnt>
<garnt> they recommend you come back three months later, </garnt>
<garnt> although I didn't get a note </garnt>
<garnt> saying that I should come back. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mine said you should come back in three months, </garnt>
<garnt> but you have to pay for it. </garnt>
<garnt> And also, you know, for cholesterol, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm obviously gonna turn up and they're gonna be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, you should exercise and eat healthy." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Thanks Doc." </garnt>
<garnt> - I was gonna ask, 'cause I heard </garnt>
<garnt> you're back on the chicken and broccoli diets. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I haven't gone right back to the chicken and broccoli. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have started eating a little more </garnt>
<garnt> health conscious though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it because of the test results? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it helped, helped me be a bit more conscious. </garnt>
<garnt> It made me, you know, when you would maybe just go </garnt>
<garnt> for the karaage, or you'd go for the chips? </garnt>
<connor> It made me like second think, like, do I really want it? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I definitely have like stopped drinking. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I think I've only drank like once or twice since. </connor>
<garnt> - Is the liver, 100% all problems come from alcohol? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like it's not just that, </joey>
<garnt> there's gotta be a whole host of other things. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's probably not. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the problem with the test results is that </joey>
<connor> they gave you the grade but they didn't tell you </connor>
<connor> how to improve it. </connor>
<connor> And I guess that was our bad </connor>
<connor> 'cause we literally ticked the box </connor>
<garnt> that said we don't want doctor's advice. </garnt>
<connor> Because I had assumed, like any other health checkup, </connor>
<connor> that it would just be like, you know, the- </connor>
<connor> - That you're gonna be good, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was just like the generic, </connor>
<connor> you know, are you doing well? </connor>
<connor> Do I need to go to the hospital </connor>
<connor> to really have a lifestyle change? No. </connor>
<joey> But as soon as I saw the fucking B, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I got a B in my blood, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like how the fuck do I improve my blood? </garnt>
<joey> What am I doing wrong? Why is my blood a B? </joey>
<garnt> - Just improve your NaN? Just like control it. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause they were like going on like, </connor>
<connor> you know, the white blood or T-cell, </connor>
<connor> I'm not a fucking uh, I'm not a medical student. </connor>
<connor> - I saw the numbers, </connor>
<garnt> I just saw the A, I was like I'm (indistinct). </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I saw the B and I'm just like, as an Asian student, </connor>
<garnt> you know, 'cause whenever I saw a B in a test, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, okay, I can improve this test score. </connor>
<connor> I can study a bit more, </connor>
<connor> I can optimize this a bit more somehow. </connor>
<connor> - What I found interesting was that like, </connor>
<joey> I always thought to myself that I was very deaf for my age, </joey>
<garnt> because I went to a lot of concerts growing up, </garnt>
<garnt> and just basically destroyed my ears </garnt>
<joey> through headphones and shit like that. </joey>
<connor> So I was expecting, on the hearing part, </connor>
<connor> that I maybe get like a B or something, right? </connor>
<garnt> I wouldn't even have complained about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But then I saw I got an A, </garnt>
<connor> so I was like, oh, it's not that I'm deaf, </connor>
<connor> it's just that I don't listen. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> It kinda made me realize, I was like, oh okay, </garnt>
<connor> I'm glad to know. </connor>
<connor> I don't have a hearing problem, </connor>
<garnt> I just have like an attention problem. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just don't give a shit. - I just don't give a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's my problem. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was telling my company, I was like listen, </garnt>
<garnt> if my eyesight or my ears come back shit, </garnt>
<garnt> I know exactly why that is. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's because I didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck was happening when they were talking to me. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - They just put the headphones on me, </joey>
<connor> I'm like, wait what? Wait, whoa. </connor>
<joey> Then she asked me, luckily I just caught her asking, </joey>
<garnt> can you hear, in Japanese, like, can you hear it? </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, hear what? What am I listening for? </connor>
<connor> And then I realized, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I had done the "Human Benchmark" test recently, </connor>
<connor> that it was the frequency thing. </connor>
<connor> So you say when you can hear it. </connor>
<connor> But I was like, what am I hearing for, like a burp? </connor>
<garnt> I didn't know what was happening. </garnt>
<connor> So I was like, oh okay, shit, all right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, how did she... </connor>
<connor> Because with the eyesight thing, right? </connor>
<connor> You have to do like the, it's like a circle </connor>
<joey> but it's cut out, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - How did you guys say that in English? </joey>
<connor> - No, I said it in Japanese. - Or did you just point? </connor>
<garnt> (speaking in Japanese) </garnt>
<connor> - Oh right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I really fucked up in the eyesight thing, </connor>
<connor> because I didn't know what they were looking for. </connor>
<connor> So I thought it was a normal eyesight test thing, </connor>
<garnt> where now it's just like, E, A, because... </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, so to explain the eyesight thing, </garnt>
<garnt> they have this circle </garnt>
<garnt> and have one of like, </garnt>
<garnt> either up, down, left or right that's cut out. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, the diagonals as well, are cut out. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't see diagonals. - I didn't see diagonals. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was no diagonals. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, there were diagonals. </connor>
<garnt> - No there wasn't. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I only saw up, down, left, right. </connor>
<connor> - No, there were diagonals. </connor>
<joey> - No, 'cause I got all of them right. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I did too, but there were diagonals, </garnt>
<joey> - There was no diagonals. </joey>
<joey> There was no diagonals. </joey>
<garnt> - The one they gave me, they usually have diagonals, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never seen diagonals. </garnt>
<joey> Because the only reason I knew about this test </joey>
<joey> is 'cause when I exchanged my driving license </joey>
<joey> from British to Japanese, I had to do the exact same thing. </joey>
<connor> And it was this exact same thing again, </connor>
<garnt> and there was no diagonals. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I definitely got it right, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I came back with like a 1.2. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you got me like, </connor>
<garnt> what the fuck is this man talking about diagonals? </garnt>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because right next to the circle thing, </garnt>
<joey> you had like the letters as well. </joey>
<garnt> So I was just reading out letters </garnt>
<garnt> when they were asking what direction, </garnt>
<garnt> sir, what direction is missing from this circle? </garnt>
<garnt> - O, O, O, O. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was wondering why </garnt>
<garnt> she was looking at me really weird. </garnt>
<connor> And she kept asking me, "Can you see, can you see? </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, </connor>
<connor> let me just read out the letters for you." </connor>
<garnt> - So why are they all Os? This is easy as fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, luckily I'd done the simulation before, </connor>
<connor> so that's why I was not panicking as much, but yeah, man. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I clicked no to the health advice </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just figured </connor>
<connor> that it was gonna be the same old, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Eat healthy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause let's be honest, right? </connor>
<connor> Unless it's something bad, like really bad, </connor>
<connor> that actually requires treatment, right? </connor>
<garnt> They're just gonna tell me, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, you should exercise more and eat healthy," </garnt>
<connor> and I do most of that anyway. </connor>
<connor> - Because, I think for cholesterol it's pretty simple. </connor>
<garnt> - Unless you just like to eat. </garnt>
<connor> - But for some of them, like for example, liver or blood, </connor>
<garnt> you look at that result. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your blood's a little yikes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a number of factors, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, what do you even start with? </garnt>
<garnt> - How do I improve my white blood cell count? I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Do I just take an injection of white blood cells? </garnt>
<garnt> What do you want me to do? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have a theory, right? </garnt>
<garnt> This could be a very pleasant theory, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> My theory was, 'cause we got this health checkup done </garnt>
<garnt> right after like Christmas, and my theory was, </garnt>
<garnt> well I've just been drinking and eating straight </garnt>
<garnt> for like three weeks. </garnt>
<garnt> This is just, clearly we've gotta write this off, </garnt>
<garnt> this doesn't count man. </garnt>
<connor> Of course my collateral is gonna be higher, </connor>
<connor> I had like 8,000 calories three days ago, </connor>
<connor> of course it's gonna be higher. </connor>
<connor> - Sure. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I did drink a lot in Christmas so that might be it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I ate so much. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, my cholesterol is terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I definitely skewed the results, </garnt>
<connor> that's what I'm gonna chalk it down to. </connor>
<connor> - They're wrong, science is wrong. </connor>
<garnt> - Doctors out there, please validate me in the comments. </garnt>
<connor> I don't wanna hear it if you have an alternative theory, </connor>
<connor> just say if I'm right. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just found it funny how, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think this is definitely the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between Asian and Western culture, </garnt>
<garnt> where I feel like in Asia, living in Asia, </garnt>
<joey> they try to make everything a test, </joey>
<joey> and everything kind of competitive. </joey>
<joey> And that's how I was raised as well </joey>
<garnt> so whenever I see a grade something in my blood drives me </garnt>
<joey> to try and improve that grade. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I don't know if I'm just like over-competitive, </garnt>
<garnt> or I just, maybe- </garnt>
<joey> - Well I think it's good, right? </joey>
<joey> Because if you're the kind of person who you are, </joey>
<joey> those things work really well. </joey>
<joey> But there's obviously some personalities out there </joey>
<garnt> that when they hear, oh, by the way, your BMI is bad, </garnt>
<garnt> or your liver's bad, where they're just like, </garnt>
<joey> instead of wanting to be like, </joey>
<joey> well fuck you, I'm gonna improve it, </joey>
<garnt> it's like, oh shit, I guess it's just like, there's no hope. </garnt>
<garnt> Like why is it not working? </garnt>
<garnt> And then they just make it worse, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I don't know, </garnt>
<joey> I feel like as someone who grew up in, you know, </joey>
<garnt> kind of both cultures, I think a lot of toxicity </garnt>
<garnt> can come in putting so much value into a grade or a test. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like definitely living in Asia, </garnt>
<garnt> they put way too much value into test results </garnt>
<garnt> and score results. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think there are some schools and companies </garnt>
<garnt> where they get bullied if you got like a bad rating </garnt>
<garnt> on one of your health tests? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, totally, it's definitely a thing in Asia. </garnt>
<connor> - Look at this mo-fo who got a D in his blood. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because in Asia, I dunno if I'm talking out my ass, </connor>
<garnt> but you see in like anime definitely, </garnt>
<garnt> where you get the test results, right? </garnt>
<connor> And it's like publicly posted. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you publicly know what your fellow classmates got. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that to me seems like a lot of pressure. </joey>
<joey> - They do that for university, like entrance exams as well. </joey>
<joey> - That's fucking rude. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They create a huge billboard in front of the school </joey>
<joey> and it has like your number on it, </joey>
<connor> and if your number doesn't show up, you basically failed. </connor>
<connor> It's like a public execution </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they literally make a public tournament arc </connor>
<joey> for your test results. </joey>
<garnt> - It's brutal. </garnt>
<garnt> - No wonder they put so much value on tests here. </garnt>
<connor> And I think that can definitely, to me, from my experience, </connor>
<connor> can definitely skew with your mentality </connor>
<connor> when you go out of schooling </connor>
<joey> and you realize that not everything in life is graded, </joey>
<connor> and not everything in life has a percentage or a grade </connor>
<connor> that judges your results and how well you do. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think especially, </garnt>
<garnt> given the industry that we've gone into, </garnt>
<connor> which is entertainment, if you will, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you'd call "Trash Taste" entertainment </connor>
<connor> but we're trying our best here. </connor>
<connor> I feel like the skill set is nearly 180 </connor>
<connor> in compares of what you learn in school, right? </connor>
<connor> It's purely based on like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like social skills are 90% of our job, right? </connor>
<connor> Being able to read a room, being able to talk, you know? </connor>
<connor> I mean, obviously there is a lot of technical aspects, </connor>
<connor> obviously, like learning how to set up all this equipment, </connor>
<connor> but the majority of it can't be taught in a classroom. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh no. </connor>
<connor> - And you can't really grade it, you know? </connor>
<connor> How can you grade someone's social skills? </connor>
<garnt> Imagine we start doing that? </garnt>
<connor> - Ooh, I mean... </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Could you imagine it? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, Connor, you were an ass, </garnt>
<garnt> but ever since the event happened </garnt>
<garnt> you've been kind of a bummer, you're kind of a D now, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like getting graded </joey>
<connor> for every tweet you make, right? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, if Japan- </connor>
<connor> - It's like, oh, that was a B plus tweet right there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true. Asia is gonna find a way. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I went through a period in life </connor>
<connor> where, you know, I was the stereotypical wiebe </connor>
<garnt> that didn't go out, and I have zero social skills. </garnt>
<garnt> And how I learned was, </garnt>
<garnt> I think everyone goes through that stage </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you go through university </garnt>
<garnt> where you kind of wanna reinvent yourself, right? </garnt>
<connor> You move in to somewhere new and you wanna be a new person. </connor>
<joey> So what I did was I basically just had like a full year </joey>
<joey> where I just went out as much as possible </joey>
<connor> and talked to as many people as possible, </connor>
<connor> just like try to go out of my comfort zone. </connor>
<connor> And that was hell for me as like this introvert, </connor>
<connor> it was kind of like a trial by fire period of my life </connor>
<connor> that I would never wanna do again. </connor>
<joey> - Garnt's "300" spartan training with social structures. </joey>
<connor> - It basically was, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I literally just did not know how to socialize. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know how to read a room, </connor>
<garnt> I didn't know what the social norms were. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's such a common cultural thing in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> that we actually have our own like phrase for it, </garnt>
<garnt> which is university debut. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like a cultural thing in Japan </garnt>
<connor> where because there are so many anti-social kids </connor>
<garnt> in middle school and high school, </garnt>
<garnt> and that when they go into university, </garnt>
<joey> they're like, oh shit, I'm like one step closer </joey>
<joey> to where I have to socialize </joey>
<connor> in order to fucking live in society. </connor>
<connor> So university is literally my last chance </connor>
<connor> before I'm thrown into that world. </connor>
<connor> So I'm gonna like make a 180 during university </connor>
<connor> and just fucking do anything and everything possible </connor>
<connor> to just completely change myself around. </connor>
<connor> - I think it is a really Opie mindset, you know, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I wasn't cool at all in school, </joey>
<connor> I was like very much an in-betweener, you know? </connor>
<garnt> I wasn't cool, but I wasn't on the bottom </garnt>
<garnt> of the social ladder, if you will. </garnt>
<joey> - You weren't like bullied to shit, right? </joey>
<joey> - I mean that's 'cause I started fighting back. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> I clawed my way out of the bottom. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, I was just kinda like whatever, </connor>
<connor> no one really paid attention to me, </connor>
<joey> never had any luck with dating or anything, </joey>
<garnt> I never had anything of that. </garnt>
<garnt> But then I thought like, Oh wait, </garnt>
<garnt> like no one knows who I am in university, </garnt>
<joey> so no one knows I'm a mid tier social, </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a C-tier on the social ladder, right? </garnt>
<joey> Like I can reinvent myself. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't, you know, I didn't reinvent myself, </joey>
<joey> it's just like you don't do the mistakes, </joey>
<connor> you don't fall back on crutches that you had, </connor>
<connor> like you said, right? You go out more. </connor>
<connor> You know, I could play video games, </connor>
<connor> which was what I probably would prefer doing, </connor>
<connor> but if people invite me out, I'll say yes </connor>
<connor> 'cause you wanna be seen as fun, </connor>
<joey> and if you seem as fun everything goes easier, </joey>
<connor> and you learn more, and you get more confident, and it's... </connor>
<garnt> Go out of your comfort zone. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me it was like the complete opposite. </garnt>
<garnt> I was really social in middle school and high school, </garnt>
<connor> and then when I entered university, </connor>
<garnt> because I started doing YouTube, </garnt>
<connor> I kind of regressed socially. </connor>
<connor> - But you also lived at home, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I lived at home. </connor>
<connor> - I can imagine that's like way... </connor>
<connor> You must feel, did you feel different </connor>
<connor> from the other people who were living on campus and stuff? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, a little bit. </joey>
<joey> I mean, our campus was weird </joey>
<joey> because I think the majority of people in my class </joey>
<joey> did live at home. </joey>
<joey> - Oh wow. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we only had maybe like a handful of people </connor>
<garnt> who actually lived on campus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which university did you go to again? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sydney University. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so I guess, 'cause it's a city university. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, we have our own campus </garnt>
<garnt> and dormitories and stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> that uni students live in. </garnt>
<connor> But I think the majority of people, </connor>
<garnt> because it's such an accessible university, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's like smack bang in the middle of Sydney City, </garnt>
<garnt> so people can just get on trains and buses </garnt>
<garnt> and just go home basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, cause I feel like- </garnt>
<garnt> - There was no one in my class </garnt>
<garnt> who lived locally to the area, like who was from there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's because you went to Swanzey, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What is there to do in Swanzey? </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's a good question, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> I'm still wondering that myself. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm yet to find the answer. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, to be fair. I didn't live locally either, </connor>
<connor> I lived like an hour and a half by bus. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck. </connor>
<connor> - So I didn't live close at all. </connor>
<connor> I could have, like, I was at a distance </connor>
<connor> where I could have easily lived on the dorm. </connor>
<connor> But then I heard from people who were living in dorms </connor>
<garnt> in Sydney University, they were like, don't do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you could experience them, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Being thrown into hell. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, I feel like I learned more </garnt>
<joey> valuable social skills, and just life skills, </joey>
<connor> going to university than I did actual career skills </connor>
<connor> that I learned from my course. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I realized it until I left, </joey>
<garnt> and then I actually started like functioning </garnt>
<joey> on my own, you know? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what I would have done </connor>
<connor> without that period in my life, Jesus. </connor>
<connor> It basically taught me how to survive in the world </connor>
<garnt> and how people really are, </garnt>
<garnt> and all the expectations I had growing up. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause as a kid, right? </garnt>
<connor> You kind of expect that as you grow up </connor>
<connor> and the more mature you get, you assume that everyone's </connor>
<connor> just gonna realize what they're doing, get mature. </connor>
<joey> And then you kind of realize, </joey>
<joey> going through university especially, </joey>
<connor> that that was a fucking lie. </connor>
<connor> And then you go out of the university, </connor>
<connor> start like the working world and you realize, </connor>
<connor> oh, everyone here is just like grown up university students </connor>
<joey> and nobody actually knows what they're doing, </joey>
<garnt> and everyone is still secretly as immature </garnt>
<garnt> as they were before. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like adults aren't as adult </connor>
<connor> as I thought they were, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I don't know. I feel like I don't... </connor>
<connor> It's either like people just have their shit together </connor>
<connor> or they don't, like there's no in-between, </connor>
<garnt> like, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never met anyone- </garnt>
<garnt> - Most adults that I've met </garnt>
<garnt> are just like kids in suits essentially. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's basically the best way I can describe it. </garnt>
<garnt> And especially seeing </garnt>
<garnt> some of the recent stuff that's been happening, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously stuff like, let's say like... </garnt>
<garnt> Can we talk about how- </garnt>
<garnt> - The stonk market? </garnt>
<garnt> - Can we talk about the stonk market </garnt>
<garnt> that we've recently just seen? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we're gonna be very delayed from you guys- </garnt>
<garnt> - We are gonna be very delayed because it's a very- </garnt>
<garnt> - To us it's just happened. </garnt>
<garnt> - To us it's just happened or is happening, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fucking know, it's a constantly evolving situation. </garnt>
<joey> So by the time this airs, </joey>
<joey> everything we're probably gonna be saying </joey>
<joey> is gonna be outdated. </joey>
<joey> - Who knows? The stock market might not even exist </joey>
<joey> by the time this comes out. </joey>
<joey> - My God, when reality is this entertaining, </joey>
<joey> who the fuck needs TV? </joey>
<joey> - This is what I'm saying, this is what I've always said, </joey>
<joey> real life is so much more interesting. </joey>
<joey> You couldn't make a movie about like, </joey>
<garnt> if you would have pitched a movie being like, </garnt>
<connor> so what happens is a bunch of Redditors, right? </connor>
<connor> They buy game stock, </connor>
<connor> and they fuck over these billion dollar head... </connor>
<connor> Everyone will think that's fucking stupid, </connor>
<connor> but if it happens, </connor>
<connor> it's like this is the coolest fucking story. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Thus, documentaries are better than movies. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and I just think we are reaching a time period </connor>
<connor> where, you know, it used to be a funny meme, </connor>
<connor> but now memes are just... </connor>
<joey> Real life memes, big memes now, </joey>
<joey> are basically just making fun of real life events, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - And having a real life effect on the world, </joey>
<garnt> that is what memes are growing into it now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I saw someone on Twitter saying, </garnt>
<joey> they were like, this is kind of the revitalization </joey>
<joey> of it's just a prank bro, </joey>
<joey> but the pranks have actually gone far, gone wrong. </joey>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna lie, the first time I saw that story </connor>
<connor> I was like I don't know what the fuck is happening, </connor>
<joey> and I'm really scared to ask. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, when it was happening, </joey>
<connor> I was like what the fuck does shorting a stock mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And now I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> now because of this meme I've done so much research </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I should get into the stock market, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> It's really weird because- </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you yoloed. </garnt>
<connor> - I have not yoloed, no. </connor>
<connor> - Are you gonna yolo that YouTube money away, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - Look, I'm not a gambling addict, okay? </connor>
<connor> A much as much as the "Gotcha" episode might've been real, </connor>
<joey> look, I am not a gambling addict. </joey>
<joey> - He'll yolo on "Gotcha" but not on stocks. </joey>
<garnt> - But it's made me think a lot </garnt>
<connor> about my grown up investments, the grown investments talk </connor>
<garnt> that I just never really thought about before. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's weird because I've been doing stocks, </garnt>
<garnt> like through like my dad, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause my dad is really in business. </garnt>
<garnt> So I've been doing it but when this shit happened </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, should I be scared? Like what's happening? </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know what was happening. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dad, is our money safe? Daddy, daddy? </garnt>
<garnt> - Daddy, please, is my money okay? Please. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, no one in my family has had anything about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think every single generation of my family </garnt>
<garnt> has just like made enough to get by, </garnt>
<garnt> and do buy some nice things here and there, </garnt>
<garnt> so I don't think stocks was ever on their mind. </garnt>
<garnt> I think my parents had some stocks </garnt>
<garnt> in the companies they worked for, as like a gift, </garnt>
<garnt> so I think my dad checks up on those stocks. </garnt>
<garnt> But in terms of actually knowing about the stock market, </garnt>
<joey> you know, no one in my family has any idea. </joey>
<joey> - Right, because it's not something </joey>
<garnt> that everyone commonly learns, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's... What I was thinking- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's only fancy gambling for rich men really. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what it's like marketed as, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, I was doing my research </garnt>
<joey> and properly reading into this, you know, I was thinking, </joey>
<connor> why the fuck aren't we taught this in school? </connor>
<garnt> Because I feel like, </garnt>
<joey> especially knowledge on the stock market, </joey>
<connor> a lot of the reasons why </connor>
<garnt> people don't get into the stock market, </garnt>
<garnt> from what I realized, is because nobody knows shit about it. </garnt>
<connor> It's because nobody was taught this in school </connor>
<connor> and it sounds so complicated that nobody has the effort </connor>
<garnt> or energy to really read up and learn about this. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I didn't, and the only reason </connor>
<connor> I started reading up about this </connor>
<connor> was because the fucking stock market was on fire </connor>
<garnt> and it turned into a massive meme. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally started reading up about this because of a meme. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who would have thought that memes </garnt>
<garnt> get you to go into like educational adventures? </garnt>
<garnt> - It happens all the time, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - But hey, look, what this made me think was, </garnt>
<garnt> why weren't we taught about this in school? </garnt>
<garnt> Growing up, there's so many life essential knowledge </garnt>
<garnt> that I think everyone should know. </garnt>
<joey> - To be fair though, I'm thinking back, </joey>
<joey> like when you were like 15, 14, right? </joey>
<connor> - You wouldn't have paid attention. </connor>
<connor> - You wouldn't have paid attention. </connor>
<connor> - You know, they always say like, oh, why didn't they teach </connor>
<connor> kids about taxes in school as well? </connor>
<connor> Because no one- </connor>
<connor> - I do think there are however- </connor>
<connor> - Because no one would fucking care. </connor>
<connor> - I think even if you aren't, even with taxes, </connor>
<connor> I do think that there should have been something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I agree, there should have been something. </connor>
<garnt> - There should be something </garnt>
<connor> so at least when you get to that point in life </connor>
<joey> you are aware and you can go back to be like, </joey>
<joey> oh, this is why it was important. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because there's so many things, </joey>
<joey> Like, for example, I don't know why it's not compulsory </joey>
<garnt> to have a financial management course in school. </garnt>
<connor> There should be, there totally should be, </connor>
<garnt> because financial management </garnt>
<garnt> is such an adult life essential skill, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's something that you have to learn </garnt>
<garnt> by just either, one, your parents teaching it to you, </garnt>
<garnt> or two, fucking up and realizing </garnt>
<garnt> that this is an important skill you need to know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Instead schools are like, no, let's learn </garnt>
<garnt> the quadratic equation, you will need that. </garnt>
<garnt> - But no, let's learn that there are- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's pretty useful actually. </garnt>
<garnt> You're drawing on the quadratic equation, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a very good equation. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's learn that there are 180 degrees in a triangle, </joey>
<joey> I've used that before in my life. </joey>
<joey> Let's learn about the tangents, and the cosine and the sine. </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) is the powerhouse of the sound, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if you know that. </joey>
<joey> Well, you know, I think why they should be teaching, </joey>
<connor> like taxes and financial advice in school, </connor>
<connor> is not so that you get, 'cause obviously kids </connor>
<garnt> aren't gonna fucking come out of school </garnt>
<garnt> being like, hello, let me do your taxes. </garnt>
<connor> It's just so that when they leave school, </connor>
<garnt> it's on the back of their mind. </garnt>
<garnt> That like, I've been taught that this is a thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's gonna come up </garnt>
<garnt> and that I should learn how it works for my value. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. The whole point of school </garnt>
<connor> I feel should be at least preparing you </connor>
<garnt> for what you're gonna face in the adult world, </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know, there can be some specialized courses. </garnt>
<connor> You know, I memed it but I can understand why </connor>
<joey> they teach mathematics and algebra, </joey>
<joey> in case you want to pursue that. </joey>
<joey> But what I am saying is there are so many </joey>
<joey> life essential knowledge that I had to learn on the fly, </joey>
<connor> and everyone does, </connor>
<connor> and I was just not taught this stuff in school. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm thinking, why the fuck is this not taught in school? </garnt>
<garnt> - And the thing is, is that like, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> you know, people can argue being like, you know, </connor>
<connor> Oh, who needs to know the fucking quadratic equation, </connor>
<connor> what people are doing... </connor>
<connor> It's like architecture or like math based stuff, </connor>
<connor> but like financial advice and taxes and shit like that, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter what job you go into </connor>
<garnt> you're gonna have to deal with it as an adult. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, there's so many things in my school </garnt>
<garnt> that we were taught that were replaceable in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we would do like media studies, </garnt>
<garnt> where we would just analyze newspapers and shit, </garnt>
<joey> and just talked about the media, </joey>
<joey> and how they advertise their stuff. </joey>
<joey> It's in my job now </joey>
<garnt> but I didn't even get anything useful from that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I had to do that as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's fucking stupid. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I didn't have to do that. </garnt>
<joey> - And then I did like cooking which was stupid </joey>
<garnt> 'cause, let's be honest, I'm not a good cook. </garnt>
<garnt> As I'm sure guys will find out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's be honest, Uber Eats is a thing now. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - I'ma be honest, make money, get Uber Eats, </joey>
<joey> that's what it's all about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, </joey>
<garnt> - No, but, you know, they could've replaced it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think that, um... Fuck, what was I gonna say? </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, I totally forgot my point now, fuck. I'm done. </garnt>
<connor> Go back to you, I'll figure out what I wanted to say. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I'm just saying </connor>
<connor> like there's so many important things in life </connor>
<connor> that I just don't know about, you know? </connor>
<connor> Like for example, I have no idea </connor>
<garnt> about anything about mortgages or anything like that, </garnt>
<connor> and when I say mortgage... You say the word mortgage, right? </connor>
<connor> And you're like, oh okay, you are a grownup. </connor>
<garnt> You know, as a kid you hear the word mortgage, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, I don't need to worry about that, </garnt>
<garnt> that's grown up shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I had to learn that shit on the fly. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I don't know what the fuck this is about. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the thing is, everyone should aim to own a house, </garnt>
<garnt> or own some property, </garnt>
<joey> that's like one of the final goals in life, right? </joey>
<joey> And yet nobody's taught this shit in school. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, is it bad the only time </joey>
<joey> I've ever heard the word mortgage was in a monopoly game? </joey>
<joey> That's the only time I've heard of it. </joey>
<joey> - And you know what? I still have no- </joey>
<connor> - I still don't know how to mortgage in a monopoly game. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, I still have like the bare bones basic idea </connor>
<connor> about mortgage because I've not gone through the process </connor>
<connor> of buying a house, because that shit sounds scary to me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it is. </joey>
<garnt> - I did go and see a mortgage advisor </garnt>
<garnt> just 'cause I wanted to learn more about it, </garnt>
<joey> and my bank had it for like, </joey>
<garnt> they were like free consultations. </garnt>
<garnt> I had no intention of getting a mortgage, </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanted to know how they worked. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because I feel like you should know how they work. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I went and then, </connor>
<connor> just this really awkward thing of like, so what do you do? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, oh well, so I make videos, </connor>
<joey> about like anime, this is the time. </joey>
<connor> And then he was like, "Okay, like, this is your income?" </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like, "It changed a lot in one year." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, yeah, yeah it does that, </garnt>
<joey> it could go up or down, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> And I'm there thinking I should just tell him </joey>
<garnt> as little about my job as possible </garnt>
<connor> otherwise he's gonna be like, "This guy is a financial risk, </connor>
<connor> I can't give him a mortgage." </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I mean it was pretty standard stuff. </connor>
<connor> I mean, there's different rates and stuff, </connor>
<garnt> but you don't need to fucking worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I had to sit down </garnt>
<garnt> with our family financial advisor, </garnt>
<joey> like I had to go through- </joey>
<joey> - That's the most privileged thing </joey>
<joey> you've ever said in your life. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Holy shit! </garnt>
<garnt> - I never had a financial advisor. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's because my parents </garnt>
<garnt> are super into the housing market and the stock market </garnt>
<connor> and shit like that, so it was just like, </connor>
<connor> you're an adult now- </connor>
<connor> - That still sounds privileged. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You can talk to this man in a suit </connor>
<connor> that comes to our house every so often, </connor>
<connor> and you'd think he's our lawyer. </connor>
<connor> I used to call him our lawyer </connor>
<connor> 'cause I didn't know who the fuck this guy was, </connor>
<connor> I was like, there's a man in a suit, he must be a lawyer. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, check your wealth, Joe </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's, </garnt>
<garnt> Quality Grooming and Shaving Supplies. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gentlemen, we all have beards, </garnt>
<garnt> except for Garnt who shaved. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I do shave, and that's why I use Harry's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man, I just hate it when I have to choose </garnt>
<garnt> between price and quality, but thanks to Harry's, </garnt>
<connor> that's no longer a problem I have to suffer with. </connor>
<connor> - You mean you can get both at the same time? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes Garnt, you can. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's illegal. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Harry's delivers a close comfortable shave at a fair price, </joey>

<connor> that they bought their own factory in Germany. </connor>

<joey> - Garnt, I'm glad you asked. </joey>
<joey> Harry's team combined a simple ergonomic design </joey>
<connor> with five sharp blades, they sourced their steel from Sweden </connor>
<connor> and manufactured their blades </connor>
<garnt> in their world-class blade factory. </garnt>
<garnt> Isn't that a fate arc? </garnt>

<connor> the gold standard of blade razor grinding </connor>
<connor> - This sounds epic, like an anime arc. </connor>
<connor> But thank God, they also stand behind </connor>

<garnt> Thank you to Harry's for sponsoring this episode, </garnt>
<garnt> back to the video. </garnt>
<garnt> - So then when I became an adult </garnt>
<connor> and I started making a little bit of money on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> they were like, okay, you can talk to our 'lawyer' now, </connor>
<connor> who turned out to be a financial advisor. </connor>
<connor> So I was like okay, I don't know what to do with this money, </connor>
<connor> please help me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause otherwise it's just gonna collect in a bank, </connor>
<connor> probably do fucking nothing. </connor>
<garnt> And he's like, well, you could, you know, mortgage, </garnt>
<connor> and I'm like, that word. </connor>
<garnt> Oh no, that word. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ideally anyone with any kind of savings </garnt>
<garnt> would have a financial advisor, </garnt>
<connor> sadly, you know, it's kind of difficult to get a good one </connor>
<joey> or get one that even... </joey>
<joey> - Like understands, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean yeah, I had to fucking like sit- </connor>
<garnt> - I would if I could, I mean, I don't fucking know anyone. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had sit the guy down to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, this is what I do. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "Wait, so you make videos </garnt>
<garnt> and you get paid to do that?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, yeah, and he's like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I would love a financial advisor </garnt>
<garnt> because there's so little I know about it, </garnt>
<garnt> and this kind of, the wall street bet thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's been going on has really just opened my eyes </garnt>
<connor> to how little I know about this stuff </connor>
<connor> that I feel like I really should know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like a YouTuber I've been watching recently </connor>
<connor> is a guy called, I think it's Graham Spector, I think? </connor>
<connor> - The millionaire guy? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the millionaire guy. </connor>
<connor> I saw him in other videos where he was talking about, </connor>
<connor> he seems like the most grounded millionaire I've ever- </connor>
<garnt> - I couldn't stand him at first, he seemed like a dick, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I started watching and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> all right, okay, he's pretty cool. </garnt>
<garnt> But he just came off as like an ass. </garnt>
<garnt> - The biggest thing that me off is every episode he goes, </garnt>
<garnt> he does the, "But don't forget to like and subscribe, </garnt>
<garnt> if you like the video", </garnt>
<garnt> and like, no matter how cool a person you are, </garnt>
<garnt> if you say it, - Immediate turn off. </garnt>
<connor> - Ironically, yeah, immediate turn off. </connor>
<connor> But I was watching some of the videos </connor>
<garnt> and some of the advice that he gave, which was, </garnt>
<connor> some of it was just like really basic financial advice </connor>
<garnt> about how to manage your money. </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing is, he gives advice that any person </garnt>
<garnt> from any level of income can take to heart. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like one of the ideas </garnt>
<garnt> that he really tried to propagate is like, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how much earn, </garnt>
<connor> everyone should get this in their mindset, </connor>
<connor> that you can invest something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I understood as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I had grown up with the mindset </garnt>
<garnt> of like the word, investment, that's for rich people, </garnt>
<garnt> that's for privileged people. </garnt>
<connor> I, I can't invest, I don't have the money to invest. </connor>
<connor> But even just investing </connor>
<connor> a fraction of your paycheck or something, </connor>
<connor> in the long-term can really help you financially </connor>
<connor> and give you a lot of financial stability. </connor>
<connor> And this is the stuff that we were just never taught. </connor>
<connor> - I guess as well, 'cause you hear so many horror stories </connor>
<connor> about investments going wrong, and you also hear about like, </connor>
<connor> you know, people who take advantage of people, </connor>
<connor> you know, a fake financial advisor who says, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I'll help you out with your money," </connor>
<connor> and then just runs off with it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It's so scary to trust someone with any amount of money, </connor>
<connor> and, you know, even if you have barely anything, </connor>
<connor> it's still all you have, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's scary to give that to someone, </connor>
<connor> and be like, oh, I trust you to take care of this, right? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the way that I was taught up, </connor>
<connor> because, you know, I also didn't come from </connor>
<connor> like the most well-off family. </connor>
<connor> - You didn't have a lawyer or a financial advisor? </connor>
<garnt> - I did not. </garnt>
<garnt> - You didn't have a family financial advisor? </garnt>
<garnt> I thought everyone had one of those. </garnt>
<garnt> - My parents declared bankruptcy when I was a teenager. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I grew up with a mentality that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you should try to keep your money as safe, </garnt>
<garnt> you should gather up as much as possible. </garnt>
<connor> And I realized how much this mentality had affected </connor>
<joey> how I think about just resources in general. </joey>
<joey> So what I realized is that I am that gamer, right? </joey>
<joey> I am that gamer who, you know, whenever you play an RPG- </joey>
<joey> - You don't use any of the precious- </joey>
<garnt> - And you get a rare item- </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't use it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't use it. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - And whenever I play, like "Command And Conquer" </garnt>
<garnt> or something, or some RTS games, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I wait until I have a fuck ton of resources, </garnt>
<connor> and then I start buying stuff out. </connor>
<garnt> And I realized, I realized this this week, </garnt>
<joey> when I when I was like, where did this come from? </joey>
<joey> And I realized, oh, it's because that's just how </joey>
<garnt> I manage my money, </garnt>
<garnt> and I've always come in the mindset of I've gotta save this </garnt>
<garnt> just in case of a rainy day. </garnt>
<connor> I can't invest it, I need to save it </connor>
<connor> because, you know, investing money might be risky </connor>
<connor> so it's better to just save it. </connor>
<connor> And, you know, I kind of realized this </connor>
<connor> as I was doing research and I learned a lot about myself </connor>
<joey> this past week because of a fucking meme. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause a lot of entrepreneurs </connor>
<connor> are spending everything they have, </connor>
<connor> just goes right into buying shit, they have no savings, </connor>
<garnt> it's just all in the businesses. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well it's all just high risk, high reward, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but then also as well, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> online there's so much of those fake, </garnt>
<garnt> stupid entrepreneurs online that have just really ruined, </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind, the image of an entrepreneur, </garnt>
<connor> like a speed run ruin in like five years. </connor>
<connor> - If I go on like a Twitter, or a social media, </connor>
<connor> and it has the word entrepreneur on it, </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> Here's the thing, right? 10 years ago, entrepreneur, </connor>
<connor> was probably one of the coolest things you could say. </connor>
<connor> - It's like damn, you're an entrepreneur? </connor>
<connor> - Now I just think, oh you're just doing </connor>
<connor> a fucking multi-level marketing scam to me, </connor>
<connor> or you're selling me a course on how to be more confident. </connor>
<garnt> Have you seen those courses? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Those things are insane, they cost like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like $1,000 for the first course. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they're like, all right now you've unlocked </garnt>
<garnt> the ability to get the next level of the course, </garnt>
<garnt> for only $5,000, and it blows my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like trying to teach you shit </garnt>
<garnt> that can't be learned. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but it blows my mind </connor>
<garnt> that people buy into this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause they're obviously just people </garnt>
<garnt> who are spending the money you're giving them </garnt>
<garnt> on this lavish lifestyle, that then they sell back to you. </garnt>
<joey> Like it's insane, and I don't know how </joey>
<joey> people get sucked into this. </joey>
<connor> Like when we were talking about the gambling stuff, </connor>
<joey> I can understand how somebody can get into gambling. </joey>
<joey> and you can gamble away. </joey>
<joey> I don't understand how someone </joey>
<joey> can watch these entrepreneurs, right? </joey>
<garnt> These fake entrepreneurs talk about </garnt>
<joey> how they can make you loads of money </joey>
<garnt> and they can tell you how to be like, </garnt>
<joey> there's loads like realtors, have you seen those? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, I could teach you </connor>
<connor> the best real estate course of your life, </connor>
<joey> just come here for $100 and then have someone else teach it, </joey>
<joey> and then add five more classes, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how does someone believe this shit? </joey>
<joey> It's all fake obviously, I don't get it. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, someone believes this shit because there's... </garnt>
<connor> I think the biggest problem is that </connor>
<connor> there's so much information out there right now </connor>
<connor> that you don't know who to believe. </connor>
<garnt> I mean I can see when someone knows nothing about... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know nothing about many things. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I also know when someone's shouting out of their ass, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - You have a bullshit detector. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of people don't have a bullshit detector. </garnt>
<connor> - A $500 paywall right off the gate for a lesson </connor>
<garnt> is normally the first indication of that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I think to a lot of people, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> they see that paywall and they see the presentation </garnt>
<garnt> and they think, oh, well this is probably legit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean I'm putting money into this </garnt>
<garnt> so that must mean the advice is legit. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I have to pay this much for this course </garnt>
<garnt> then it must bring results. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe I just can't see that </connor>
<garnt> 'cause obviously we're doing entertainment </garnt>
<garnt> and you see how fake things are, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - We've been on the internet for long enough to know </garnt>
<garnt> what's bullshit or not, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, we're producing content, </garnt>
<garnt> I know what fake content looks like, right? </garnt>
<connor> I can imagine how it was made </connor>
<connor> and what tactic was used to push that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because whenever I see one of those </joey>
<joey> marketing trailers of like, oh, you can learn X amount </joey>
<joey> and earn X amount. </joey>
<joey> I swear they all have the same fucking templates. </joey>
<joey> - They do. </joey>
<joey> - With the same inspiring stock-like music. </joey>
<connor> - "The first year I made $3,000, </connor>
<joey> the next month after that I made $1 million." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, oh, I'm sure you did, I'm sure you did. </joey>
<connor> Off mugging everyone off. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like the equivalent of going on a piracy site, </garnt>
<joey> and then seeing the adverts of, </joey>
<connor> I earned $10,000 from filling out surveys. </connor>
<joey> And you're like, who the fuck actually clicks on this </joey>
<joey> and believes this stuff? </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It is the con on porn ads, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - The fact that you're advertising on like, </garnt>
<connor> not even PornHub, but like it's some shady hentai website. </connor>
<connor> - Eat this pill and your dick will grow </connor>
<connor> three times the size in three months. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, now that I'm thinking about it more, </connor>
<connor> it must come from targeting insecurities, right? </connor>
<connor> - Absolutely, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like it must come from like, </connor>
<connor> some people are already insecure </connor>
<connor> about their financial amount, right? </connor>
<connor> And I'm sure there's other things like that. </connor>
<connor> I mean I just realized now, why would they offer dick pills? </connor>
<connor> Oh, because people are pretty insecure </connor>
<connor> about their dick not working, right? </connor>
<connor> So it's probably the same kind of- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and they don't know any better, right? </connor>
<garnt> They just think like, well I want just the quickest, </garnt>
<connor> easiest, like most straightforward way </connor>
<connor> to get a lot of money, oh, look at this ad. </connor>
<connor> - It's a harsh lesson in life to learn </connor>
<connor> that miracles truly don't exist. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Who would have thought that you need </connor>
<connor> to actually put the work and effort into- </connor>
<connor> - If your dick doesn't work, that might just be, </connor>
<connor> that might be a lifelong thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think any amount of pills is gonna save you, dude. </garnt>
<connor> - There's only so many times you can pop that Viagra, </connor>
<connor> you what I mean? - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like it's the same reason </connor>
<connor> why people fall for multilevel marketing scams. </connor>
<connor> - Apparently that's really bad in the U.S. </connor>
<connor> I have a lot of friends from the U.S </connor>
<connor> who tell me that they have loads of their friends </connor>
<connor> from high school who tell them that, </connor>
<connor> they're constantly messaging about it. </connor>
<connor> - Really? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know how bad it is. </connor>
<connor> It could just be that I'm connected to strange people </connor>
<connor> who have strange friends. </connor>
<connor> Meilyne, do you have friends </connor>
<connor> who have multilevel marketing people? </connor>
<connor> You do? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] They tried to sell me alkaline water. </connor>
<joey> - Alkaline water. (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Tried to sell you alkaline water. </connor>
<connor> - Ladies and gentlemen, I have won case, my proof is there. </connor>
<joey> - I mean yeah, I know a few people from America as well. </joey>
<connor> - You do? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, maybe not like- </joey>
<joey> - Directly, but you know people who know- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know people, and even, I think Sydney's mom, </joey>
<joey> has on occasion messaged Sydney </joey>
<connor> about this nice little scheme that can make her money, </connor>
<joey> but you know, Sydney obviously steps in. </joey>
<joey> And it's because, I mean, it really preys on people </joey>
<joey> who are looking for that out, </joey>
<connor> looking for that out in their life. </connor>
<garnt> you know, when you're stuck at a dead-end job, </garnt>
<garnt> and you are old enough where you feel </garnt>
<garnt> like you're kind of stuck here, </garnt>
<garnt> you're not young enough to do something crazy </garnt>
<connor> or just quit everything and you have responsibilities. </connor>
<garnt> You know, you kind of look for a way </garnt>
<garnt> that can get you out of this lifestyle, whatever that is. </garnt>
<garnt> And sometimes, I mean, that's why- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, don't get me wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I was gonna say like, don't get me wrong, </garnt>
<connor> like, you know, in order to get out of that kind of stuff, </connor>
<connor> risk taking is definitely a thing that you have to do. </connor>
<connor> - There's risk taking and there's making mistakes. </connor>
<connor> - Right, there's responsible risk taking </connor>
<connor> where you'll always have a fallback if it doesn't work out, </connor>
<connor> and then there's just a risk take </connor>
<connor> where you just yolo it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, at the end of the day, right? </connor>
<connor> Let's be honest, right? The way life works, </connor>
<connor> if somebody had a million dollar idea, right? </connor>
<connor> A stranger isn't gonna come up to you and pitch it to you, </connor>
<connor> they're gonna fucking do it themselves. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Right? Like if anyone comes up to you </connor>
<connor> promising to make you money, </connor>
<connor> that should be the biggest red flag in existence. </connor>
<connor> - Nobody can promise to make you money. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - For example- </connor>
<connor> - And if that person also promising to make you that money </connor>
<garnt> isn't a billionaire themselves, </garnt>
<garnt> why the aren't they doing it? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. When I realized where... </joey>
<garnt> What I've realized growing up is, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> my mum and dad would give me advice </garnt>
<garnt> about how to be successful in X and Y, </garnt>
<garnt> and I love my mum and dad, </garnt>
<garnt> but then I came to a point when I realized that </garnt>
<garnt> some of the mentality, especially when managing money, </garnt>
<joey> was not wrong per se, </joey>
<joey> because that's the mentality that they had to survive, </joey>
<joey> because that's the environment that they were in. </joey>
<joey> - It was just different, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was a different environment, </joey>
<garnt> and I gotta realize I'm growing up </garnt>
<joey> under different circumstances, </joey>
<garnt> and I have to, you know, I have to choose sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> whenever some advice does pertain to me and when it doesn't. </garnt>
<garnt> And when someone's promising you to make money, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like, okay, we're three successful YouTubers, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But as much advice as we can give we cannot promise </garnt>
<connor> a random person to make them a successful YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - [Connor] Right. </connor>
<connor> - We can give advice about how to increase their chances </connor>
<garnt> and how to help work the algorithm, for example. </garnt>
<garnt> - But we're not gonna drop a million dollar video idea, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we would just do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's no way that I can sit here </garnt>
<garnt> and guarantee you that yes, I can give you advice </garnt>
<garnt> to make you a YouTuber that gets a million subscribers. </garnt>
<garnt> Nobody can do that, or an X amount from YouTube. </garnt>
<joey> - As far as I'm concerned, </joey>
<joey> we were all very lucky in that case as well, right? </joey>
<joey> We had the odds in our favor </joey>
<connor> - But nobody told us what to do. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I preach by that, you know, </connor>
<garnt> we did a lot of things right, </garnt>
<garnt> and we all were also very lucky in a lot of aspects. </garnt>
<garnt> There wasn't one without the other. </garnt>
<garnt> There are things that you can do to increase your chances </garnt>
<connor> of success and massively get the odds into your favor </connor>
<garnt> but to guarantee something, to guarantee success like that, </garnt>
<connor> it's pretty much impossible. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think the sad truth of life is, </connor>
<connor> and I think you just realize this, </connor>
<connor> is like I think the stock market looks like a fucking casino </connor>
<connor> to many people. </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was a casino. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of the hedge funds do treat it like such. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - But at the end of the day- </connor>
<connor> - We learned that today, we learned that in the past week </connor>
<connor> - At end of the day it's truly a sad moment when you realize </connor>
<connor> there isn't really a get rich quick scheme in life, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't exist, right? </connor>
<connor> And if you're looking for that, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like you're already setting yourself up </garnt>
<connor> to be disappointed, or gonna hurt yourself. </connor>
<garnt> - If there was a scheme that could 100% give you </garnt>
<garnt> a success rate of like, you're gonna get famous, </garnt>
<joey> you wouldn't think everybody would be doing that? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it might make someone rich, </joey>
<joey> probably not gonna be you. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Here's the thing, like reading up about a lot of like </connor>
<connor> financial advice and everything that I have for the past </connor>
<connor> you know, the past week, </connor>
<connor> like, take this with an exact- </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Three people who don't know </connor>
<connor> what the fuck they're talking about financial, </connor>
<connor> discuss financial advice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Please do not take any of our advice, </connor>
<garnt> this is not financial advice. </garnt>
<garnt> - We do have to make a disclaimer about this </garnt>
<connor> but from what I've read and from what I've seen, </connor>
<connor> it seems like you can definitely increase your chances </connor>
<garnt> of being successful in life, but the problem is that </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the legitimate advice I've seen, </garnt>
<connor> it seems to stem from you don't get rich quick, </connor>
<connor> it's all boring stuff, </connor>
<connor> it's all put your money in safe places. </connor>
<connor> - It's the long game most of the time. </connor>
<connor> - Wait 10 to 20 years and you'll be well off in life. </connor>
<garnt> Nobody wants to hear that advice. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just boring. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just boring </garnt>
<garnt> - They wanna hear the, I went to sleep, woke up </garnt>
<garnt> and I have a million dollars now right? </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't wanna hear about Roth IRA's, </garnt>
<garnt> or put your money in fucking cash Isis. </garnt>
<garnt> - I want Gamestop stocks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. They wanna hear something exciting, </garnt>
<connor> but when you hear boring financial advice </connor>
<connor> you just kind of tune out and you're like, oh, okay, </connor>
<connor> so I can get rich but just not now, </connor>
<connor> but like in 10, 2O, no, more like when I retire, </connor>
<garnt> I'm gonna have a retirement fund. </garnt>
<connor> - And thus Garnt figured out why all the old people </connor>
<garnt> hold all the wealth in nearly every developed country. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I noticed, right? </connor>
<garnt> I was just looking around for maybe like, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted to just talk to a financial advisor, </garnt>
<garnt> not like do anything, I just wanted to talk to them </garnt>
<garnt> and just have like the free consultations </garnt>
<connor> and talk to them, </connor>
<garnt> and just figure out what the fuck, like what do they do, </garnt>
<garnt> what can they do, what's a good one, what's a bad one. </garnt>
<garnt> And I noticed on all of the websites, </garnt>
<connor> at least in the UK, every single one, right? </connor>
<connor> It was picture of some young man helping an old person </connor>
<connor> out on a laptop, pointing at the monitor. </connor>
<connor> And then it was all- </connor>
<connor> - It's like a Stock image. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was all just like pension advice, </garnt>
<garnt> pension, pension, pension, and like long-term, long-term. </garnt>
<garnt> Like none of it was like risky- </garnt>
<garnt> - For young people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, none of it was for young people, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause, you know, let's be honest, </garnt>
<connor> young people don't do that shit. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. So yeah, it was really, </connor>
<joey> you kind of just like, </joey>
<connor> a lot of the things that you'd noticed about the world </connor>
<connor> start to fall in place, and when you start looking </connor>
<connor> you're like, ah, okay, </connor>
<connor> everything's starting to make sense now. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like my best advice to anyone young watching this, </connor>
<connor> is if this conversation leads to anything, </connor>
<connor> just go out and do your research. </connor>
<connor> Actually read up about this shit, because- </connor>
<joey> - Don't fucking sign up to a $500 seminar, </joey>
<joey> I will disown you. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't do that, just read up about basic financial advice. </garnt>
<joey> - Everything you need to know is free. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the thing, </garnt>
<connor> everything you need to know is free </connor>
<connor> and the only thing stopping you is your own laziness. </connor>
<connor> Cause that is.. </connor>
<joey> Me reading up about this felt like I had just gained </joey>
<garnt> five levels of info that I should have known </garnt>
<connor> when I was in my 20s. </connor>
<joey> And I'm just like, why didn't I know this shit before? </joey>
<joey> I was stupid, I was lazy. </joey>
<connor> - Don't expect to get rich off the GameStop stonks and shit, </connor>
<garnt> like the road is gonna be long and probably really boring. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm investing in learning Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> so that I can become a translator for a yakuza </garnt>
<garnt> and then I'll translate the wrong number </garnt>
<joey> like in the "Great Pretender", </joey>
<connor> and profit hundreds of millions of dollars for myself. </connor>
<connor> Thus being the best investment of ever. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, someone's gonna take that idea. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't fucking steal my get rich quick idea, </connor>
<garnt> I swear to God. </garnt>
<garnt> - You gave away the million dollar idea. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bi-lingual people don't do it, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like writing it now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey's like shit, write that down. </garnt>
<garnt> Joey's called up his financial advisor. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna set this scheme, you won't believe it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Does anyone know any yakuza? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Any yakuza with cross country gang information </garnt>
<connor> that we could- </connor>
<connor> - Does any yakuza need any translation work? I'm your man. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - All right, well boys, </garnt>
<joey> I have something very special planned today. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, </connor>
<connor> - They said it wouldn't happen, </connor>
<joey> the common said it couldn't be done, but I finally did it. </joey>
<connor> I wrote a PowerPoint presentation. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> for all the different ways- </garnt>
<garnt> - You actually did it? You actually did it. </garnt>
<garnt> - How many weeks ago was that? </garnt>
<joey> - I was just like at week 10 or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like nine or something, right? </joey>
<garnt> - That was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, when you say something off hand and then- </garnt>
<garnt> - It was an offhand comment. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was an offhand comment, </garnt>
<garnt> and then the community and the Reddit </garnt>
<garnt> were just like never let you forget </garnt>
<garnt> that you said that one thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - To explain what Garnt is talking about, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know which episode it was. </garnt>
<garnt> Play the flashback mode on. </garnt>
<connor> - What I gotta do is I gotta, some episode, </connor>
<connor> I need to bring a presentation of all the different ways </connor>
<connor> people have tried to hit on me. </connor>
<connor> Like, I gotta, - Please. </connor>
<connor> - A PowerPoint presentation, </connor>
<joey> the most interesting ways it's happened. </joey>
<connor> So I made a little presentation, with some fun images </connor>
<joey> to explain all the different ways that you can be, </joey>
<connor> so I guess I should pull the laptop up. </connor>
<connor> - Are you about to break down the 93%? </connor>
<connor> - Break down the 93%, it's not the 93% anymore, </connor>
<joey> it's like a 59%. </joey>
<connor> - This is how you can also be the 93%. </connor>
<connor> Sign up, first month is $100. </connor>
<joey> - I wanna preface that this is not my laptop, </joey>
<joey> as it has stickers on it, so it's just disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, that's my beautiful laptop. </joey>
<joey> - "A YouTuber Guide To Being Hit On, </joey>
<joey> all the ways a YouTuber can be hit on." </joey>
<joey> - Wow, this is bringing me back to like high school. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, you've actually done a PowerPoint presentation. </joey>
<connor> - I did. </connor>
<connor> - Is this is a Ted talk. </connor>
<connor> - This is my Ted talk, Ted didn't invite me, </connor>
<connor> so I thought, we'll make my own. </connor>
<connor> - Before we start, how much effort did you put into this? </connor>
<connor> - Not that much. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So this is like... </garnt>
<connor> Okay, so basically these are all true things </connor>
<joey> that have happened at one point or another. </joey>
<garnt> And I didn't write the whole details out, </garnt>
<connor> so basically they're more prompts for my memory </connor>
<joey> to be like, ah yeah, this is what happened, </joey>
<joey> all right, let me explain it. </joey>
<joey> - This looks like a real Ted talk. </joey>
<joey> - I guess so, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - This isn't like the high school, </connor>
<connor> I'm reading off the PowerPoint. </connor>
<joey> - No, there's literally like two sentences </joey>
<joey> just to remind me, oh, it's this story, okay. </joey>
<connor> But yeah, I do wanna preface before we begin, </connor>
<connor> I'm not trying to make out that I'm some kind of </connor>
<connor> like fucking sex God that no one can resist, </connor>
<garnt> it's literally just when you have X amount of subscribers </garnt>
<connor> obviously there's gonna be two people out there </connor>
<garnt> that are stupid enough to think that I'm attractive </garnt>
<connor> and try and hit on me. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Okay, </connor>
<connor> - Just wanna get that out there. </connor>
<connor> - You're being very humble there. </connor>
<connor> - I do no think that I am like X hot or whatever, </connor>
<joey> it just happens with the job, I think. </joey>
<joey> People don't try it with you, </joey>
<joey> 'cause, you know, you guys are basically married, all right. </joey>
<joey> Not to each other, of course. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Why are you laughing, Meilyne? </joey>
<joey> - Meilyne's like, I love the gay talk. </joey>
<joey> - She's like, tell me more about how they're married. </joey>
<joey> - What do you expect to see on this list? </joey>
<connor> What are you excited for? </connor>
<connor> - Uh, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Basically, I'm just looking forward to this presentation </connor>
<connor> just being a massive excuse to say I'm not a fuck boy but. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I obviously didn't reciprocate, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause most of these are strange. </connor>
<connor> I've also accompanied, I just downloaded </connor>
<garnt> a bunch of stock images, I didn't pay for the license, </garnt>
<garnt> I shouldn't say that, but I just downloaded the bunch. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you, Getty Images, for sponsoring this episode. </connor>
<connor> - So just to accompany it, just for fun, why not? </connor>
<connor> Like I said, I love Stock Images. </connor>
<connor> So we have the classic to start with, what is that? </connor>
<garnt> So this is, as I've said, a text to my personal number. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, what? How did they get your personal number? </joey>
<garnt> - That's what I wanna know, Garnt. I don't know </garnt>
<connor> So this happened about, I think four or five months </connor>
<connor> into my YouTube career, if you will. </connor>
<garnt> I thought great, I haven't leaked anything, </garnt>
<garnt> I just do live streams- - That was what, 2015? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was wondering how the fuck someone had done this. </garnt>
<garnt> So turned out, at the time I had an iPhone </garnt>
<garnt> and the email that I listed </garnt>
<garnt> was actually like my email linked to my iPhone account, </garnt>
<garnt> and someone had just connected the dots of like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, let's just put this email on my iPhone and text Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't use iPhone anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that's how, because they did the iMessage thing. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, so I deleted that email, </joey>
<garnt> so it doesn't exist anymore, 'cause I was like, fuck this. </garnt>
<connor> But at the time it was very creepy of wake up to a text </connor>
<connor> from an American number being like, </connor>
<joey> "Hi, is this Connor by the way?" </joey>
<joey> It's not exactly being hit on, </joey>
<connor> but I stopped it before it could get there. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the first one, I think this is a Stock Image. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I've actually had something similar happen to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Admire my Stock image. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I have a lot of questions about this Stock image. </garnt>
<connor> Why is there a potato there? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] What is that stock image? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I don't know, these are all strange Stock images. </connor>
<joey> So she's just saying no to the potato on the desk. </joey>
<connor> - But yeah, I've had similar things happen to me, </connor>
<joey> I'm not gonna name what messaging app </joey>
<joey> or whatever it was on, </joey>
<connor> but I've realized that you could find my username, </connor>
<connor> obviously pretty easily through this messaging app. </connor>
<garnt> And I would get like people adding me </garnt>
<joey> and just messaging me randomly on it. </joey>
<joey> That was a humbling experience to realize, </joey>
<joey> oh, okay, I can't- - I fucked up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I fucked up, </connor>
<garnt> I can't use this email for everything now. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] All right, the classy, the fan mail. </connor>
<connor> The actual handwritten letter </connor>
<connor> - Oh, like a physical fan mail. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Was this sent to your P.O box? </connor>
<garnt> - This was sent to my P.O box, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was about to ask how they found your address. </garnt>
<joey> - P.O box, you know, had a few letters </joey>
<joey> that were asking if I was, you know, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they would know what conventions I'm going to </joey>
<garnt> and then they would say, "Hey, is it possible </garnt>
<connor> that maybe we could go on a date or something?" </connor>
<connor> And obviously, you know- </connor>
<connor> - I never got that, even when I was single. </connor>
<connor> - No? - Never. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe with time it'll change, Joey. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - YouTubers weren't cool back then, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is just like two, three years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> this used to happen. </garnt>
<connor> It didn't happen that often, </connor>
<garnt> but people would attach their numbers and then they would- </garnt>
<connor> - I never had that, did you ever have that? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, when I first started up really blowing up </connor>
<joey> on the anime community </joey>
<joey> I was already pretty much dating Sydney. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - And, you know, if like Sydney makes her, </joey>
<joey> let's say she marks her territory. </joey>
<joey> - She wards off the- </joey>
<joey> - The laser eyes. </joey>
<connor> - The predators, also I added a stock image, it's this one. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What is happening? </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] It's a guy with a beer. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] This man's doing like a parallel park drift </garnt>
<joey> while pouring a beer, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] The classy. - [Joey] On a highway? </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] And then this one is the modern, the fan email. </connor>
<connor> Obviously, we get emails. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, we still get that. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It's a classic, we get that all the time. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] That was a classic. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] And then this is the Stock Image, </joey>
<joey> 'cause this is me putting the emails in the trash </joey>
<connor> when you send them to me. </connor>
<connor> - I thought you meant this is all the fan mails </connor>
<connor> we get for "Trash Taste". </connor>
<connor> (all exclaiming) </connor>
<connor> - I hate you, Joey, it's not fucking funny, </connor>
<garnt> - All pretty standard so far for YouTubers though. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Okay, next we have the extra classy. </connor>
<connor> I used to do Patreon fan letters, </connor>
<connor> where you could pay to be pen pals with me. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, that sounds like so much effort. </garnt>
<connor> - That doesn't sound like a nightmare is about to happen. </connor>
<connor> - When I made that I didn't think it was gonna, </connor>
<connor> so it's not on there anymore, </connor>
<connor> but I used to think that it was like, </connor>
<garnt> oh, this is such a cool way to connect with me, </garnt>
<connor> and I didn't realize about the logistics. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause you never do with Patreon, </garnt>
<connor> you never think about the logistics until you realize- </connor>
<connor> - I have do this every month. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, basically I agreed to write like 20 letters a month </connor>
<connor> which I'm not good at writing either, </connor>
<connor> and I don't like writing, so writing one letter for me </connor>
<connor> takes like 30 minutes, cause I hate it. </connor>
<connor> - I've seen your handwriting. </connor>
<connor> - I hate writing so much so it was just painful </connor>
<connor> and it was really frustrating as well, </connor>
<connor> I'll go on to how I got hit on after. </connor>
<connor> But it was frustrating as well </connor>
<connor> 'cause people would join Patreon for one month and leave. </connor>
<connor> So I would send out a letter that would just be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you, </connor>
<connor> tell me about yourself," and then not get a response. </connor>
<connor> But I'd have to write like seven of those letters a month, </connor>
<connor> every month, and I was doing them all by hand. </connor>
<connor> - How long was the letter itself? </connor>
<garnt> - Like a page or two? </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus. - Geez, that's a long- </connor>
<garnt> - For how much a month? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was on like the $40 tier, </garnt>
<garnt> but that was included with a voice message as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like how much would, let's let's break this down </garnt>
<connor> on cost to effort-wise. </connor>
<garnt> How much would it take you to write a letter? Not long? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I guess if they paid $40 </connor>
<connor> for 30 minutes worth of work, </connor>
<joey> but I'd always get distracted and I couldn't focus </joey>
<joey> 'cause I just didn't wanna be doing it, so it was awful. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I had someone as well, same with the fan letter, </joey>
<joey> who was like, </joey>
<joey> it was this really weird situation </joey>
<connor> where I'm not really sure what happened. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was just being like, ah, yeah, cool, </connor>
<joey> I like Pokemon too, I like these things, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I was trying and be honest </connor>
<connor> and trying to make a friendship with them. </connor>
<connor> And then they were like, they replied one time being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, so I told my coworkers at work </connor>
<connor> that I have a boyfriend and I said that it was you." </connor>
<joey> And then they asked like, "Is that okay?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, sure, I don't give a fuck, </joey>
<garnt> I'm not gonna go around saying that, you can say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - She brings up the Cdawgva to YouTubers, </garnt>
<connor> and she's like, "Hey, you wanna see my boyfriend?" </connor>
<connor> - That's my boy right there. </connor>
<connor> - Look at that guy, Sebastian, his name's Sebastian. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just thinking and I'm like, is that a brag? </connor>
<connor> Because if they pull up my videos, </connor>
<garnt> half of them are either gonna be me reading BL, </garnt>
<connor> or me in the cosplay. </connor>
<connor> And I think they were from like Midwest somewhere, </connor>
<connor> super conservative state, </connor>
<joey> so I couldn't imagine they would take too kindly </joey>
<connor> to me being like naked in my room, basically going, </connor>
<joey> (squeals) you know? </joey>
<connor> So yeah, that was interesting, that was fun. </connor>
<garnt> - Also, it's a boyfriend that never fucking responds </garnt>
<garnt> to messages or anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a one way boyfriend. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a boyfriend that replies once a month via mail. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, I ended up getting rid of that </garnt>
<connor> because, just stuff like that- </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds like effort. </garnt>
<garnt> - And also it's just way too much effort. </garnt>
<connor> And this is the Stock Image to accompany it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What is happening? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] This is me writing the reply email </connor>
<connor> to the hitman that they hired if I didn't say yes, </connor>
<connor> that we were dating. </connor>
<connor> And then yeah, this is the obvious, </connor>
<connor> this is called nutting during fan calls. </connor>
<connor> I made a video about this, you should go and watch it. </connor>
<connor> It's really old now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know the story, but you can tell. </connor>
<connor> - So essentially there was this time </connor>
<connor> where I was doing a fan call as Hetalia characters. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like cringe already, all right. </connor>
<connor> - So I was doing it with someone else </connor>
<connor> who was doing another voice, </connor>
<garnt> and we were on the call with the person, </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought like there's some weird breathing sounds </garnt>
<garnt> coming from them. </garnt>
<garnt> But I was like, huh, it sounds a little weird </garnt>
<garnt> but I didn't think much of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it Meyline? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Too bad, you bring the Dakimakura </garnt>
<connor> or someone from like "Vampire Knight" she'll get like that. </connor>
<connor> So what happened was, is that we were on this call, </connor>
<connor> I thought, that's weird. </connor>
<connor> And then when we got off the call, </connor>
<joey> it was only like six, seven minutes, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Bruce, was that weird? </joey>
<connor> That call was weird, right?" </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Oh no, I don't think so." </connor>
<connor> But I was editing the audio, </connor>
<connor> so I can go back and listen to the audio, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, she's definitely nutting, </joey>
<joey> that isn't like hyperventilating breath, </joey>
<joey> it was like slow, deep breaths. </joey>
<garnt> (breathing heavily) </garnt>
<connor> Like that, and I was like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> So I made a video about it, </connor>
<connor> but I pitch shifted and changed it, </connor>
<garnt> and it sounds even creepier. </garnt>
<connor> It sounds like a two year old now, which is just scary. </connor>
<joey> Because I wanted to protect their identity obviously, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't know if it was, I don't know if it wasn't, </joey>
<joey> but like, it don't sound good. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I had cut a lot of people- </connor>
<joey> - That's a bit of yikes. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's a bit of yikes. </garnt>
<connor> - How do you handle that? </connor>
<connor> - You're playing character, right? </connor>
<connor> When you do those calls you're in character, </connor>
<connor> so when people would say stuff I would reply in character, </connor>
<connor> like to reject them. </connor>
<connor> - I'd just like to imagine, you just hear like, </connor>
<connor> (moaning) </connor>
<connor> And Connor's like pastor, oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which "Hetalia" character were you playing? </connor>
<connor> - I was playing France from "Hetalia". </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I've never watched "Hetalia", but I assumed </connor>
<joey> he was like a bit of a player from what I understood. </joey>
<connor> - I would have loved it if he was playing like Italy, </connor>
<connor> and he was just like, </connor>
<connor> (moaning) </connor>
<connor> oh yeah, pastor, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I was playing France, they were playing Italy. </connor>
<connor> - They were playing Italy. (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - Pastor. (Joey moaning) </connor>

<garnt> - I think you mean, explosion. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sorry. - Fake fan. </connor>
<connor> - I'm a fake Konosuba fan. - Fake fan. </connor>
<garnt> - She can explode my wallet, if you know what I mean, </garnt>

<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Woo! </garnt>
<garnt> - And like, to be fair, it would happen fairly often </garnt>
<garnt> but I nearly always cut them 'cause it was just cringe. </garnt>
<joey> And people would just be like, I wanna date Sebastian, </joey>
<garnt> and I'd be like, no one is worthy of me, like that. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's really, </garnt>
<garnt> like when I'm in the zone and I would do these calls, </garnt>
<garnt> I would like fully believe in that moment </garnt>
<connor> that I was like that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you have to if you want to do it good. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you're playing a character, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so when people would say stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> I would just like snarkily just insult them straight away, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause they loved it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was fun. </garnt>
<garnt> Dude, imagine being an asshole </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone's like, oh my God, he's amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - How long did you do this for? </joey>
<joey> - These calls? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I did them for like two, three years. </joey>
<joey> - How? Just how? </joey>
<joey> - No, 'cause when it went well it was really fun, </joey>
<joey> because people had such a genuine, </joey>
<joey> happy response, really great. </joey>
<garnt> - You had to just deal with some weird shit fairy often. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, all right, I'ma head out </garnt>
<garnt> like this Stock Image, from that call, am I right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm only joking Meilyne, </garnt>
<garnt> you were probably never that bad, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, she was. She still is, she is worse. </garnt>
<connor> I'm joking. (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I've seen her when she gets around Uta No Prince. </connor>
<connor> All right, next is the uncomfortable, </connor>
<connor> as if none of them were already. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] The last one wasn't uncomfortable? </connor>
<connor> - No, I can deal with that. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause that's in character, that's not Connor, </connor>
<connor> that's Sebastian, that's France. </connor>
<connor> That's not my problem, that's France's problem. </connor>
<connor> - She's getting real hot for France. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, up until very recently </connor>
<connor> I used to do Patreon fan calls. </connor>
<connor> - That was not in character. </connor>
<connor> - No, as me. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So I would offer, and it's gonna sound like a lot, </joey>
<joey> for like $100 an hour to have a call with me, </joey>
<joey> but then if you ask any YouTubers around our sides, </joey>
<joey> they'll be like, wow, that's too little. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause, I know, it sounds absurd, it sounds stupid, </joey>
<joey> my parents all thought it was dumb. </joey>
<joey> They were like, </joey>
<joey> "People pay to speak to you, Connor? That's absurd." </joey>
<connor> - My parents got the same reaction. </connor>
<connor> - "Why would anyone wanna pay speak to you, Connor?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, mom, fuck off mom. </connor>
<connor> So anyway, up until recently I used to do Patreon fan calls, </connor>
<connor> like I said. </connor>
<connor> I'd call it like generations, I don't really know why. </connor>
<connor> but people would always leave in mass and join in mass, </connor>
<connor> and there's only 10 spots on my call, </connor>
<connor> so only 10 people at a time could get these calls. </connor>
<connor> And I would only maybe have like one person </connor>
<connor> who was on it for like two plus years, </connor>
<garnt> but the rest of the time it was like rotating people. </garnt>
<connor> And like I had some really fucking uncomfortable ones </connor>
<connor> that I haven't really spoke about </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm just like, this is so fucking weird, </connor>
<garnt> but I mean, I might as well speak about it now. </garnt>
<garnt> So this one time, this is by far the most uncomfortable, </garnt>
<connor> where I had done two calls with the person </connor>
<connor> and they were like, okay, all right, </connor>
<connor> they seemed pretty decent, seemed pretty normal, </connor>
<connor> they were from Vegas, you know? Aki represent. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know why you're pointing at me, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not from Vegas. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, and they were like, </garnt>
<connor> sorry, I didn't do webcam, it was only about voice. </connor>
<connor> But one time they were like, "Can we do webcam?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, all right, sure. I mean, a one-off, right? </connor>
<connor> Like what's the worst that could happen with a webcam? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You guys know what happened. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm like okay, sure. Sure, let's do it, </connor>
<garnt> let's do webcam, whatever, you know, </garnt>
<connor> you've been on Patreon for a while, we can do this. </connor>
<connor> So we boot up the call, I turn on my webcam, </connor>
<connor> she turns on her webcam. </connor>
<connor> Ah, yeah, she's naked. She's fully naked, </connor>
<connor> but wearing body paint, but you can like- </connor>
<connor> - The look on Usher's face. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Luckily she was over age, dodged a bullet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank God. - Luckily. </garnt>
<garnt> - Luckily, thank God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Otherwise finna get arrested immediately, </garnt>
<connor> I was like, yo, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> And then I was like, oh no, the connection's breaking up, </joey>
<joey> and then like- </joey>
<joey> - You go like, hello can you hear me? </joey>
<connor> (imitating static) </connor>
<connor> - I was like, gosh. </connor>
<garnt> - Hello, I'm going through a tunnel. </garnt>
<connor> - Literally the moment it happened, </connor>
<garnt> like it flashed on the screen, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, smash the red and fucking end this call. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, fuck man. </connor>
<connor> You know how hard, British internet man, </connor>
<connor> it keeps going out. </connor>
<connor> I'm so mad at them man, ugh. </connor>
<connor> - I gotta stay on voice, </connor>
<connor> my internet can't handle the webcam. </connor>
<connor> - Damn, my webcam just imploded. </connor>
<garnt> So I was like fuck, that's awful, it's just terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> And I had some other uncomfortable things come up </garnt>
<garnt> and generally just not very good things happen, </garnt>
<garnt> that were just like, why are they doing this? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, they would just hit on you </garnt>
<connor> in really uncomfortable ways, </connor>
<connor> to the point where I was just like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> some people would think that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you'd meet some people who had clearly never been rejected </garnt>
<joey> in their circle, right? </joey>
<garnt> And then they pay me to talk to me </garnt>
<joey> and then they're like, well I've never been rejected, </joey>
<connor> so it's not gonna start now obviously. </connor>
<connor> They think I'm gonna like... This is a work thing for me, </connor>
<connor> I'm there doing business. </connor>
<garnt> - It sounds like you had a fucking babe station, </garnt>
<garnt> call center going on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Obviously, 'cause like, it's great, </garnt>
<garnt> 90% of people, it was chill, it was just talking to them, </garnt>
<connor> give them a bit of useful advice, </connor>
<connor> and maybe help them with things, super normal calls. </connor>
<garnt> It's just like some people were like, bro, this is my in, </garnt>
<garnt> this is my way to get Connor to hang out with me or stuff, </garnt>
<joey> and like all sorts of weird shit. </joey>
<connor> Like people would go around and, </connor>
<connor> like, I think recently, I used to do like voice recordings, </connor>
<connor> I still do to be fair, 'cause they're really easy. </connor>
<garnt> But people would go around, take the voice recordings </garnt>
<garnt> and say, "Look, me and Connor are best friends." </garnt>
<garnt> - Ugh. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, I have a message from Connor saying hi to me, </connor>
<garnt> we're kind of like best friends. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, do people know? Like why do people do this? </connor>
<connor> Why? Do you think you're getting clout? </connor>
<connor> - Are you comfortable with that? </connor>
<garnt> - Whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - I wouldn't be comfortable with that, </joey>
<garnt> I don't know that to me is- </garnt>
<garnt> - Someone going around saying that they're a friend of mine </garnt>
<connor> to get their way is not cool with me. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's also, you know, it's big brain. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause, you know, I could be like... </connor>
<connor> Let's say, right? God forbid, </connor>
<connor> I say something stupid on a live stream, </connor>
<joey> we're like, no, that's just a recording, </joey>
<connor> a Patreon recording not me. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck was that? No, I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> - Well now when Connor gets counseling, two year- </connor>
<connor> - When I get counseling I'll be like guys no, </connor>
<connor> that was a script, I was doing a job. </connor>
<connor> - Just watch this one clip at least. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm kidding. </connor>
<garnt> - I was playing France from "Hetalia" the whole time. </garnt>
<connor> - I never record anything inappropriate, </connor>
<connor> it's just like, obviously, 'cause some people want </connor>
<connor> an uplifting message </connor>
<connor> 'cause they've been beaten down recently </connor>
<garnt> and I'm more than happy to do that. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, you know, if me giving you a voice message </connor>
<connor> saying, hey man, things will get better, just keep trying- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I've done that before as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but at the same time, if I found out that that person was- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh I don't give them voice messages anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, was going around telling people, hey- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm best friends with Giggukaz </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm best friends with Garnt, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, okay, get the fuck out of my life please. </garnt>
<joey> - I email them basically saying, </joey>
<connor> hey, I'm removing you from Patreon, </connor>
<joey> what the fuck are you doing? This is sad. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. That's not cool. </connor>
<joey> - Because the worst thing was that </joey>
<joey> she wasn't going around to like her close friends, </joey>
<joey> for some reason she was going around </joey>
<joey> and sending them to other YouTubers, </joey>
<garnt> saying I'm friends with Connor, look, I have this message, </garnt>
<connor> and unfortunately some of those YouTubers didn't know </connor>
<connor> that I was doing the Patreon voice messages. </connor>
<connor> - But I mean, I've gone through that as well </connor>
<garnt> where I've had people going around saying that they know me </garnt>
<connor> and saying that they have been friends with me </connor>
<garnt> when they weren't just to try and get in with other people. </garnt>
<joey> And it's like, that's the biggest fucking red flag for me. </joey>
<garnt> - But that's kind of one of the big reasons, </garnt>
<garnt> as well as time, is why I removed the ability </garnt>
<connor> to call me on Patreon, I don't do it anymore. </connor>
<garnt> You can't have a quick phone call with me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the worst thing that happened to me </garnt>
<connor> was it literally happened to me at a convention, </connor>
<garnt> where, you know, I had a guy who was going around </garnt>
<garnt> telling people, telling companies, that they knew me </garnt>
<connor> and they were trying to use that as an in. </connor>
<connor> - That's somehow even worse, </connor>
<connor> is when they're going around to companies. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause they're potentially ruining your name. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - But they're also trying to profit themselves, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yes, you see I can deal </joey>
<joey> with someone being a fucking creep, that's (indistinct), </joey>
<connor> I can just immediately shut that down, right? </connor>
<connor> But if someone does that, that's repairing I have to do. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's horrible. Luckily, that's why- </connor>
<connor> - I guess that's why it triggers me so much, </connor>
<connor> because I hear that and I just think, </connor>
<connor> dude, the shit I had to deal with then. </connor>
<connor> The audacity of this bitch. </connor>
<connor> - I would gladly have someone hit on me on a call 100 times, </connor>
<connor> rather than them go to a company saying that we're friends, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Cause I can, you know? That's fine. </connor>
<connor> - Don't do that. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, do not do that. </connor>
<connor> That is the biggest asshole move you could do. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] We have Garnt in 50 years, as the- </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] It's (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay, I don't know what the Stock Image is. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Where the fuck did you get this image from? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - What is this? Is this like Asian Humpty Dumpty? </connor>
<connor> - You type in (indistinct), and this what comes up. </connor>
<garnt> - So this is, the real. </garnt>
<garnt> I was at a coffee shop one time, in good old Swanzey, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'd recently just broke up with my ex-girlfriend </garnt>
<garnt> at the time. </garnt>
<connor> I was very sad and so my housemates took me out for coffee. </connor>
<joey> And we were just like, you know, </joey>
<joey> he just wanted to talk to me </joey>
<joey> and just keep me uplifted, you know? </joey>
<connor> And I love coffee, I love talking, </connor>
<connor> so this is the perfect combination. </connor>
<connor> And whilst I was at the coffee shop, </connor>
<joey> dressed in like sweat pants, miserable, some person, </joey>
<joey> what looked to be like a 15 year old girl, I shit you not, </joey>
<joey> by the way, I was like 20, </joey>
<garnt> comes up to me and I know they're coming to me. </garnt>
<garnt> You know how I know? - [Garnt] How? </garnt>
<connor> They got a fucking, they have like the scout leader, </connor>
<garnt> scout regiment backpack from "Attack On Titan". </garnt>
<joey> And I saw them looking at me, </joey>
<joey> and I could see this eye contact not breaking, </joey>
<connor> coming up to me. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And no joke, right? </connor>
<connor> She was like, can I sit down and join you for coffee? </connor>
<connor> And she's like 15, and her friend is like right there, </connor>
<garnt> and I'm like, what is happening? </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's kinda inappropriate, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I don't really know you, I don't really wanna do this. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean it's not really being hit on 'cause underage, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, it was just kind of uncomfortable </garnt>
<garnt> and just like what? </garnt>
<garnt> I thought like a picture, sure, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm totally fine with doing pictures </garnt>
<garnt> or signing anything you want, I don't care about that. </garnt>
<connor> But like you wanna just sit down </connor>
<connor> and start talking next to me? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, don't invite yourself to like, that kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know, it's weird, </connor>
<garnt> but they were a kid, they didn't know any better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, that's happened to us a few times, </garnt>
<garnt> I would think. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's happened at conventions quite a bit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it happens at conventions- </garnt>
<garnt> - Conventions, I expect it, </garnt>
<garnt> but when you're hanging outside, just chilling, </garnt>
<joey> and I was pretty beat up at the time and I was really hurt. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you weren't in the best mental state. </joey>
<joey> - I was really fucking sad, </joey>
<joey> and having a girl come up to me, just being like, </joey>
<joey> hey, can I sit next to you? </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, I really don't want to right now. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna do anything with any women anymore. </connor>
<connor> - It was literally like the day off as well, </connor>
<connor> so I was like fuck it, I was miserable. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I think about that, </joey>
<joey> and I think, you know, she'll probably look back </joey>
<connor> at that period of her life- </connor>
<connor> - Cringe. - And just fucking cringe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I can, we're not saying you should do it, </garnt>
<joey> or I'm justifying it or anything, </joey>
<garnt> because you shouldn't do that. </garnt>
<joey> But I know that, you know, when you're that young </joey>
<joey> and you feel like you have a para-social relationship, </joey>
<garnt> you don't know about this stuff. </garnt>
<connor> Especially, you don't know about the social boundaries, </connor>
<joey> and she'll probably grow up and she'll look back at that </joey>
<joey> and she'll wake up in a cold sweat. </joey>
<connor> And think, God, why the fuck did I do that? </connor>
<connor> - Literally you can approach me anywhere, </connor>
<connor> even if it's in a fucking toilet, </connor>
<connor> I don't really give a shit, </connor>
<connor> as long as I'm not pissing, or I'm eating or drinking. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, please don't do it when I'm pissing. </garnt>
<connor> - While I'm pissing and eating, just please don't. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I just wanna finish my meal, </garnt>
<joey> it's what I look forward to most in the day. </joey>
<connor> - It's the few times where we can have full privacy, </connor>
<connor> so just give us that privacy. </connor>
<connor> - It's not even that, I just wanna enjoy my meal. </connor>
<connor> I just love food so much, I don't wanna have to think about, </connor>
<connor> oh fuck, I have to take a picture, my steak's going cold. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and this is the stock image to go along with it. </connor>
<connor> - Quiet at a coffee shop. </connor>
<connor> You know how I told the story about the dude </connor>
<connor> who stopped me in the urinal, </connor>
<connor> this is the exact face he made when he saw me. </connor>
<garnt> He was like, "Yo, it's Joey!" I'm like dude- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Joe, that's your dick? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, dude, my dick's out man. </garnt>
<connor> Like don't pog at me, </connor>
<connor> my dick's out right now man, let's stop </connor>
<joey> - He literally pog jumped your dick? </joey>
<joey> - I've mentioned the next story before, </joey>
<joey> but yeah, this is the hotel key card one, </joey>
<joey> when someone gave me their hotel key card. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, that shit was fucking creepy. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] This is the Stock Image that I chose </connor>
<connor> to go along with it. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What? </connor>
<connor> - Did you know actually, this is the same trio- </connor>
<joey> - Is that Ludwig? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Tell me that doesn't look like Ludwig? </joey>
<joey> - This is the girlfriend. </joey>
<connor> - This is the girlfriend meme, right? </connor>
<connor> - This is the girlfriend meme, </connor>
<connor> with the guy looking the other way. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I recognize the guy's face. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the exact same model, from the girlfriend. </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, to those who don't know </garnt>
<garnt> and don't wanna go back and watch the episode, </garnt>
<garnt> essentially what happened was someone gave me </garnt>
<garnt> a piece of paper and they were like, this is for you, </garnt>
<garnt> and on it was their hotel key card and room number, </garnt>
<garnt> that was signed. </garnt>
<garnt> And it said uh, there was like times when I could go. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there was a person at the desk next to me </garnt>
<garnt> who was helping, you know, manage, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause when you get the money, you had to (indistinct). </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And they were like, "Bro," and I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> "Do you want it? I don't want it." </connor>
<connor> Needless to say, I immediately gave it </connor>
<connor> to the hotel reception when I was done signing things, </connor>
<connor> and they were like, "Why do you have this?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, it's a long story. </connor>
<connor> And this one's called, the bold, it's a hotel door, </connor>
<connor> with a hotel door. </connor>
<connor> So I told you one story about how there was one hotel room </connor>
<garnt> where I was on the bottom floor, </garnt>
<garnt> and we came out and there was the two girls, at midnight. </garnt>
<garnt> But there was another time where I came back, </garnt>
<garnt> and this wasn't as creepy, it was just kind of weird. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like middle of the day, like 1:00 PM. </garnt>
<connor> - Was this at an anime convention? </connor>
<connor> - This was at an anime, </connor>
<connor> of course it was an anime convention. </connor>
<connor> Where else would it be, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> So I don't know how someone found out it was my room, </connor>
<connor> I was pretty careful. </connor>
<connor> Like I made sure, it sounds so fucking stupid, </connor>
<connor> like made sure no one was following me, right? </connor>
<connor> As Garnt should have. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - This is why I do it even though it sounds like I'm CIA. </joey>
<joey> - I wouldn't have got it, I wouldn't have understood </joey>
<joey> until I got followed back to my room. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I just don't want people to know, right? </connor>
<connor> And there was just like, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> one girl who looked like in her 30s, just like, </connor>
<garnt> you know how the doorframe is like this, </garnt>
<garnt> just sitting like this at my doorframe, </garnt>
<garnt> like blocking the door. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] What? </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, like the door is here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, so that's the frame, </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And this is the other frame. </garnt>
<garnt> - So they're just there right in front of your door. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I was like, hello? </garnt>
<connor> And they were like, "Oh, I like your videos." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, oh no. I'm like social skills 10,000, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, oh, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Then I was like , "Oh okay, awesome. You want a picture?" </connor>
<connor> And they were like, "Yeah sure, that'd be awesome." </connor>
<garnt> And we took a picture, and then they just left, </garnt>
<connor> and I was like, cool, I don't have to say anything. </connor>
<garnt> All right, awesome. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I didn't know what was going on, </connor>
<garnt> I was like, why are you in front of my hotel room door? </garnt>
<garnt> We're on like the fifth floor </garnt>
<garnt> which is like nowhere near the elevator or anything, </garnt>
<garnt> like this is really far away. </garnt>
<garnt> I think maybe they wanted, I don't know if they knew me, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously they did, </garnt>
<garnt> but my first thought was like, are they just chilling here? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I get it, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause sometimes the lobby is really crowded and shit, </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna just go to the alleyway or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> in the fucking rooms, 'cause they're long. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, oh, how did you know this was my door? </garnt>
<connor> That's pretty concerning, I wanted to ask her. </connor>
<connor> I never found out, so to this day I don't know </connor>
<connor> why she was in front of my door, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what she wanted. </garnt>
<garnt> Again, this isn't a very good guys getting hit on, </garnt>
<garnt> this is just strange ways people approach me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, this sounds like a lot of strange things </garnt>
<connor> that have happened about you getting stalked. </connor>
<connor> - Just gonna say it's, hit on, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna put it all under the umbrella, it sounds catchy. </connor>
<connor> - This is the YouTube clickbait, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna stay hit on in the description. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this is actually YouTube clickbait. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, this is true. </connor>
<connor> And then this is the Stock image </connor>
<connor> that I found for this one. </connor>
<connor> Although there is that one story- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] R.I.P to all the audio only listeners. </connor>
<connor> - This does make me realize about the person </connor>
<joey> who isn't on the list, </joey>
<connor> but the person who named their baby after me </connor>
<joey> Have we told that story? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - We haven't told that story. </joey>
<joey> - So back when I was re-doing "Black Butler" a lot, </joey>
<connor> there was this one person who, obviously this was it, </connor>
<connor> that's how I remember, </connor>
<connor> I just remembered the canonical in my head. </connor>
<connor> I went to the "Black Butler" meetup one time- </connor>
<garnt> - The canonical order. </garnt>
<garnt> - The canonical order of the- </garnt>
<connor> - This is head canon. </connor>
<connor> - They say in the filler arc. </connor>
<connor> - So what happened was, this was like my first ever AIX, </connor>
<connor> and I can't remember how long I was doing YouTube for, </connor>
<garnt> but I thought it would be cool just to go </garnt>
<garnt> to the "Black Butler" meetup and just say hi, hey man, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm the guy on YouTube </garnt>
<joey> who does all the "Black Butler" stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> And just say hi and just, you know, it was just to meet them </joey>
<joey> and just meet all the fans of "Black Butler" and to be like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, this is fucking sick, and they're all really nice. </joey>
<connor> And there's one person who was like really, really nice, </connor>
<connor> super, super nice. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, she was really nice, </connor>
<joey> we got loads of pictures with her, a little intense, </joey>
<joey> but that's fine, I'm used to that. </joey>
<joey> - I mean all "Black Butler" fans are quite intense, </joey>
<joey> to be fair. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but some of them are just there, </joey>
<connor> don't give a shit about watching my videos, </connor>
<connor> but there was a good... I'd say like half there were like, </connor>
<connor> oh my God, yo, excuse me. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you were the "Black Butler" guy </connor>
<garnt> back then, weren't you? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean yeah, in terms of YouTube I was the only one </garnt>
<connor> making content about "Black Butler". </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it was like how many years after </connor>
<connor> "Black Butler" had aired? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like I almost made like a mini renaissance </connor>
<connor> of the (indistinct), in terms of Western. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the community became way more active- </connor>
<connor> - It's kinda like what the "Abridged" series, </connor>
<garnt> did for the "Yu-Gi-Oh" anime back in the day. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't wanna say it was that heavy </garnt>
<connor> but I feel like it was definitely a bump </connor>
<joey> because of all the "Black Butler" stuff I was pumping out. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But anyway, a year goes by, right? </garnt>
<connor> And I go to the, you know, they're messaging me </connor>
<connor> telling me you have to come back </connor>
<garnt> to the "Black Butler" meet up again, </garnt>
<connor> I have a big surprise for you. </connor>
<connor> And so I'm like, all right, okay, sure. </connor>
<garnt> I thought it was like a gift or something, </garnt>
<garnt> that they were making out to me. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, okay, sure, I'll get it, I'll take a picture, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll come, why not? </garnt>
<garnt> This is the point where I was trying </garnt>
<garnt> to distance myself from "Black Butler", </garnt>
<garnt> but I was like, okay, cool, I'll come. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I go, lo and behold she's holding a baby, </garnt>
<garnt> literally, like a two month old baby. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how old this baby is, like it's a fresh baby. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fresh baby. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fresh out the oven. </garnt>
<connor> - Freshly made baby. </connor>
<connor> - Not a single wrinkle on this baby. </connor>
<connor> And she's like, "Do you wanna hold Connor?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Connor? That's a funny coincidence." </connor>
<connor> And she said, "Oh no, no, it's not a coincidence, </connor>
<garnt> I named him after you." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, okay, this is fucking weird. </garnt>
<garnt> This is fucking weird. </garnt>
<connor> - The fuck? My favorite ever photo </connor>
<connor> is of you holding baby Connor. </connor>
<garnt> - It's still out there? </garnt>
<garnt> - With the most uncomfortable smile </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever seen on you. </garnt>
<garnt> - How'd you even react to that? </garnt>
<connor> - Uh, just pure confusion. </connor>
<connor> And again, you gotta understand Garnt, </connor>
<connor> I just go with everything. </connor>
<connor> - His face holding the baby is like, </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, I get it. I would do exactly the same thing. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanted the picture to reflect how uncomfortable I was </garnt>
<garnt> so I could tell the story later on. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, there's a picture out there. </connor>
<connor> If you just Google, Connor with baby, maybe? </connor>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<connor> - Connor with baby? </connor>
<connor> - Cdawg baby I don't fucking know. </connor>
<connor> Well I don't know what the fuck comes up. </connor>
<connor> - It's CDawgVA two. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and to be fair, it's pretty fucking cute, </garnt>
<connor> but like there was something wholly uncomfortable </connor>
<joey> about holding a stranger's baby </joey>
<garnt> that I just, I don't know, </garnt>
<joey> it's like holding someone's expensive vase, you know. </joey>
<connor> - I still don't know how to handle babies. </connor>
<connor> Like someone asks me if I wanna hold their baby, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, does it come with an instruction manual? </connor>
<garnt> What do I do? </garnt>
<connor> I feel so inadequate when it comes to handling babies. </connor>
<garnt> - They're great for the 10 seconds </garnt>
<joey> where they're not like crying, </joey>
<joey> and then the moment you pick them up and they start crying, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, Oh God, Oh God, what to do? </joey>
<garnt> - It's like stop please, please, stop, stop! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but as odd as that is, </garnt>
<garnt> and almost creepy, you could say, </garnt>
<joey> it's flattering more than anything, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, don't get me wrong. </connor>
<garnt> - They were very nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's probably flattering in a sense but- </garnt>
<connor> - It's flattering, I just, I would feel that </connor>
<connor> if anyone named a baby after me, </connor>
<connor> that's a bit too pressure on me. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like naming your baby after any influencer </connor>
<connor> is a bad idea. </connor>
<connor> - Did you find it Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What did you type in? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Cdawg baby. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Type in Cdawg baby. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, Meilyne found it by typing in, CDawg baby. </connor>
<connor> - Apparently it comes up. </connor>
<connor> - I just think it's a bad idea </connor>
<garnt> naming your baby after any influencer. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We all know we're just one bad tool away from being- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, don't name your kid </garnt>
<garnt> after your favorite YouTuber, that's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like getting a tattoo </garnt>
<garnt> of your favorite YouTuber, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - But luckily it was just Connor and not CDawgVA the bay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I have no idea how Corp's husband feels </garnt>
<garnt> when he sees his voice, what do we call it? </garnt>
<joey> - It's his wave file. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the wave form of him breathing as a tattoo. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, man, how'd you handle that? </garnt>
<connor> - Yikers. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that's how that happened. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that is very bold indeed. </connor>
<connor> - That is very bold. </connor>
<connor> - I've got like the next one, </connor>
<joey> it's called, the smooth paper. </joey>
<connor> I've been handed pieces of the paper before at conventions, </connor>
<garnt> you know, I always like sign something, </garnt>
<joey> or I'll take a picture and I'll charm in a piece of paper. </joey>
<joey> I'll be like, "Hey, here's my number? Come text me." </joey>
<connor> I think that's kind of smooth, that's very old style, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why that's smooth. </garnt>
<connor> I never reply to any of them, 'cause I'm like, bro, </connor>
<connor> my phone doesn't work in the U.S, </connor>
<garnt> sorry, I just have internet. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's very smooth, I like it, </garnt>
<connor> I actually like that one, I think it's classy. </connor>
<connor> - Now, you're gonna get this at every convention. </connor>
<connor> - No, shit. Fuck, I shouldn't have said. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause with this one, it's not intense, </connor>
<garnt> it's like, if I wanna call you, I'll call you. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna call you, just letting you know, </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm too fucking busy. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just the casual, right? That's how I imagine people- </connor>
<connor> - It's nice. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - There's something simple about it that's so inoffensive. </joey>
<connor> But maybe it's because I'm a guy, </connor>
<joey> I feel like if I was a girl and guys kept doing it to me, </joey>
<joey> I'd be annoyed. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that'd be very creepy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It is very flattering when someone is attractive </garnt>
<connor> and they send you, you know, they hit on you. </connor>
<connor> It's like, oh wow, this league? Really? </connor>
<connor> Ah, no, get out of here. </connor>
<garnt> - We weren't even playing the same sport. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought I was playing checkers, </connor>
<garnt> you're playing 40 chairs. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> This don't match. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, it's a nice ego boost for like 20 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> until you realize that- </garnt>
<garnt> - Until you realize it's a bit weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Until you realize, fuck, this is a bit strange, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> Golden rule, don't fuck your fans, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially in this climate, </garnt>
<connor> I just think that's a great rule to stick by. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, dude. Whenever I used to... </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause for the first like two or three months in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I had like Tinder, 'cause I thought </garnt>
<garnt> no one's gonna recognize me on Tinder, fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> But yet there's people who recognized me on Tinder here </garnt>
<garnt> who could speak English obviously, </garnt>
<joey> and obviously a white guy would stand out. </joey>
<joey> And they were like, oh, I watch your videos, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, immediately unmatch. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, like- </joey>
<joey> - You played it smart. </joey>
<joey> - Why would I wanna... </joey>
<joey> I don't want to date someone who turns up and they're like, </joey>
<joey> yo, I love that video you just posted. </joey>
<joey> Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. </joey>
<joey> - Because unfortunately there's a lot of YouTubers </joey>
<joey> who'd probably use that as an ego boost, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Listen, okay, getting in the whole topic </joey>
<joey> of fucking your fans, or dating your fans. </joey>
<joey> There is a way to go about it that works. </joey>
<joey> - There is a right way </joey>
<joey> and there is definitely a wrong way. </joey>
<garnt> - Dunky and Leah, they met through being fans, </garnt>
<garnt> and no one ever would question, what's the word? </garnt>
<garnt> - Legitimacy? </garnt>
<garnt> - The legitimacy or the ethicacy of that, right? </garnt>
<connor> That's a legitimate relationship. </connor>
<connor> But there are ways to doing it </connor>
<connor> that are like taking advantage of your power, </connor>
<joey> and I think that's where people have the problem. </joey>
<connor> And unfortunately, a lot of YouTubers don't understand </connor>
<garnt> when they are kind of taking advantage of their own power </garnt>
<garnt> in the situation. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like hooking up, </garnt>
<garnt> I say hooking up, hooking up is the wrong word. </garnt>
<garnt> Because if hooking up with your fans implies </garnt>
<garnt> that yeah, you are just kind of just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - You're not pursuing anything afterwards, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're just kinda throwing your fame out there </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like you have to be really self-conscious </garnt>
<garnt> about this, and I'm glad that people </garnt>
<joey> are looking more into this, </joey>
<connor> and putting more attention into this. </connor>
<connor> - Fans are getting smarter about it as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and fans are getting smarter about this as well, </connor>
<garnt> as they really should be. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's the responsibility you hold as a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> and sometimes you just don't wanna worry about that. </garnt>
<joey> You just wanna meet someone </joey>
<joey> where you don't wanna have to worry </joey>
<garnt> about this power imbalance </garnt>
<joey> because we all are just people as well. </joey>
<joey> We're all just people and sometimes </joey>
<joey> we just wanna switch off this part of our lives, </joey>
<joey> and just be a normal fucking person like anyone else. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't want someone who watches my videos </garnt>
<connor> and has an expectation </connor>
<connor> of me in general, that I couldn't live up to. </connor>
<joey> - That is portrayed through your video. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - It's funny 'cause most of the friends I've made </joey>
<joey> who started off as fans, as we became friends </joey>
<joey> they just started watching less and less of my stuff. </joey>
<joey> And that's because... </joey>
<joey> In a lot of ways that made me more comfortable, </joey>
<garnt> or we stopped talking about it because they were just mates </garnt>
<joey> and we would talk like mates, </joey>
<joey> and talk about whatever else apart from my job, </joey>
<connor> as I'm sure they stopped- </connor>
<connor> - I kinda feel that works in the same way </connor>
<connor> with like friends between two YouTubers, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's like, I definitely watched less </garnt>
<garnt> of my YouTuber friends videos after we just kind of </garnt>
<garnt> went past that point and just became friends. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you keep up with it </garnt>
<connor> just to see what your mates are doing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but you're not like damn bro, </garnt>
<connor> that last video, fucking banger bro. </connor>
<garnt> Like I would've done this differently though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I like showing support to my mates, you know? </garnt>
<joey> But it's different from being like, </joey>
<joey> yo I'm a huge fan of what you did, fuck yes, </joey>
<connor> fucking banger right there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, man, life's hard hey. </connor>
<garnt> If you're a YouTuber, if you wanna just be safe, </garnt>
<garnt> don't fuck your fans. </garnt>
<joey> - Rule number one, don't fuck your fans. </joey>
<connor> - That's what I've been doing </connor>
<joey> and it's been working good for me. </joey>
<joey> - Don't fuck your fans. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> Here's my Stock Image. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Can you explain why you chose </connor>
<connor> this particular image? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay, so there is a Labrador </connor>
<connor> holding a gun right now. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I just thought this one was fun, you know? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay, sure. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I don't know, it's kind of fun, right? </connor>
<joey> - This is what happens when you reach </joey>
<connor> like the end of your project </connor>
<connor> and you're just like, </connor>
<connor> I'll just throw whatever shit I put on. </connor>
<connor> - Well, we're about halfway. </connor>
<connor> - We're about halfway? Okay. </connor>
<connor> - The next one started getting a bit more obvious, </connor>
<connor> you've ever been hit on on the YouTube comment section? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Of course, yes. - [Garnt] Of course. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> "Take me on a date next time I visit Japan," that happens. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, that happens a lot. </garnt>
<joey> - I got a few of those comments and it's like, uh, no. </joey>
<joey> How about you pay for my date? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I wonder if anyone has, ever in the history of YouTube, </joey>
<joey> probably has, would have taken a comment like that seriously </joey>
<joey> and tried to pursue it. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, if you're like a smaller YouTuber, maybe </garnt>
<garnt> - For a YouTuber, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I did something similar along with email, </garnt>
<garnt> somebody emailed me asking me to go on a date and- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but there's a difference between an email </garnt>
<connor> and a YouTube comment. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, true. </garnt>
<connor> - Anyone can write a YouTube comment. </connor>
<connor> - The live, and then obviously, you know, </connor>
<connor> people ask you on dates on livestreams all the time. </connor>
<connor> You're streaming, yeah, I get comments sometimes </connor>
<garnt> being like, can we on a date, can we go in Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> People subtly ask questions that are like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think they that they're being subtle, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's very obvious what they're asking. </garnt>
<garnt> Like for example, one very big giveaway, </garnt>
<connor> as to what some people are asking are like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, would you ever do </connor>
<connor> like long distance relationships by the way?" </connor>
<connor> And like, some people might genuinely be curious, right? </connor>
<joey> But there's a way that certain people ask it, </joey>
<joey> that is like, no. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It kind of gives you that vibe of like, </connor>
<connor> you're asking this for a purpose. </connor>
<joey> And also I get a donation sometimes, </joey>
<garnt> which I think that's another one actually, </garnt>
<garnt> but where people will be like, oh, I'm just wondering, </garnt>
<garnt> what kind of age group do you go for? </garnt>
<joey> If it isn't obvious by now, uh, MILFs. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> Mother knows best, that's what I go for. </joey>
<connor> - All the MILFs rise up right now. </connor>
<connor> - So, you know, if you're around my age- </connor>
<joey> - Lonely housewives, this is your time to shine. </joey>
<garnt> - They're preparing their wallets for the next stream. </garnt>
<joey> - If your husband is not cutting it, </joey>
<connor> I don't wanna know who he is, but... </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm kidding. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I mean, stuff like that. What else do I get? </joey>
<connor> There's ones as well, </connor>
<connor> you know what I get asked a fair amount, </connor>
<joey> which is like the least subtle? </joey>
<garnt> Which is like, would you ever date someone </garnt>
<connor> who like, doesn't do YouTube? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, do you think I exclusively date psychopaths? </connor>
<connor> Like, is that what you think? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I only, exclusively, date YouTubers. </garnt>
<joey> - That's weird. </joey>
<connor> - If you don't have at least 10,000 subs- </connor>
<connor> - Well, you guys date YouTubers, </connor>
<joey> but I couldn't imagine dating a YouTuber. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I started dating her </joey>
<joey> when she had like less than 1000 subs, </joey>
<joey> so it's a little bit different. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I convinced my girl to become a YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> - So you brought them into the play. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we brought them in, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wouldn't want my significant other to be a YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I don't wanna fucking deal with another me, </garnt>
<garnt> that's fucking awful. </garnt>
<connor> And like, my schedule is such a mess already, </connor>
<garnt> that I wouldn't... </garnt>
<garnt> Like a relationship, to me, </garnt>
<connor> like that would be such a fucking mess </connor>
<connor> if both of us had similar schedules like that. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I don't blame you. </connor>
<connor> There's lots of people who are like that. </connor>
<connor> - That's just me, it's just me, that's what I want. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel that's just how our relationships ended up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's just a standard work schedule. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] And like this Stock image, which is a... </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Again, it doesn't really have anything </joey>
<joey> to do with the point but is a funny Stock image. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh no, no, </joey>
<joey> I just wanted to put a Stock image in there. </joey>
<connor> This one, donations again. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] The charitable. </joey>
<connor> I'm pretty sure these are called simps, right? </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] These are called uh... </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] But you can't say that anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, banned off Twitch. </garnt>
<connor> - No, learn to call them, prime members. </connor>
<joey> - T3 subs. </joey>
<joey> - You're a prime member, well, we're going on a date soon. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, obviously, you get that a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> Actually, Instagram, message requests, </garnt>
<garnt> I get that a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Do you actually check them? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, 'cause I used to- </garnt>
<garnt> - I do every now and then just 'cause- </garnt>
<garnt> - I used to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I used to as well </garnt>
<connor> and then I realized that these are useless </connor>
<joey> and I stopped checking it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like throwing a coin down a well </joey>
<garnt> hoping for it to grow into a tree, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's like, it's not gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, this is the Stock image to go along with it. </connor>
<garnt> I don't really know- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] What is happening there? </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] They're on a car bonnet. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Definitely having sex. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I'm not really sure what's going on. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] I have no idea what's going on there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so that's Instagram messages, completely useless. </connor>
<connor> Don't do it, it's not gonna work, </connor>
<connor> unless you have a shit ton of followers. </connor>
<connor> I think it pops up, Instagram tells you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah . </connor>
<garnt> - Someone big has messaged you. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's like some kind of threshold of followers, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like having that blue tick mark on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> I already mentioned this one, but just Tinder. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yep. - [Garnt] Yep. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Wait is that the same girl </connor>
<joey> in front of the burning house? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] It does look like her, doesn't it? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It looks like her, doesn't it? </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, it kinda does, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Could be. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] It could be. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe she found a nice career </connor>
<connor> in Stock images afterwards. </connor>
<connor> - Who knows? </connor>
<connor> Also, actually, believe it or not, </connor>
<connor> I've been hit on on Fiverr. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Of course you have. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] No joke. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Of course you have, why am I not surprised? </connor>
<joey> - I legitimately had a seller- </joey>
<joey> - Sell your services, is that it? </joey>
<joey> - 'Services'. </joey>
<joey> - They were like, "Connor, I've got a great deal for you, </joey>
<connor> let me give you a custom offer on Fiverr." </connor>
<connor> So yeah, actually, funny enough </connor>
<connor> they were really a good sport about it though, </connor>
<connor> but they were basically just kind of like... </connor>
<joey> I think I had hired them for one of the videos, </joey>
<garnt> and I think they were an artist. </garnt>
<garnt> - What were they trying to buy from you? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I hired them, and then when the video came out, </connor>
<connor> they were like, "Oh, thanks for including me in the video." </connor>
<garnt> But I don't know if you wanna ever just call or hang out. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - Here's my discord, and I'm like, oh, okay, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - This man's an absolute chick magnet. </garnt>
<connor> - No, this is what I'm saying, right? </connor>
<garnt> When you have, you know... </garnt>
<garnt> How many fucking views do we get a month on our channel? </garnt>
<garnt> Like eight, nine million views a month, right? </garnt>
<connor> All it takes is one person to think I'm attractive. </connor>
<connor> Why? I don't know, </connor>
<connor> to then go on and then do something, right? </connor>
<connor> I don't think I'm inherently more attractive </connor>
<connor> than anyone or most people, you just have a platform. </connor>
<connor> - But the thing is like, I've never experienced that, </connor>
<joey> and I don't think Garnt's ever experienced that. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Well, not to this- </connor>
<joey> - But, to be fair, I also- </joey>
<connor> - But also I feel like your content- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I do videos about dating and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, it doesn't surprise me. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess you do appeal more to that kind of crowd. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyone who has, 'cause a lot of your content base </garnt>
<garnt> started off with literal fan interaction. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it all started from there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whereas or me, I literally didn't start, </garnt>
<connor> even for most of my videos, I don't show my face </connor>
<connor> on my videos at all. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas we don't give a shit about our fans. </connor>
<connor> No, I'm just kidding. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you don't, you fucking scum. </garnt>
<garnt> My whole YouTube career in the start </garnt>
<garnt> was built off interaction, and I'm very grateful for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why it doesn't surprise me, </garnt>
<joey> why some of the weirdest fan interactions </joey>
<joey> have come from you. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess so. Yeah, that makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you give avenues for people to talk to you </garnt>
<garnt> they'll find a way to hit on you, </garnt>
<garnt> that's how it works. </garnt>
<garnt> Now, this is the Stock image. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God, what is that? </connor>
<connor> That was me at the end of the figurine challenge, </connor>
<connor> that's what it felt like. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] True, I was just wondering </connor>
<connor> what the direction was here. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I'm curious. </connor>
<connor> - Hey kid, swallow this fish for us real quick. </connor>
<garnt> He said, all right, I got you fam. </garnt>
<garnt> - Viking kids eating a meal. </garnt>
<garnt> - How much am I getting, $5 for this? </garnt>
<connor> - I've been asked out if I'd like to go drinking </connor>
<joey> with someone at a panel. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] In front of other people? </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] In front of the whole panel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've had that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like two women, who were, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> in my preferred demographic of older women. </garnt>
<garnt> Who were like, would you like to- </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Connor was like, I'm listening. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, you have my attention. </joey>
<joey> - Connor goes through his analytics, </joey>
<joey> and he picks by demographic. </joey>
<connor> He's just like, get rid of all this, </connor>
<joey> this is like 25 to 30, no, none of that, </joey>
<garnt> too close an age. </garnt>
<garnt> - 35 to 45, ooh. - Ooh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So legit, I think it was two women, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I think one was the aunt and one was the mother </garnt>
<garnt> of the daughter they brought along. </garnt>
<garnt> And she just sticks her hand up and she's like, </garnt>
<connor> "I have no idea who you are but I like your voice. </connor>
<garnt> Would you be willing to have drinks with us later?" </garnt>
<garnt> - The mom said that? </garnt>
<connor> - The mum said that, and I've never seen a child </connor>
<connor> go from like smiling to anger so fast. </connor>
<garnt> The child's like, mom, mom, mom! </garnt>
<garnt> - The child's like, I was gonna say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was just like, yeah, I'd love to, jokingly. </garnt>
<connor> I never did. </connor>
<garnt> Honestly, if they came up me afterwards, </garnt>
<connor> - Of course you would. </connor>
<connor> - Or found me at the bar, I'd have been like... </connor>
<connor> I love talking, I don't know, </connor>
<garnt> moms are so fun to talk to at anime conventions. </garnt>
<connor> No, not in the hitting on way, just in general. </connor>
<connor> They're so fun, dude, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they don't give a fuck </connor>
<connor> and they're like, "I don't know what the fuck is happening, </connor>
<connor> but I'm the cool parent that was willing to come </connor>
<garnt> to the anime convention. </garnt>
<connor> - To be fair, it's at a signing, </connor>
<connor> and a mom or a dad comes with their son or daughter, </connor>
<connor> - They're always so chill. </connor>
<connor> - And they're like... Yeah, they're the best people also. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, they are pretty chill. </connor>
<connor> - See? Meilyne is trying to make it creepy. </connor>
<connor> It's not fucking creepy, Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> - It's 'cause you specifically said moms. </connor>
<connor> I love talking to parents at conventions. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like dads, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> - Give me all the moms. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, I've had like a... </connor>
<connor> Oh wait, I don't know if it comes up later. </connor>
<connor> I'll tell it later, </connor>
<connor> but basically there was this one guy I've had before, </connor>
<joey> like his kids really liked me and he was like, </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah, can I buy you dinner or something? </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, yeah, fucking sure, why not? </joey>
<joey> I'll talk to you, we'll hang out and be nice. </joey>
<garnt> And it was nice getting to know him and his kids, </garnt>
<garnt> so that was cool. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I've had the same things with dads as well. </joey>
<connor> - They're just cool, man. </connor>
<garnt> - If a dad's willing to get involved in this shit, </garnt>
<joey> then they're a cool fucking dad. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> - When that happens and they show passion </garnt>
<garnt> about what their kid is passionate about, </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's so fucking cool. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a good parent. </connor>
<connor> - I wish my parents did that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause my parents didn't do that, </connor>
<connor> and they would never do that to this day. </connor>
<connor> - I think the proudest mom I've ever seen, </connor>
<garnt> it was at AIX and we had signings, </garnt>
<garnt> and then two little kids come </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know, they were cute and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the mum looks at me </garnt>
<garnt> and she like sees my name and everything, </garnt>
<connor> and she goes, asked me in Thai, "Are you Thai?" </connor>
<connor> Then I reply in Thai and then we have this conversation, </connor>
<garnt> and she was just like, I am so fucking happy </garnt>
<garnt> that my kids are looking up to a Thai person. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you for representing the Thai people, </garnt>
<garnt> I am proud of you, thank you very much. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had the opposite once in Finland, </garnt>
<connor> where the mum was a big fan and the daughter had no idea. </connor>
<joey> Like the mom came up and was like, "Can you sign this?" </joey>
<joey> - God, I wish that was me. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> She was like, "Can you sign this?" </connor>
<joey> And I was like, yeah, sure, and I looked at the daughter </joey>
<joey> and I was like, okay, what's your name? </joey>
<connor> I looked at the daughter and I was like, what's your name? </connor>
<connor> And the mom was like, "No, no, no, it's me." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, Oh okay. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I feel like for Southeast Asian parents, right? </connor>
<connor> Anytime you talk to a Southeast Asian parent, </connor>
<connor> whenever you meet someone else who is the same race, </connor>
<connor> every Southeast Asian mother especially, </connor>
<connor> they go into Southeast Asian mum mode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So the first thing she legit asks me </connor>
<connor> after finding out I'm Thai and just, you know, </connor>
<connor> asking the basic questions, </connor>
<connor> is have you had any Thai food recently? 'Cause I can- </connor>
<connor> - You've gotta eat good Thai food, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you gotta have good Thai food, </connor>
<garnt> I could recommend you some places </garnt>
<connor> if you're missing some Thai food. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, dude, </connor>
<connor> honestly I'm like, thank you so much. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to take this advice to heart. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause honestly yes, I am missing Thai food. </connor>
<connor> I am missing home. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause also like moms or like parents have come up to me </connor>
<connor> and are like, do you want a water? </connor>
<connor> You look like you're tired. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, thank you, I'll take this. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you, that's so kind. </garnt>
<connor> - I've had a dad just slip me a $20, </connor>
<joey> being like, buy yourself a beer after this, </joey>
<connor> you're working real hard today, son. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, thanks man. </connor>
<garnt> - I had one time similar to that </garnt>
<garnt> but there is, actually, an old Patreon of mine met me </garnt>
<garnt> and her grandma came, </garnt>
<connor> and she must have been like 78, I'm not sure, </connor>
<connor> and she was just so impressed that I wrote in cursive. </connor>
<connor> She was like, in the most hick, </connor>
<connor> not hick, it was kinda like Midwestern, </connor>
<connor> kind of like, "Oh, you know, it's just not right. </connor>
<connor> They teach the kids here, </connor>
<connor> they don't teach them how to write cursive. </connor>
<connor> It's not right, I really like that </connor>
<connor> that you keep the old ways alive." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I'm just British. </connor>
<joey> I have no fucking clue what you guys are doing. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I don't know if it's that good </joey>
<joey> because no one can read my fucking handwriting. </joey>
<joey> So, I mean, honestly, what your kid's doing </joey>
<joey> is probably already pretty good actually. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, also the Stock image, </joey>
<connor> I actually found one that was fitting for this. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Pregnant lady with a gun. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] With the tiniest gun I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] That's like a... </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's like a BB gun. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] That's like a German pistol, </connor>
<connor> like World War Two, that looks like </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's like the spy gun </connor>
<connor> that they like hide in a purse, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, is this a scene </connor>
<joey> from like "Inglorious Bastards" or something? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] This is definitely a frame taken </joey>
<joey> from a Quentin Tarantino movie </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Uh, fuck, oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> This wasn't so much odd. </joey>
<joey> This wasn't being hit on but this is just a funny story </joey>
<joey> I wanted to tell. </joey>
<joey> So one time I was at a convention, </joey>
<joey> and I actually have this guy on Facebook still, </joey>
<joey> so he's really nice. </joey>
<garnt> But it was very strange and things kept adding on </garnt>
<garnt> and adding on, </garnt>
<garnt> where I went to it and they were like, okay... </garnt>
<garnt> When you go to a convention as a guest, </garnt>
<garnt> typically if it's a big convention, </garnt>
<garnt> you'll get like a handler. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like an assistant. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically someone who makes sure </garnt>
<garnt> that you turn up to your appointments on time, </garnt>
<garnt> and also if you need anything, </garnt>
<garnt> or like let's say you're signing things, </garnt>
<garnt> and you run out of sharpies. </garnt>
<connor> Like, can you give me a sharpy real quick? </connor>
<connor> They'll do stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> And the guy I had, he was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, my daughter's a big fan." </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, cool, cool that's awesome. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Would you mind saying hi to her?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, yeah, of course, of course, </connor>
<joey> like I'll hang out with him. </joey>
<joey> And then he was really nice and he helped me out a lot, </joey>
<connor> he always got me whatever I needed. </connor>
<connor> And then he was like, "Yeah, do you wanna come </connor>
<joey> for a family dinner with me and my family?" </joey>
<garnt> I was like, oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I felt like I had to say yes, </garnt>
<garnt> but I was like, oh sure, of course, I don't mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, this guy's helping you out right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, I literally had nothing better to do, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, yeah sure, why not? You've been real nice, </joey>
<joey> so I'd love to meet your family. </joey>
<connor> His family was like 12 kids or something. </connor>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - Half of them knew who I was, and half of them didn't care, </connor>
<connor> but it was like being in the middle of, </connor>
<garnt> was it "Half A Dozen"? What's that movie called? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck is that family movie called? </garnt>
<connor> - I know what you're talking about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - By the dozen, or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Something like that. </connor>
<connor> But it was really cool 'cause I think he was a foster parent </connor>
<garnt> or something and it was really cool, </garnt>
<joey> the story was really unique. </joey>
<joey> Not being hit on by the way, at all, quite the opposite, </joey>
<joey> I just thought it's a cool story to tell. </joey>
<joey> I just thought it was really odd </joey>
<joey> that I got like roped into this, </joey>
<garnt> and I was like, what is happening? </garnt>
<garnt> Why is there 12 kids? </garnt>
<joey> - All I can envision is that seen from "Annie", </joey>
<joey> where they're all eating on the really long table </joey>
<joey> and you're just in the middle. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm in the middle of these 12 kids </joey>
<joey> and I felt bad 'cause the dad was trying to talk to me, </joey>
<garnt> but obviously all the kids were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yo, it's the YouTuber!" They wanted my attention, </garnt>
<connor> and he kept asking me questions, </connor>
<garnt> and they could be like, "Do you pay taxes?" </garnt>
<garnt> Or something like that, and I'm like, well- </garnt>
<joey> - A four year old asking you is like, </joey>
<joey> are you avoiding taxes? </joey>
<joey> - Are you the IRS? Kids, no. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it was just really cool, </joey>
<joey> I felt it was a fun story. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh God. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Well, that was just a morbid Stock image. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] This is a hell of a Stock image. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I don't know why this was the Stock image. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Getty, why do you have this? </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes you just look at Stock images </connor>
<connor> and you think in what context </connor>
<connor> would someone want to use this? </connor>
<connor> - What was the direction they had when- </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I do think there is like a small market, </garnt>
<connor> a small market of Stock Image photographers </connor>
<garnt> that are like, I'm hoping this is gonna become a meme. </garnt>
<connor> I'm betting that this, I'm gonna take some meme photos </connor>
<connor> and hope that this becomes- </connor>
<connor> - They're all racing to be the next meme, right? </connor>
<connor> - To become the next jealous girlfriend meme guy, </connor>
<garnt> this is definitely giving me that energy right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. For sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, this is the unexpected, if you will. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me show you the Stock image first of all, </garnt>
<garnt> I have a good stock image. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Now that's a Tarantino shot right there. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] My cigar with the boys, we kidnapped somebody. </connor>
<garnt> So one time, like you said, </garnt>
<garnt> the daughters bring their mothers along. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And one time they were both really big fans, </garnt>
<joey> and I thought, well that's so fucking cool. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, I didn't really think much of it, </joey>
<garnt> like she was joking, being like </garnt>
<connor> she said I looked like Tom cruise, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I do not look like Tom cruise, </connor>
<connor> I look quite the opposite of Tom cruise. </connor>
<connor> - Is this basically every Reddit post </connor>
<connor> who has like a white guy with a beard, </connor>
<connor> and they're like that looks like Connor, that guy. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that's Connor man, the white beard checks out. </connor>
<joey> And then I was, oh okay, </joey>
<joey> and then they were like, are you're seeing anyone? </joey>
<connor> Like legit asked me this. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, the mom was on you? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the mom asked me that </connor>
<connor> while I'm signing the daughter's autograph. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, Oh, not really. </connor>
<connor> She was like, "Oh, okay, do you wanna get a drink later?" </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, ah, </garnt>
<connor> and I was like, yeah, sure, sure, sure, </connor>
<connor> thinking like this isn't serious. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Found out later she was very serious, </connor>
<garnt> and she was very disappointed </garnt>
<garnt> that we didn't have that drink. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I thought it was joking. </connor>
<connor> - You basically stood her up. </connor>
<connor> - You stood up a MILF, Connor? </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not proud to say it. </garnt>
<connor> - The world is gonna end tomorrow. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not proud to say, but yeah I did. </connor>
<connor> - Connor, I had expected better from you. </connor>
<connor> - I believe it was a single mother as well, actually. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's like your fantasy </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> The thing with MILF porn, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You see, you don't see the kids, </garnt>
<garnt> so that's a big plus, right? </garnt>
<connor> I don't wanna fucking know about the kids, </connor>
<connor> don't tell me about the kids, </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna get involved. </garnt>
<connor> What's wrong Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] So what if they call, </connor>
<garnt> if you get married and they have to call you dad? </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor exclaiming) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so gross. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, some people are into the daddy thing, right? </joey>
<connor> - No, it's the fantasy. </connor>
<connor> Listen, the problem with the whole MILF dynamic in real life </connor>
<joey> is there are a lot of hurdles </joey>
<joey> that make it very uncomfortable and very awkward. </joey>
<joey> - I would feel so sorry for the fucking daughter. </joey>
<joey> Imagine being a fan- </joey>
<joey> - I felt sorry for the daughter as well. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine being a fan of a YouTuber </joey>
<connor> and then they become your dad, </connor>
<connor> let's just think about that for a second. </connor>
<connor> - That is like a visual novel in the making. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He was my favorite YouTuber, but now he's my dad? </connor>
<connor> But actually it was the daughter </connor>
<garnt> that ended up being like, oh, I'm sorry, </garnt>
<connor> my mom just gets carried away sometimes. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, your mom's on the prowl next to you, with her? </connor>
<connor> What's going on? </connor>
<joey> What kind of dynamic are you guys using? </joey>
<joey> - Your mom's in cougar mode. </joey>
<connor> - You guys are real close to be like scouting out </connor>
<joey> the prey with each other, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Her mom's like, yo, become my wing-woman </joey>
<joey> - That's what it was, it was like a wing-man. It was crazy. </joey>
<joey> - That's nuts. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Domestic boyfriend. </joey>
<connor> - Domestic boyfriend. - Domestic boyfriend. </connor>
<connor> - It's like love triangles, </connor>
<connor> you know, in a porno or a hentai, </connor>
<connor> it's very attractive in the hentai, </connor>
<connor> but you realize in real life, fuck, it's a nightmare. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's messy as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - If you have anything like that, it never ends well. </connor>
<connor> - And that was definitely unexpected, that's for sure. </connor>
<connor> - That was the unexpected. </connor>
<connor> I actually got hit on, on "Overwatch" one time. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah? </connor>
<connor> - That was fun. - [Joey] How so? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, someone recognized who I was and then I added them, </connor>
<garnt> I started playing with them, </garnt>
<joey> and then just casually started inquiring </joey>
<joey> about my love life and stuff, and that's normal. </joey>
<connor> - Were they like role playing or anything like that? </connor>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - At which part of your career was this in? </connor>
<connor> - Which part of the career? When did "Overwatch" come out? </connor>
<garnt> It was like literally three four months </garnt>
<joey> into "Overwatch" being released. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, okay. - Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That was a while ago then. </garnt>
<joey> - That was like four or five years ago? </joey>
<garnt> - Yikes, I'm old. </garnt>
<connor> Whenever "Overwatch" came out, this happened, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I remember it just being a bit awkward </connor>
<garnt> because they kept asking, </garnt>
<garnt> like when someone normally inquires about your love life </garnt>
<garnt> an a bit of uncomfortable amount </garnt>
<connor> when you don't really know them, which is fine, </connor>
<connor> I mean you can ask me about that, I'm pretty open about it, </connor>
<garnt> I never mind talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But then when you proceed to ask me the next step, </garnt>
<joey> it's like you live in Norway, </joey>
<connor> I don't know, it's kind of far, </connor>
<garnt> I don't even know what's in Norway. </garnt>
<connor> There's no benefits to getting married to someone in Norway, </connor>
<garnt> I'm joking, I'm joking. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, and then this is uh, yeah, this is it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh this is almost what it was like </garnt>
<joey> at the urinal for me. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] So when we see each other at the urinal, </garnt>
<connor> or, you know, how do I say urinal? </connor>
<connor> - Urinal. - Urinal. </connor>
<connor> - Is that what Americans say? </connor>
<garnt> - No, that's what the British say, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, we say urinals. </garnt>
<garnt> - Urinal. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought the British said urinal? </joey>
<joey> - No, Americans say urinal. </joey>
<connor> - I've never heard someone say urinal before. </connor>
<joey> - I've said urinal. </joey>
<joey> - I've only heard British people say urinal. </joey>
<garnt> - You know what? I get confused on what words I'm saying, </garnt>
<garnt> on British and American, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause people constantly correct me. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though I know I'm not wrong, </garnt>
<connor> but they say, why does he say it like that? </connor>
<connor> And then I ended up unconsciously changing it. </connor>
<connor> So I go back to the UK and now everyone mocks me </connor>
<garnt> for sounding American. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't even know what, like sometimes I say a word </garnt>
<connor> and I don't even know if that's said in a British way </connor>
<connor> or an American way anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's it. </connor>
<connor> That's this power point presentation, boom, done, thank you. </connor>
<connor> - That was a hell of a presentation, </connor>
<connor> thank you for your Ted talk, sir. </connor>
<connor> - Thanks guys. </connor>
<garnt> Why aren't you clapping Meilyne? </garnt>
<connor> Clap louder, Meilyne, I couldn't hear you. </connor>
<garnt> - What lessons did we learn? </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor's fans are fucking weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you are a woman above the age of 35? </garnt>
<garnt> - 35, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that what you think my demo is? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. - I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just like older than me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that what you think it is? You are correct. </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, you can see- </garnt>
<garnt> - How old are you at right now, 24? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm 24, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so late 20s </garnt>
<garnt> - Twenty four and a half year olds are gonna be like, Ooh. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm in the zone. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Some people age like wine, man, they age better, man. </connor>
<garnt> They get more attractive. </garnt>
<connor> Why are you laughing, Meilyne? It's true though. </connor>
<garnt> It's true. - Yeah, it's true </garnt>
<garnt> - Some people, you see pictures of like, </garnt>
<garnt> you see them when they're younger, like celebrities, </garnt>
<joey> you see them when the older and you're like, </joey>
<garnt> holy shit, he's 50 but he's hotter than he ever was. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right? </connor>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, to me it's like, as long as the mindset is there </connor>
<joey> that you're in my world and you're on the same </joey>
<connor> wavelength of thinking and you treat life the same way, </connor>
<joey> I don't give a fuck about your age. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like some people- </connor>
<garnt> - As long as you're hot. </garnt>
<connor> - I just don't want you to be younger than me, </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna fucking date someone younger. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like some people just hit a certain age </garnt>
<garnt> and then they just stop giving a shit about how they look </garnt>
<connor> and taking care of themselves, right? </connor>
<connor> Or alternatively, they just think they can get away </connor>
<connor> with the lifestyle they had in their 20s, </connor>
<garnt> and just bring that to like the- </garnt>
<connor> - 40s and 50s. </connor>
<connor> - Their entire 30s, 40s and 50s. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause, you know, I think being 30 now, </connor>
<joey> as the only 30 year old, </joey>
<joey> I've heard that being 30 is just basically being 20 </joey>
<joey> with one debuff. </joey>
<joey> - And shit blood. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and shit blood, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And yeah, I mean, I feel like some people do age </connor>
<connor> like fucking fine wine, </connor>
<joey> and a lot of Asians just don't age at all, </joey>
<joey> I guess until they've reached like this cap, </joey>
<joey> and then they just start aging like crazy. </joey>
<connor> - And then they're like, oh, we have to age, oh okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, also going back to the naming me after a baby, </connor>
<joey> it wasn't an insult by the way, </joey>
<joey> I just wanna make sure that's clear. </joey>
<joey> I don't think that's like a bad thing, </joey>
<joey> it just looked very intense, just quite a lot. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I've never heard any other story like that. </connor>
<connor> - It's so overwhelming that you're like, </connor>
<connor> which emotion do I take away from this? </connor>
<garnt> - I put myself in your shoes and the biggest, like, </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm like trying to be like POV, </garnt>
<garnt> you are Connor holding a baby that's named after you. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, how do I even- </garnt>
<garnt> - Cue the pump music. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - How do I even manage what to say right now? </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't even know how to react. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a mixture of overwhelming flattery, </garnt>
<garnt> overwhelming, like what the fuck, are you sure about this? </garnt>
<garnt> Are you sure about that? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, is this a mistake? </garnt>
<garnt> Are you gonna regret this? 'Cause I'm not all that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What else did we take away </garnt>
<garnt> from the power point presentation boys? </garnt>
<garnt> What did you learn today? </garnt>
<garnt> - You get hit on a lot. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, it's actually... You know what? </connor>
<connor> - You get hit on a lot. </connor>
<connor> - So my audience has gone from, as we know, 93%, </connor>
<connor> recently it went to like 60% male. </connor>
<connor> - It's cause of all the Jojo shit you've been doing. </connor>
<connor> - Jojo, I think also there was a good amount of time </connor>
<garnt> where, I think because of my thumbnails, </garnt>
<garnt> because the topics I was covering, </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube just didn't recommend me to guys, </garnt>
<garnt> and now it's suddenly started being like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh wait, guys can watch this guy too. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I started getting a massive influx of guy views </garnt>
<garnt> that I never had before, </garnt>
<garnt> and I stopped doing as much yowie stuff </garnt>
<connor> and slowed down on that. </connor>
<garnt> But, I mean, it's still like nearly, </garnt>
<garnt> it depends on the month, </garnt>
<connor> like depending on the videos I make. </connor>
<joey> It's about 50, 50 now, which is nice, </joey>
<connor> and it's slowed down a lot. </connor>
<connor> But there's ups and downsides, right? </connor>
<connor> Like it was mainly... I know that I spoke about, </connor>
<connor> mainly it was girls coming up to me </connor>
<garnt> but, dude, guys hit on me just as much. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've had that one as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Which was flattering, 'cause there was like one dude </connor>
<connor> who was in my Instagram message request, </connor>
<connor> the man was fucking ripped as fuck, </connor>
<garnt> and I was like, wow, I'm very flattered. </garnt>
<garnt> This man had like the body of a Greek statue </garnt>
<garnt> and this man thought I was worthy of being hit on. </garnt>
<joey> I was very flattered. </joey>
<joey> - I'm jealous. </joey>
<connor> - Right? I was like, damn. </connor>
<joey> But yeah, I mean, it's whatever, it's just fucking YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, what I can take about this </garnt>
<garnt> is that if there is going to be an avenue, </garnt>
<garnt> not necessarily to be hit on, </garnt>
<garnt> but for someone to get in contact with you, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I would say half of these were just, you know, </garnt>
<joey> the fan interactions </joey>
<garnt> or people trying to get in contact with you. </garnt>
<garnt> If there's an avenue, people are gonna find a way, </garnt>
<garnt> and I've definitely felt that as YouTuber as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, you can hit on me, </garnt>
<garnt> it's very flattering, I don't care. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't have to stop doing it, just not be creepy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just do it in a sophisticated way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah man, you do it sleek, </garnt>
<connor> I'll be like, thank you for the ego boost. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go away feeling great, and who doesn't? </connor>
<connor> Dude, you get hit on you're like, damn I'm a 10. </connor>
<connor> And then you go back to your hotel room </connor>
<joey> and eat a whole bag of flaming hot Cheetos, </joey>
<connor> and realize you're truly a five. </connor>
<connor> - And also, on the opposite end, taking this advice </connor>
<joey> for any young budding YouTubers out there, </joey>
<joey> tread carefully with fans hitting on you. </joey>
<joey> - Don't fuck your fans, man. It never works out. </joey>
<garnt> - Listen, you know, it might work out one tenth of the time, </garnt>
<garnt> but the problem is that- </garnt>
<connor> - But are you willing to take the risk? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's a risk- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you have to be really careful, </connor>
<connor> and I think the biggest problem </connor>
<connor> is that whenever you're like a YouTuber starting out, </connor>
<connor> especially when you're a small YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> I feel like this is more a message to small YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who don't have the experience, </connor>
<connor> or don't think they're gonna get big, </connor>
<connor> because you don't fucking know </connor>
<joey> if you're gonna get big, right? </joey>
<joey> But you should treat the fans, </joey>
<connor> or you should treat your audience, </connor>
<connor> no matter how big you are, exactly the same. </connor>
<connor> And stay grounded. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, I'm sure there's cringy messages out there </connor>
<joey> of me hitting on someone at 19 that would just embarrass me. </joey>
<connor> But, again, I'm 19, you know, just fucking delete it. </connor>
<connor> - But like, you're like kind of- </connor>
<connor> - It wasn't like I hit on fans and be like, send me nudes, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It was just like me being an average 19 year old, basically. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, when you're younger </connor>
<connor> you don't really have the senses </connor>
<connor> to know what exactly is cringe or not. </connor>
<connor> - Also when you're younger, you're just horny as fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you think you can get away with being horny, </garnt>
<garnt> and you grow up and you realize, man, </garnt>
<garnt> I did a lot of stupid shit back then. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, young, dumb, and full of cum, as they say. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lovely, Joey. Words to live by. </garnt>
<joey> But I mean, it's like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause there's some people, </joey>
<joey> you know, there's a lot of YouTubers out there </joey>
<joey> who are very openly happy to admit that they date fans. </joey>
<joey> They're like, well, you know, </joey>
<connor> normal famous celebrities get to fuck their fans </connor>
<joey> and no one bats an eye, and it's like, well- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that double standard propagated, and it's true. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but the reason why, </joey>
<garnt> this is the way I interpret it and the why that's the case, </garnt>
<garnt> that normal celebrities they don't bank on the fact </garnt>
<garnt> of relatability, they don't bank on the fact of being- </garnt>
<joey> - They're like people above the clouds. </joey>
<joey> - Like every pop star is supposed to be like a character, </joey>
<joey> like an absurd kind of, not real person, right? </joey>
<joey> They never pretend to be your friend, </joey>
<garnt> they never like pretend to give a shit about you, </garnt>
<connor> and if you have sex with them </connor>
<connor> they probably don't give about it, right? </connor>
<connor> Maybe, maybe it's just a joke. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, if you do it with an influencer, right? </connor>
<garnt> Ugh, a gross word, or a YouTuber, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate that word, influencer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Influencer. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess it's almost kind of a betrayal </garnt>
<garnt> of what you built up which is like a lot of the people </garnt>
<garnt> who watch us, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, I don't know if you guys know, </garnt>
<garnt> you guys feel this way, </garnt>
<garnt> like you form like a bit of a bond, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where you respect the creator and you look up to them </garnt>
<garnt> and you enjoy their stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> and you feel a lot closer to a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> than you would a normal celebrity. </garnt>
<garnt> And so it's that that's being taken advantage of. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, it's because most of YouTubers are more, </connor>
<connor> I guess, grounded, right? And feel more real, </connor>
<joey> so when you do watch them, you're just like, </joey>
<connor> oh, this is an actual person I'm watching. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I would say the right way to go about it </connor>
<connor> if you're going to get involved with your fans, </connor>
<connor> one of the biggest things is you don't do it straight away. </connor>
<connor> Like you need to treat them- </connor>
<connor> - Start as a friend. </connor>
<connor> - Start as a friend, treat them like a human being, </connor>
<connor> get to know each other first, </connor>
<connor> like any normal fucking relationship </connor>
<garnt> - You need to immediately like break down or disassemble </garnt>
<joey> any power dynamic in play, of like fan, YouTuber, </joey>
<joey> you put yourself on equal footing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and with stuff like one night stands or something, </joey>
<joey> that gets so messy, </joey>
<joey> and there's no way to like differentiate </joey>
<joey> is there a power dynamic there? </joey>
<joey> - Is the person gonna do this </joey>
<joey> and then, you know, regret it afterwards and just... </joey>
<joey> It's too messy to be able to justify, I feel, </joey>
<connor> and there is a right way to go about it and- </connor>
<joey> - There's lots of ways to go about it, </joey>
<joey> but most of the time it's like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> do you wanna diffuse a bomb? </garnt>
<garnt> If you know how to, and you wanna do that, go ahead. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a right way to do it </connor>
<connor> but it's not worth the risk most of the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but is it worth- </connor>
<garnt> - Is it worth the risk? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not worth the risk. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're literally blowing yourself up in terms of career. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, is it worth it? Or you could just, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> do what everyone else fucking does in the world, </garnt>
<connor> and just date normally. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like a lot of smaller YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> they don't really think about this </connor>
<connor> because they think I've got nothing to lose, </connor>
<connor> so I'm just gonna do this right now while I can. </connor>
<connor> Because you grow up in a culture where, yeah, </connor>
<garnt> you do see, you know, celebrities and like groupies </garnt>
<garnt> sleeping with, you know, music artists </garnt>
<connor> and everything like that, and you think, man, </connor>
<connor> that sounds like an awesome lifestyle, </connor>
<connor> I kind of want that lifestyle. </connor>
<connor> So when they get like a smidgen of that </connor>
<connor> they think I gotta take advantage of this </connor>
<connor> while I still can. </connor>
<garnt> - The rock and roll lifestyle works if you're in that field, </garnt>
<joey> the rock and roll lifestyle is not the YouTuber lifestyle, </joey>
<joey> it's two completely different things, I find. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. it's tough, it's so tough, </connor>
<connor> and it's not even worth like getting into, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I feel like to get involved in this, </connor>
<connor> you are literally navigating a minefield. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, 100%. </connor>
<joey> It's like if you really wanna do it, you can do it, </joey>
<joey> but the reason why I think most YouTubers will say </joey>
<joey> don't fuck your fans is because it's just like </joey>
<joey> it's so much risk you're taking on for no reason. </joey>
<joey> And to me it's like, do you really want someone </joey>
<joey> who wants to be with you for your videos? </joey>
<connor> Why is that attractive? </connor>
<garnt> - They're looking at you only for the content you make. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me it's a competitive mindset. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me, that's like a massive turnoff. </garnt>
<garnt> If they're only with me because of my content, </garnt>
<garnt> then that's like... </garnt>
<joey> The same thing, if you're only my friends for my content </joey>
<connor> then you can't be my friend, </connor>
<connor> because that's not how I would see a friend, </connor>
<connor> the same way that's how I wouldn't see a possible partner </connor>
<joey> or anything like that. </joey>
<joey> - That's like saying like, oh, so if I change my content </joey>
<connor> then you're suddenly not my friend. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - There is no bigger turn on, right? </joey>
<garnt> Than meeting someone who just likes you for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sitting there thinking like, </garnt>
<garnt> how the fuck am I supposed to be into this, </garnt>
<joey> and then like get my dick hard when all I'm thinking about, </joey>
<joey> you're thinking is like, what's the next upload gonna be? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? Like, fuck that. </joey>
<connor> No, I want someone who speaks to me, </connor>
<garnt> knows nothing about YouTube, and is like, holy shit, </garnt>
<connor> this guy's fucking cool, I like him, he's so nice. </connor>
<garnt> - You want people to see you as Connor not CdDawgVA. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, which obviously I made a bit difficult for myself, </connor>
<connor> obviously, but I can still go about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't wanna be with a girl, be in bed and be like, </garnt>
<connor> yo, if you enjoyed that session, hit the subscribe, </connor>
<connor> and click the like button. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - If we get to 5,000 likes, I'll do round two. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I want video a YouTube video of someone trying to do that. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like... Oh my God, yeah, </connor>
<connor> there's just so many douche-tubers out there </connor>
<connor> who do shit like that. </connor>
<connor> - There are. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure there's YouTubers out there </connor>
<connor> who will just admit every single fucking day, </connor>
<connor> like, yeah, I fucked my fans so what? </connor>
<connor> I mean, screw them. But if you wanna have like, you know- </connor>
<joey> - If you wanna be respected by the community </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, if you wanna be seen as like a role model, </joey>
<connor> I don't know what that is. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, like douche-tubers, </joey>
<connor> I feel, just exist on a different plane of existence </connor>
<connor> where, I don't know how they function or, you know- </connor>
<connor> - I just want YouTubers to have a better rep, right? </connor>
<connor> Like not all of us are fucking psychopath, uh, </connor>
<connor> validating chasing, - Money hungry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, a lot of us are horny motherfuckers and that's just- </connor>
<connor> - That's just human nature. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of us are horny but we do it the right way. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - "Mother Knows Breasts" on Blu-ray, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - We are three horny guys, but at least we're horny on main, </garnt>
<garnt> and we keep to being horny on main </garnt>
<garnt> and that's pretty much it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> - A part of me is glad, </garnt>
<connor> is that I have YouTube to keep me in check almost, </connor>
<connor> not that I would start doing awful shit </connor>
<garnt> if I wasn't a YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> But the fact that there is this kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> obvious moral lines that it's not like, </garnt>
<connor> oh no, man, should I do.., No, it's not. </connor>
<connor> - They're like these unspoken guidelines and rules </connor>
<connor> to like, make sure you're not overstepping. </connor>
<connor> - Being an ass, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It really makes me cautious about how I come off to people </connor>
<garnt> and what I say to people, it makes me way more conscious </garnt>
<garnt> about how I speak in a way that I think is... </garnt>
<joey> You know, the way I speak on live streams, </joey>
<joey> the way I speak, you know, on the video </joey>
<garnt> is how I'll speak to most people in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I like that it's kind of taught me, in a way, </garnt>
<garnt> to just be, it sounds awful, right? </garnt>
<connor> But just give a shit about everything and pay attention </connor>
<connor> even if it is draining at times. </connor>
<connor> It sounds awful, I'm like, you should have taught me </connor>
<connor> to be not an asshole. </connor>
<connor> But like, you know how some things you take for granted </connor>
<joey> when you're an individual who isn't like a open person. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, for me, </garnt>
<garnt> it didn't teach me to give a shit about everything, </garnt>
<garnt> but it did teach me to really question my own values. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's a better way of putting it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and really justify, is this value I hold right? </garnt>
<garnt> As opposed to like, I'll just think about, </garnt>
<garnt> I just think of it this way, </garnt>
<garnt> because I grew up in that kind of environment, </garnt>
<garnt> and it really made me self reflect. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like that is like a healthy part of YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've become a better person because of YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's about that mentality of like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, if I wasn't doing YouTube, then are the things </garnt>
<garnt> that I do and the way that I talk to people </garnt>
<connor> and that kind stuff, </connor>
<connor> would that be still considered respectful to other people, </connor>
<joey> regardless of if I had this job or not. </joey>
<connor> Would I still be a good person if I didn't have YouTube? </connor>
<connor> And if the answer is yes, </connor>
<garnt> then I think if you're following it right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Very worrying if the answer is no. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Well, I mean, you know, look at all the douche-tubers, </garnt>
<garnt> apparently you can get away with that shit </garnt>
<garnt> if you have a YouTube channel. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, do they get away with that shit though? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, there's a reason why they have an audience. </garnt>
<connor> - They're on borrowed time. </connor>
<garnt> - Are they looking at tweet longer, waiting to happen? </garnt>
<garnt> - They're not gonna be at the point that they are </garnt>
<garnt> for very long </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I feel like a big, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, this is getting to a really deep topic now, </garnt>
<garnt> but a big problem with a lot of these like apology videos, </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know, a lot of this kind of culture </garnt>
<garnt> that has been built up, I understand where it comes from, </garnt>
<garnt> where we do need to keep each other in check </garnt>
<garnt> and make sure that people aren't abusing their power. </garnt>
<garnt> But a part of it just makes me feel like, man, </garnt>
<garnt> people are just treating this like one big reality TV show. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's not keeping each other check, </garnt>
<garnt> we've just made it a modern Coliseum. </garnt>
<garnt> - We just gamified it basically. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you know, we can't kill each other, </connor>
<connor> this is the best thing we can do, </connor>
<garnt> is fucking get at each other's throats online. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, which is why now when I see an apology video </connor>
<connor> or a tweet longer, you know, </connor>
<connor> a lot of like, as we said, </connor>
<joey> we were taught to have to give a shit about this thing </joey>
<garnt> but sometimes I see this and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have the energy to care about this, </garnt>
<garnt> this doesn't involve me. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, sometimes it fucking sucks </garnt>
<garnt> when I hear about, you know, some person in the community </garnt>
<garnt> or in some community that I'm not even involved in, </garnt>
<garnt> having like a 50 page dissertation </garnt>
<connor> breaking down every shitty thing they've done. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I'm sorry that this happened, </connor>
<garnt> but at the same time, like I don't have the energy </garnt>
<connor> to invest myself into this. </connor>
<garnt> Can someone literally give me a cliff note </garnt>
<connor> of what's going on? </connor>
<connor> And like, I don't want to be the guy </connor>
<connor> to be like can you tell me what to think? </connor>
<connor> But there reaches a point </connor>
<garnt> where there's too much happening right now that you can- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like sensory overload of drama. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just like, at the end of the day </garnt>
<connor> all I'm seeing is someone's getting fucking paid leave, </connor>
<connor> that's all I'm seeing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's like I have limited time, I have limited energy, </joey>
<connor> and I wanna be able to use it </connor>
<connor> on shit I actually care about. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would like to care about every big scandal, </garnt>
<garnt> every big thing that gets brought up on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know, that's, logically, </garnt>
<connor> and if I would think about it that's what I want to value, </connor>
<connor> but logistically you can't. </connor>
<connor> You can't care about this much shit, </connor>
<connor> and I feel like a big problem right now </connor>
<connor> is that this entire environment </connor>
<connor> just feels like "Big Brother", </connor>
<connor> or this feels like a reality TV show </connor>
<connor> where people care, but do they really care? </connor>
<connor> Like it gets to a point where, does this really... </connor>
<connor> Where I think, does this is really involve me, </connor>
<connor> you know, am I doing something right to society </connor>
<garnt> by getting involved with this, </garnt>
<joey> or am I just feeding the fumes and the fire </joey>
<joey> and just making the environment more toxic? </joey>
<joey> - If you have thick enough skin, nothing's stopping you. </joey>
<garnt> If you don't care that everyone hates you, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're fine with that, </garnt>
<garnt> then there's literally nothing stopping you </garnt>
<connor> from succeeding on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's people who make a career </connor>
<connor> off of being hated. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, plenty. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, one of the biggest examples, </connor>
<garnt> is of course, Logan Paul. </garnt>
<connor> I can't remember who said this quote </connor>
<garnt> but I think it was like Muhammad Ali or a boxer, </garnt>
<garnt> where they said something like, </garnt>
<connor> if people will pay to like... What was it? </connor>
<connor> People will pay to shut you up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, people will pay to watch you get punched </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, watch you get punched, </connor>
<connor> or watch you shut the fuck up, </connor>
<connor> something along those lines. </connor>
<connor> And man, Logan Paul has capitalized that to the max. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I'll fucking admit, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I got involved with whenever Logan Paul </garnt>
<garnt> gets into a boxing match </garnt>
<garnt> - I watched the boxing matches, of course I did, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna see Logan Paul get punched a bunch. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just funny, you know? </garnt>
<joey> I mean, I don't really have anything personally </joey>
<connor> against the guy, obviously, </connor>
<joey> but it's just fun seeing two YouTubers </joey>
<joey> smack each other in the face. </joey>
<joey> This shit's funny as fuck. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I'd do that if the right target came up. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yo, how much money did he make? </connor>
<joey> Put me in the ring, give me some beef, please. </joey>
<connor> - Give me some beef to fight over. </connor>
<joey> - Pay per view, anyone? </joey>
<joey> - It's scary. </joey>
<connor> Scary how it's evolved to that point, isn't it? </connor>
<garnt> It makes you wonder what the next step is. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're going back to where we started, </garnt>
<joey> where, you know, when reality is this entertaining, </joey>
<joey> who the fuck needs TV? </joey>
<garnt> - That's what I've been saying the whole time gone, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> Reality has always been more entertaining. </garnt>
<connor> - Documentaries are the new movies. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, man, you can't make this shit up, man. </connor>
<connor> You can make up all these "Harry Potters" </connor>
<joey> and "Lord Of The Rings", that's epic and all, </joey>
<joey> I love those films but you can't make up the weird shit </joey>
<joey> that happens in real life. </joey>
<joey> And that's been "Trash Taste". </joey>
<joey> But you know what hasn't been "Trash Taste"? </joey>
<joey> Without us reading the Patreons, </joey>
<connor> that didn't make any sense. </connor>
<connor> - That made no sense at all. </connor>
<connor> I was like, where are you going with this? </connor>
<joey> - Let's do it, "Trash Taste" Patreon, woo! </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, look at all these Patreons. </connor>
<connor> - They love him. </connor>
<connor> - This guy has giga-brain, giga monkey brain. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Hey, if you'd like to join the Patreon, </connor>
<joey> then as always, go to patreon.com/trashtaste, </joey>
