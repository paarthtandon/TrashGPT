<connor> don't forget to comment, like, subscribe, </connor>
<connor> 'cause today, we're gonna be reviewing </connor>
<connor> the windows installer. </connor>
<joey> (music mimics) </joey>
<joey> - What's up Mike Wazowski enthusiast? </joey>
<connor> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - My favorite, Mike Wazowski. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you're all Mike
Wazowski enthusiasts. </connor>
<joey> I'm your host, Joey </joey>
<joey> and with me is Garnt and Connor. </joey>
<joey> You know who we are. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow, that was just like, </garnt>
<joey> let's just jump right into it. </joey>
<joey> - No wasting time. You
guys know who we are. </joey>
<joey> We're fucking, how many episodes? </joey>
<joey> 25 at this point, 26? </joey>
<joey> - Don't remind me man. </joey>
<joey> - I don't even know.
- It's just 25 I believe. </joey>
<joey> - I saw a brilliant comment, </joey>
<connor> I think it was on episode
21 or 22 or something- </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- That said... </connor>
<connor> The top comment was like, </connor>
<garnt> "How has it already been 22 episodes? </garnt>
<garnt> It still feels like episode four." </garnt>
<connor> - No, I totally agree. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember how
many episodes it was ago </connor>
<joey> where I was like, "Yeah,
were just like a month </joey>
<joey> into this really."
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And it was like episode 18 or something. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember you said that was like </connor>
<joey> that math don't add up. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> - 18 Weeks in a month, you know? </connor>
<connor> That's what it felt like this year. </connor>
<connor> Fucking hell.
- Oh my God! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but what are we
gonna talk about today lads? </joey>
<connor> - Well, this is the YouTuber episode, </connor>
<joey> so we're gonna discuss some
of our favorite Youtubers </joey>
<connor> and just generally discuss
Youtubers that we watch </connor>
<connor> and the ones that we wanna talk about. </connor>
<garnt> - Basically we just simping
over other content creators. </garnt>
<joey> - Your favorite Youtuber's
favorite Youtuber. </joey>
<connor> Who is it?
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> Who is it gonna be? </joey>
<connor> - Still wanna bear in mind
that we've said this before, </connor>
<joey> but sometimes people forget it. </joey>
<connor> They have to come here
to be on the podcast, </connor>
<connor> no exceptions. </connor>
<joey> - I love all the comments that are like, </joey>
<joey> "But they have a TV? </joey>
<joey> You can just get them on a Skype call." </joey>
<connor> - The thing about this, </connor>
<connor> we can talk about the Calli episode now, </connor>
<connor> cause that's out.
- Now that's it's out. </connor>
<connor> - And all the speculation
that they were like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, she's just gonna
appear on the TV, right?" </garnt>
<garnt> - And then we just fucking dunk on them </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, "JK, she's right here." </garnt>
<connor> - Calli was indeed there. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I don't know
if we actually prefaced </joey>
<connor> in that episode because it's
been like what, four weeks. </connor>
<connor> As of us recording this
then it came out, but, yeah. </connor>
<connor> For people who are wondering, </connor>
<connor> she was physically sitting
right here as well. </connor>
<connor> - Calli that is. </connor>
<connor> - Calli was, yes.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Meilyne he looking at me it's like I... </connor>
<connor> We signed an NDA.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we just want to preference that, </connor>
<joey> like she was actually here. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we can say we
signed an NDA, right? </connor>
<connor> Okay, we signed an NDA. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's pretty obvious </joey>
<joey> that we would have had to sign an NDA. </joey>
<joey> - Is there an NDA on us signing an NDA? </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna make sure
what's the NDA level? </connor>
<connor> How many NDAs do you (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> - We can't disclose that
we've signed an NDA. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] You can't
say how it was filmed. </joey>
<connor> - You can't say how it was done, </connor>
<joey> but you guys know how it was done. </joey>
<connor> It's pretty obvious how it was done. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we did it.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> We did it, we nailed it. </joey>
<connor> - But I've had two hell
weeks back to back. </connor>
<garnt> - Man, you have had the worst
fucking experience on YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> - I know. Since this is
a YouTube related thing, </connor>
<connor> so we will jump into the
Youtubers after this, </connor>
<connor> but-
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So on the convention
horror story episode, </connor>
<connor> which is episode 23 I believe. </connor>
<connor> - 22. </connor>
<connor> - Was it 22?
- Yes. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, wow! </garnt>
<connor> Okay, well that- </connor>
<garnt> - I don't remember the episode numbers. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, that episode we recorded. </connor>
<connor> I spoke about getting
hired to do the Samsung ad, </connor>
<connor> and were like, "He-he that's
funny, I got undercharged." </connor>
<connor> Turned out it was not he-he funny </connor>
<connor> because the company fucking
struck my video down. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it was just, oh my God! </connor>
<connor> It was almost worst that
they replied to our emails. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because normally you just, if it's Sony </connor>
<connor> or it's a giant music company- </connor>
<garnt> - To explain, they contents
claimed your video, </garnt>
<connor> am I correct? </connor>
<connor> So they gave you a copyright strike. </connor>
<connor> They copystriked your video, right? </connor>
<joey> - And we copystriked Sea Dogs in the ad. </joey>
<connor> - And normally, like as a Youtuber, </connor>
<connor> especially when you've done like from... </connor>
<connor> Especially someone in my position </connor>
<connor> if you just used anime footage, </connor>
<connor> copyright strikes aren't
anything new for me. </connor>
<connor> But the normal thing I do </connor>
<connor> is like reply to them being like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, this is fair use and everything." </connor>
<connor> And 90% of the time, </connor>
<connor> they just don't reply.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because they're Japanese companies, </connor>
<connor> they don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> So I've never dealt with
a copystrike situation- </connor>
<connor> - Were they have replied. </connor>
<connor> - Where they've just back to back. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm actually...
(Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - I almost wished they didn't, </joey>
<joey> because like, "Oh my God!" </joey>
<joey> - It must be hell. </joey>
<connor> - It was like this... </connor>
<connor> I've never had a more rude company. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I don't expect
them to be nice to me, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they don't owe me anything. </connor>
<joey> But just being polite would be nice. </joey>
<joey> - You've had some seriously
bad luck with (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> I mean like the whole ultra- </joey>
<joey> - All of my videos have
been claimed twice, </joey>
<joey> so I lost a lot of money on that. </joey>
<joey> And then this one obviously happened. </joey>
<joey> But this one was just frustrating </joey>
<joey> because they hired me. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So the ad that I'm voicing
in, they struck me for it. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And that reasoning was
because I showed the footage </joey>
<joey> and in my Fiverr gig that
where they hired me, right? </joey>
<joey> So the video was for, </joey>
<joey> for people who don't know, </joey>
<joey> I was doing a video where
it was a Fiverr seller </joey>
<joey> and I was a voice actor, and
on my Fiverr gig I said like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, anything you order
will be used in the video." </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I was like, "Hey man, you guys know </joey>
<joey> that I was gonna use this. </joey>
<joey> One, you should have told me. </joey>
<joey> Can you at least give me the..." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause this was
misunderstanding and whatever. </joey>
<connor> Give me a chance to remove the footage, </connor>
<connor> because on YouTube you can
actually edit the video live, </connor>
<connor> so you can actually remove stuff. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we we'll.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We all know this, right? </connor>
<connor> So I was saying like, "Hey,
just remove this strike, </connor>
<connor> it takes one button </connor>
<connor> and I'll get rid of the
copyright stuff right away." </connor>
<connor> - All right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Like clearly this is not a big deal, </connor>
<connor> let's just sort this out. </connor>
<connor> And their response was
like, "We're too busy." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And bear in mind, it is one button. </connor>
<connor> It is one button to
remove the strike, right? </connor>
<joey> - But it's the button
that's just so far away. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They replied with
something along the lines of, </connor>
<connor> "We have so many projects going
on, we're extremely busy." </connor>
<connor> Bear in mind, our email chain
is like 20 fucking emails. </connor>
<connor> We've got a huge... </connor>
<joey> This is bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - As if you're not busy. </joey>
<connor> - It was less buttons to claim
the video in the first place. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like what the hell? </connor>
<connor> - And I told in the email, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "You could have emailed me, </connor>
<connor> I would have removed it ASAP." </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Well
we don't know that. </connor>
<connor> We didn't wanna deal with
talking and all that." </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause there like, to explain, </garnt>
<garnt> there are several levels
of copyright strike, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You can just claim the content </garnt>
<connor> and give the content
creators zero strikes. </connor>
<connor> And then if you do that, </connor>
<connor> then they can edit out
the copywrited material, </connor>
<connor> and-
- Which I would have done. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, which he would have done. </connor>
<connor> No, but they went like the nuclear option. </connor>
<connor> They just straight up gave you a strike, </connor>
<connor> put a strike in your account- </connor>
<connor> - Took the video down. </connor>
<connor> - Took the video down, </connor>
<garnt> and so you have zero
control over the video. </garnt>
<connor> To explain to people.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And a strike is, I mean,
I'm sure you all know this, </garnt>
<connor> but three strikes and your channel's gone, </connor>
<connor> of copyright strikes. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I explained that to them </connor>
<connor> and they were like, "Well
you know, not our problem." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Well, I mean, kinda is, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you're the one who did this. </connor>
<connor> And you know, it doesn't
really need to be this way </connor>
<connor> and it's very easy to fix." </connor>
<joey> And they just kept saying,
"Well, we don't really care." </joey>
<connor> And it was just awful, just awful. </connor>
<connor> And fuck, what else happened? </connor>
<connor> God, I might have cussing
while I think about the story. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt giggle) </connor>
<garnt> - I remember you politely saying, </garnt>
<connor> but you know, "Hey, </connor>
<garnt> I probably need to talk
about this on my channel." </garnt>
<connor> - Yes so, I told them, "Hey..." </connor>
<connor> Because they were just
being so uncooperative </connor>
<connor> and they were even fine with
the idea of me editing it out, </connor>
<connor> But they kept saying, "hey,
just ask YouTube to do it. </connor>
<connor> Just ask YouTube." </connor>
<connor> The problem is right, </connor>
<connor> is that YouTube, as it should be, </connor>
<connor> isn't involved with it. It
doesn't involve with this issue. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just a mediator. </connor>
<connor> - They're just the ones who host it, </connor>
<connor> it's not their problem. </connor>
<connor> They kept saying, "We've
gone through YouTube, </connor>
<connor> so why are you contacting us? </connor>
<connor> Go through YouTube's system." </connor>
<connor> And I don't think they understood </connor>
<connor> that YouTube tells you to contact them, </connor>
<connor> because it's not their problem. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - YouTube is like, you
have to talk to them. </connor>
<connor> So that's what we're trying to tell them. </connor>
<joey> It's like talking to a fucking wall </joey>
<joey> 'cause they are like,
they just don't get it. </joey>
<joey> I don't think they understand
YouTube's system so well. </joey>
<joey> - Not only do they not get
it, but it's frustrating </joey>
<joey> because they don't care to understand it. </joey>
<connor> - They don't care to
understand, they don't get it, </connor>
<joey> because they've got their result, </joey>
<joey> which is the video down.
- Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - And then you know, after every... </connor>
<connor> We sent like 10 emails back and forth. </connor>
<connor> I think maybe it even caught them up </connor>
<connor> and they kinda like shrugged it off. </connor>
<connor> So nothing's happening. </connor>
<connor> So in the email we write saying, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, well, I hate to say this, </connor>
<connor> but we're probably gonna
have to re upload the video, </connor>
<connor> which I am doing, </connor>
<connor> and we're probably gonna have
to explain in that video, </connor>
<connor> why it's been taken down, </connor>
<connor> which may make you look bad." </connor>
<connor> And they immediately responded with like, </connor>
<connor> "How dare you try and blackmail us?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It was like, "We will not entertain </connor>
<connor> nor give in to blackmail." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What are you, </connor>
<connor> the US government
dealing with terrorists?" </connor>
<garnt> - We will not negotiate with terrorists. </garnt>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was literally
the vibe of this email. </garnt>
<garnt> It was so funny. </garnt>
<joey> - We will not take this slander. </joey>
<connor> - They went full fucking Karen mode, man. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "I am the victim actually. </connor>
<connor> How dare you come to my house </connor>
<garnt> and you threaten me?" </garnt>
<connor> - That's literally the... </connor>
<connor> They literally did the full 180. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] They said
"We will never give in". </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We will never give in. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor]
We will never give in. </connor>
<connor> - We will never give in. </connor>
<connor> Okay actually, guess which
country this company is from? </connor>
<connor> I think it will make so much sense. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Just take a guess. </connor>
<connor> What country do you think
is super strict with rules? </connor>
<connor> (sighs) </connor>
<joey> Top of your head. </joey>
<joey> - I would think in some
kind of Asian country. </joey>
<connor> - No, European.
- Russia? </connor>
<connor> - No, Germany. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - We're following the rules.
(imitating German accent) </connor>
<joey> - That makes sense, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I tried so many routes. </joey>
<joey> Like trying to get this
done through YouTube. </joey>
<joey> I have even the company saying like, </joey>
<connor> "Hey, they don't care that..." </connor>
<connor> They are totally fine
with me getting the stuff </connor>
<connor> removed from the video
and re uploading it, </connor>
<connor> but they just don't want to do that. </connor>
<connor> They don't want to remove the strike. </connor>
<connor> And so as also, I asked Fiverr, </connor>
<connor> I said, "Hey Fiverr, I know
that I did use that footage </connor>
<connor> and it's up in the air
and if it's fair use </connor>
<connor> or not, whatever, et cetera, et cetera." </connor>
<connor> Fiverr, even though I was
critical of them in that video, </connor>
<connor> I did say that I think it's
wrong if Fiverr takes... </connor>
<connor> Fiverr takes a bit of the tips, </connor>
<connor> which I don't think they should do. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And they also charge 20% on everything. </connor>
<connor> And Fiverr actually reached
out on my behalf to the company </connor>
<connor> and asked, "Hey, we
know this is a problem, </connor>
<connor> but hey, could you please
put the video back up?" </connor>
<joey> - Oh, so Fiverr had your back? </joey>
<connor> - Fiverr backed me up. </connor>
<joey> - Oh nice! </joey>
<connor> - You know what they told Fiverr? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] What?
(Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - They said to Fiverr, </connor>
<connor> "We wanna keep the strike on his channel </connor>
<garnt> 'cause he tried to blackmail us. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's what they told Fiverr. </garnt>
<garnt> No joke, that's what they told. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<connor> - This company was just so
petty the whole way through. </connor>
<connor> It was so tragic. </connor>
<joey> And so now I'm just re uploading the video </joey>
<garnt> and just explaining that. </garnt>
<garnt> - So do you still have a strike? </garnt>
<connor> - Still have the strike
unfortunately, they won't remove it. </connor>
<joey> - But at least you're gonna
slightly call them out right, </joey>
<connor> in the video? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, I mean, you know- </connor>
<connor> - You're probably not
gonna say them by name </connor>
<connor> but still-
- I mean it's... </connor>
<joey> If you look through the video, </joey>
<joey> then you can see the name of the company, </joey>
<connor> at least it's there.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like, I dunno... </joey>
<joey> Because the way I've
been conditioned as... </joey>
<joey> The way I was taught as a kid
was to get problems resolved. </joey>
<joey> It's polite, you know, to ask politely </joey>
<joey> and to resolve conflicts in adult manner. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, be civil about it, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah be civil about it. </joey>
<joey> But the more I'm on the internet </joey>
<joey> and the more, especially as a Youtuber, </joey>
<garnt> I've realized that to get problems solved </garnt>
<garnt> and to get shit done, </garnt>
<garnt> it goes against everything
I was taught, because... </garnt>
<joey> - They're the best way
to get shit resolved </joey>
<joey> is just go out into the
public and go, "Fuck you". </joey>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's true though, right? </connor>
<connor> Because we've been conditioned
now to get a problem resolved </connor>
<garnt> is to make as much fucking noise possible. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey fanbase, I'm gonna give
you a new target to go off. </joey>
<joey> Seek em.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's unfortunate, because
I always as a last resort, </connor>
<joey> tweet about it or make it a public issue. </joey>
<joey> Because I just don't like it. </joey>
<connor> I think it's really- </connor>
<joey> - Because there's a part of
you that makes you look bad. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like an asshole being like, </garnt>
<connor> "Yo, but I got this following, </connor>
<connor> I'ma set the dogs on this one. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Release the hounds. </connor>
<connor> - Release the hounds. </connor>
<connor> It feels like that's the
only way to get things done, </connor>
<connor> especially when it's like... </connor>
<connor> I love the fact that the official way </connor>
<connor> to get problems resolved on YouTube, </connor>
<garnt> is just to fucking at
team YouTube on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> and just get people to retweet that, </garnt>
<garnt> instead of having a proper
chain of communication. </garnt>
<joey> No, you just got to make </joey>
<garnt> as much fucking noise
on Twitter as possible. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not a last resort
to at team YouTube, </joey>
<connor> it's just a requirement. </connor>
<joey> - If it's a YouTube problem,
I'll at team YouTube. </joey>
<joey> But this shit was kind of that company, </joey>
<joey> and honestly their social media... </joey>
<joey> I found their social
media isn't everything, </joey>
<joey> they're pretty small. </joey>
<connor> If I wanted to make them
known, I could have tweeted out </connor>
<connor> and be like, "Hey guys,
go and fucking spam </connor>
<connor> their social media ask
them to remove the strike." </connor>
<connor> But I don't know, I just
didn't wanna do that. </connor>
<joey> - You don't wanna use your
power for that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> - It's sad as well,
'cause I could do that, </joey>
<connor> and that would be like, </connor>
<connor> I guess I'm using my power, right? </connor>
<connor> But then also the only reason </connor>
<connor> they aren't taking me seriously </connor>
<garnt> is because I'm an individual. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly,
- [Joey] right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's unfair
because they're a company </garnt>
<garnt> and they think that I'm just a fly, </garnt>
<garnt> and that they can just
swat me away every time, </garnt>
<connor> which they just kept doing. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, at any point I
could have just made... </connor>
<connor> The thing is, right, is that
you don't want to say it, </connor>
<connor> but if people search
for the company's name, </connor>
<connor> you could easily make it, </connor>
<connor> so that the stuff that comes
up is pretty bad for them. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) Could
have easily have done that, </connor>
<connor> but I'm not going to,
cause I'm not an asshole. </connor>
<joey> - You might be a flyer, </joey>
<joey> but you're a flyer that's
about six feet long. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's gonna be a little
hard to swat you away. </joey>
<connor> - It's like such a
thing, 'cause it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, I really wanna
abuse my power right now." </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Go on a power trip. </connor>
<connor> - I really wanna thoroughly
abuse my power right now </connor>
<garnt> and make your life hell </garnt>
<garnt> because you guys are
being absolute assholes. </garnt>
<connor> - Cigar in one hand, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> let's get them. </connor>
<connor> - It's like trying to find a
right balance between like... </connor>
<connor> I got my integrity, you know, </connor>
<connor> I wanna be a good person, </connor>
<connor> but at the same time, </connor>
<connor> it's just the world is making it </connor>
<connor> super fucking hard sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it fucking sucks
that it's this way, but... </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's just that war between </joey>
<joey> the traditionalist way of doing things </joey>
<connor> and then the new age things of doing that. </connor>
<connor> Because, you know, even
if YouTube right now </connor>
<joey> is such a massive thing worldwide, </joey>
<joey> technically speaking, it's
only been around for what? </joey>
<garnt> 15 years?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's just, I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> it's just the age of social media now </garnt>
<garnt> where it is all about making
as much noise as possible, </garnt>
<garnt> even if you are someone
very much in the wrong, </garnt>
<connor> and your logic is fucked,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Somehow some people are
able to make more noise </connor>
<connor> than the other person, </connor>
<connor> therefore they are the right ones, </connor>
<connor> that they win in the end.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's a very, I
would say backwards way, </connor>
<garnt> but it's just the way the
world is now unfortunately. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's just the
hands that we've been dealt. </connor>
<garnt> Unfortunately with YouTube system, </garnt>
<garnt> it's really sad that it only ever gives </garnt>
<connor> any benefit to the claimant. </connor>
<joey> So it's like you kind of
don't really have a choice, </joey>
<connor> and it sucks because people
who don't wanna do it... </connor>
<connor> I mean I don't want to do it, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to make a
fuss about it on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> And I probably might've
been able to get it resolved </connor>
<connor> if I just made it hell for them. </connor>
<connor> If I just bombed their
social medias and just- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It might've worked, </connor>
<connor> but did I want to find out </connor>
<joey> and would I felt good about it? </joey>
<joey> Like probably not. </joey>
<joey> - You don't wanna resort to that, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, It's horrible. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing about,
especially with YouTube copyright, </garnt>
<garnt> is that there's just been... </garnt>
<garnt> Everything that's been mentioned </garnt>
<garnt> and everything that people
say is all fucking guesswork. </garnt>
<connor> Because the thing is,
there is no precedence, </connor>
<connor> because the highest
level this can go up to </connor>
<connor> it's like-
- Supreme court? </connor>
<connor> - It's like court right? </connor>
<connor> And that's only happened
once between one creator </connor>
<connor> and one creator, which is like H3H3. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's been the only precedence </connor>
<connor> about anything regarding
YouTube copyright. </connor>
<garnt> We've never had an individual
go up against the company. </garnt>
<garnt> So nobody knows how that's
gonna end up really. </garnt>
<connor> - I think because the company
doesn't really want that </connor>
<connor> 'cause it'll look bad for them. </connor>
<joey> - And no individual wants to be the test. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, nobody
wants to be the first. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you really wanna
be that company picking </garnt>
<garnt> on a singular dude? </garnt>
<garnt> And then that dude also rally
the internet behind him? </garnt>
<connor> You probably don't want that. </connor>
<garnt> You might win it, </garnt>
<connor> but everyone will think you're an asshole. </connor>
<connor> - In that situation,
kind of everyone loses. </connor>
<connor> There is no single winner at that point. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe the creator can come out of it </connor>
<connor> if he's willing to go through it. </connor>
<connor> The creator might come
out with a lot of respect </connor>
<connor> and might get a lot of
community support and yeah, </connor>
<joey> it could be worth it, but
it's such a big gamble. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It could also completely
go the other way around. </connor>
<garnt> - It could also completely
just ruin your life. </garnt>
<connor> - It could bankrupt you. </connor>
<connor> - It can not only
bankrupt that individual, </connor>
<garnt> but it could also leave an
example for other companies </garnt>
<garnt> to start abusing that, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, "Oh well, they
lost it in the court case, </connor>
<joey> so let's go out and
just fucking snipe down </joey>
<joey> all these individual creatives." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> nobody fucking understands the law anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> None of us really
understand fair use laws. </garnt>
<garnt> How the fuck are the fucking jury </garnt>
<garnt> gonna understand fair use laws? </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - So what, you used anime
ghoul in your video, </joey>
<joey> and this company owns said anime ghoul, </joey>
<joey> but doesn't actually own it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, yes, your honor. </joey>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Geez, I have to mask even
how world wide YouTube is. </connor>
<joey> How do you sue someone
that's in a different country </joey>
<joey> with different laws? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What if none of you
are an American company, </joey>
<joey> which laws are you using? </joey>
<joey> You're using YouTube's laws or? </joey>
<joey> - Well that's the problem, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that like- </joey>
<connor> - I'm not an expert so I'd love to know. </connor>
<connor> - And I think that's why at least </connor>
<connor> the majority of anime
Youtubers who have been caught </connor>
<connor> using anime footage in their videos </connor>
<connor> have managed to get away with it, </connor>
<connor> because in Japan we
don't have fair use laws, </connor>
<connor> but in America where YouTube is hosting, </connor>
<connor> we do our fair use laws.
- [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it just never happens. </connor>
<connor> The Japanese look at that
and were like, "Oh shit. </connor>
<joey> Well I guess we're gonna back away now." </joey>
<connor> - Just put in the work that time either </connor>
<connor> to try and figure out if they can do it. </connor>
<garnt> - It is an unfair system because,
it really just fucks over </garnt>
<connor> any of the small creators. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And I feel like if you're a small creator, </connor>
<connor> the best strategy you can go for </connor>
<connor> is befriend a bigger creator. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because if you're ever in any trouble, </connor>
<connor> then you're gonna rely on
them to make noise for you </connor>
<garnt> because you can't do it for yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> And I can't really think of a better way </garnt>
<garnt> to go about it aside from that. </garnt>
<joey> - Except just fucking giving up, clearly. </joey>
<connor> It's like literally no other
way of going around that. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, right?
- Yeah, it sucks. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's kind of unfortunate </joey>
<joey> 'cause even creatives our sizes, </joey>
<connor> it's still difficult to get things fixed. </connor>
<connor> I think the only creators I
can think of that would be able </connor>
<connor> to get shit done is
probably like Mr.Beast, </connor>
<connor> 'cause he's obviously... </connor>
<connor> - The Youtuber poster boy? </connor>
<connor> - If YouTube's really friendly with you, </connor>
<connor> they'll help you out.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They'll figure out a
way to make it go away. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's like one out
of how many million channels? </joey>
<connor> - That's the thing right? </connor>
<connor> There's maybe like a hundred, I bet... </connor>
<connor> No more than a hundred of those people </connor>
<garnt> who can have that kind of power. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause even we're big creators, I guess- </connor>
<garnt> - We're big creators in the anime field, </garnt>
<joey> but in the overall
fucking scheme of things, </joey>
<joey> we're just a fucking pebble. </joey>
<connor> - We're still decently sized though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah but there's, I
saw this I think in 2020, </joey>
<connor> like beginning of 2020,
like rough estimate, </connor>
<connor> there's I think over 10,000 channels now </connor>
<connor> with over a million subs. </connor>
<connor> - Wow! </connor>
<connor> - So we're definitely expanding more. </connor>
<connor> - But you'd still think
that the ad revenue </connor>
<joey> that you're maybe bringing in, </joey>
<joey> is more than a Google employee, </joey>
<joey> so it might be worth having someone... </joey>
<joey> - Right, but how many
Google employees are there? </joey>
<connor> - True, true.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I guess that's tough. </connor>
<connor> - At the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> yes, we may be big in our separate fields </connor>
<connor> and maybe compared to
other smaller creators, </connor>
<connor> or people who don't do stuff, </connor>
<connor> but in a bigger sense, </connor>
<joey> the ceiling is very, very high. </joey>
<connor> - It should be nice, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you know, there's
like 45% of your ad revenue, </connor>
<connor> it'd be nice to know that
they give a fuck about it. </connor>
<garnt> Not just host the videos.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean they're big enough
where they don't care about, </connor>
<connor> they don't care about.
- Yeah, they don't really. </connor>
<garnt> - 1 million creators,
1 million subscribers, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like nothing.
- True. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, I guess they didn't
really care about the credits </connor>
<joey> that can actually affect their reputation, </joey>
<joey> which are obviously the super big ones. </joey>
<joey> - 0.001%, right?
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because I mean, I get it
when you see on Twitter, </connor>
<connor> they'll be a dude with like 20 subs, </connor>
<connor> you're like man, "YouTube's so
unfair that the small guys." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "I mean,
come on you have 20 subs." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I mean, you don't really
have much to lose. </connor>
<connor> I know you shouldn't be
discriminating against sizes, </connor>
<garnt> but also I think there
should be a prioritize </garnt>
<garnt> on people who are living off it </garnt>
<garnt> and they've use the system throughout. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I feel sorry for
YouTube at the same time as well, </connor>
<connor> because I'm like-
- You can't win. </connor>
<connor> - I'm thinking about this
from their perspective </connor>
<connor> and like, how do you solve every problem </connor>
<connor> that you have on YouTube? </connor>
<connor> Because YouTube right
now is too fucking large, </connor>
<connor> there's too much content </connor>
<connor> to be able to know what
everything, everyone is doing </connor>
<connor> and everything being uploaded. </connor>
<connor> It feels like it's just an
impossible puzzle to solve. </connor>
<connor> You jiggle around one thing and
then another piece pops out, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> That's what it feels like, where, </connor>
<connor> I feel like they are doing
the best that they can. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like as creators, </connor>
<connor> we all are very grateful to YouTube, </connor>
<connor> but the sucky thing is that, </connor>
<connor> if we have a problem with YouTube, </connor>
<connor> we have to make them look
like the fucking devil. </connor>
<connor> You what I mean.
- Yeah, we do. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas my personal opinion is that, </connor>
<connor> I know YouTube's doing the best they can, </connor>
<connor> I know there's some massive problems </connor>
<connor> that happen where some
people getting banned </connor>
<connor> or some people getting
demonetized by accidents </connor>
<connor> and everything, and it can
affect livelihood by... </connor>
<garnt> I look at this also
from the perspective of, </garnt>
<garnt> hey, this platform is
just fucking massive. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna be impossible to
solve every problem with a bot, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's what they need to do. </garnt>
<garnt> They need to have a bot, </garnt>
<garnt> because you can't have actual
humans looking over everything </garnt>
<garnt> that's being uploaded. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah because, hasn't YouTube in terms of </joey>
<connor> stuff that Google owns, </connor>
<connor> hasn't YouTube been in the red </connor>
<connor> for the past four years or something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - YouTube's constantly losing money. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's not the
value of making money, </joey>
<connor> it's the amount of information
that YouTube brings, </connor>
<connor> Google is priceless. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like what, 50 hours of
content uploaded every minute </joey>
<garnt> or second I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's way more than that.
(Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's more than that.
- Way more than that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's insane, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But no, it's scary. </garnt>
<connor> But I guess that comes
with the price of it being </connor>
<connor> just a brand new type
of entertainment, right? </connor>
<connor> I'm sure radio and TV had
probably the exact same problems </connor>
<connor> when it first started to rise. </connor>
<joey> And it's only after decades
and decades of trial and error </joey>
<joey> that they've kind of smoothed it out. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, what I find funny is that </garnt>
<garnt> when YouTube first started </garnt>
<garnt> to get super, super commercialized, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And people will start
having all these problems </garnt>
<garnt> with copyright and a lot
of people taking advantage </garnt>
<connor> of the system. </connor>
<connor> People were like, whoa, </connor>
<connor> this is a fucking dying platform, </connor>
<connor> let's go over to Twitch everyone. </connor>
<connor> And then now the Twitch is starting </connor>
<connor> to burst into the mainstream, </connor>
<connor> we're now seeing like the same problems </connor>
<connor> affect Twitch creators now.
- [Joey And Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And everyone's like, man, </joey>
<garnt> Twitch is getting so hard now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Twitch is getting axed
even harder than YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the new DMCA Law's </garnt>
<connor> are bloody ridiculous on Twitch now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it was the one thing
that Twitch was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, thank God we don't
have to worry about </garnt>
<garnt> playing copyrighted stuff
on our Twitch anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> And then Twitch was like..." </garnt>
<joey> And when Amazon kind
of stepped in was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, about that..."
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I mean it's more like the music industry </connor>
<garnt> has just been stuck in its ways
for like the past 30 years. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is weird though because </joey>
<garnt> websites like Newgrounds to this day, </garnt>
<garnt> you can use copyrighted music. </garnt>
<garnt> And they won't do anything about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's 'cause no one owns Newgrounds. </garnt>
<garnt> Newgrounds is still privately owned. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, but the thing
is just like is like, </joey>
<joey> even when it was in its prime, </joey>
<joey> the music industry never stepped in </joey>
<connor> and tried to do something about it. </connor>
<connor> They were just like, "Well..." </connor>
<joey> - Because the money wasn't there. </joey>
<joey> Like when the live streaming, </joey>
<joey> they see all of these
billion dollar buy-ins- </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like they are pretty
same but music industry </garnt>
<connor> are like, "Hello..."
- yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Basically, I feel like
it's just the contents. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone tries to find
this new platform where... </garnt>
<garnt> I mean we talked about the
golden age of the internet before </garnt>
<garnt> where things were less
regulated and everything, </garnt>
<garnt> but as soon as something
does get popular enough, </garnt>
<joey> it's just an inevitability that companies </joey>
<joey> are just gonna wanna get in on it. </joey>
<joey> And it's going to be more regulated, </joey>
<joey> and you're gonna have content creators </joey>
<joey> are just gonna have less freedom. </joey>
<joey> It's the unfortunate truth of the internet </joey>
<joey> and it's the unfortunate truth of media. </joey>
<joey> - God, I hate capitalism. </joey>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Down with capitalism. </garnt>
<connor> - Should we get into some of
our favorite YouTube channels, </connor>
<joey> or the channels we like watching? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because I feel like we all
watch very different Youtubers </connor>
<garnt> or I guess...
- Do we? </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I mean we established like before, </connor>
<garnt> that like the amount of
YouTube the three of us watch </garnt>
<garnt> is probably quite different. </garnt>
<joey> - So like what... </joey>
<garnt> Here's my first question to you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> What do you guys look
for in a content creator? </garnt>
<garnt> If anything, if anything. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I'm the type of
guy, people are like, </garnt>
<joey> whenever I get asked who
my favorite Youtubers are, </joey>
<joey> especially in conventions
and panels and everything, </joey>
<joey> everyone expects me to
say anime Youtubers. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, my favorite attitude. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, right.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And because it's my job, </connor>
<connor> I try to watch the least amount
of anime content as I can </connor>
<connor> because I don't want to... </connor>
<connor> One, it's my job, I can't
view animate content </connor>
<connor> in the same way ever again. </connor>
<garnt> And two, I don't want it
to affect my own content. </garnt>
<joey> - Also, so many of them suck, </joey>
<connor> I'm just kidding. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. </connor>
<garnt> I totally agree, like you know, </garnt>
<joey> my YouTube viewing time is my off time. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly.
- I just maximize YouTube man. </connor>
<garnt> Every single moment of my
life I'm watching YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't do that. </garnt>
<joey> - Do you watch other Youtubers though? </joey>
<connor> - A few. </connor>
<connor> - Like other Youtubers that
you don't know personally. </connor>
<connor> Like I obviously watch your guys' content, </connor>
<joey> like people I'm personally friends with, </joey>
<joey> but I very rarely watch other YouTube </joey>
<joey> who I don't personally know. </joey>
<connor> - There's some I like, </connor>
<joey> but I feel like they're
not quite there yet. </joey>
<joey> Like they're still figuring
it out their style. </joey>
<joey> - Because they're new, or? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because they're new. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I find enjoyment in
watching the new channels </connor>
<joey> kind of figure out their own way </joey>
<joey> and seeing their growth. </joey>
<connor> - I mean some of my
favorite channels on YouTube </connor>
<connor> are the tiny ones where
they've only got update videos. </connor>
<joey> - I love those, I love those.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Where they have more update
videos than actual content. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I would name one or two, </joey>
<connor> but I'm also worried that- </connor>
<joey> - You don't wanna bully them. </joey>
<joey> - I'm also worried that
they'll get 10,000 new viewers </joey>
<joey> and they won't know how to handle it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- But... </joey>
<joey> - But you know the ones
we're talking about. </joey>
<joey> They're out there, they're out there. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, obvious channels
that we all like and enjoy </connor>
<connor> just like Internet Historian. </connor>
<connor> Everyone fucking loves Internet Historian. </connor>
<joey> I mean like what else, what else? </joey>
<connor> - Come on to the podcast
Internet Historian. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Nakey Jakey is one of my favorites. </joey>
<joey> - I remember Nakey,
cause I discovered him... </joey>
<joey> You know when you discover a creator </joey>
<joey> who's under a hundred thousand subs, </joey>
<connor> and you're like, "You're gonna blow up." </connor>
<connor> That was Nakey Jakey for me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I discovered him before </connor>
<connor> he even did his fucking
green screen effects, </connor>
<connor> and he was just basically try a mix </connor>
<connor> between donkey and John Tron. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he was just like,
he didn't show his face, </connor>
<connor> it was just pure voiceover. </connor>
<connor> But he was someone who I
discovered really early on, </connor>
<connor> and I could tell, I
could tell immediately- </connor>
<connor> - Personality was shining through. </connor>
<connor> - His personality was shining through </connor>
<connor> and he was gonna blow up eventually. </connor>
<connor> And then he did like the first... </connor>
<connor> The first video where I
thought he was gonna blow up, </connor>
<connor> was he did a video about video game dogs, </connor>
<connor> which is so different from
what other people were doing. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But it was just so unique. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "That's it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's your niche, you've found it." </garnt>
<connor> - I just love his flow of comedy. </connor>
<connor> There are some videos where it's like... </connor>
<garnt> One of my favorite videos to this day </garnt>
<connor> is the one where he talks
about water levels in gaming. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And it's such a short video, </connor>
<connor> it's like six minutes long. </connor>
<connor> But it's just constant, constant jokes, </connor>
<connor> jokes, jokes, jokes.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - With no room for error, whatsoever. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I just love videos
like that where it's like, </garnt>
<connor> cut all the bullshit filler out, </connor>
<connor> just say the punchline and
then immediately move on. </connor>
<connor> That's the type of comedy I strive to do </connor>
<garnt> in my thing as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like everyone
thinks of him as just the guy </garnt>
<connor> who has a green screen
and sits on the ball, </connor>
<connor> but as someone who's been
following him for ages, </connor>
<connor> he can do any kind of content-
- oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it'll still be fucking great. </connor>
<garnt> - You do a lot of writing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So, I assume you think his writing </garnt>
<garnt> is also pretty spot on as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think his writing
is fucking brilliant. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's brilliant. </connor>
<garnt> - It is really hard and
even I'm still trying </garnt>
<connor> to learn this too, </connor>
<connor> to try and balance analytical, </connor>
<garnt> like your thoughts and
analytics to comedy. </garnt>
<joey> And I've seen so many creators </joey>
<joey> and I feel like even
I might be one of them </joey>
<joey> who sometimes it's like, okay, </joey>
<joey> this part is analytical
and this part is comedy. </joey>
<joey> But to combine the two
together seamlessly, </joey>
<garnt> is a fucking difficult thing to do. </garnt>
<joey> And to make it look natural
as well is really hard. </joey>
<garnt> - This episode is
sponsored by Express VPN. </garnt>
<joey> - Wow, Express VPN baby!
(yells) </joey>
<connor> - Okay Garnt. </connor>
<connor> But I understand you're
happy because it's December, </connor>
<garnt> it's the Christmas spirit time, </garnt>
<garnt> which I have plenty of? </garnt>
<connor> - Is it the big D? </connor>
<connor> - The big, what? </connor>
<garnt> Which means we can officially start </garnt>
<garnt> watching Christmas movies. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeh!
(hosts rejoice) </connor>
<connor> - Which you know that I love. </connor>
<connor> I love them, I love them. </connor>
<connor> But what if you go to Netflix, Jerry? </connor>
<connor> - Mhh! </connor>
<connor> - This horror situation, </connor>
<connor> and you discover that your
favorite Christmas movie </connor>
<connor> isn't available.
(dramatic music) </connor>
<joey> - Then I will cry and
scream until I get it. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess I just can't get it. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess I have to give
up on the Christmas spirit. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess I'll just get
depression for Christmas. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what would happen. </garnt>
<connor> But get ready to have your mind blown. </connor>
<connor> You can use in bold Express VPN </connor>
<connor> to watch any Netflix library in the world. </connor>
<garnt> (puking mimics) </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you telling me that Express VPN </garnt>
<garnt> are saving Christmas? </garnt>
<connor> - They are saving Christmas. </connor>
<connor> And this weekend I used Express VPN </connor>
<connor> to stream a Christmas classic, </connor>
<connor> "Elf", on German Netflix. </connor>
<garnt> - Now I know that's your
favorite Christmas movie </garnt>
<connor> of all time. </connor>
<joey> - That is everyone's
favorite Christmas movie. </joey>
<connor> - Very fond of "Elf". </connor>
<connor> It was so simple. </connor>
<connor> I just opened the app, </connor>
<connor> hit one button to change my location, </connor>
<connor> refreshed Netflix, and
that's it, that's it. </connor>
<garnt> - So easy. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] See, express
VPN lets you control </garnt>

<joey> - [Connor] Oh my God Garnt! </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Just imagine how
many Netflix libraries that is. </joey>
<joey> - It's a hundred Christmases. </joey>
<joey> - That's a hundred libraries. </joey>
<garnt> - That's at least, that's over five. </garnt>

<connor> But let's also be honest again, </connor>
<connor> there are hundreds of VPNs out there, </connor>

<joey> - Link's in the description. </joey>
<joey> Thank you to Express VPN
for sponsoring this video, </joey>
<joey> back to the show. </joey>
<joey> I think one thing I respect the most </joey>
<joey> out of Nakey Jakey's run in, </joey>
<connor> like Nakey Jakey is
definitely not the only one </connor>
<connor> who does this, </connor>
<connor> but I think it's the
type of content creator </connor>
<connor> that I especially like
and inspire to be myself, </connor>
<connor> is the people who can writes scripts. </connor>
<connor> They're clearly scripts, </connor>
<connor> but they write it and perform it in a way </connor>
<connor> that doesn't make it look like
they're reading off a script. </connor>
<connor> Like Nakey Jakey is obviously
a great example of that. </connor>
<connor> I think the whole reason
why JonTron as well, </connor>
<connor> blew up is because of that.
- Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - He's managed to like, as you said, </connor>
<connor> mix the whole analytical
side with the joke side, </connor>
<connor> just so seamlessly. </connor>
<joey> And if we're talking (indistinct) as well, </joey>
<joey> a Demo was a perfect
example of that, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean Demo kind of
just started as a new wave </garnt>
<connor> of anime YouTube content,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And his style still prevails today </connor>
<garnt> in a lot of people's content.
- Right. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, I certainly look
up to that guy's writing. </joey>
<garnt> - I think every pretty
much every big anituber </garnt>
<garnt> does in some way shape or form. </garnt>
<joey> - But weird, not even like 10% of the way </joey>
<joey> to being as funny as that. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like, we're trying really hard, </joey>
<joey> but we can't quite get there. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like how, cause you
can copy someone's style, </garnt>
<joey> but you can never be that person. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause that's kinda like the hard thing </connor>
<connor> about being an independent content creator </connor>
<connor> is that you can be influenced by someone, </connor>
<joey> but if you're influenced
by them a bit too much </joey>
<joey> then everyone's gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> "Ah, you were trying to be X person." </joey>
<joey> - You're just a clone. </joey>
<joey> - Unlike if you're trying to be X person </joey>
<garnt> then in the viewer's mind,
all they are going to see </garnt>
<garnt> is you trying to be X person, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it was that problem
right of back in the day </joey>
<garnt> whenever anyone tried
to do any G Let's play. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it doesn't matter if
you were no is similar to him. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone was like, </garnt>
<garnt> well this guy's just a
PewDiePie clone, isn't he? </garnt>
<connor> He's just a marker clone.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> and am just like, I got those comments. </connor>
<connor> Like where I first started
doing clothes party, </connor>
<connor> people were like, "Oh, this guy looks </connor>
<connor> and sounds like PewDiePie." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Okay, I get the sounds part, </connor>
<connor> how the fuck do I look like Felix?" </connor>
<connor> - How do you sound like
Felix, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, Apparently I sound... </connor>
<connor> I mean, I can do Felix impressions, </connor>
<connor> but it's not like I was
trying to do them actively. </connor>
<connor> Because surprise, Felix
wasn't the only Let's Player </connor>
<connor> that was around back
then and who I watched. </connor>
<connor> - Speaking of, oh go on. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, you. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, speaking about Nakey Jakey, </joey>
<garnt> have you guys watched Scott The Woz? </garnt>
<garnt> Have you seen him? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've seen a few of his videos. </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen a few of his
videos, but I'm not subscribed. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love Scott, I love you Scott. </connor>
<connor> Because he's the opposite of Nakey Jakey. </connor>
<connor> Almost where Nakey Jakey tries on purpose </connor>
<connor> to not feel like a script, </connor>
<connor> where Scott feels so incredibly scripted, </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> that it makes it almost funnier. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, he's just
so extremely consistent, </connor>
<connor> and he uploads sometimes like twice a week </connor>
<connor> and it's always such fucking good quality. </connor>
<connor> - Right , right , right.
- But they're so good. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I feel like a... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was at one point as well, </connor>
<connor> Jon trying to not upload it for so long </connor>
<connor> that they turned Jon Tron
sub-reddit into Scott The Woz. </connor>
<connor> - Are you serious?
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he didn't upload for so long. </connor>
<connor> Because everyone would
say that Scott The Woz </connor>
<connor> was like Jon Tron but more consistent. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - But it's still very
different styles of humor. </connor>
<connor> And I remember as well, </connor>
<connor> he's like so anal about </connor>
<connor> keeping the same level of consistency </connor>
<connor> that he re-uploaded the whole video once </connor>
<connor> because he accidentally
didn't sensor a swear word </connor>
<connor> in one of his outfits. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - God damn, and that is commitment. </garnt>
<connor> - He just seems like a such a chill dude </connor>
<connor> but also Hella awkward
cause there's clips of him </connor>
<connor> in conventions that he
looks so awkward in like... </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like the kind of
energy that I'm like, "Man, </connor>
<connor> that's so honest." </connor>
<joey> He can just tell you that
he loves what he's doing. </joey>
<connor> - That's the type of genuine Youtuber. </connor>
<connor> - Have you watched any of his videos? </connor>
<connor> - I feel like, I've definitely seen </connor>
<connor> at least a couple of his videos </connor>
<connor> come up on recommended, but... </connor>
<connor> - I definitely have. </connor>
<joey> - It might not be for everyone, </joey>
<joey> but I think definitely you can
always watch it and enjoy it, </joey>
<joey> but you might not go away being like, </joey>
<joey> "I fucking love this guy." </joey>
<garnt> But you'll definitely enjoy
it, a hundred percent. </garnt>
<connor> He's really good. </connor>
<connor> - He's definitely on my list of people. </connor>
<garnt> Every time he's on my
recommended, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I'll give you a go." </garnt>
<connor> - It also makes me wonder
how specific of a subject </connor>
<connor> about gaming can you talk about? </connor>
<connor> Like he did memory cards the other day. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing ) </connor>
<connor> He did a whole 30 minute
video on memory cards. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right ,
right. And I was like, </connor>
<connor> I don't even know what he talked about. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember, but I enjoyed it. </connor>
<connor> But I just remember thinking this video </connor>
<connor> is totally pointless. </connor>
<joey> - There's another
channel that's like that, </joey>
<joey> which I think you showed me
this Connor, but, "Ahoy"? </joey>
<garnt> - I was literally about like, </garnt>
<garnt> when Connor mentioned
that I was like, "Ahoy". </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, there's another channel </garnt>
<garnt> that covers super niche
and specific titles. </garnt>
<connor> - I for the longest time
thought it was some like </connor>
<connor> film studio that hired
the sexiest narrator ever. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - But I think it's
legit, the narrator guys- </garnt>
<connor> - No, I think it's just one dude, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So to explain to Ahoy, </connor>
<connor> he does video game documentaries </connor>
<connor> on really, really niche like subjects. </connor>
<connor> I think one of my favorite ones was, </connor>
<connor> he went through the entire history </connor>
<connor> of exploding barrels </connor>
<connor> in like video games.
- That was such a good video. </connor>
<connor> - And it's one of those subjects </connor>
<connor> where you never thought about it </connor>
<connor> until someone brought it up. </connor>
<connor> Like why is it that when you
see a barrel in a video game, </connor>
<connor> you just expect it to explode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's just something that
you've just been conditioned </connor>
<connor> to know, but then you think about it </connor>
<joey> and you're like yeah, </joey>
<garnt> "What is the history behind that?" </garnt>
<joey> - He's also like... I'm
looking at his channel now, </joey>
<joey> he's also the antithesis of click-bait. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) like it goes,
do you know what his video </connor>
<connor> on explosive barrels is called? </connor>
<connor> - Just barrels, right? </connor>
<connor> - Explosive Barrels. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) With a period at the end. </joey>
<connor> - I also genuinely don't think, </connor>
<connor> and there's only maybe one
or two people I can think </connor>
<garnt> that have the same level of
production quality as him. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh!
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The production quality of
this man's videos are insane. </connor>
<connor> - We've mentioned before,
but like, LEMMiNO. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's kinda like the insane
kind of production qualities </connor>
<garnt> where you're like, "This guy
uploads one every three months </garnt>
<garnt> and I know why he uploads
one every three months." </garnt>
<joey> - It's legit like box levels of it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - He just did a video on what was like, </joey>
<joey> what was the first video game ever. </joey>
<joey> That's a very good video. </joey>
<connor> - My favorite one as well is like, </connor>
<connor> where does the history of chickens. </connor>
<connor> Like healing here come from.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And well, yeah, it's just great. </connor>
<connor> It's really weird like, </connor>
<connor> there are just some Youtubers I feel </connor>
<connor> that can just take these
extremely niche topics </connor>
<joey> and just somehow able
to turn it into a video </joey>
<joey> that you'd never thought you needed, </joey>
<joey> but then the moment you watch it, </joey>
<joey> you're like, "All right, I
kind of need this video." </joey>
<connor> - As I was going through my list, </connor>
<connor> I did realize what really appealed to me. </connor>
<connor> And it was like more so the human aspect- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do you know, Noclip by any chance? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - They do video game documentaries </connor>
<connor> that are really, really well produced </connor>
<connor> about game development. </connor>
<connor> And it's really reached insane
production, great stuff. </connor>
<connor> But half the time I end
up just not really caring </connor>
<connor> because I feel like there's
no human aspect to it </connor>
<connor> or a personality
attracting me in the video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - It just feels like a documentary, </connor>
<garnt> which is great and it's amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> don't get me wrong, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not like Ahoy,
where it feels so passionate </garnt>
<garnt> from one person and so
many of the channels </garnt>
<connor> that were mentioned today. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, we've
talked about this before </garnt>
<garnt> about how to be successful on YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like having
that human connection </garnt>
<garnt> and having a personality, </garnt>
<garnt> even if you are doing a
sort of documentary thing, </garnt>
<connor> inserting your own passion </connor>
<connor> and your own personality
into it as much as possible, </connor>
<connor> is the real selling point </connor>
<connor> of why people will want
to come back to you. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like that's why,
(clear throat) </connor>
<connor> like I remember when YouTube went through </connor>
<connor> this whole video essay boom- </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And now I think it's last
starting to die down, you know. </joey>
<joey> - Especially on anitube as well. </joey>
<joey> - I remember when Every Frame a Painting </joey>
<joey> came along and started
doing video essays... </joey>
<joey> - Rest in piece, </joey>
<joey> but that was one of the best
fucking channels I swear. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God!
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And Nerdwriter and
everything came along, </joey>
<joey> and we have this video essay boom. </joey>
<joey> And now people, they
don't care so much about </joey>
<joey> the analytical side of things, </joey>
<joey> they care more about the
personality behind it. </joey>
<joey> - All right.
- You know what I mean. </joey>
<joey> - They care about the person
telling the narrative, right? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause why should I listen </joey>
<joey> to some random person's college thesis </joey>
<joey> where there are actual
experts on the platform now. </joey>
<joey> Which brings me to my next creator, </joey>
<connor> which is a video essay channel. </connor>
<connor> Because they did a video essay on, </connor>
<connor> was it Shazam, Kazam, what
was that superhero movie? </connor>
<connor> - Oh Shazam.
- Shazam </connor>
<connor> - Shazam </connor>
<connor> Yeah they were doing a
video essay on Shazam. </connor>
<connor> He's called Ponysmasher. </connor>
<connor> - I've never heard of this channel. </connor>
<connor> - And he was doing a video essay on Shazam </connor>
<connor> by breaking down how hard it is to... </connor>
<connor> The little problems that need to be solved </connor>
<connor> when making a movie, right? </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "Oh, it's
just another video essay." </connor>
<connor> And then he starts using
first person perspective. </connor>
<connor> Like, "So, what I had to
do was I had to do this, </connor>
<connor> I had to do that on this movie." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Wait a minute, </connor>
<connor> this is the director of Shazam </connor>
<connor> making a video essay on his own movie." </connor>
<connor> - Waw! </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, "What the fuck!" </connor>
<connor> - That's cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was the director of Shazam </connor>
<connor> making a video essay on his own platform. </connor>
<connor> And I remember how he ends the video </connor>
<connor> is he says, yeah. </connor>
<connor> There was a point where I was just </connor>
<connor> super obsessed with YouTube video essays, </connor>
<connor> and then I started making movies </connor>
<joey> and now he views video
essays completely different. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he admitted himself, </joey>
<joey> as someone who has made movies, </joey>
<joey> he doesn't know whether, you know, </joey>
<joey> you can break down the movie's themes </joey>
<joey> and all the back end of
something with the movie. </joey>
<joey> But he was like, "Yeah, </joey>
<joey> sometimes it's just like
a complete accident." </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - It's just a happy
little accident, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sometimes he's just like, </joey>
<connor> "Yeah, did I mean to, </connor>
<connor> was there any meaning behind
making this curtain blue </connor>
<connor> or something like that." </connor>
<connor> And sometimes it's just, </connor>
<connor> is just the only curtain
that was fucking available. </connor>
<connor> - I just liked the color that's all. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you know.
- That's so cool. </joey>
<joey> - And hearing it from him,
after I saw that video, </joey>
<joey> I was just like, yeah,
he's kind of got a point. </joey>
<garnt> When you've got actual fucking directors </garnt>
<garnt> making video essays on your own movie, </garnt>
<garnt> how can other people kind of compete </garnt>
<garnt> with that at that point? </garnt>
<joey> - That's the point I want to get to, </joey>
<joey> where eventually if I
ever make my own anime </joey>
<joey> or my own Manga, </joey>
<joey> and I just make a video
essay on my own show. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> That'd be the ultimate flex. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I know exactly why they
decided to use these things, </garnt>
<joey> because I fucking made them, that's why. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Ambitious goal Joey, ambitious goals. </connor>
<joey> - The most primary sources
that you could ever get. </joey>
<connor> - Also like, going the
complete opposite of that, </connor>
<connor> which is experts in the field. </connor>
<connor> My new worst fucking pet peeve on YouTube </connor>
<connor> is seeing videos of... </connor>
<connor> I had mentioned this
to you guys in private, </connor>
<connor> but there's this new thing on YouTube </connor>
<connor> where things that shouldn't
be a qualification </connor>
<connor> that are a qualification, </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> like reacts to something, I've noticed. </connor>
<connor> And these things will not
stop leaving my recommended. </connor>
<connor> It's like Japanese person </connor>
<connor> reacts to every course abroad video. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "I don't care." </connor>
<connor> That is not impressive that
a Japanese person watches. </connor>
<joey> - The recent one I saw that
would not leave my recommended </joey>
<joey> is Japanese person reacts </joey>
<joey> to Bill Wurtz's history of Japan. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, I don't... </joey>
<connor> This should not be a qualification. </connor>
<connor> I get it, there's like... </connor>
<garnt> What was the other ones? </garnt>
<connor> Like doctor reacts doctors, that's fair. </connor>
<connor> - Because that's an actual
quantification, that's a job. </connor>
<connor> - You were just born in a country bro, </connor>
<garnt> what do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> Its not like you were
born in like Machu Picchu </connor>
<connor> talking about the ruins
or some shit, that's tiny. </connor>
<connor> - My favorite ones as well
is the music related ones. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, I remember
I saw one which was like, </connor>
<connor> "Jazz drummer reacts
to Tool live concert." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "But Tool is a metal band." </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> it's like, you don't know
anything about metal. </joey>
<joey> Its like you playing... </joey>
<joey> Oh yeah, the other one is like, </joey>
<joey> "Church drummer reacts to whatever." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, you play
at your local church. </joey>
<joey> It's not like, you're
not even a professional, </joey>
<connor> you just play at your local church. </connor>
<connor> - Can somebody please
make a YouTube channel </connor>
<connor> out there like, "High student
reacts to high school." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I just want us to go full meme now, </connor>
<connor> like it's getting ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> I saw, there was a mathematician one, </connor>
<connor> and in the video it was like
"Mathematician reacts to", </connor>
<connor> and I click on the vide and it said guy, </connor>
<connor> it's just a college student showing Math, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like what? </connor>
<garnt> - I actually wanted to make a parody </garnt>
<garnt> of that video series, which is like </garnt>
<garnt> "professional degenerate
reacts to Hentai." </garnt>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You should totally do that. </garnt>
<connor> - I gotta make it now. </connor>
<joey> - You gotta make that
before it gets taken. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Some people saw the lawyer
things obviously with like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, I'm a specialized Japanese person. </connor>
<connor> I can react to..." </connor>
<connor> Not bashing on any chance to do it, </connor>
<connor> I just think it's really
weird and not weird, </connor>
<connor> but like unnecessary. </connor>
<garnt> - It's kind of like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> there's this trend that
makes sense, right? </garnt>
<joey> You have a professional qualified person </joey>
<joey> who has been doing this job for years, </joey>
<joey> like a lawyer or a doctor </joey>
<connor> and can actually provide insights. </connor>
<connor> And then as with everything, </connor>
<connor> as with every YouTube trend, </connor>
<connor> people like try to bend
it as much as possible </connor>
<connor> to be like, "Yeah, I'm kind of like... </connor>
<connor> I have a qualification in X kind of." </connor>
<joey> You know when you're in that job interview </joey>
<joey> and you try to buff up your fucking CV </joey>
<joey> with as much bullshit as
you can possibly imagine, </joey>
<garnt> that's kind of what it
feels like, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - So have you had any past jobs? </joey>
<joey> Well, I used to have to take out the trash </joey>
<garnt> every week at my parents'
place. (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<joey> That was kind of an obligation. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I remember back in the bridge scene </garnt>
<connor> where people were just like,
"Yeah, I do sound design." </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Motherfucker,
I know what the you do." </connor>
<joey> - Talking into a bull
yeti Is not sound design. </joey>
<garnt> Dude, if you're any
smaller Youtubers watching, </garnt>
<garnt> here's an idea for you, </garnt>
<joey> react to anything, but just call yourself </joey>
<joey> "Aspiring entrepreneur reacts to". </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> You'll get clicks like that. </joey>
<joey> That's free real estate, it's for you. </joey>
<joey> Okay, but to be fair though, </joey>
<garnt> we mentioned this earlier, </garnt>
<joey> but the "Doctor Reacts to Cells At Work"- </joey>
<joey> - That one was good.
- That shit was fucking great. </joey>
<joey> - No, like when this trend started, </joey>
<joey> I was all for this.
- [Joey And Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't often watch reaction videos, </garnt>
<garnt> but I watched all of those </garnt>
<joey> because the dude was
A, charismatic as fuck. </joey>
<connor> I forgot the name, it was Doctor... </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen it, I've seen it. </connor>
<connor> - I think my favorite one </connor>
<connor> is that guy who breaks down accents </connor>
<connor> and reacts to accents.
- He so good, the WIRED guy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the guy on WIRED, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Derek Singer, I think his name is. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah.
- I love those videos so much </joey>
<joey> I basically ripped out your mind. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you tell me.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I was like,
"Oh man, this is fun, </connor>
<connor> I can explain this." </connor>
<joey> - Not gonna lie, when I
saw that on my sub feed, </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Fuck, that's a good idea." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I wish I did that. </joey>
<connor> - I mean I thought, "Why not, man? </connor>
<connor> I've been doing this for years." </connor>
<joey> - I was actually gonna
do something similar. </joey>
<joey> I was gonna name myself,
"Japanese expert." </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was gonna react to foreigners in films </joey>
<garnt> doing Japanese accents
or speaking in Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, can you still do it. </garnt>
<joey> - I might still do that,
but I don't know... </joey>
<garnt> - Are you a qualified Japanese person? </garnt>
<connor> - You weren't born and raised here Joey, </connor>
<connor> I mean I don't know...
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I have a certificate though. </joey>
<joey> - How many years experience
do you have being Japanese? </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Only 26 years you know. </garnt>
<connor> - The amount of videos I've seen that has </connor>
<connor> "Japanese person reacts to Filthy Frank" </connor>
<joey> is like way too many. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There there's so many, </joey>
<joey> it's like this should not be necessary. </joey>
<joey> Like it's just a Japanese- </joey>
<joey> - Also it's like, who cares? </joey>
<joey> - And also you probably
won't get a really authentic </joey>
<connor> cause most of the time the
Japanese people that are doing it </connor>
<connor> are doing it in English. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- So they're like, you know... </connor>
<connor> I mean, I'm not gonna lie, </connor>
<connor> but the foreigners that I've spoken to, </connor>
<connor> or the Japanese people that I've spoken to </connor>
<connor> that studied abroad, are very different </connor>
<connor> to the Japanese people who are Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - I love that half the videos as well </connor>
<connor> it's like "Japanese
reacts to Filthy Frank." </connor>
<connor> And it's just an American
born Japanese guy, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's like, "You're an American dude. </garnt>
<connor> You're not even Japanese." </connor>
<connor> - That's an interesting point actually. </connor>
<connor> I would actually like... </connor>
<connor> That's interesting content. </connor>
<joey> Say you take a video and actually sub it </joey>
<joey> and then show it to a
Japanese person subbed, </joey>
<joey> and see how he reacts to it. </joey>
<joey> That would be interesting I think. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that would be interesting, </garnt>
<connor> but the problem is no one
can be fucked to do that. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> It's just too much effort. </joey>
<connor> - What other Youtubers do
you guys enjoy watching? </connor>
<joey> - Well I have a Youtuber
who is up and coming. </joey>
<connor> I found him fucking, </connor>
<connor> like maybe when he had less than 10K subs. </connor>
<connor> But he's this guy called Johnstone. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - And he's a Pokemon Youtuber. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - But unlike every other
Pokemon Youtuber out there, </connor>
<joey> he kind of takes Pokemon challenges </joey>
<connor> and kind of goes way overboard. </connor>
<connor> - Is this the guy who, this
guy beat the whole game </connor>
<connor> with a ditto or something? </connor>
<joey> - No, that's Pikasprey.
- Okay. </joey>
<connor> - That's another guy who I also follow. </connor>
<connor> So Johnstone is this guy who does </connor>
<connor> these absurd Pokemon challenges </connor>
<connor> and just condenses them into one video. </connor>
<connor> So like SmallAnt is a guy
who also does similar things. </connor>
<connor> He's a massive Twitch streamer. </connor>
<connor> But Johnstone kind of like, </connor>
<connor> he does these ridiculous challenges. </connor>
<connor> Like, can I beat the
entirety of Pokemon fire red </connor>
<connor> with just one Raj and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> And he not only puts his
own personality into it, </connor>
<connor> but kind of breaks down
how to do it as well. </connor>
<connor> So if people want to do it, then they can. </connor>
<connor> And I think it's only recently that, </connor>
<connor> you know, we were talking about </connor>
<connor> people who make content
which is very informational, </connor>
<connor> but then try and put their
own personality to it. </connor>
<connor> I feel like he's a guy who's like, </connor>
<connor> just starting to learn how to do that </connor>
<connor> and just kind of growing off of it. </connor>
<joey> And it's been really
cool to watch him grow. </joey>
<connor> - There's a few channels like that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I watch, is it Gamechamp3000? </connor>
<connor> I think I have it written down here. </connor>
<connor> He does the beading like X game </connor>
<connor> without collecting a coin or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And like, I don't know
why he would do that, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it sounds like pain. </joey>
<connor> - SmallAnt does that too, </connor>
<connor> I recently watched him do. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Can I beat Pokemon
fire red with only Shinies?" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> So what he would do is like he would... </connor>
<connor> And he would do this all live on Twitch </connor>
<connor> and then just make a video on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> So every time the starters would come up </connor>
<connor> and if none of them are shiny,
he'd just reset the game. </connor>
<connor> And he'd keep going until
the startle was shiny. </connor>
<joey> - That's like speed runners kind of, </joey>
<garnt> what's the word I'm looking for? </garnt>
<garnt> Dedication. </garnt>
<joey> - Or another one was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Can I beat all of Pokemon
Emerald without taking damage?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<joey> - And every time he took
damage he had to reset. </joey>
<connor> - I think I saw that, </connor>
<connor> I think I've seen that one.
That one sounds familiar. </connor>
<joey> - It went quite viral I think. </joey>
<garnt> - I think I've seen a few videos like that </garnt>
<joey> where it's like no damage
dark souls (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - [Joey And Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, there is always
a fucking trip to watch. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I love watching
those kinds of content </joey>
<connor> 'cause I think I've just
gotten so into speed running </connor>
<connor> and like just people who
are just way too good </connor>
<joey> at games for their own good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's a fair amount </joey>
<joey> of speed running dedicated channels. </joey>
<garnt> Just thinking of it, none
of them are quite nearly </garnt>
<garnt> the level of obviously, Summoning Salt, </garnt>
<garnt> which everyone loves. </garnt>
<connor> - Summoning Salts. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like it's Summoning Salt, </connor>
<garnt> then kind of everyone else. </garnt>
<connor> - Not to be rude to everyone else, </connor>
<connor> but he's just definitely doing something </connor>
<connor> that's clearly appealing to everyone. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like what he does so well </garnt>
<joey> is that he just knows kind of
like how to present a story. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like, okay... </joey>
<joey> He's one of the few
channels where I'm like, </joey>
<connor> I don't really know
his personality, right? </connor>
<connor> But the stories that he picks
to present on his channel </connor>
<connor> are like a banger every time. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause if you don't have a
personality in your channel, </connor>
<connor> then that puts pressure
to make the subject </connor>
<connor> you are presenting, </connor>
<connor> that has to carry your video, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's normally easier to have </connor>
<connor> a nice, interesting personality </connor>
<connor> that people want to come back to. </connor>
<connor> But if you're someone like Summoning Salt, </connor>
<connor> who for some reason knows how to present </connor>
<connor> the most compelling speed running stories </connor>
<connor> every fucking time, I'm just... </connor>
<connor> - It's like watching a movie. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - His recent one with the
perfect Mario 64 record </garnt>
<garnt> is so good, it's really good.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It was so good. </connor>
<connor> - I also really love his... </connor>
<joey> Which one was it? </joey>
<joey> The Ninja Gaiden one, the cowboy dude, </joey>
<joey> I love that guy.
(Garnt giggles) </joey>
<connor> He's so nice and it made
for such a good story. </connor>
<joey> - It's so cool as well, </joey>
<joey> because I found so many cool speed runners </joey>
<garnt> because of his videos, as well, </garnt>
<garnt> just because the way he kind of sells them </garnt>
<garnt> and also just kind of lays
out their entire journey, </garnt>
<garnt> is just like... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what it is because it's like, </garnt>
<connor> truth be told, he's not
the most charismatic, </connor>
<connor> or interesting presenter, </connor>
<connor> but he just manages to write and present </connor>
<connor> and kind of tell a story in a way </connor>
<joey> that you just have to watch. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's like,
there's always the hook. </garnt>
<connor> It almost follows the
structure of a movie. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean?
- [Joey] All right. </connor>
<connor> - There's the hook, there's the beginning, </connor>
<connor> the middle of the end. </connor>
<connor> And the end is always
like a really big climax </connor>
<connor> that you're like, "Wow,
this was worth sitting </connor>
<connor> through like 45 minutes
to an hour watching </connor>
<connor> just so I could have seen this climax </connor>
<garnt> and get invested into this story." </garnt>
<joey> - I'm glad I sat through
45 minutes to know that, </joey>
<connor> that cowboy dude got
a sub 10 in Ninja guy. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I'm so glad these efforts
are gonna pay off, man. </garnt>
<joey> It was so worth it, clap. </joey>
<joey> Everybody applause. </joey>
<connor> - You try to explain
this content to someone </connor>
<connor> who just knows nothing
about speed running, </connor>
<connor> and it's just like why'd
you care so much about- </connor>
<connor> - It's because he's tried his best man. </connor>
<garnt> - It's one of those things
where it's like, just watch. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I think again, </garnt>
<garnt> this is why I love
documentaries and all that, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I just love the human
aspect of stories and the... </connor>
<connor> I guess, almost human
life is more interesting </connor>
<connor> because weird shit happens
that you couldn't even predict. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's so interesting
and obviously like... </connor>
<connor> I also think that Summoning
Salt is really similar </connor>
<joey> to Frederick Knudsen,
which is like my favorite- </joey>
<joey> - Down the Rabbit Hole?
- Yeah down the Rabbit Hole, </joey>
<joey> which is like literally my
favorite channel on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - I still haven't seen his new one. </joey>
<joey> - No, I haven't seen his new one either. </joey>
<joey> - I just think the sheer
amount of dedication </joey>
<joey> to the story and getting
all the facts there </joey>
<connor> is just insane. </connor>
<connor> And I think every time I get drunk, </connor>
<connor> I watch their "Wings Of Redemption". </connor>
<joey> - That's the problem with Knudsen though, </joey>
<joey> is that every time he does upload a video, </joey>
<garnt> it's like a yay moment as
well as an oh shit moment. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's a yay moment </garnt>
<garnt> because he uploads like three months. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's an oh shit
moment because it's like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, okay, what day in my calendar is free </joey>
<garnt> to watch this video?" </garnt>
<joey> - You know there are some content creators </joey>
<connor> that you just watch immediately. </connor>
<connor> And there's some content creators
where you make mental note </connor>
<garnt> and you're like, "They haven't loaded it." </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, "Okay,
I gotta find time." </garnt>
<joey> - Like "The Right Opinion"
is the exact same thing. </joey>
<garnt> Every time he uploads, it's like, "oh, </garnt>
<garnt> it's another two hour
video about Right Opinion." </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna be a banger, </garnt>
<joey> but man, I'm not free for like three days. </joey>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I have so much respect
for "Right Opinion" </garnt>
<connor> because normally I can't
stand commentary channels </connor>
<connor> most of the time-
- yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Because it's just the
biggest free for all. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I don't know why
some people are so fucking loud </joey>
<joey> and I don't know why some people
listen to the other people. </joey>
<joey> It's just a fucking- </joey>
<joey> - And it's almost always biased. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's so biased,
it's always a fucking mess. </joey>
<joey> But dude, if "Right Opinion"
makes a video about you, </joey>
<joey> I'm fucking listening. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I was in one of his videos. </joey>
<joey> - (laughing) Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Featuring Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I was in one of his videos. </joey>
<joey> Thanks for that, by the way. </joey>
<joey> - If I get destroyed by "Right Opinion", </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, yeah, "Okay
I did something wrong, </garnt>
<joey> my bad, my bad."
- But that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like when people were telling me </joey>
<connor> that I was in like a
"Right Opinion" video, </connor>
<connor> in my head I was like, "Yay" </connor>
<joey> and shit at the same time. </joey>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, you got a cameo, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - I got a cameo but it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Is that gonna be good, is my career over? </joey>
<joey> Oh my God!" </joey>
<joey> Luckily I was fine. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause he has such a good skill </joey>
<joey> in breaking down the key
components about what, </joey>
<joey> you know, someone's personal mistakes. </joey>
<joey> - He just tells it how it is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, without... </joey>
<joey> He is obviously biased,
but every time he has </joey>
<connor> any kind of bias in it,
he says it up front. </connor>
<connor> And in the end, he lets the
viewer make their own opinion </connor>
<connor> rather than telling the viewer how... </connor>
<connor> You know, what opinion they should have. </connor>
<garnt> Like he presents the facts, </garnt>
<garnt> he presents his biase
and then he doesn't say, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, you should fucking
hate this person." </garnt>
<garnt> He just says, you can make... </garnt>
<garnt> It's kinda like you make your own opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean.
- Right, right, right. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, obviously I watched
the fucking four hour video </connor>
<joey> in one go because I was dying that day. </joey>
<joey> - Nikocado Avocado.
- Disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - I got like halfway
through then I was like... </joey>
<connor> - It felt like it was
just repeating at times, </connor>
<connor> but that's because he
does repeat his real life </connor>
<connor> multiple times, his mistakes. </connor>
<connor> I think the only video that
I was kind of like meh on, </connor>
<joey> I think he made a video on
the animation community. </joey>
<joey> And I remember feeling like, "All right, </joey>
<joey> this is kind of like,
all right, kind of meh." </joey>
<joey> - Was that the done as a plan? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, that one
was good I liked that. </joey>
<joey> It was talking about
the animation community </joey>
<connor> and I think how they all rely
on each other for success. </connor>
<connor> And it was kind of like
warning that they shouldn't... </connor>
<connor> But I really didn't
feel like it was like... </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Okay, cool. </connor>
<joey> I mean, it doesn't really say anything." </joey>
<joey> But I mean, overall, yeah. </joey>
<joey> He's just amazing at
presenting an opinion. </joey>
<joey> Also, Frederick Knudsen by the way is... </joey>
<joey> Because we didn't explain what it was, </joey>
<connor> he does documentary on anything basically. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Choose a documentary on anything- </connor>
<joey> - Any one personal event or anything. </joey>
<joey> - It was so well done that
it's just like, "Oh my God!" </joey>
<joey> Again, he has a video on
"Wings Of Redemption", </joey>
<joey> who I had no idea who that was, </joey>
<connor> but I watched the full two
hour like 30 minute thing, </connor>
<connor> it's amazing, it's so good. </connor>
<connor> - It's nuts how people can just </connor>
<connor> make a compelling
narrative about anything, </connor>
<connor> especially when something where it's like, </connor>
<garnt> "I never knew about this
and never cared about it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I guess now that
I'm here, I'm invested." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I feel like
I watched that content, </garnt>
<garnt> not only because it's entertaining, </garnt>
<connor> but I also as this is my job. </connor>
<connor> - Oh I can appreciate the work so much. </connor>
<connor> - I appreciate because they
also break down as a Youtuber, </connor>
<connor> like how the best way to
present yourself online is in. </connor>
<connor> And the mistakes of what not to do. </connor>
<connor> - Write that down, write that down. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's exactly the point. </connor>
<connor> Because they break it down
so well that you can... </connor>
<joey> If this is your job and
social media is your job, </joey>
<joey> then you can literally take
advice about what not to do </joey>
<joey> and the mistakes that
other people have made. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a self-help guide. </joey>
<joey> - It is, it really is, it really is. </joey>
<joey> - All right, don't do that, noted. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, wait, before we move on. </joey>
<joey> Okay here's a question for you guys. </joey>
<connor> Have you guys ever rehearsed </connor>
<connor> a kind of like an apology video? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no.
(Joey laghing) </connor>
<connor> - You've never done? </connor>
<connor> Even though you've done nothing wrong, </connor>
<connor> even though you've done
nothing wrong, right? </connor>
<garnt> Come on, you must have thought about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah in my head
I've thought about it, </garnt>
<connor> but I haven't sat there in
front the mirror being like... </connor>
<garnt> - Oh no, no, no, not actually rehearsing, </garnt>
<garnt> but like in my head.
- I've thought about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wake up every morning and I practice </garnt>
<connor> the sigh before it begins, you know the... </connor>
<garnt> (Joey inhales and exhales deeply) </garnt>
<connor> This is a really hot video to make. </connor>
<connor> - In your head, you've thought about it </connor>
<garnt> and you've gone okay. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, there's a few ways to go about it. </connor>
<garnt> There's the double down, </garnt>
<garnt> there's the do nothing, </garnt>
<garnt> there's the apologize
and admit wrongdoing. </garnt>
<garnt> And from what I've seen on YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> it seems to be unfortunately </garnt>
<garnt> that people always want an apology, </garnt>
<garnt> but the people who apologized
and admit wrongdoing, </garnt>
<garnt> normally get the worst treatment. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I notice the people who doubled down </garnt>
<garnt> normally get away with it. </garnt>
<joey> So other Youtubers double the fuck down, </joey>
<joey> just go with it.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Every time, double down. </joey>
<joey> - Because I don't have anything in my past </joey>
<joey> that I expect I'm gonna need
to make an apology video, </joey>
<joey> but nobody fucking expects me </joey>
<joey> to need to make an apology video, right? </joey>
<joey> So as you see, as a Youtuber, </joey>
<connor> I see these trends happening. </connor>
<connor> I see like cancel culture happening, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "But what if I did need
to make an apology?" </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean.
(Joey and Connor laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Like V-Soul's music stopped playing. </garnt>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> I dint need to apologize,
but what if I did? </connor>
<connor> Do you watch any other
documentary channels </connor>
<connor> similar to theirs, 'cause I have a few. </connor>
<connor> Actually, you know, on
the note of YouTube, </connor>
<connor> I think that EmpLemon makes
good ones about YouTube. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I-
- I know his name. </connor>
<joey> I probably seen a few of this stuff. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like his presenting style, </connor>
<connor> I don't really gel with, </connor>
<connor> but I think the way that
he talks about YouTube, </connor>
<connor> I think it's really well done. </connor>
<connor> And he's clearly someone who is... </connor>
<connor> I guess I can see parallels between me </connor>
<connor> and the way that he
talks about the internet </connor>
<connor> and the way that like I was, </connor>
<connor> from like age 10, I was
glued to the internet. </connor>
<connor> He talks about how... </connor>
<connor> Realistically let's say, </connor>
<connor> I think he made a video
about YouTube likes. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So, on paper, if you see
90% likes to dislike ratio, </connor>
<joey> any mathematician would be like, </joey>
<joey> "That's great, that's great. </joey>
<joey> That's 9:1." </joey>
<joey> But a Youtuber sees that
and thinks, "oh fuck." </joey>
<joey> - Why isn't it 95?
- Exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - So he basically did a whole video </joey>
<joey> explaining how the actual
YouTube like ratio system </joey>
<joey> is like 99% is good. </joey>
<joey> 98% is you've probably off a little bit </joey>
<joey> of your audience. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 95% is you've probably said
something a little bit bad. </joey>
<garnt> And anything below 90
is like, you fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- Which is true. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is definitely true. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he made a video as well
that was really well done. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a fuck about NASCAR. </garnt>
<garnt> He did a bit of a thing about NASCAR </garnt>
<garnt> that was really good. </garnt>
<garnt> He also made a video about
Hungrybox, the smash player. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt And Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And that was a really
pretty good documentary. </connor>
<joey> - I do like I do like watching... </joey>
<joey> I'm not subscribed to any of them, </joey>
<joey> but I do like watching Smash compilations </joey>
<joey> every now and then. </joey>
<connor> - I mean the smash documentary
that came out years ago, </connor>
<joey> was amazing on YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that was- </garnt>
<connor> - Was that the four-hour
smash documentary? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That was the documentary
that got me into- </connor>
<connor> - Got me into smash.
- Not just got me into Smash, </connor>
<connor> but got me into YouTube
documentaries as well. </connor>
<connor> I dunno who made that, </connor>
<connor> but it was like this very famous
four-hour Smash documentary </connor>
<connor> that is like way out of date now </connor>
<connor> because it detailed, the very, very start </connor>
<garnt> of the Smash community.
- Again, a human story. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. It is. </connor>
<connor> - They build up the characters
of the story, and it did it. </connor>
<connor> Other channels if you guys
like Frederick Knutson, </connor>
<joey> I know you probably don't
know these channels. </joey>
<joey> There's "Anxiety War", I don't
know if you've heard of them. </joey>
<joey> Not Anxiety War, sorry, sorry, fuck. </joey>
<connor> There's the- </connor>
<joey> - I don't subscribe to a
lot of the documentaries. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause again, they just take so much time. </joey>
<joey> - True, there's no Anxiety War, sorry. </joey>
<garnt> I'll talk about him though
later, He's fucking strange. </garnt>
<garnt> Atrocity Guide? </garnt>
<joey> She does videos similar
to Frederick Knudsen. </joey>
<joey> - I know that name. </joey>
<joey> - Her voice is so fucking
chilling and creepy </joey>
<connor> that even the ones that
aren't scary, feels scary. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it's like, (panting)
what's gonna happen? </connor>
<connor> What's gonna happen? </connor>
<connor> Very good, and then- </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not subscribed to him, but J Aubrey? </garnt>
<connor> - J Aubrey, yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Every time his video
comes up to my recommended, </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, yeah this seems like a- </garnt>
<joey> - Who's the guy who did that, </joey>
<connor> or who is doing the massive crochet- </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I was gonna get on with it. </joey>
<garnt> - That's GenoSamuel2.1, </garnt>
<garnt> he lives in Japan by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you want to explain that? </garnt>
<connor> Because Connor showed
us this the other day. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll talk about... </garnt>
<garnt> We'll be back to Joey
in some other channels. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's a channel called GinoSamuel2.1. </garnt>
<connor> And like his whole channel is dedicated </connor>
<connor> to the history of Chris Chan. </connor>
<connor> You know who Chris Chan is, he's very- </connor>
<joey> - Infamous?
- Infamous online. </joey>
<joey> And the whole point of, if
you know what Kiwi Farms is, </joey>
<joey> it's a shit talking website. </joey>
<connor> That whole website was made
to document Chris Chan, </connor>
<connor> because there's so much information </connor>
<connor> about this one person online. </connor>
<garnt> - He's probably the most
documented person in history. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the like, it's kind of like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean we watched what, like- </garnt>
<connor> - Two episodes. </connor>
<connor> - We watched two episodes. </connor>
<garnt> - We watched two out of how many episodes? </garnt>
<joey> - I think there are nearly 50 of them now. </joey>
<joey> - How long were the episodes? </joey>
<joey> Like 40 minutes. </joey>
<connor> - At least 40 minutes each. </connor>
<connor> - So we watched an hour
and a half of this- </connor>
<connor> - Prologue.
- This prologue. </connor>
<connor> Not even the fucking prologue, </connor>
<connor> and the amount of information
they got about this guy's life </connor>
<garnt> was just fucking mind blowing. </garnt>
<garnt> - From like age five. </garnt>
<garnt> - From age five. </garnt>
<garnt> This episode is sponsored by a Apari. </garnt>
<connor> - shit, is that what
I'm wearing right now? </connor>
<joey> - Look at these clean fucking
clothes we're wearing. </joey>
<joey> - Look at this design man. </joey>
<joey> - Look at this drip. </joey>
<connor> - Is this artist owned anime
inspired quality clothing? </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] I think it is.
- You bet your ass it is boy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna lie fam,
this is pretty fucking... </joey>
<garnt> I know I mean with a little
bit, but this is nice. </garnt>
<connor> - Look how blinging you
look right now, man. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love the bucket hat. </connor>
<garnt> - I know.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's thanks to the
quality fabric by the way </garnt>
<connor> and the original art. </connor>
<connor> Did you know that, though? </connor>
<joey> - It is anime inspired as well, </joey>
<connor> which is nice for the (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - And Also, I'm not gonna lie, </joey>
<connor> I fuck with the color schemes.
- I fuck with the colors too, </connor>
<connor> it's really nice.
- I like the fun color code. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I saw this design </connor>
<connor> and if they weren't sponsoring me, </connor>
<connor> I would have bought it anyway. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, same. </connor>
<connor> - This is like so me. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And they gave us a cute little cute- </connor>
<garnt> - This little key chain. </garnt>
<connor> - So me and Joey are wearing... </connor>
<connor> Oh, Mayline is throwing
us an extra shirt to show. </connor>
<connor> A jumper, sorry.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> But this is from, me
and Connor are wearing- </joey>
<connor> - This is from the fall winter collection. </connor>
<connor> And trust me, these boys are thick. </connor>
<connor> I'm very hot right now. </connor>
<connor> - They'll keep you warm, </connor>
<connor> they'll definitely keep you warm. </connor>
<connor> - We are inside and I wanna take this off. </connor>
<connor> I'm too hot right now.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> So thank you, I actually love this shit. </connor>
<connor> And Garnt has some of the shirt
designs as he's mentioned. </connor>
<connor> He also has another one. </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you Apari.
- God damn! </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you Apari for
sending me more clothes. </connor>
<connor> I have more clothes to
wear on Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> cause I am running out of my wardrobe now. </connor>
<connor> And this is the shit
I would wear normally. </connor>
<connor> - That design is fucking sexy. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, that's some fucking sexy- </garnt>
<garnt> - I also got some facemasks
but they're at home </garnt>
<joey> 'cause they're dirty and
I've been using them. </joey>
<joey> - So put up an image, there they are. </joey>
<joey> - They are really fucking cute. </joey>
<joey> I had the most stylish facemask. </joey>
<connor> I do, I don't wanna clown all these. </connor>
<connor> But I did have the most stylish ones. </connor>
<connor> And this crisp bucket hat fellas. </connor>
<joey> - I do like the bucket hat. </joey>
<connor> - Because, no joke, when I go in the sun, </connor>
<connor> not right now obviously, but
when I get in the summer, </connor>
<joey> if I went out without a hat
I would just get a headache. </joey>
<joey> - But now you got it. </joey>
<joey> - Mayline said I was disgusting one time </joey>
<connor> 'cause I sweat in her bucket hat, </connor>
<connor> that she borrowed me.
(hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Apari releases new
collections every season. </connor>
<connor> So if you wanna stay up to date
with their latest clothing, </connor>
<connor> follow them on Instagram @apariart. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Or sign up to their
mailing list at apari.com. </garnt>
<garnt> - Trust me fellas, you're not
gonna wanna miss these drops, </garnt>
<connor> these are clean. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah if you want some slick weeb drip, </joey>
<joey> then Apari is the place to go. </joey>
<joey> So thank you Apari for
sponsoring this episode, </joey>
<joey> and back to the video. </joey>
<connor> - So his whole channel is dedicated </connor>
<connor> to discussing Chris Chan. </connor>
<connor> And you're probably thinking like, </connor>
<connor> there can't be that much on this dude. </connor>
<connor> They've made biopics </connor>
<connor> about some of the most interesting people </connor>
<connor> and they're only two hours long. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where on that pod, </connor>
<connor> like it's something near 50, or 50. </connor>
<connor> And the reason why his
channel's called 2.1 </connor>
<connor> is cause I've been watching
this since like episode five- </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - His channel got taken down at one point. </connor>
<connor> I think episode 15 or something </connor>
<connor> and he decided to quit talking about it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what happened, </connor>
<connor> 'cause he got out.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> He came back, he came- </connor>
<garnt> - He just when I thought I was out, </garnt>
<connor> they pull me back in. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - And he's back doing it now. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know how far we are
into it but all the comments. </joey>
<joey> And actually Chris Chan
replies to every single video. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - Tries to correct details. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Didn't even question about the fact that </joey>
<connor> he's making these videos, huh? </connor>
<connor> - Chris Chan seems to like it. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, I think it's she now, </connor>
<connor> sorry for the the naming. </connor>
<joey> But yeah, it's really interesting </joey>
<joey> and I hope that you keep
finishing the thing, </joey>
<joey> you get to the end. </joey>
<joey> I don't even wanna know how
much a mental toll that is. </joey>
<garnt> - How far are we through
Chris Chan's life right now? </garnt>
<connor> - I think maybe halfway, I'm not sure. </connor>
<garnt> - And how many hours of content </garnt>
<garnt> do you think has been made? </garnt>
<connor> - About 30 plus at the moment. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, let's do the math. </joey>
<joey> If each episode is at least 30 minutes </joey>
<connor> and there's like 50, right? </connor>
<joey> - There was like 15 episodes </joey>
<connor> to just Chris Chan being trolled. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, when you showed
us that at your place, </joey>
<joey> we watched the first two episodes </joey>
<joey> and we hadn't even made it past age 10. </joey>
<connor> - With the majority of the videos </connor>
<joey> have been about trolling Chris Chan. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's a good chance
they might reply it here </joey>
<joey> but I mean, it's super interesting </joey>
<joey> and if you wanna... </joey>
<garnt> It's so bad as well because Chris Chan </garnt>
<garnt> is autistic and constantly says it, </garnt>
<garnt> and constantly says
high functioning autism. </garnt>
<garnt> And in the documentary, </garnt>
<garnt> you kinda like in the start, </garnt>
<joey> you really want to root for him </joey>
<joey> because he's clearly
just been unfortunate. </joey>
<joey> - He's had a rough life. </joey>
<joey> - And his parent as well,
they're super questionable. </joey>
<joey> And then the moment you're
about to root for him, </joey>
<garnt> he's just like, "I don't like gays, </garnt>
<garnt> I think that blacks are less than people, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like God fucking damnit. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - He had us in the first half. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah he literally has
us in the first half </connor>
<connor> and then it's like, God damnit, man. </connor>
<joey> (Connor grunts) </joey>
<joey> - You're so close. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's like the Tiger
King documentary, right? </joey>
<joey> They want you to root for Joe Exotic, </joey>
<connor> but they leave out all the
racist that Joe was saying. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think I would
have rooted for him. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's just good storytelling, right? </connor>
<joey> - What I find fucking
terrifying about the first two </joey>
<connor> episodes of this
documentary that I watched- </connor>
<connor> - Sheer amount of information. </connor>
<connor> - Was just the sheer of a
sheer amount of information, </connor>
<connor> and the of a sheer amount
of intimate information </connor>
<garnt> that I probably wouldn't
even know about my own life </garnt>
<garnt> at that age, </garnt>
<garnt> let alone someone else's life. </garnt>
<connor> - So Chris Chan, the
one of the first things </connor>
<connor> that opened wide, like
the whole trolling thing </connor>
<connor> is that when it was all started, </connor>
<connor> and I'm sure the comments will correct me </connor>
<connor> if I'm wrong on these details, </connor>
<connor> 'cause people are all
like Historians about him. </connor>
<connor> I think they call them Christorians? </connor>
<connor> - Christorians.
(hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Is what they call themselves. </connor>
<connor> So...
- I love that. </connor>
<connor> - Internet Christorians.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - When they first started the
dramatica thread about him- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The first thing that Chris did was- </connor>
<connor> - Correct it? </connor>
<connor> - Correct it by overloading
it with personal information, </connor>
<connor> thinking that they would get bored. </connor>
<connor> But he just gave them everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it was at that point- </connor>
<connor> - Zero privacy.
- I knew I was hooked. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> Because I was fascinated by it. </connor>
<joey> - I couldn't believe that </joey>
<connor> he was the one who invented Sonichu. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he's the one who made Sonichu. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause Sonichu was just... </connor>
<connor> If you don't know what Sonechu is, </connor>
<connor> there's probably a picture
of it on the screen, </connor>
<connor> this monstrocity. </connor>
<connor> The massive meme right on the internet. </connor>
<connor> And for the longest time I
saw that shit everywhere- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was just like,
where did this come from? </joey>
<joey> But now I know it's from the
brilliant mind of Chris Chan. </joey>
<joey> So thank you for that. </joey>
<connor> - Other good channels
that do documentaries, </connor>
<connor> there's a guy called Toad McKinley </connor>
<garnt> and he did a two part
documentary on Chris Hanson </garnt>
<garnt> and that whole debacle. </garnt>
<garnt> It was really good, actually, </garnt>
<connor> that was good. </connor>
<garnt> - And how long are these documentaries? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I know you watched
more documentaries </connor>
<connor> than both of us combined. </connor>
<garnt> - A lot of documentaries you can leave </garnt>
<garnt> on in the background I feel, </garnt>
<connor> like watching the Chris Chan ones, </connor>
<connor> they're so long and often it's basically </connor>
<joey> playing a whole audio clip for 20 minutes. </joey>
<joey> You get the gist. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's just a podcast about Chris Chan. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's just a podcast about Chris Chan </connor>
<connor> with someone else narrating his life. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - And obviously, I
watch J. Aubrey as well. </connor>
<connor> I think J. Aubrey is good
friends with Right Opinion. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I can tell, they're
styles are similar, </garnt>
<joey> but different enough that, </joey>
<joey> their content stands out for themselves. </joey>
<joey> But I kind of respect that
content in the same way </joey>
<joey> where they really know how to break down, </joey>
<connor> how public perception can warp an opinion </connor>
<garnt> of a certain person. </garnt>
<connor> - I think sometimes coming to channels, </connor>
<connor> I don't like being told
what my opinion should be. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like
sometimes, some narrations, </connor>
<connor> like I think some video in J. Aubrey, </connor>
<connor> the way he narrates would be like, </connor>
<connor> all right, you should think this way. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure he doesn't intend to, </connor>
<connor> that's just the way I perceived it. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, it's still amazing videos. </connor>
<garnt> - It's either one way or the other way. </garnt>
<garnt> Where if commentary channels either, </garnt>
<connor> I know you're a fucking clown </connor>
<connor> and I know no one's gonna
fucking listen to you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, someone like Kim Star. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - It's either one way or the other way. </connor>
<connor> And there's so many
commentary channels I see </connor>
<connor> that hit that middle ground, </connor>
<connor> and think that they are the
fucking Holy grail of opinions. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Where it's just like, dude, it's just- </garnt>
<joey> - And then you have
some commentary channels </joey>
<joey> that just kind of are commentary channels, </joey>
<connor> like technically speaking, </connor>
<connor> but just the way that they present shit </connor>
<connor> and the topic they choose, </connor>
<connor> just kind of go away from commentary. </connor>
<connor> Like perfect example, who
I fucking love watching </connor>
<connor> is Leon Lush. </connor>
<connor> - I love Leon Lush. </connor>
<connor> More humor focused, I think. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But technically he's a
commentary channel, right? </connor>
<connor> Like technically speaking, </connor>
<connor> but the way he presents it </connor>
<connor> and the topics he covers
is just like, just so.. </connor>
<connor> It's like Cody Ko, with like the... </connor>
<joey> What's the series that he does, </joey>
<joey> where he cringes at shit? </joey>
<joey> I think it's just called "Cringe". </joey>
<connor> - I don't really watch Cody Ko, </connor>
<connor> or, what's the other guy? </connor>
<connor> Kurtis Conner is the other one? </connor>
<connor> That's like those three, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, 'cause I don't really watch them. </connor>
<connor> I watch a lot of... </connor>
<connor> I've really like Danny Gonzales, </connor>
<connor> I think he's really funny. </connor>
<connor> - Mmh! </connor>
<connor> - I think also the stuff
he does where he bought... </connor>
<garnt> There's this video he made, </garnt>
<garnt> where he spent like
$15,000 on YouTube ads, </garnt>
<garnt> that was such a fucking video. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I've seen that video. </garnt>
<connor> - That's such a good video. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, I didn't know
who you're talking about, </connor>
<connor> but I remember that, I
remember watching that video. </connor>
<garnt> - He has such a good personality. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And Drew Gooden as well, obviously. </connor>
<connor> Have you heard of the
channel called "Anxiety War"? </connor>
<connor> - No.
- I mentioned it briefly. </connor>
<connor> He basically does how to catch a predator. </connor>
<connor> Like that's his thing. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - But he's a psychopath.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know how you can... </connor>
<connor> He spends all day talking to pedophiles. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how you can do that. </connor>
<joey> Like how do you do that?
That's weird, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that is weird. </joey>
<joey> - But he goes and meets up
with them and film some. </joey>
<joey> And some of these dudes... </joey>
<connor> There's one dude he met up with </connor>
<connor> that was like eight foot or some shit. </connor>
<connor> This guy's built like a brick shit house. </connor>
<connor> And he turned up pretending to be a girl. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What?
- What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And so he goes up... </connor>
<connor> He literally just does
how to catch a predator. </connor>
<connor> But instead of going there with
armed police and everything, </connor>
<connor> he goes alone with a camera. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, you're insane. </connor>
<connor> - That's how he die. </connor>
<connor> - Does he have a crew or anything? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, it's just him. He
took it with a handheld camera. </connor>
<connor> - How many subscribers does he have? </connor>
<connor> - Oh God, Like over half a million. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's like
Chris Hanson hard mode. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - One health. </connor>
<connor> - I think one time the
predator, one of the... </connor>
<connor> Sorry, one of the
predators tried to sue him. </connor>
<connor> One of them did. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know if it worked out, </connor>
<connor> but the guy's got a strange personality </connor>
<connor> as well when you're watching him. </connor>
<connor> I watch him just for fascination, </connor>
<connor> just to see how this guy does it. </connor>
<connor> But man, it's such a
weird presenting style </connor>
<connor> and he's constantly giggling to himself </connor>
<connor> while he's recording it. </connor>
<connor> It's really weird, but
it's an interesting watch. </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's like... </connor>
<connor> It's something unnerving
about watching it, </connor>
<connor> because the content
that he's talking about </connor>
<connor> and the way that he's
talking about, like... </connor>
<connor> He's talking about how
we told someone on Xbox, </connor>
<connor> but it's actually some dude
who trying to fuck a kid </connor>
<connor> and it's like, okay, waw! </connor>
<garnt> - I'm kinda seeing a
pattern when all the content </garnt>
<connor> you're recommending and it is very much, </connor>
<connor> you just like the human aspect, </connor>
<garnt> a human kind of story behind it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a lot of channels that I like </garnt>
<joey> that I just think the
guy is a fucking weirdo </joey>
<joey> and I don't really like the personality, </joey>
<joey> but I think they're just
so fascinating to watch. </joey>
<joey> - I reckon you'd love this channel then </joey>
<joey> that AKI recently recommended to me, </joey>
<joey> called "Soft White Underbelly". </joey>
<connor> - That sounds familiar. </connor>
<garnt> - It's this guy who basically... </garnt>
<garnt> He's like this photographer guy, </garnt>
<garnt> but he basically goes around streets of LA </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that, </garnt>
<connor> and he picks up homeless
people for whatever reason </connor>
<connor> and they bring him in to interview them, </connor>
<connor> and kind of like talk about their life </connor>
<connor> and why they're homeless </connor>
<connor> and how they got there and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> So there's ones where he's like, </connor>
<connor> he picks up a dude from the street </connor>
<connor> and asks what he's about. </connor>
<connor> And he ended up being homeless because </connor>
<connor> he raped his mom or something, </connor>
<connor> or did something like this insane crime. </connor>
<connor> And these people just
fucking break down on camera </connor>
<connor> and just talking about their life. </connor>
<connor> And it's really raw, </connor>
<connor> but it's so fucking interesting to watch, </connor>
<connor> just because you
otherwise would never hear </connor>
<connor> about these people's lives, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And there's like no bullshit. </connor>
<connor> There's no snarky commentator
or presenter being like, </connor>
<connor> so tell us your story
about why you're homeless. </connor>
<connor> It's literally just listening to a dude, </connor>
<connor> try and communicate with
this clearly broken person </connor>
<connor> for whatever reason, </connor>
<connor> and you just... </connor>
<joey> Some of these backstories,
I'm just like, holy shit! </joey>
<connor> How were you alive? </connor>
<connor> - It's so 50-50 for me with those, </connor>
<connor> especially when they're
getting homeless people. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, it's
such a fine line between, </connor>
<connor> in my eyes being genuine
or just taking advantage. </connor>
<garnt> - Or this is kind of like reality TV, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's kinda like the, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> the backstory Olympics. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> - Like it's an x-factor audition. </connor>
<connor> - Where it's just like okay, </connor>
<garnt> who has the worst, most tragic backstory? </garnt>
<connor> Who do we want to cheer for, right? </connor>
<connor> - I'm already out, so I'm always like, </connor>
<connor> okay, some of them I
could definitely see... </connor>
<connor> God, there was a channel where </connor>
<connor> this guy interviews meth heads and stuff. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the name of
it off the top of my head, </connor>
<joey> but that's a really good channel. </joey>
<connor> But he did like a really
raw, emotional issues... </connor>
<joey> - I feel like with the
way that you present it... </joey>
<connor> I've seen a bunch of his videos </connor>
<connor> and they all seem pretty fucking genuine. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, if you say so then I trust you. </connor>
<connor> - It's a gut feeling, </connor>
<connor> I've seen the fake ones before, </connor>
<connor> and this one definitely doesn't
seem like the fake ones. </connor>
<connor> - Just a lot of them
where it's like sad music, </connor>
<joey> royalty three and they've
picked up some crackhead. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - No, you know, if there's
fucking sad music in the back it, </garnt>
<garnt> it's probably fucking scripted. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, you must feel sad
now because of the sad music. </joey>
<garnt> It's also the sad music, </garnt>
<joey> you know they've gone
from the YouTube library, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you've heard it
a million times before </joey>
<joey> on like other channels. </joey>
<joey> - I see you're also using Kevin Mcloud. </joey>
<garnt> (cast laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I was in a shopping mall the other day </garnt>
<joey> and I was walking past this makeup section </joey>
<joey> and they were using that fucking ukulele. </joey>
<connor> (cast imitating ukulele sound) </connor>
<joey> Fucking ukulele YouTube stock music. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<garnt> - That's my favorite piece of music. </garnt>
<joey> Just because I can envision
every video that uses it. </joey>
<garnt> It's like way too fucking white. </garnt>
<connor> The white balance is totally off, </connor>
<connor> it's way too bright, way too sunny, </connor>
<connor> the background is way too clean, </connor>
<garnt> and it always starts with, "Hey guys." </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey guys.
(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - "Today here's my outfit of the day." </joey>
<joey> - I look back to that period </joey>
<joey> and just think, well, why ukulele? </joey>
<garnt> Why did every blogger at
one point have a ukulele? </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't be sad listening to a ukulele. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> You can't play it like,
"Oh shit I'm about to cry." </joey>
<connor> The fucking ukulele like
(imitates ukulele music). </connor>
<joey> - But it's also the kind of like, </joey>
<connor> my family is dying around
me and I'm crying ukulele. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<joey> Do you guys like "Report Of The Week"? </joey>
<connor> - I love "Report Of The Week".
- I love "Report Of The Week". </connor>
<joey> - He is in a league of his
own in terms of content. </joey>
<connor> - I also think of him as
like a category of creator. </connor>
<connor> Like I can often compare courageous to him </connor>
<connor> in the sense of that's the
kind of charm that they have. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, what other creators
do you think they are like? </garnt>
<connor> - Buffcorell? </connor>
<connor> - I was about to say Buffcorell. </connor>
<connor> I wanted to shout out my boy, Buffcorell. </connor>
<connor> Okay, how do you describe
Buffcorell as a channel? </connor>
<connor> - It is just, you can never
leave one of his videos </connor>
<connor> not being happy. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just a guy literally Buffcorrell, </connor>
<connor> that's his name, he's buff. </connor>
<connor> He dances and sings. </connor>
<connor> His singing is horrible, </connor>
<joey> but in such an endearing and funny way </joey>
<joey> that you'd love it. </joey>
<connor> - But the boy can dance. </connor>
<joey> The boy can fucking dance. </joey>
<joey> And he's buff as fuck as well. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> I love this man so much. </connor>
<connor> - The first time you
watch any of his videos, </connor>
<connor> everyone goes on the same trip </connor>
<garnt> where like starts dancing, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, "Okay,
this boy can dance." </garnt>
<connor> - Please pause this video </connor>
<garnt> and go and watch one video then come back. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then he opens his mouth </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like the
fucking worst singing </garnt>
<connor> you've ever heard. </connor>
<garnt> But then he does it with
such self-confidence </garnt>
<garnt> that you're like, "Damn man, </garnt>
<garnt> I can only respect that."
- You know what he is, </garnt>
<joey> he's the epitome of this
is what I do in my room </joey>
<connor> when I'm alone.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> But I decided to get a camera
and start recording myself. </joey>
<joey> - He's so happy dude. </joey>
<garnt> You're just like, "Man,
I love it,I love it." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so infectious. </garnt>
<garnt> My dream is to one day </garnt>
<connor> have a fucking karaoke
sesh with Buffcorell. </connor>
<connor> - With Buffcorell. </connor>
<connor> - Please Buffcorell, come to Japan, </connor>
<connor> we'll have you on Trash Taste
and go to a karaoke sesh. </connor>
<connor> That is my fucking dream. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<garnt> That is on fucking my list
of things to do before I die. </garnt>
<joey> - And I love as well
the little Easter eggs </joey>
<garnt> he throws around. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the fact that he has a
picture of himself on his wall. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I love that, I love that. </joey>
<joey> - The fact that the camera quality </joey>
<garnt> is like the same fucking low
HD fucking five pixel camera. </garnt>
<joey> - It is like, the one thing I love is that </joey>
<joey> he's not even pointing
the camera at himself. </joey>
<connor> He's pointing it at a mirror,
(hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> that has a reflection of him. </connor>
<connor> - Epic dude, epic. </connor>
<connor> It's cinematography.
- That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's channels like that. </connor>
<connor> Like him and like reported the week </connor>
<garnt> where it's like, I don't
care if this is a joke </garnt>
<garnt> or if they're being a
hundred percent serious, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd still entertain. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't, I like, I would be impressed </garnt>
<connor> if they were putting that one. </connor>
<connor> Because there's no way that, </connor>
<garnt> that kind of genuine
happiness cannot like radiate. </garnt>
<joey> - But it's the age old question, right? </joey>
<joey> Like with report of the week, </joey>
<joey> like, is that actually how he is </joey>
<garnt> or easy just doing this
job until it catches on? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't want to know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But like, that's like kind
of like half the fun of. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love the memes, I love
the memes of (indistinct). </garnt>
<joey> - It's kind of just come
like this content creator </joey>
<joey> who I feel like they
just being themselves, </joey>
<connor> but part of that
personality is so infectious </connor>
<connor> that you cannot watch a video
and not come out happier. </connor>
<connor> And I mean, I could be
having the shittest day, </connor>
<connor> put on a Buffcorell video, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, okay, my day... </connor>
<connor> How can I be sad when he's not sad? </connor>
<joey> You see what I mean? </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) How could
I be having shitty day? </joey>
<garnt> - When totally got these sick move, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, Buffcorell Twitter is the most </garnt>
<connor> like blessed coast thing I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because like, I think
like three times a day </connor>
<connor> he posts a selfie of himself. </connor>
<garnt> - Hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - With like no captions. </garnt>
<garnt> With like different angles.
(hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's the most like... </garnt>
<connor> It's like a dude who just
loves himself so much, </connor>
<connor> but you can't hate him for it. </connor>
<garnt> - I love that, I love that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, "You have
so much self-confidence </garnt>
<joey> and man, I respect." </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't like quantify into words, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, what is the line between </garnt>
<garnt> like vanity and self-confidence. </garnt>
<garnt> And Buffcorell, he fucking
obliterates that line, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he's so vain yet you
just feel happy for him. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no negative feelings-
- right. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just, ah, I fucking love him man. </garnt>
<connor> - There's this channel like
that's I don't know why, </connor>
<garnt> it gives me reported the week vibes. </garnt>
<connor> It might be an insult, I dunno, but... </connor>
<connor> It's called Project Farm, right? </connor>
<connor> All he does is just review
like engine oil and tool. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, and he'll like review
like different tapes. </connor>
<joey> - There is truly a channel for everything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And he's just so... </joey>
<joey> Like there was a video and
he reviews like flex tape, </joey>
<joey> gorilla tape and could pass them all, </joey>
<connor> and like, "I don't give a
fuck about any of this", </connor>
<connor> but he's so passionate
about reviewing these things </connor>
<connor> and it's so genuine. </connor>
<joey> - What's that fucking channel
that reviews all of the locks. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, LockPickingLawyer. </garnt>
<connor> - LockPickingLawyer, I love as well. </connor>
<connor> - He's like.... </connor>
<connor> I feel like he's like low key, </connor>
<garnt> one of the funniest
crazies in the platform. </garnt>
<connor> - He is, I love it. </connor>
<connor> Indestructible lock in
the title, 22nd video. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, okay, all right. </connor>
<connor> He's just got to pick this." </connor>
<connor> - So LockPicingLawyer is a
lawyer and his whole channel. </connor>
<connor> He's like a lockpicking expert. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he just, it's so funny </connor>
<garnt> because he's built up so many in jokes. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause he's insane at picking locks. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like all his delivery is so dry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He's got like the driest
delivery you can ever imagine. </connor>
<garnt> But that's why every time he makes a joke, </garnt>
<garnt> it just hits every time.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - There was a video that
he made for April fools, </garnt>
<connor> that was breaking into
my girlfriend backdoor. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It was like, ex-girlfriend right. </connor>
<connor> - My girlfriend's back door. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it was so funny, it was so funny. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, "She didn't
let me in the front door, </joey>
<connor> so I guess I have to go in
through the back door now." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey lauhing) </connor>
<joey> - And then there was like rust on the key </joey>
<joey> that he actually put things like, </joey>
<garnt> I've got to get rid of the brown residues. </garnt>
<connor> I was like hahahaha!
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He's just gotta make sure the hole </connor>
<connor> is like well lubricated </connor>
<joey> so he can fit in the key and everything. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I love that shit dude. </joey>
<connor> - Like normally anyone else, </connor>
<connor> this would be like third grade humor, </connor>
<connor> but he's like the way he delivers it- </connor>
<garnt> - It's the dry shoot for me, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking kills me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Such a good channel,
such a good channel. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, Who else is like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think one of my favorite
video of his was like when... </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember the exact video name, </garnt>
<connor> but it was like some guy
who had sent him a lock </connor>
<connor> that's he tried to get picked </connor>
<connor> by like a professional
lock picker or something- </connor>
<connor> - And he said was it was impossible. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and he said he was impossible, </connor>
<connor> but I saw this one guy on YouTube do it, </connor>
<garnt> and he just destroys this lock in seconds. </garnt>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, if you can do
it in less than two minutes, </connor>
<connor> I think the challenge was, and
he did it in like 10 seconds. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like he just, he sees a lock </joey>
<joey> and it's already picked
when he picked it up. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know how this man does it. </joey>
<joey> - It's just hockey, man. </joey>
<connor> He's just like hockey, like on locks. </connor>
<joey> - And it's the best part is </joey>
<connor> there's no to these videos. </connor>
<garnt> - There's no arrogance. </garnt>
<joey> He just he's someone that
he doesn't need to flex. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean?
- he Just really funny. </connor>
<garnt> - He's just really good.
- Like there's minimal intro, </garnt>
<connor> that all three minutes long, </connor>
<connor> but you get exactly what you want. </connor>
<connor> You normally end up like
laughing or giggling. </connor>
<connor> Like it's just such a video. </connor>
<garnt> - I love this like non bullshit channels. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I like Daily Dose
Of Internet as well, </connor>
<connor> just because it's just no bullshit. </connor>
<garnt> Here's just like Read it top page. </garnt>
<garnt> With no filler, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - From what I've seen on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> he's such a nice dude as well.
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So, okay, this is like super... </garnt>
<connor> I guess it's kind of old, </connor>
<connor> but do you know "Imaqtpie". </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - You know "Imqtpie". </connor>
<connor> He was an actually a league pro. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- All right. </connor>
<connor> - He one of a streamer now, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - He streamer now. </connor>
<connor> And like, I wanna talk
about him cause like, </connor>
<connor> I just think he's so funny </connor>
<connor> and he's like, he looks
like a homeless man, </connor>
<connor> that's like the joke. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And for like, I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> but for like six months in my life, </connor>
<connor> I could not get to sleep unless his videos </connor>
<garnt> are playing in the background. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> He's got such a chill voice. </connor>
<garnt> - He does have like that chill Jesus vibe, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds like he's permanently stoned. </connor>
<garnt> - That's exactly what I thought. </garnt>
<connor> He's just so chill. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah.
- And yeah, no, I mean, </connor>
<connor> he hasn't been uploading
that much recently </connor>
<connor> cause I think he been
going through some stuff, </connor>
<connor> but I love your channel, man. </connor>
<connor> Keep it up, I love you, man.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Man, what are the
channels do you guys like? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, if we're talking
about league streamers </garnt>
<connor> or league content creators-
- Gbay. </connor>
<connor> - There's one content creator I- </connor>
<joey> - All right, now I head out. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - There's one content I want to shout out, </joey>
<joey> which is Gbay99, which I follow. </joey>
<joey> I've been following his
channel for a long while. </joey>
<joey> And he used to make like very, </joey>
<joey> let's say like,you know- </joey>
<joey> - Youtubury videos. </joey>
<joey> - Youtubury leaked videos,
which is just like, </joey>
<connor> wrote a diamond where
he basically tries to </connor>
<connor> get his account to like high diamond </connor>
<connor> or high master or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But recently it's been... </connor>
<connor> You know when you see a
content creator evolve </connor>
<connor> and you feel like that
fat black proud father, </connor>
<connor> that's been me with Gbay.
(Connor and Joey) </connor>
<connor> Because recently he's been starting to do </connor>
<garnt> these really in-depth
league documentary where- </garnt>
<connor> - And even if you don't like league, </connor>
<connor> I still enjoy it cause
it's such a good story. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because he basically breaks down </garnt>
<garnt> some of the most interesting stories </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of like the
league E-sports scene, </garnt>
<garnt> because he has two passions. </garnt>
<garnt> He's really passionate about sports </garnt>
<garnt> and he's really passionate
about league, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So what he does, </garnt>
<garnt> is he basically makes
these league documentaries </garnt>
<garnt> that are basically just
sports documentaries, </garnt>
<garnt> right.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he goes through this
entire history or this narrative </garnt>
<garnt> and breaks down like it's
a a big sporting event. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - If you like Summoning
Salt you'll like him. </connor>
<connor> I think he's also sending
videos that he's been inspired. </connor>
<joey> The reason why I started
doing that content </joey>
<joey> was cause he Summoning Salt doing it- </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And obviously, you know, </joey>
<joey> speed running is really specific. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And he thought, okay, well
I can make it about league. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's been great because
I've seen his transition, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he like, he used to make videos. </garnt>
<garnt> He's one of those people that
made video dailies, right? </garnt>
<connor> And then he got to this
point where he was just like </connor>
<connor> completely burnt out, </connor>
<connor> and I then he became the
update video channel. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> There was a period in his career </connor>
<connor> where like every two
videos was an update video. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "I'm working
on something big and I'm just, </connor>
<connor> there's a new direction in my channel." </connor>
<connor> And then he made like his
first big documentary, </connor>
<connor> and then he went from uploading every day </connor>
<connor> to uploading once every three months. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, what every one
of his videos is a banger now. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Because every one of his... </connor>
<connor> Every story he chooses to present </connor>
<connor> is like super interesting. </connor>
<connor> And as someone who didn't... </connor>
<connor> I was like, before I came out
as an anime fan or something, </connor>
<garnt> I would like pretend
to be like a sports fan </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that.
- Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so seeing him presents
league in the same way, </garnt>
<garnt> that's in the same depending way </garnt>
<garnt> that I see a lot of like
sports documentaries </garnt>
<garnt> and sports fans talk
about their own sports, </garnt>
<garnt> was like so refreshing, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause nobody did it for him. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought it was just like so obvious </garnt>
<garnt> that someone could do this basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<connor> - There's also a Exil who does like super, </connor>
<connor> that's more like league
stories about Champions. </connor>
<connor> - Still pretty good there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I really enjoy Exil. </connor>
<garnt> - But that's like hot
to recommend to people </garnt>
<connor> who don't know league.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What are some gaming
creators that you like </connor>
<connor> apart from the Pokemon ones? </connor>
<connor> Okay, do you watch Angry Video Game nerd? </connor>
<joey> - Every now and then I do. </joey>
<joey> I like, cause I kind of
grew up watching AVGN </joey>
<connor> and I liked going back cause
like all of his old stuff </connor>
<connor> is on YouTube still.
- I know, I know, I love it. </connor>
<connor> - I love going back and watching
like the Spiderman episode. </connor>
<connor> Like that's still my favorite one. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's just nice in YouTube, </connor>
<connor> where the platform which
is constantly changing, </connor>
<connor> everything's changing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just nice having an anchor, </connor>
<connor> like Angry Video Game Nerd. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's just a constant, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, whether
I enjoy the content, </joey>
<joey> it depends on the video, right? </joey>
<joey> But It's just nice having
a creator who's consistent, </joey>
<connor> no drama, just constantly
makes bangers like. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I think recently he
made an earthbound video, </joey>
<connor> which was fucking such a good video. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, every so often I go back </garnt>
<connor> and see like the parallels </connor>
<connor> between what happened
to Angry Video Game Nerd </connor>
<connor> and what happened to
Nostalgia critic, right? </connor>
<connor> - It's kinda crazy, yeah.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's...
- Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - It's so gearing to see the evolution or- </connor>
<connor> - They were like the top two. </connor>
<connor> - They were the top two
fucking media critic reviewers, </connor>
<connor> and just seeing like Angry Video
Game Nerd being the anchor. </connor>
<connor> and whatever the fuck
happened to Nolstagia- </connor>
<connor> - Did you see his game show? </connor>
<connor> - No, I did it.
- Yeah, he did game show. </connor>
<connor> He funded it like via crowd funding. </connor>
<garnt> He channel called them Ralphthemoviemaker, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't if you know who that is? </garnt>
<garnt> He does really good movie reviews, </garnt>
<garnt> really funny guy. </garnt>
<garnt> Really like Gordon Ramsey asked, </garnt>
<garnt> like just really brutal.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Pretty funny. Don't
agree with this takes always, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, pretty good, good channel. </garnt>
<garnt> But he did a video about the
Nostalgic Critics Game Show </garnt>
<garnt> and it is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it looks like a school project </garnt>
<garnt> and they spent like $50,000 on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - And It's garbage, like it is bad. </connor>
<connor> - Have you like... </connor>
<connor> Remember that period in
like YouTube reviewers, </connor>
<connor> where they had to have like a
story behind random reviews. </connor>
<connor> Do you remember that period </connor>
<connor> where it was like channel awesome. </connor>
<connor> - Actually two hour views, remember that? </connor>
<connor> Unlike the first 30 minutes
it was like a garbage skit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Whereas Amy Jean was
like, I can do that, </joey>
<joey> but condense it into like 15 minutes, max. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's because
it's also mega cheesy. </connor>
<connor> Whereas like, I think Nostalgia Critic is, </connor>
<connor> they're like the same thing, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The same quality, but almost, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, that's kind of,
haven't insulted him, </garnt>
<garnt> but they're kind of the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> where they're like,
cheesy, obviously like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Very tongue in cheek. </garnt>
<garnt> - Very tongue and cheek- </garnt>
<garnt> - The playing in character as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - But obviously the two
wanted to be seen different. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nostalgia Critic wanna be
seen as like mega professional, </garnt>
<connor> as Angry Video Game Nerd. </connor>
<connor> This happy being like, it's
tongue in cheek, it's camp. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's so endearing, </garnt>
<garnt> whereas seeing the Nostalgia
Critic try to be like, </garnt>
<connor> you know, what's the movie he made? </connor>
<connor> It was like called The
Holy Grail or something, </connor>
<connor> that was like two hours
long and it was terrible. </connor>
<connor> - I swear like, Nostalgia Critic has done </connor>
<connor> so many side projects that </connor>
<connor> have just ended up being absolutely shit. </connor>
<connor> Like he made...
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> He made a fucking parody
album of Pink Floats The Wall. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Grant shouting) </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God, I remember that. </joey>
<joey> - And I didn't, as someone who's like, </joey>
<connor> The Wall is like one of my
favorite fucking albums. </connor>
<connor> It's an album that's adored by everybody, </connor>
<connor> the movie as well it's amazing. </connor>
<connor> And then I listened to that album, </connor>
<connor> I got like two songs in and
I'm just like, "I can't." </connor>
<connor> But then I watched fucking Needle Drops- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - As he absolutely destroying it, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, "Yes, </joey>
<joey> this is why I love you, Anthony." </joey>
<joey> It was so fucking good. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause it was just seeing a creator </garnt>
<connor> just trying to do something
that was so unnecessary. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like it's, like you said, </connor>
<connor> it was someone who obviously
wanted to be respected </connor>
<connor> and be seen as like someone
who did something great, </connor>
<connor> but it was just so like... </connor>
<joey> How can I do, </joey>
<joey> how can I word this? </joey>
<joey> If you-
- Self-indulgent. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was very
self-indulgent, you know. </joey>
<joey> - And it was extra like cringy as well, </joey>
<connor> just like seeing that. </connor>
<connor> Like he was clearly
trying to be like funny </connor>
<connor> and edgy about it. </connor>
<connor> Being like, "I'm gonna
trash all over this album </connor>
<connor> that everybody loves." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Not everyone
likes this album dude, </connor>
<joey> like just chill out." </joey>
<connor> - Nolstagia Critic is a OG YouTube channel </connor>
<joey> that reviewed movies, by the way. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Did we explain that? </garnt>
<connor> - Did we mention that by the way? </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure that everyone who's
listening to this episode </joey>
<connor> give somewhat about YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - Never mind about him, watch
TheNeedledrop, he's great. </joey>
<connor> I fucking love him. </connor>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - He was in New York times as
well recently, that was cool. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, true, true. </joey>
<joey> I almost never agree with his opinions, </joey>
<joey> but hell that guy can talk. </joey>
<connor> - But that's the thing
I like about critics. </connor>
<connor> The good ones on YouTube is that like, </connor>
<joey> I don't have to agree with them, </joey>
<joey> but like damn, they're entertaining. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there Input is
still interesting, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think like there's a lot
of movie channels like that. </joey>
<connor> Like YourMovieSucksDOTorg. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I like his channel a lot. </connor>
<connor> He's did a really good
video on like the Lion King </connor>
<connor> and Kimba comparisons. </connor>
<connor> It was like two hours fucking long. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's a really good video. </connor>
<connor> I've really like a channel. </connor>
<connor> I mean, obviously don't
agree with all the opinions. </connor>
<joey> - There's also, probably
one of my favorite movie, </joey>
<joey> critic guys is a guy called SpookyRice. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I showed you that right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think you and AKI
were like super into it. </connor>
<joey> - I showed AKI 'cause I wanted that like, </joey>
<joey> cause he reviewed like- </joey>
<joey> - All the horrible worst horror movies. </joey>
<joey> - They're are like worst horror, </joey>
<connor> it's disgusting movies.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he manages to be
able to sit through it </connor>
<connor> enough times that he can write </connor>
<connor> a comprehensive review about it. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> But you just, none of it comes in </joey>
<joey> because he shows it as
well when it happens. </joey>
<connor> - But imagine that YouTube, Ukulele music, </connor>
<connor> that kind of personality reviewing </connor>
<connor> like a horror thing like,
"Yeah, so then he ate the Shit" </connor>
<connor> and it's like, "What?" Why are
you saying it like it's a..." </connor>
<joey> - I didn't really like that
scene though. (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I fucking love this wall he's intro, </connor>
<connor> which is a, like, he like- </connor>
<connor> - Kokue or something? </connor>
<connor> - He's like cure the Kohan. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then he's like, has a logo </connor>
<joey> and then creepy go horns just
like shows up, I'm like... </joey>
<joey> There's no, there's nothing, </joey>
<joey> he just likes Kohan. </joey>
<joey> I guess I'm like, all
right, I respect that. </joey>
<garnt> - What's your opinion
on like YouTube intros? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey sighs) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I personally don't use it. </connor>
<connor> - I sometimes I think that I have to do it </connor>
<connor> to explain roughly what's
gonna, like the premise. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause sometimes the title
doesn't really explain it </joey>
<joey> and I wanna explain it. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I just- </joey>
<joey> - I try to keep it to a minimum. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, my intro is
like two, three seconds. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, I'm not like fucking AVGN </connor>
<connor> where I have a fucking
theme song attached to it. </connor>
<connor> - I don't mind if you have an intro, </connor>
<joey> if it likes serves a purpose, </joey>
<garnt> but the ones where it
really, really me off, </garnt>
<garnt> I like tutorials. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my fucking God! </garnt>
<connor> - I hate tutorial
channels or help channels </connor>
<connor> that have a into. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not even a
tutorial or help channel, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking, I don't know why </garnt>
<connor> every time I would wanna look
for a Sony Vegas tutorial, </connor>
<connor> there's always that fucking </connor>
<connor> (Connor mimics beat) </connor>
<joey> - Always fucking editing some Cod footage. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) I don't know
why it's always Cod, right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey claps) </joey>
<joey> - And then on top of that, </joey>
<joey> they make a bullshit like
four, five minute intro </joey>
<connor> trying to put in their personality. </connor>
<connor> I don't care, </connor>
<joey> I just wanna know how to edit thing. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, so you picture it, right? </connor>
<connor> You're trying to install windows, </connor>
<connor> you get to the guy like,
"Yo, what's up fam. </connor>
<connor> We just hit 5,000 subs. </connor>
<connor> I think we can get 6,000 if
you really liked this show. </connor>
<connor> If you liked this video, </connor>
<connor> don't forget to comment, like, subscribe. </connor>
<connor> Because today we're gonna be reviewing </connor>
<connor> the window installer. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And when we break down
the windows installer..." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Oh my God! </connor>
<joey> Just tell me how to install windows." </joey>
<joey> And then it's like
literally like 10 seconds. </joey>
<connor> - If we hit 500 likes, </connor>
<joey> I'll do a windows eight installer. </joey>
<garnt> - You know is redundant
when you Google search </garnt>
<garnt> on I'm like how to solve X problem. </garnt>
<garnt> And they pull up the
YouTube video that you need, </garnt>
<garnt> and literally skip a
minute and a half ahead </garnt>
<joey> to be like, "Here, Google's like here. </joey>
<joey> Here's where I think
you'll enjoy starting." </joey>
<joey> You don't need this fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Even the Google system
is aware of how shit </joey>
<connor> and pointless the intro is.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I've optimized it. </joey>
<joey> What I do is two monitors, right? </joey>
<joey> So the tutorial one tab, and
you go to text on the main tab. </joey>
<garnt> So if you go through the text... </garnt>
<garnt> And if you can find it on the text </garnt>
<connor> before it gets mentioned
in the video, you win. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's so fucking shitty, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you have this like
minute and a half of intro. </garnt>
<garnt> So what you do, is you start
watching at times two speed, </garnt>
<garnt> then the tutorial itself, </garnt>
<garnt> they speed through the information so fast </garnt>
<garnt> that you're like, "Whoa,
Whoa, hold on a second there." </garnt>
<garnt> And you have to skip back
to be like, "Yo, yo. It-" </garnt>
<joey> - It could be like a five minute video </joey>
<joey> and the tutorials is
like the last 30 seconds. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly right? </joey>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<joey> - So egregious. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - What are some... </joey>
<garnt> I have some other gaming
channels that I think- </garnt>
<garnt> - I got some gaming channels as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know that you watch
Darkk Mane as well. </garnt>
<connor> I think dark Mane is really funny. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Really good comedic delivery like jokes, </connor>
<connor> he's literally the definition
of jokes that aren't funny, </connor>
<garnt> but when you deliver them well, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just so fucking hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Right, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's so funny and I met him once, </garnt>
<connor> I don't think he remembers
because he's very briefly, </connor>
<connor> but he was super, he was the
exact same as his videos. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - He blew up at Lee content, </garnt>
<garnt> but he does general gaming stuff as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- All right. </garnt>
<connor> - Just a really odd
guy, just really funny. </connor>
<garnt> - Is he exactly like he is in his videos? </garnt>
<garnt> - When I met him he seemed like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - I, so he does- </connor>
<joey> - That's always endearing, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - He does like, a very like, </joey>
<connor> what's that, dry delivery
of unfunny jokes, </connor>
<connor> sometimes funny jokes.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But either way, it's always funny. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right.
- And I met him in real life </connor>
<connor> and he was wearing like, he
was dressed up as Thanos. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> And he had like purple,
'cause he's purple- </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right, right.
- He had like a glove on. </garnt>
<garnt> And I met him, and he for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> he just like completely unrelated. </garnt>
<joey> He was like, "I'm Thanos." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh, I see that." </joey>
<joey> - Sick. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, "Okay."
(hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "All right." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I met his friend
RedRiotRoss as well, </connor>
<garnt> He's really funny dude.
- Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really nice guy, makes great content. </garnt>
<connor> I think also who would come? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, one of my favorite
gaming content creators </garnt>
<garnt> is Core-A Gaming. </garnt>
<connor> - About the fighting game stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, a funny game. </connor>
<connor> Like he does some of the
best analytical content </connor>
<connor> on YouTube, in my opinion. </connor>
<connor> Because his content is
all about fighting games, </connor>
<connor> but he breaks it down in
a way that's so general, </connor>
<connor> that anyone, that one makes you interested </connor>
<connor> in fighting games, </connor>
<connor> even though I have zero
interest in fighting games. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean, </connor>
<connor> I have zero interest, </connor>
<connor> zero knowledge about finding games. </connor>
<garnt> I come out of a Core-A Gaming video, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Yeah, you know-" </garnt>
<connor> - You are the type of dude
who sees a how to tutorial </connor>
<connor> and like, how to stop fishing guns. </connor>
<connor> It's buying a rod on Amazon. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like that is so gone, gone gets in. </connor>
<connor> You've watched the AlphaGo
documentary, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And like the next week after I watched </connor>
<connor> this documentary about geos,
I want to buy a geoboard. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Let's play geo. </connor>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because I, like my one niche </garnt>
<joey> is watching videos I
have zero interest in. </joey>
<joey> - I like that to. </joey>
<joey> - But watching like, </joey>
<joey> watching a content creator, </joey>
<connor> basically be able to break it down </connor>
<connor> in a way that makes me interested in it- </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - That is my niche and interests. </connor>
<connor> And that is what I wanna
do with like anime, </connor>
<connor> to like with my own content. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's like the
content creator I respect. </connor>
<connor> So like with Core-A Gaming, </connor>
<connor> he like breaks down
fighting games on like, </connor>
<connor> I think like a social level. </connor>
<connor> He goes into like the psychology, </connor>
<connor> of why people act the way
they do in fighting games. </connor>
<connor> Like he unlike some... </connor>
<connor> I honestly, I think like
every video he's done </connor>
<connor> is the banger when it's
like an analysis video. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - But he literally like
breaks down the psychology </connor>
<joey> of what goes into, like the
fighting game community, </joey>
<joey> why salt in the fighting game community </joey>
<joey> is like such a big thing. (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And he also has like some
really interesting stories </joey>
<joey> in between all of this analysis. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - And it's just like the complete package. </connor>
<connor> It's everything you want
in an analytical video, </connor>
<connor> but it's just fighting games. </connor>
<connor> But you can have zero
interest in fighting games </connor>
<connor> and you can appreciate what he does. </connor>
<connor> Because a lot of his
analysis can be applied </connor>
<connor> to pretty much just life in general. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Like he, there's a lot of like key ends. </connor>
<joey> A lot of his videos with
like a nice little message. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> Which can be applied to
a lot of things in life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like something you can take away. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I do need to watch more of his stuff </joey>
<joey> because I don't think I'm sad, but- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you gotta check them out. </joey>
<joey> - I think another sure the
gaming channels I like, </joey>
<connor> obviously the LilKirbs who
does the Mario speed runs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - He did the ship post of all time. </joey>
<joey> Because obviously Dunkey,
which we all like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is that the guy who
does the bows is big- </joey>
<connor> - Yes, so Dunkey did like the whole joke </connor>
<connor> in his Mario maker video. </connor>
<connor> If you guys don't know Dunkey, </connor>
<connor> I mean you should know Dunkey. </connor>
<connor> He's at the biggest gaming channel. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He did a video where he like </connor>
<connor> made his own level and got
the world record on it, </connor>
<connor> and was like bragging about it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then obviously Dunkey
makes any excuses in his videos </connor>
<connor> when he can't beat a Mario maker level. </connor>
<connor> Like, "Oh, you know, my
little brother was playing. </connor>
<joey> I was playing with a USB steering wheel." </joey>
<joey> - I was blind folded, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So this YouTube Qaeda LilKirbs, </joey>
<joey> who also is just a God at Mario. </joey>
<joey> Like an absolute God, </joey>
<connor> who gets like the world
record on everything. </connor>
<connor> I think he's won like every
Nintendo speed run competition- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - On Mario maker.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - He did a video where he
obviously did Dunkey's course </connor>
<connor> blindfolded with a steering wheel. </connor>
<connor> - It's so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> Like I love that level of thing. </connor>
<joey> - It was such an amazing shit post, </joey>
<connor> but there's also like a
second layer of enjoyment </connor>
<connor> actually see him do. </connor>
<connor> - Like he's actually insane. </connor>
<joey> - He's actual fucking God at it. </joey>
<connor> - It's sheer posting
has gotten to the point </connor>
<connor> where you need to be like, </connor>
<garnt> the sheer posting itself
is just your pure skill. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know what I mean?
- It's insane, it's so good. </connor>
<connor> And also other gaming creators I like, </connor>
<joey> I don't know if you see Nitro Rad. </joey>
<joey> He does just like- </joey>
<joey> - I know the name. </joey>
<connor> - He does 40 minute like essays on gaming. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, </connor>
<connor> it's not that warm feeling </connor>
<connor> of like watching YouTube in 2014. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Just being coze it up, you know. </connor>
<connor> Just watching someone
talking about video games. </connor>
<connor> Really like just be passionate. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think... </connor>
<connor> I think there's nothing that's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, he's hilarious." </connor>
<connor> Or like, there's nothing that's like mega. </connor>
<connor> Like, "Wow, it should be unique." </connor>
<connor> Just all round, just a great package. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just super such a nice guy </connor>
<connor> and just seems really into it </connor>
<connor> and really loves his gaming upstarts. </connor>
<joey> - That's always the best, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> one game on YouTube where I like a... </connor>
<connor> I kind of respect for a
different reason is a RelaxAlax. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Mmmh! </connor>
<connor> - Just because like, I got into him </connor>
<connor> because he did this like
amazing analytical view </connor>
<connor> on persona five. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right.
- [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like, I respect
him because his editing </connor>
<connor> is fucking next level. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's so bittersweet watching a dude </connor>
<connor> who is like relatively not
that big on the YouTube sphere. </connor>
<connor> Who can just crank out like just </connor>
<connor> these incredibly well
edited videos, right? </connor>
<connor> I mean like, the whole reason why I, </connor>
<connor> you know, our editor Mudan, </connor>
<connor> the reason why I got into his stuff </connor>
<connor> is because that dude's
editing on his videos </connor>
<connor> is fucking next level, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I respect him as a Youtuber
and as someone who edits </connor>
<connor> like videos on One note and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> if anything, I've gotten a lot
of like good editing ideas, </connor>
<connor> like creative ideas from his videos. </connor>
<connor> Being like, "Oh shit, </connor>
<joey> I never thought to do something like that. </joey>
<connor> But that's pretty cool." </connor>
<connor> - I felt bad for the dude
when he got in a bit of drama. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, he did, didn't he? </joey>
<joey> - And I think he was like... </joey>
<joey> I mean, I don't know
what was right and wrong- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I think that he was
uploading a lot of videos </connor>
<joey> about it to his channel, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Dude, </joey>
<joey> I don't think you should
upload this many videos." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think he uploaded like two videos </joey>
<joey> and the insisted for a week about it. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "No, don't do this man." </joey>
<joey> - Just double down dude,
we've established this, </joey>
<joey> just double down. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I do wanna also mention that </joey>
<joey> if we did recommend Youtubers that turnout </joey>
<joey> to have done some up stuff. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, we don't know that, </joey>
<joey> we're just recommended
based on purely content. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We're separating the
creators from the creation </joey>
<connor> as much as possible. </connor>
<connor> - And also we don't
follow everything going on </connor>
<joey> and everything.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean a lot of these dudes, </joey>
<connor> we just watch and like the content, </connor>
<connor> we don't keep up with what
they do in their personal life. </connor>
<connor> Whatever they do, that's on them. </connor>
<connor> But like, yeah, I'm sure, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure one of these crazy mentioned </connor>
<joey> is gonna be like, "They've
promoted someone." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They touch the kid or
something, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause obviously when you
PewDiePie recommended YouTube </joey>
<connor> as he got in shit for that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- All right. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, I wanna make that known </joey>
<joey> that any creatives that we recommend, </joey>
<joey> please hunt us for it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Also finally one, </joey>
<joey> I have one last gaming creator
that I want to recommend. </joey>
<joey> So I've been watching
this guy for like forever. </joey>
<connor> He's called like Caddicarus. </connor>
<connor> And he did like... </connor>
<connor> His whole thing way back was just a dude </connor>
<connor> who used to do just PS1 game reviews. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And it was kind of sad </connor>
<connor> because I felt like he'd
stagnated for a long time, </connor>
<connor> just doing PS1, PS2 games. </connor>
<connor> And it was kind of like, "Alright, nice." </connor>
<joey> He wasn't really growing much. </joey>
<joey> And then I'd say like last
year he really turned it around </joey>
<joey> and started doing some really good videos, </joey>
<joey> like insane amounts of effort. </joey>
<joey> - All right.
- Right. </joey>
<connor> - Like hour long videos about
like skateboarding games, </connor>
<connor> and it's really update. </connor>
<connor> In like, the amount of edits </connor>
<connor> in this dudes videos are insane. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - and he's just broadening out a lot more </connor>
<connor> and it just making some
really good right now. </connor>
<connor> So if you like gaming content, </connor>
<joey> and also he's British, </joey>
<joey> and it feels sometimes like his jokes </joey>
<joey> are like British kids TV show. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like, it's weird.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> Because like, you can see.
- But how so. </joey>
<joey> - Very stupid and very like... </joey>
<joey> I don't know, very crack Heady. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it feels very childish at times- </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- But it's just, it's good, </connor>
<connor> and you know, if you're a 12 year old, </connor>
<connor> you can enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And if you are 24 year old like I am, </connor>
<joey> you can still enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> And it's a bit silly, but it's good. </joey>
<joey> - Are we talking like
poopoopiipii levels of show. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes, yeah, sometimes.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'd dig for that, I thought of that. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, it's just nice. </connor>
<connor> Like you said earlier,
it's nice seeing a creator </connor>
<joey> just step it up- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And really like, I
just want to give credit </joey>
<connor> where credit's due and- </connor>
<joey> - It's especially nice
to see a creator step up </joey>
<connor> when they haven't made 70
videos about them leveling up. </connor>
<joey> It's like, just level up. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's hard, right,
when you're creator, </joey>
<joey> when you're stagnating. </joey>
<joey> I've been there-
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's really hard to just be like, </joey>
<joey> "You know what, fuck it." </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna put all this effort in, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna take a risk. </joey>
<joey> It might not work.
- Just try something new. </joey>
<connor> - And like, most of the
time it doesn't work out, </connor>
<connor> but you have to keep it up. </connor>
<connor> You have to keep taking those risks </connor>
<connor> to get those awards. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's nice seeing... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I can relate
somebody who is stuck in </connor>
<garnt> doing black butler for like two years. </garnt>
<garnt> I can really relate to getting out of it, </garnt>
<connor> and I really wanna give
credit where credit it's due. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think, I feel
like there is a space </garnt>
<garnt> for update videos, </garnt>
<garnt> but at the end of the day, the audience, </garnt>
<garnt> like for the most part,
don't really give a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> If you're gona drop something big, </garnt>
<garnt> then just drop something big. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- If you're not, </garnt>
<garnt> then your like... </garnt>
<connor> What you can convey in an update video </connor>
<connor> can be conveyed within your next project. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Unless it's gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be away for like a month or two. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And at this point, that's just like </connor>
<connor> calling in sick for your boy. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean?
(hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, "Right gang, I'm not
gonna be uploading for a month, </connor>
<garnt> just calling in sick." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's also the element
of surprise, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I've noticed that
like whenever I upload </garnt>
<connor> something big or something
completely different, </connor>
<connor> with no pre-warning whatsoever, </connor>
<garnt> it usually does better than if you do give </garnt>
<connor> some kind of hints to it </connor>
<connor> because people aren't expecting it. </connor>
<joey> And therefore I think it gets
people talking about it more. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's unfortunate
but at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> YouTube, it doesn't
recognize the comments, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't recognize any of that. </connor>
<connor> It recognized clicks and watch time. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So if you can get that, </connor>
<connor> that's a bigger statement than being like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey guys, I'm gonna do some big." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - One, one niche Youtuber
I wanna recommend </garnt>
<garnt> is Marshall McGee. </garnt>
<garnt> And he is basically a
professional sound designer </garnt>
<garnt> who breaks down sound designs </garnt>
<garnt> in like games and movies and anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's like, I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> because he's only had
like 50,000 subscribers. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel like, it's
because sound design </connor>
<connor> is such a niche topic
that nobody thinks about, </connor>
<connor> but he breaks it down into like basically, </connor>
<connor> he hears like a sound from
like dark souls or something. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Okay, </connor>
<connor> here's how I would like make the sound." </connor>
<connor> And he like breaks down
this entire process </connor>
<connor> of like layering- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's really hard. </connor>
<connor> - Every sound he does. </connor>
<connor> And it just like, I feel like sound design </connor>
<connor> is one of those topics </connor>
<connor> that just doesn't get enough appreciation. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, it's insane. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like a channel
like Marshall McGee, </connor>
<connor> like breaking down, what
actually goes into this, </connor>
<connor> is like super interesting as well. </connor>
<connor> Just like how much effort
and like knowledge it takes </connor>
<connor> to be like, okay, this is what I think. </connor>
<connor> Like how would you take a
sound that doesn't exist </connor>
<connor> and like create it in your head, </connor>
<connor> and like actually make
the sound that you hear </connor>
<connor> in your head into an actual SFX. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's like the
cartoon sounds like a Boeing. </garnt>
<connor> Like what makes a Boeing sound? </connor>
<joey> Nothing makes a Boeing sound effect. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember seeing a video a while back. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it's still up. </joey>
<joey> It's really all video of
this guy who broke down, </joey>
<connor> one sound, in one cartoon
and it was the fucking... </connor>
<connor> You know in Scooby-Doo, </connor>
<connor> you know when they go running. </connor>
<connor> Like when the...
- The running sound. (mimics) </connor>
<connor> - That sound, it was just a breaking down </connor>
<garnt> how they made that sound
of why it's so iconic, </garnt>
<garnt> and just finding out what it was </garnt>
<connor> and like how they made it in shit, </connor>
<connor> and like how they came up with that idea. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, how do you even think of that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just so... </garnt>
<garnt> It's something that you
just weren't expecting. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, Oh, it's probably
just like a bunch of mallets. </joey>
<joey> It's like, Nope, completely wrong. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's also strange, I mean like, </connor>
<connor> we think about getting punched. </connor>
<connor> When you punch, it doesn't
make it punch sound. </connor>
<joey> You just get punched. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Garnt and Connor laughing) </connor>
<joey> There was another video where I saw </joey>
<joey> like a Foley artist explaining like </joey>
<joey> how the Hollywood makes
the punching sounds. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they break leak to break
bones and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - It's like break of saller rift </connor>
<connor> and make bones crack and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> It's like, shit's so interesting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I definitely do watch a lot
of like music based Youtubers, </connor>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think some music ones are like, </connor>
<connor> there's a guy called Joe Jeremiah. </connor>
<connor> He doesn't upload much, </connor>
<connor> but he just like melodies of like games </connor>
<connor> and animated shows from piano. </connor>
<garnt> It's really good. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Just melodies, feel like maladies. </connor>
<connor> - We counting the SethEverman is like a- </connor>
<connor> - SethEverman- </connor>
<joey> - SethEverman is shit post channel. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the one thing I fucking love </garnt>
<joey> about the music Youtuber
community, is that- </joey>
<garnt> - There shit posting game
is on another fucking level. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so shit posty </garnt>
<joey> and yet they're all so fucking talented. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I know, right? </joey>
<connor> - Obviously like Davie504 as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Davie504 and like
SethEverman and other one, </joey>
<joey> and like, even like Jon
Sudano was another one. </joey>
<garnt> Like the fat dude who like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- He did covers all this songs </garnt>
<joey> by the replaceable
lyrics with SmashMallow. </joey>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Shittyflute as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, Shittyflute. </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno, like a lot of the music content </connor>
<garnt> are like consumers,
mostly just shit posting. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - And music channels... </joey>
<connor> - There literally so
much you can do with it </connor>
<joey> and they've gotten really
creative with shit posting- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Ten Second Songs is another one- </joey>
<connor> - That really good as well. </connor>
<connor> - It's like super talented
dude, but at the end of the day, </connor>
<joey> you finish the video and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "I just watched the post." </joey>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<joey> That was a post, but it was so good. </joey>
<connor> - But you guys to watch any like, </connor>
<connor> like horror YouTubers. </connor>
<connor> (whispers) </connor>
<connor> - Define horror Youtubers? </connor>
<joey> - Like just talk about horror. </joey>
<garnt> - Like Corpse Husband and stuff like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Not really. </connor>
<connor> - Corpse Husband isn't horror, is it? </connor>
<connor> Or it used to. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, he use to do like
creepy pasta stuff, right? </connor>
<connor> - I guess so. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Just could pasta like that. </connor>
<joey> - Like MrCreepyPasta and stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> - I don't want MrCreepyPasta. </connor>
<connor> I met him in real life, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really, did you? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How was he? </connor>
<connor> - Thlod. </connor>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I hope he doesn't watch this. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> I mean, I feel like it takes
a quirky personality, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He was nice but, you
know, out by my British. </connor>
<connor> I mean, 'cause most Americans aren't. </connor>
<connor> I'm tryna save this now. </connor>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> You were very pleasant, </joey>
<joey> but I guess you were a
little bit off, right? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Wait, don't we have an entire clip that </connor>
<connor> which is like Americans
are different species. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, we have. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, we do. </joey>
<joey> - Check out that clip. </joey>
<joey> - There obviously ReingBot
who did the Mr. Anime videos. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that one. </garnt>
<connor> My unexpected cameo in that one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Nexpo does some pretty
good ones as well. </connor>
<connor> I really like his video of
Redditors Dive Into Turmoil. </connor>
<connor> That's really good, have you seen that? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - That's about where the woman
who asked a subreddit help. </connor>
<joey> Man has to help subreddit
take custody of the kids. </joey>
<joey> And then the wife killed them both </joey>
<joey> when she saw the subreddit. </joey>
<joey> - Yaikes </joey>
<joey> - And it's just really, really- </joey>
<joey> - I know that story. </joey>
<joey> - I have showed you. </joey>
<joey> It's a really, like... </joey>
<joey> You just didn't expect
the video to go that way. </joey>
<joey> It's a really just chilling video. </joey>
<joey> And I highly recommend. </joey>
<connor> I mean I've spoiled it, I recommend it. </connor>
<connor> - We all know the best
horror channel is a Chills. </connor>
<connor> My boy Chills. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh God!
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - The greatest-
- No 10, burger King foot. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, I can't tell you how happy I was </joey>
<garnt> that I was in one of his videos. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- And he said my name, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, I've made it as a YouTuber. </joey>
<joey> Like, it's peak. </joey>
<connor> - Have you seen the video
where he just talks. </connor>
<connor> He's such a genuine and nice guy as well. </connor>
<joey> - Like-
- Chills. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because like that's
just how he talks, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's how he talks. </connor>
<connor> - Because everybody
thinks he's like purposely </connor>
<connor> trying to make this like annoying accent, </connor>
<connor> but like videos where he
just like talks off script. </connor>
<connor> That's just how he talks. </connor>
<connor> - You wanna give him a high five. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So nice bless him. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, Chills I fucking love you. </connor>
<connor> You're like, please come onto the podcast. </connor>
<joey> It would be the most
basic sounding podcast. </joey>
<connor> - Also a guy who popped
up not too long ago, </connor>
<connor> Barely Sociable. </connor>
<garnt> He does really good videos. </garnt>
<garnt> He did a really good video
on the silk road as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I might've seen that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's a Silk road. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was the website that was famous </garnt>
<garnt> on the deep web for selling drugs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I thought it was some like </garnt>
<garnt> mastermind criminal organization, </garnt>
<connor> but it turned out it was just some dudes, </connor>
<connor> like petty and fighting
about getting trolled. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like I've seen a
lot of these guys' content </garnt>
<connor> on like my recommended. </connor>
<connor> And I've watched it. </connor>
<connor> It's because like, </connor>
<connor> it's not the type of content
I would subscribe to. </connor>
<connor> But if it's like, if it's
an interesting enough topic, </connor>
<garnt> I'm willing to click on
anything on my recommended. </garnt>
<connor> - What about educational channel voice. </connor>
<connor> What educational channels
do you guys watch? </connor>
<connor> - Oh! </connor>
<joey> - I mean Vsauce is the one that- </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't really upload. </garnt>
<joey> - They haven't bought in a while, </joey>
<joey> but is it even Vsauce source anymore? </joey>
<joey> Cause he like, </joey>
<joey> he's doing like minefield or mine. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I haven't seen any other
channel called Dong. </connor>
<connor> Do you remember that? </connor>
<connor> And then YouTube forced him
to change it to like Ding, </connor>
<garnt> because Dong was obviously- </garnt>
<joey> - See was like penis, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't believe that, that's awful. </garnt>
<connor> - Are we counting like
engineering video educational? </connor>
<connor> - Yes, of course. </connor>
<connor> - Because I feel like engineering
has had like a resurgence </connor>
<connor> within this past few years. </connor>
<connor> Thanks to creators like
Michael Reeves, Willam Osman. </connor>
<connor> - Mark Rober. </connor>
<connor> - And Mark Rober. </connor>
<connor> - Like I wish they were around </connor>
<connor> when I was in fucking university. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - Because I didn't know
engineering could be cool </connor>
<garnt> until they started making content man. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think especially like
the posting ones like </garnt>
<garnt> Michael Reeves. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I found Michael Reese
when he was doing like, </garnt>
<garnt> when he was branded as like the laser guy. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He made one video about
a laser pointing in his eye </connor>
<joey> and for like months, his
channel was like everything. </joey>
<joey> - He was the laser dude. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And it was so it's so cool
seeing and blow up and also just </joey>
<garnt> making engineering. Cool. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. Like William Osman and Mark Robert. </connor>
<connor> - I think, I think the latest video, </connor>
<connor> the latest creator I discovered
was a stuff made here. </connor>
<connor> I love stuff, man. </connor>
<connor> He's just, he's just like
someone who is just, I don't, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is about
him that like stands out like </connor>
<connor> even more. Cause he's not,
he's not a poster one. </connor>
<connor> No, no. </connor>
<connor> He's, he's like a very
serious engineering one, </connor>
<garnt> but he just makes these really
cool contraptions and some of </garnt>
<garnt> the stuff he makes takes so
much effort. It's insane. </garnt>
<connor> - How high the bar? The bar, </connor>
<connor> like the bar for like good engineering. </connor>
<connor> The explosive bat. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> What the? Like, like
he made a baseball bat, </garnt>
<garnt> but it has like four shells
in it when you hit it. </garnt>
<connor> It explodes and object
to thing that yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Basically he basically the
concept was he wanted to make a </garnt>
<connor> baseball bat that anyone could
use to like get a home run. </connor>
<connor> Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> I'd like to, to like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Break the world record
for home run. And so he, </connor>
<connor> just puts shotgun shells
into this baseball bat and he </connor>
<connor> breaks down his entire
process about how to make this </connor>
<connor> feasible. And it's like the first, </connor>
<connor> the first problem he had
to overcome was like, he, </connor>
<connor> he made a baseball bat that worked, </connor>
<connor> but anyone who would use it
would break that arm if they </connor>
<connor> used it. Right. </connor>
<connor> And it's like his level or his
like knowledge and level of </connor>
<joey> engineering is just like
on a different scale. </joey>
<garnt> Fantastic presentation
and great presentation. </garnt>
<garnt> There's actually a Japanese, YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> I don't watch many Japanese. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But because frankly they're all quite man, </connor>
<connor> but there's one Japanese Ichiba
who like blew up recently or </connor>
<connor> like quite recently
who's like kind of like, </connor>
<connor> he's like halfway between
engineering and just absolute </connor>
<connor> post. </connor>
<connor> Okay. And, </connor>
<joey> and he does these videos
where it's basically just him </joey>
<connor> having fun. It's the guy who
like a himself on like a call. </connor>
<connor> Yes. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> He, he does like, he basically is like, </joey>
<joey> he was the one who popularized the, </joey>
<connor> if you carve out a watermelon
and then you boil salt water </connor>
<connor> to a thousand degrees and
you pour it in the watermelon </connor>
<connor> explodes, I found that he did apparently, </connor>
<connor> but like the UN a recent
one that he did was like, </connor>
<connor> he was like, I love popcorn. </connor>
<connor> So I'm going to make a, I
think it was like a 50 meter, </connor>
<connor> long popcorn container and
just fill it up with popcorn. </connor>
<connor> And then he did that and it's
massive and it's all filled up </connor>
<connor> with popcorn, </connor>
<connor> but then he took it one step
further and he invited his </connor>
<garnt> friends and he pranked them by
making this fake room in his </garnt>
<garnt> studio so that the popcorn would
fall in as if it would keep </garnt>
<garnt> into the house. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was insane. And
the videos are so short. </garnt>
<connor> He just manages like condense
that it's like a five minute </connor>
<connor> kind of like, it sounds
like David doebrick right. </connor>
<connor> Just doing it. Same thing is he, </connor>
<connor> he just does the most insane. </connor>
<connor> Like there was another one
where he like, you know, he, </connor>
<connor> he wanted to replicate the, </connor>
<connor> the force of someone going into space, </connor>
<connor> but obviously you
couldn't afford a rocket. </connor>
<connor> So what he did was he created
this contraption where it </connor>
<connor> would explode underneath him
and it would just inject, </connor>
<connor> it flew like 50 meters into
the air and like almost broke </connor>
<connor> his neck and he's just
laughing the entire time. </connor>
<joey> I'm like this guy's a psycho,
but he's so fun to watch. </joey>
<connor> And Japanese cubes are like
insane, but that's the thing. </connor>
<joey> It's like, he's a Japanese teacher, </joey>
<joey> but like he can only speak
Japanese and all that, </joey>
<garnt> but he just presents things. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so visual that you don't
have to understand what he's </garnt>
<garnt> saying to be such an entertaining video. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we're getting, </garnt>
<garnt> we're now getting to the point in YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> where to stand out, </garnt>
<garnt> you need to like have genuine
qualifications and experience </garnt>
<garnt> behind the stuff you do,
because it's like some of these, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of these creators that
we've mentioned can easily get </garnt>
<joey> jobs. </joey>
<garnt> - In the, in their field,
in their professional field. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, decos, I think he's only like 18, </garnt>
<garnt> am I like a wizard engine? </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. I mean, it
goes to show that right. </connor>
<joey> Cause like the quality of the
engineering is like so insane </joey>
<joey> at this point. </joey>
<joey> Then you have like the top
channels that doing it. Like, </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like I have an engineering
degree and I'm like baffled. </joey>
<garnt> - Like apps three years. </garnt>
<connor> I have a master's in engineering
and some of the stuff </connor>
<connor> they're coming up with this,
just like, man, this is, </connor>
<garnt> this is this what I would have
done if I had stayed in my </garnt>
<garnt> engineering course. </garnt>
<joey> - And he made the surgery robot. </joey>
<joey> Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> what the? </connor>
<connor> I, I met him as well. </connor>
<connor> And he was like the
nicest dude ever. Right. </connor>
<connor> Like, </connor>
<connor> because we were at the anime
awards and he was leaving and </connor>
<connor> we didn't really get
a chance to talk much. </connor>
<connor> Now came over just to say bye to me. Like. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds like, wow, dude, </connor>
<connor> like people don't normally
do that. That's really fun. </connor>
<connor> I mean. </connor>
<connor> - And Lily Petri was super nice. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like what I've seen the offline
TV crew just seemed like </connor>
<connor> great. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Trashy stuff like TV collab. When. </connor>
<connor> - When the world opens, </connor>
<garnt> when the world opens up and
we can fly to places or that I </garnt>
<connor> can fly to places who the knows. </connor>
<connor> - So many educational channels. </connor>
<garnt> Like obviously like everyone
wants you to CPG gray. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> To watch Tom Scott. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Where's Tom Scott. </garnt>
<garnt> I subscribe to Tom Scott, but man, </garnt>
<garnt> his videos will not leave my room. </garnt>
<connor> He says one of those channels
that I just know we've got, </connor>
<connor> like, I don't even need to
subscribe to your channel. </connor>
<connor> - I used to, I used to, </connor>
<connor> whenever I used to go to the
YouTube studio in London, </connor>
<connor> he's always there. </connor>
<connor> I just editing his videos
and I never said hi. </connor>
<connor> Cause I felt bad editing, but. </connor>
<garnt> - He seems like a machine. </garnt>
<connor> I respect, </connor>
<connor> I respect because I respect
his work ethic because he has </connor>
<connor> like a schedule. I don't
know how he's able to upload. </connor>
<connor> So consistently with like the,
the amount of videos he has. </connor>
<connor> - Corona and he's somehow
still going abroad. </connor>
<connor> - I like, he has like
really interesting ideas. </connor>
<connor> So consistently like his, his video where, </connor>
<joey> where it was about like this
video has X amount of views </joey>
<joey> that just fall back guy.
He's the one he made there. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I knew, I knew his name was familiar. </connor>
<connor> Yeah.
- We don't have red shirts. </connor>
<garnt> That guy. </garnt>
<joey> - And what, </joey>
<garnt> what impresses me the most
actually is how he's able to </garnt>
<garnt> present his information
with like zero cuts it. </garnt>
<joey> Like without a script, just,
just in, just in one test. </joey>
<garnt> How does he do that? </garnt>
<connor> - You get like a Disani
video about like the Sony, </connor>
<connor> the water bottle. It's
like a five minute video. </connor>
<garnt> Does it all in one tape, down the street. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> Like. </garnt>
<connor> - How are you doing?
This is so professional. </connor>
<garnt> So good. I'm reading off a script. </garnt>
<garnt> And even I need like
five takes to get one. </garnt>
<connor> - I do love the memes
of like, Oh, I'm here. </connor>
<garnt> Have you seen those memes? Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Breaking, breaking down. </garnt>
<connor> The Tom Scott. </connor>
<garnt> - Obviously this cook has got cook is </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone loves him. I mean. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, we're going to notch. </connor>
<connor> Wasn't he? Like, </connor>
<joey> didn't he try to change his
name to like in a nutshell, </joey>
<garnt> start in a nutshell. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I like Veritasium as one
of these really good terms. </joey>
<garnt> Amazing. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Real life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Real life. </connor>
<garnt> Like obviously smarter every day as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you guys watch, I've seen Mike Boyd, </garnt>
<garnt> the guy like loons things like
he'll like spend like a week </garnt>
<connor> just learning something and you know, </connor>
<connor> he won't stop the video
until he does it. So like, </connor>
<connor> he'll learn how there's one
video where he learned to us </connor>
<connor> shattered glass with his voice. </connor>
<joey> I feel like I've seen that everywhere. </joey>
<joey> I feel like it's really good. </joey>
<joey> And he just learns like
completely useless. </joey>
<joey> - I know, </joey>
<joey> I know a boy in a band did kind
of a parody of that where he </joey>
<connor> learned to sing in 30 days. Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. That was cool. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. Which was really cool. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Pretty good. </joey>
<connor> - Highly recommend it.
There's also like casually, </connor>
<connor> casually explained is also
kind of similar to like. </connor>
<garnt> - I, I, so like is, is he
educational or is he meme? </garnt>
<connor> Do you know? Do you know. </connor>
<connor> - Salmonella, salmonella? </connor>
<garnt> He does like casually explained, but. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, because here's the thing, </garnt>
<connor> I think that's the part, </connor>
<connor> that's the thing like there's like, </connor>
<connor> there's like engineering and
what educational Youtubers are. </connor>
<connor> Then there's like casualty, </connor>
<connor> planes and tear zoo who are
just like, I mean the, the tape, </connor>
<joey> what they say is
technically correct. Right. </joey>
<garnt> Is anyone actually watching
them to be like educated? </garnt>
<connor> Really? Nah, probably not. </connor>
<garnt> Have you watched Jewish Jay
foreman? I do not watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - He does videos mainly about London, </garnt>
<garnt> like history of London
and stuff. And like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just so insane. How well
produced these videos are. </garnt>
<garnt> I also met him ages ago. </garnt>
<garnt> He doesn't remember because
he was like four years ago. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. And he's just
obsessed with London and, </connor>
<connor> but his videos are so well
done. And it's so funny. </connor>
<connor> And like, he'll, </connor>
<connor> he'll just do a shot where
he's just in the middle of the </connor>
<connor> street in London for like two seconds. </connor>
<connor> But he has to get a
camera man. He had to get, </connor>
<connor> they had to set it all up.
It's like, it's in the same. </connor>
<connor> Wow. And it's just all
to talk about London. </connor>
<connor> Most of the time I'd highly recommend it. </connor>
<connor> If you like just general
history about London. </connor>
<joey> - Fair enough. I mean recently, </joey>
<joey> like I've definitely found myself. </joey>
<joey> I used to not watch a lot of
the YouTube videos from like </joey>
<connor> the really like big
like corporate channels. </connor>
<connor> I didn't really like
the corporate channels. </connor>
<connor> I used to look at like Wyatt
and Fox channels and be like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, it's just like a. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I want you to channel
called chatter sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> But I feel just so sad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. That name sounds familiar. </garnt>
<garnt> - They always do the video. </garnt>
<connor> Like why New York has big skylines? </connor>
<connor> Why electric calls on in America? </connor>
<connor> It's like such generic titles of like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why Walmart
is big. And it's like, </connor>
<connor> every single video is so lifeless. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. And like, it's informative. </garnt>
<garnt> I will say there's sad. There,
there is one kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say cooperation kind of
video that I do enjoy. I'm not, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know if this is
the name of the channel, </connor>
<connor> but the name of the series
is like big, great story. </connor>
<connor> They actually have like really
cool and interesting stories. </connor>
<connor> I think one of my favorite
videos of them was like, they, </connor>
<connor> they, </connor>
<connor> they were in Japan and there
was this like Japanese person </connor>
<connor> who sells painting made
in Microsoft Excel. What? </connor>
<connor> I haven't seen that.
I've never seen that one. </connor>
<connor> So there's this guy who, </connor>
<connor> there was this Japanese guy who just like, </connor>
<connor> he just wanted to express himself, </connor>
<connor> cost zero skills of Japan. Japan. </connor>
<connor> We do a lot of things in Japan, </connor>
<connor> but like he had zero skills
in like painting and like, </connor>
<connor> you know, art skills. </connor>
<connor> So he just side, </connor>
<garnt> like making pictures in
Microsoft Excel and the actually </garnt>
<garnt> like he he's been doing it for
so long that they'd started </garnt>
<garnt> to become really good. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just like such a
like uplifting story to just be </garnt>
<joey> like, it doesn't really matter
what your tools are now. </joey>
<joey> That is a big grid step. That
is the big story. Always. </joey>
<connor> - Super concise as well.
They're not too long. </connor>
<connor> And it's just. </connor>
<connor> - Great. </connor>
<garnt> There's also another story
about this soup that is being </garnt>
<connor> like made in Thailand or something. </connor>
<connor> It's like 50 years old. </connor>
<joey> It's like been boiling for
50 years. I don't remember. </joey>
<joey> I remember watching it and
it was just like, they, </joey>
<joey> they didn't want wash the place at all. </joey>
<connor> So the oil had been built up. </connor>
<connor> So there was a mountain
next to this massive pot. </connor>
<connor> Have you been there?
I have not been there. </connor>
<connor> You're going to go back down
when you go to Thailand, </connor>
<joey> if you ever like take us to Thailand, </joey>
<joey> which I'm sure will happen.
Eventually we really want to go. </joey>
<joey> I actually want to like
see if it's good or not. </joey>
<connor> If you guys want a channel
called a captain disillusion. </connor>
<joey> Yes. </joey>
<joey> 3D, like. </joey>
<joey> - Blender. </joey>
<connor> - Breaks things down. So well. </connor>
<garnt> And he like. </garnt>
<connor> - He's too talented for
YouTube as well. I think. </connor>
<joey> - There were just some channels out there </joey>
<joey> that are just like, </joey>
<joey> like cartel digital is one
that was just way too talented </joey>
<joey> for YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - I feel bad. Cause he
doesn't upload often. </joey>
<joey> But you can tell that he like, I dunno, </joey>
<joey> maybe he just wants to
do a bit more. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But I found them ages ago. </joey>
<garnt> Cause he's been uploading
for like 10 years. </garnt>
<garnt> Like his first videos are in
like three 60 P Oh Jesus. So. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I mean he came up with at the
same time as like Freddie w </garnt>
<connor> and a rocket jump. I think, </connor>
<connor> I think they didn't blow up
until like two years ago. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> Cause I remember, I
remember he was like back, </garnt>
<connor> back in the day, it was like
Freddie w and rocket jump, </connor>
<connor> taking over the YouTube scene
and then every other VX B </connor>
<connor> effects specialist was
like after him. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, they, </connor>
<connor> they kind of like did their
own thing and then that, </connor>
<garnt> that like gave way to like
other people like corridor </garnt>
<connor> digital. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Everything like that. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, there's also another channel. </connor>
<connor> I like the, you know, the Jonny
Harris, the guy left Volks, </connor>
<connor> the guy used to be the boarders on Fox. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> Challenge. It's just the same thing. </connor>
<connor> Sound good. Quality. </connor>
<connor> I'd recommend it. </connor>
<connor> It's already been blowing
up a lot on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> So I'm sure you probably seen
the videos and you recommended </connor>
<connor> the video of like why'd you
Americans eat dessert for </connor>
<connor> breakfast. That blew up a ton. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I might have seen that
one, one, like, as I said, </connor>
<connor> like once I never used to
watch Voxer or anything, </connor>
<joey> but like the earworm
series is so good. Like. </joey>
<connor> - It's essentially like
a one person who's. </connor>
<connor> - In charge of that. </connor>
<joey> It's like one woman at Vox who
just like does all these like </joey>
<joey> really in-depth analysis, </joey>
<connor> documentaries on like music
history and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> It's do the editing. It's insane. </connor>
<joey> It's so good. This episode
is sponsored by book Walker. </joey>
<connor> - Cool guys announced their
year end ranking results for the </connor>
<connor> best-selling e-books. </connor>

<connor> I'll go through the rankings
of the top for each element. </connor>
<connor> You can start with number three. </connor>
<connor> - Well, </connor>
<joey> number three is my next life
as a villainous old routes, </joey>
<garnt> lead to doom. Lighten up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, I have not read this one. </garnt>
<joey> - I have no read this one, but
I have read the second one, </joey>
<joey> which is a sentence of a bulk. Woah. </joey>
<joey> That's actually a really
cute Lionel that is game. </joey>
<garnt> And it's really well
received. Like really good. </garnt>
<joey> It's it kind of gives me like
spice of Wolf fives. Oh yeah. </joey>
<garnt> That was really good. </garnt>
<connor> - The first one I can
announce this one day. </connor>
<connor> No, don't worry. </connor>
<connor> I can announce this
one. If you like, it is, </connor>
<garnt> you are my princess volume collections. </garnt>

<joey> Wow. </joey>
<connor> Wow. </connor>
<connor> - There's some people
involved, dude is Epic. </connor>
<connor> I mean, </connor>
<connor> it's crazy to me that something
that I made could sell as </connor>
<connor> much as other like legitimate. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> The audio book version, right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> She just, she's a scary man. </joey>
<joey> I, I, you know, when you, </joey>
<connor> when you make a story around a product, </connor>
<joey> I feel like people are more
likely to give it a shot, </joey>
<joey> you know? And I think
people could see my blood, </joey>
<connor> sweat and tears. It's
really awkward to hold. </connor>
<garnt> I'll put it that for now. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. Thank you. </garnt>
<connor> Thank you bookwork. </connor>
<connor> - So moving on to the top
Mongo. Well, well, well, </connor>
<connor> well why did we start? </connor>
<connor> Why did we start with
the top overall Malin? </connor>
<connor> I feel like it should have
been the last category. </connor>
<connor> So the top manga setting
overall at number three is don't </connor>
<garnt> toy with me. Miss negatory. </garnt>
<joey> Oh yeah. That's a good Mongo. </joey>
<joey> I'm surprised that's number. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm surprised. It's number three. </garnt>
<garnt> It is a good mungus. It's wholesome. </garnt>
<joey> Tan go cute. Number two. </joey>
<garnt> - The cultured individuals really </garnt>
<garnt> is interspecies reviewers at </garnt>
<connor> number two. Am I surprised? </connor>
<connor> No. That just means there are
that many degenerates on book </connor>
<connor> Walker right now. I'm very proud. </connor>
<joey> I'm proud of you boys. I'm
proud of you, but overall. </joey>
<joey> - Of course we have to talk
about the number one top Mongo. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to talk about it. </joey>
<connor> - What is it called? </connor>
<connor> mine. Oh, did she? </connor>
<connor> Not two years in a row now let's go. </connor>
<joey> We got also the top. </joey>
<garnt> - Light novels and number
three is a that time I go ring </garnt>
<garnt> cotton as a slime light novel, </garnt>
<garnt> which I've never actually read. </garnt>
<garnt> I've already read the
manga for this. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> There's a MOG is brilliant. Yes. </connor>
<garnt> And there was the animal. </garnt>
<connor> - Or the army was great. I loved it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Animals guys. </connor>
<connor> And then number two is a same one. The, </connor>
<connor> my next life as a villainess, </connor>
<garnt> which were already established. </garnt>
<joey> And then number one is a
sentence of a book. One, </joey>
<joey> some great lineup of serious. I'm glad. </joey>
<joey> I'm glad to send it to have
book one. God, number one, </joey>
<garnt> because that is honestly, I'm surprised. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't realize there were
that many people reading it. </garnt>
<joey> It's a really refreshing because
no one's talking about the </joey>
<garnt> anime, but like my next knife
has a Vanessa and a slime. </garnt>
<garnt> Definitely got a lot more
talk and discussion on crunch. </garnt>
<connor> Although it was quite popular.
My next life is wellness. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. But I'm really shocked with the, </garnt>
<connor> you are my princess results,
man, that really did well. </connor>
<connor> All right. Could you handle it. </connor>
<connor> - Again until December the eighth? </connor>

<connor> And thank you once again to
book Walker for sponsoring this </connor>
<connor> episode. Also congratulations to. </connor>
<connor> I can't wait to frame
this a four printed paper. </connor>
<joey> - I can't wait to give this my naughty, </joey>
<garnt> not even glossy paper mailers. Seriously. </garnt>
<connor> It's just a PowerPoint slides. </connor>
<connor> I don't actually care. </connor>
<connor> - I had a great time making
it. I got a banger of a video. </connor>
<connor> That's all I ever wanted.
This is like that, </connor>
<garnt> that student that turns into
homework five minutes before </garnt>
<joey> it's like Jew, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Got it. I got it. </joey>
<joey> I get points with this. Right. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, Hey,
you've done your homework. </joey>
<connor> That's homework. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> Well the power of yellowy. Thank you both. </connor>
<connor> Thank you very much to the
sponsor of this episode book. </connor>
<connor> We'll go back to the video.
So questions for you guys. </connor>
<garnt> Is there anything else, </garnt>
<garnt> anyone you want to shout out
who has actually influenced </garnt>
<garnt> your own content or anything
about your own channel? Oh man. </garnt>
<garnt> I've, I've so many people. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, </connor>
<joey> like I feel the majority of at
least making you sound like a </joey>
<joey> panel. I go right now. </joey>
<joey> - It's always a question I
get asked at every panel who </joey>
<joey> inspired you, Joe. </joey>
<connor> - I guess I'll go first then. Cause like, </connor>
<connor> I guess the first one I
want to shout out is Philip </connor>
<connor> DeFranco. </connor>
<connor> Cause I've been watching
films since 2006 and he's been </connor>
<connor> like, he's been the one content
creator who I've basically </connor>
<connor> followed for his entire career
because I followed him from </connor>
<connor> the beginning and you know,
he at, at the moment he's, </connor>
<connor> you know, does a lot of the
news and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> But you know, I, I started, you know, </connor>
<connor> I started seeing his progression
when he was like more </connor>
<connor> villagey and just talking
about stuff on the internet and </connor>
<connor> girls and everything like
that. And I like, he was, </connor>
<connor> he was like probably the
biggest inspiration for me. Not, </connor>
<connor> not as like for the content of my channel, </connor>
<connor> but how to approach YouTube
as a job. And as, as, </connor>
<connor> as a business, </connor>
<connor> like I probably would not be
here right now if it wasn't for </connor>
<connor> Phil, because basically during my break, </connor>
<connor> when I was at the BBC and I
was like trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> how to come back to YouTube, </connor>
<connor> like a lot of the stuff he said
before about how YouTube was </connor>
<connor> and content creators should
think about their career as like </connor>
<connor> a, as like a proper career
and how it's like broadened, </connor>
<connor> broaden their income and
everything like that. </connor>
<connor> I basically got a lot. </connor>
<connor> - Of that from a lot of the
things Phil had been saying for </connor>
<connor> like years. Right. </connor>
<connor> So here's the person I want
to shout out. Cause he, </connor>
<connor> he has been like a massive
inspiration for me and I took a </connor>
<joey> lot of what I'm doing now or
the way I'm doing now behind </joey>
<garnt> the scenes from all the advice
that he's given over the </garnt>
<joey> years. For me, it's like, </joey>
<joey> I dunno like my biggest
inspirations for like how to do </joey>
<joey> YouTube and like how to present
myself on YouTube weirdly </joey>
<connor> enough came from like all of the, </connor>
<connor> kind of the big OJI YouTube
is back in the day. So like, </connor>
<connor> you know, </connor>
<connor> the AFA mentioned like AVG and
like I used to watch a lot of </connor>
<connor> his stuff and like, you know, </connor>
<connor> basically YouTube is that
everyone knows like, you know, </connor>
<connor> Felix, obviously grumps, if
we're talking like actual, </connor>
<connor> like regular voguers, </connor>
<garnt> like Ryan Higa was like a
massive ankle, right knee. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I used to watch like every, </garnt>
<connor> he got a video that came out
just cause like it's really </connor>
<connor> good. And it's just like
such a like personable dude. </connor>
<connor> And like, definitely like the
way like he used to like vlog, </connor>
<connor> especially like where he would
just sit in front of a camera </connor>
<connor> and talk about whatever. </connor>
<connor> Like I took a lot of inference
from that because that's what </connor>
<connor> I do. I just come in front of
a camera and just talk about </connor>
<connor> whatever. Right. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. And like a, you know,
like smashed back in the day, </connor>
<connor> you know, </connor>
<connor> like they had like such
overwhelming power in the YouTube </connor>
<connor> sphere where it was basically
if you're on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> like anywhere before 2012, </connor>
<connor> like it was impossible
to not watch them. Right. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. So it was because like, </connor>
<connor> I guess like when I first
got into like YouTube burrs, </connor>
<connor> like I never really went directly
to like a niche that I was </connor>
<connor> interested in. Cause I
just wasn't aware of that. </connor>
<connor> So I would just basically
watch like all the big guys and </connor>
<connor> they influenced me, you
know, in small parts. </connor>
<connor> I mean like in terms of like
Anna CIB is probably like, </connor>
<connor> probably demo was my, probably
like my biggest influence, </connor>
<connor> but you know, </connor>
<garnt> which energy of it hasn't
been influenced by demos. </garnt>
<garnt> So I think demos influenced
everyone in like, </garnt>
<connor> at least a little way because
I was around before demo. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like it's even, </connor>
<connor> it's impossible to like think
of any two contents before </connor>
<joey> demo. Like, I mean like off the demo, </joey>
<joey> it's it all he changed the
field completely. Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> Absolutely. Come back demo. </joey>
<connor> - I cannot think of my
inspirations. I mean, </connor>
<joey> obviously I was watching
my own inspiration. </joey>
<connor> No, I know I've taken like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I've definitely been taking
bits and pieces, right? </connor>
<connor> Like definitely like pots of, you know, </connor>
<connor> Peter Popsie growing up,
watching him in high school, </connor>
<connor> watching him do bits and pieces, </connor>
<connor> I think from like a lot
of different people. </connor>
<connor> But I can't think of like any
one of top of my head that has </connor>
<joey> been like huge. </joey>
<connor> - When you watch so much
content, especially on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's not just one person. </connor>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because otherwise you just end
up being exactly like that. </garnt>
<joey> Exactly. I mean, </joey>
<garnt> I'm sure we can distill down a
lot of our influences and you </garnt>
<garnt> know, take bits here and
there, but at the time. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe I can break it down and figure </connor>
<garnt> out exactly which ones </garnt>
<connor> really like gave him my style. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. It's hard to say. </connor>
<joey> Cause obviously I, I
pivoted my content so much. </joey>
<joey> I know there was inspirations there. </joey>
<connor> - And you know, it's, it's, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's not to say that like, you know, we, </connor>
<connor> we still get inspired to this day. Right. </connor>
<connor> Without new influences and
whatnot, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure like the majority of the YouTube, </connor>
<joey> as we talked about today have
influenced us in some small </joey>
<garnt> way. We have just listed
probably 90% like our influence. </garnt>
<joey> - Today. And basically,
you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Just, just in this two hour. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. Is there any one else
you guys want to shout out? </garnt>
<connor> I've got a bunch of channels
that we didn't really like talk </connor>
<garnt> about that I could just speed run through. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. Let's buy an old gas. </garnt>
<connor> No brakes. God Tia challenge. </connor>
<garnt> Love, love, love all gas. </garnt>
<garnt> No brakes. </garnt>
<garnt> I showed you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. He's like the modern day. </garnt>
<garnt> Kassem G. </garnt>
<connor> - Donna put Kassem G but more
political because Kassa McGee </connor>
<connor> was more like, let's just
throw a topic out there. </connor>
<garnt> That's funny. </garnt>
<garnt> But like also castle actively
made fun of them in a good </garnt>
<garnt> way. Like have some GS
pulled install videos. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Like some of the
best content on YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> Actually. If anything, </connor>
<connor> maybe Kassem G might have
inspired me at the time. Like, </connor>
<connor> I really enjoyed his way of
how he would insult them, </connor>
<connor> but not insult them. </connor>
<joey> But honestly, he doesn't
really do anything anymore. </joey>
<joey> And now he's just an extra in
movies. Like the transformer. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was he? I don't even know. </garnt>
<connor> You have to know what
he's up to now, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> All gas, no brakes. </connor>
<garnt> What I love about him is that
he doesn't even need to do </garnt>
<garnt> much. He just lets the stupid
people do the stupid thing. </garnt>
<connor> I think. </connor>
<connor> - Willing to go there and
he's friendly with them. </connor>
<connor> He gets them to talk to him
and it's really hard to do. </connor>
<connor> I think. And a lot of
journalists just can't get them. </connor>
<connor> He gets like, everyone knows. </connor>
<connor> He's just going to be nice. </connor>
<connor> Like he's going to show everything. </connor>
<connor> - Like some of my favorite ones were </connor>
<connor> when he went to like the
COVID party. Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> Just the biggest cesspool
I've ever seen. However. </connor>
<connor> - The time he goes somewhere,
somehow people bring up Jews. </connor>
<connor> - Like I dunno, like
he'll go to somewhere. </connor>
<connor> Jews. </connor>
<connor> - Get brought up for being the
problem. And it's like what? </connor>
<joey> The first. </joey>
<joey> - Is like sleep the lone man, hell. </joey>
<joey> - It's crazy. </joey>
<connor> And I loved it on a PO I think
he was on the history podcast </connor>
<connor> where he mentioned like, he, </connor>
<connor> the reason like his influences
that like I could go all </connor>
<connor> these places all around the world, </connor>
<connor> but the backyard in America is so crazy. </connor>
<garnt> Why would you not want to document? Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> It's so true. Don't blame him man. </joey>
<joey> It's crazy. </joey>
<joey> There's a guy called honest
guys who does like videos about </joey>
<connor> Prague. I've no interest
in going to Prague. </connor>
<garnt> I've already been, but he just, </garnt>
<connor> he's just so passionate about Prague. </connor>
<garnt> - I love it. Talking about videos, </garnt>
<garnt> watching videos that
you have no interest in. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to shout out Ristic
studies who makes essays about </garnt>
<connor> magic? The gathering. </connor>
<garnt> I don't, I don't know a
single thing about magic. </garnt>
<garnt> The gathering. I do not even
know the rules of magic. </garnt>
<joey> I've never played magic in my life. </joey>
<joey> I play magic a little bit, </joey>
<joey> but the way that he breaks down
these concepts in magic are </joey>
<joey> just so interesting. </joey>
<joey> Like I think one of my favorite
videos of his is he goes </joey>
<joey> through like the history of
like the rarest card in magic. </joey>
<joey> I like how much it sold for
everything in black Lotus or the </joey>
<connor> black Lotus. He made a video
on that and like how to like, </connor>
<joey> like how people like actually
verify like that these cards </joey>
<joey> that's cool. And then like, </joey>
<joey> cause he starts off
talking about not the heat. </joey>
<joey> He starts off, not even
talking about magic. </joey>
<connor> You start us off this video, </connor>
<connor> this video talking about rare
baseball cards and the history </connor>
<connor> of like how these like all these cards, </connor>
<connor> how these cards have sold for so much. </connor>
<connor> And then he pivots that into
magic and it sounds like a good </connor>
<joey> dog. </joey>
<joey> amazing. </joey>
<garnt> Like he's a great con and
he's editing as God's here as </garnt>
<joey> well. Speaking of magic, but
on the actual, like regular, </joey>
<joey> this is a channel I watched
quite regularly called Chris </joey>
<connor> Ramsey. </connor>
<connor> - I think I've Oh, is it
the guy who does the opens? </connor>
<joey> - He does. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> He's he's, he's like a
professional magician, </connor>
<joey> but he also has his own
YouTube channel where he, </joey>
<connor> he got famous off of like get
buying these like super hard, </connor>
<connor> like 3D puzzles and like solving them. </connor>
<connor> But he also just does these
like videos where he like, </connor>
<connor> he basically like he did the
train before it was a train. </connor>
<connor> He actually does like the
professional magician reacts like </connor>
<connor> magic, </connor>
<connor> but like he actually has
qualifications cause he's actually </connor>
<garnt> a professional magician and
he like kind of like tries to </garnt>
<connor> like, he obviously, you know, </connor>
<connor> magician doesn't tell
their secrets. Right. </connor>
<connor> But he like kind of reacts
to it and says like, </connor>
<connor> this is a good magic trick
because of this. And like, </connor>
<connor> he kind of pinpointed
in ways where it's like, </connor>
<connor> you wouldn't really be able to see a list. </connor>
<connor> You were in the same
field and like he's right. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know what
camera he uses, but Holy, </connor>
<connor> his camera quality is like red camera. </connor>
<connor> Like I want to know what
camera he uses the most insane </connor>
<joey> quality camera that I've ever seen. </joey>
<connor> - Obviously loved Linus tech tips. </connor>
<connor> So that video where he talked
about possibly retiring Blake </connor>
<garnt> broke, that broke me as well. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? Like it's such a, </garnt>
<connor> like such an honest video
and you just can't help it. </connor>
<garnt> - Why don't, you know what that felt like? </garnt>
<connor> It felt like leaving. </connor>
<connor> You felt like that talk where it was like, </connor>
<connor> your dad's just like, </connor>
<connor> so me and your mom are going
to break up and you know, </connor>
<connor> I know, I know it's confusing times. </connor>
<connor> That's exactly what I
felt like, man, like, </connor>
<garnt> honestly it's not your fault. </garnt>
<connor> Trust me. It's like, we were
just, we've tried everything. </connor>
<connor> If anyone deserves to retire
it's lineup, the man has been. </connor>
<joey> - Like a, a staple of
YouTube and he's been, </joey>
<joey> he's been on the grind, man. </joey>
<joey> He's been on the grind and
he's just like, you know, </joey>
<connor> it's obvious that his, you
know, the company's built up, </connor>
<connor> everyone just loves to work. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's just so great. It's so great. </connor>
<connor> Seeing people like he would
just see me who seemed lovely. </connor>
<connor> You could be the biggest
dictator at all. I don't know, </connor>
<connor> but he just seems like
such a genuine nice guy. </connor>
<garnt> - Speaking of Linus, </garnt>
<joey> we got to talk about his
latest collaborator too mad, </joey>
<joey> the mic off crack head of YouTube. </joey>
<connor> Like my love to his content
so much. But my God, </connor>
<connor> I go out there with ADHD, one
of his videos and I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> my attention span is destroyed right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Friend, who you have, </connor>
<joey> who you just can't introduce
to people like you're so funny </joey>
<connor> and I love you, but I can't. </connor>
<connor> - So he said, </connor>
<connor> he's the one friend that you'll
proud to know that he's a </connor>
<connor> friend of you, </connor>
<connor> but you're also ashamed to
say that he's a friend of you. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a bunch of other
channels value select two. </garnt>
<connor> I've just shown you guys a million times. </connor>
<connor> This guy does like skits and
he's probably the best skit </connor>
<connor> channel on YouTube.
Doesn't really good music. </connor>
<connor> Like January music as well, just so funny. </connor>
<connor> And he hasn't blown up yet.
He hasn't blown up insane. </connor>
<garnt> And I've literally been like
touting this guy to everyone. </garnt>
<connor> I know for like months, </connor>
<connor> like every time I go to
someone's house, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> give me the ox code. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'll put on a song. You've had no ship. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Speaking of other skit channels, </joey>
<connor> I want to shout out
Britain, Nick, this is like, </connor>
<connor> this is like a channel that's
been like around for years. </connor>
<connor> Right. But he, he's also a skit channel, </connor>
<connor> but he's one of those videos. </connor>
<connor> He's one of those channels
that uploads once every year, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> One video. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it's like a two minute skit. </connor>
<connor> Most of the time to five minutes gear. </connor>
<connor> But his skits are so densely
packed that it's like another </connor>
<connor> level of quality. Like every, </connor>
<connor> every scene in the skits
leads into the other scene, </connor>
<connor> perfectly. The writing is just
like, so top-notch, you know, </connor>
<connor> you know, when you see like a scene in a, </connor>
<connor> in like a sitcom or
something and you know, </connor>
<connor> it's gone through like a
hundred different rewrites. </connor>
<connor> That's the kind of the
quality I'm talking about. </connor>
<connor> But because he, like, </connor>
<connor> he's been around for like
nine years or something, </connor>
<garnt> but because he only uploads
once every year, he just, </garnt>
<garnt> he just doesn't like that. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't do that on YouTube anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. Right. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I also, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> What's quantity, but cracked. </connor>
<connor> He's like that one friend
who like is just a piece of. </connor>
<connor> But then the actually funny. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. I mean, </connor>
<connor> I do love that you'll know that
dad's complete con but then </connor>
<garnt> she funny crack it. He
just does discord humor. </garnt>
<connor> So perfectly such a good. </connor>
<connor> He is discord as a person.
You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - A guy who, when I
used to do prank calls, </garnt>
<connor> he doesn't really give any views anymore. </connor>
<connor> It was called house hotel. And like, </connor>
<connor> he's so good at prank calling. </connor>
<connor> And he knows all the like scams
inside out really good way. </connor>
<joey> I was influenced by him
with your scam call. </joey>
<joey> I used to really like his
videos. And I thought I found it, </joey>
<joey> like, </joey>
<connor> I really liked how he dealt
with it and he would keep them </connor>
<connor> going. </connor>
<connor> There's a few other
channels as well called us, </connor>
<connor> the guy kit Boga as well.
He does pranks really good. </connor>
<connor> And there's a guy who,
God don't know his name, </connor>
<connor> but he hadn't said the engine Kohl center, </connor>
<connor> that video was insane.
And that was really. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's, there's, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of content
creators that I don't know their </garnt>
<connor> channel name, but I
can name their content. </connor>
<garnt> Like if I say, Hey, those two
Indian guys that built stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously like critical. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well obviously we talked about like, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like proceeded and
critical the same thing, </garnt>
<joey> but like different content
they're talking about. </joey>
<connor> Like they do the same
thing essentially. Right. </connor>
<joey> But pro CD is like talking
about food and Adam and and like </joey>
<garnt> meme and critical is just. </garnt>
<garnt> And. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like critical.
We could do a video about, </connor>
<connor> and he's like one of the few
content creatures that can </connor>
<connor> literally do a video about anything. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like he, like, he can, </connor>
<connor> he can make it like the top
10 massacres of all time. </connor>
<joey> And I'll be like, man, if
the Holocaust a number one, </joey>
<joey> I'm not leaving this video, man. </joey>
<garnt> my favorite video where I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> this is a video of the only
critical chromate, which was a. </joey>
<connor> So it was so disgusting, but
so good at the same time. </connor>
<connor> You're like, I hate you so
much, but Dan, this is yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Another YouTube. I think
we've all watched is the, </connor>
<joey> you won't know his name, </joey>
<joey> but Q army Japan is what it's called, </joey>
<joey> but he's the dude who makes knives. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, yes. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Makes nice out of everything.
I got a smoke out of jello. </connor>
<joey> I comment on one of his videos is. </joey>
<joey> - I hate to be in a jail cell with him. </joey>
<connor> - There's a guy called virtually vain. </connor>
<connor> He also did prank calls. He
didn't really upload much. </connor>
<connor> He did one recently, but he was
like the God of prank calls. </connor>
<connor> You did like a great African, </connor>
<joey> like he did like African
dictator or something for calls. </joey>
<garnt> It was so good. </garnt>
<garnt> But this man is that the
King of prank calls up. </garnt>
<connor> Do you guys know sorrow TV? </connor>
<connor> - He doesn't have that. That
makes that sound familiar. </connor>
<connor> - Just the he's like the only
channel I like that does like </connor>
<connor> Reddit videos. Like when
he like reads a sub Reddit, </connor>
<connor> like all the other ones. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you talking about the ask
Reddit videos where it's just </garnt>
<connor> like this computerized
voice. I was just like awful. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. This is like, whatever. </connor>
<connor> Whenever Sydney does
any makeup or anything, </connor>
<connor> I just hear ask Reddit this time. </connor>
<garnt> I might be out those videos, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Our TV is like, actually
like, you know what? </garnt>
<connor> A video that shouldn't require talent. </connor>
<connor> She brings a ton of talent. </connor>
<connor> That's our team. </connor>
<connor> He's so good at doing voices
and like voicing the like </connor>
<connor> Reddit thing. It's like, wow. </connor>
<garnt> - Everyone was just
dogs. Wait, wait, is it, </garnt>
<connor> is it actually just the
same ask Reddit threads. </connor>
<connor> But like this it's like
a professional voiceover </connor>
<connor> essentially. </connor>
<connor> It's like voice to them and
I'm just like, man, they, they, </connor>
<garnt> they leveled up. Their
voice actually got boy. </garnt>
<connor> Nice guys. </connor>
<connor> - It's actually like a guy who's amazing </connor>
<connor> is like doing voices. </connor>
<connor> Like you're so good at
like, I'm a voice actor, </connor>
<connor> but I can't do that. </connor>
<connor> - It's like hearing like, </connor>
<garnt> like Morgan Freeman or like
narrate and ask Reddit threads. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - He'll swap the voices really well. </connor>
<joey> Soak it with comedic timing, James. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't really upload anymore. </joey>
<joey> - Griffin is like a guy that does lap. </joey>
<connor> It's kind of sounds familiar. </connor>
<connor> He's the guy who does like
the one dude 50 voices or </connor>
<connor> whatever. He's like. </connor>
<connor> - Nana's shout out to Nana's
cause now this has been around </connor>
<connor> for light. </connor>
<garnt> knows. Hell yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I remembered yanas back when she was, </connor>
<connor> she was like the daughter
of fortune and just, </connor>
<connor> just seeing her like debut,
like debut as a V Chiba, </connor>
<joey> like it's it was just like, </joey>
<connor> it was just like such an obvious choice. </connor>
<connor> I know you didn't think about
it until it happens. Right? </connor>
<connor> Like the VCU I'm just like,
that's the perfect matter. </connor>
<connor> Of course she wants to, </connor>
<garnt> she was a beach you buy
before Vichi was existed. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's be honest. </garnt>
<connor> - I was voice acting online
since like 2013, 2014. </connor>
<connor> And she was still like the staple. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I pitched posting. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And that was back then. </connor>
<joey> And it's crazy to see that
she's like peaking now. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's really cool to
see someone doing well. </joey>
<garnt> Who's been around for so long
a node city obviously. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Like circle tunes HD as well.
That guy just a move stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - I really like how he
was basically. Cause he, </garnt>
<connor> he can animate. Right? </connor>
<connor> He does. He doesn't need to animate. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like it's
better because of that. </connor>
<connor> You must see in his videos,
it's the guy who has like, </connor>
<joey> he he's basically like
an animation Youtuber, </joey>
<joey> but instead of actually animating, </joey>
<joey> he just like goes into
Photoshop and just like wiggle </joey>
<joey> wiggles, like your. </joey>
<joey> - Models around. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. That, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Jenny Nicholson as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Up. It's not jump as good as
the gaming Youtuber who like, </garnt>
<connor> he was the first person who
actually did VR gaming videos, </connor>
<connor> but just made it like
he, he, like I said, he, </connor>
<connor> he has this perfect line
of like comedic analysis on </connor>
<joey> literally just like VR games. Right. </joey>
<joey> Cause I I've I've I've not
seen any other content creator </joey>
<joey> that focuses on VR games except for him. </joey>
<garnt> And he, he definitely set the bar high. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh. </garnt>
<connor> - Well the is cold, </connor>
<connor> but he's been at my
recommended a bunch of, </connor>
<connor> he like makes video games and

<connor> We'll let me know that guys. </connor>
<garnt> - Is there any one you think
is like a low-key Wiebe? </garnt>
<connor> it's like, it's like these
last couple of years, </connor>
<joey> like people who we thought had
no affiliation to animate or </joey>
<joey> just like Yama we've forgot
Carson. Call me, call us. </joey>
<joey> Oh yeah. He is he's
he's not a low-key weep. </joey>
<garnt> He's a, he's a full degenerate. </garnt>

<connor> - I have a lot of recommendations
to go and watch tonight, </connor>

a dense episode of like </joey>
<joey> recommendations. </joey>
<joey> Like write that down right
away. Please slow down please. </joey>
<connor> - Just rapid fire recommendations. Like. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I feel like we did gloss
over a lot of the obvious, </garnt>
<garnt> bigger content creators. </garnt>
<connor> - Many creators that I was
already affiliated with. </connor>
<joey> So obviously ditis and Emily. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's amazing. I don't
need to mention that. </joey>
<joey> - We didn't mention our friends
because you guys should know </joey>
<garnt> by now. </garnt>
<garnt> If I've talked to you
in a DM, that probably, </garnt>
<garnt> that probably means that that
means I already know you. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? And yeah, </joey>
<joey> I think that's probably a good, </joey>
<garnt> I'm just waiting for the
comment being like, no, </garnt>
<joey> if only they did this with anime. </joey>
<connor> - Do you guys actually watch that? Like, </connor>
<garnt> cause I watched John super eye patch. </garnt>
<garnt> - I watched the cow. I want
to shout out beyond Ghibli, </garnt>
<garnt> beyond Ghibli does
amazing animated videos. </garnt>
<connor> And it's, it's hard to describe like, </connor>
<connor> like an anime YouTube channel. Right. </connor>
<connor> Because that's what I do, right? </connor>
<connor> Like how do I, how do I, </connor>
<connor> how do I describe this
animal YouTube channel? </connor>
<garnt> Basically he does amazing
anime analytical content. </garnt>
<garnt> Did a great one on recently. </garnt>
<connor> I think, I think check
him out was pretty good. </connor>
<connor> I think they have a. </connor>
<connor> - Lot of misses, but when
they hit, they hit good. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've got to give a shout out
to my boy shaves like, Nope. </connor>

<garnt> section. </garnt>
<joey> Okay. I'll need you digest. </joey>
<garnt> Which is a series a where Chaves, this, </garnt>
<joey> this energy where it goes

<joey> like some of his favorite
YouTube videos to do with like in </joey>
<joey> the anime, </joey>
<joey> YouTube is least favorite
least favorites as well. </joey>
<joey> And this is like the one series. </joey>
<joey> I've pretty much think every
anime, YouTube watches, </joey>
<joey> even though, even if they don't want to. </joey>
<connor> - I told him I'm like everyone watches, </connor>
<connor> everyone doesn't want. </connor>
<joey> - Every attitude of a secretly
wants to be on the good side. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, did I make it
onto the good one this week? </joey>
<garnt> - The reason I like watching
it is because my taste in what </garnt>
<garnt> makes a good YouTube or like
what makes an interesting </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube video is so. </garnt>
<connor> - Different. </connor>
<connor> - It's a good critic. Right? </connor>
<joey> You can just appreciate the
cake that he's doing and don't </joey>
<joey> give a about you if you disagree, </joey>
<joey> which is more often than normal. I do. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Don't worry. Shaves. </connor>
<joey> I'll do more interview videos for you. </joey>
<garnt> I feel like the worst thing
you can do as a critic is just </garnt>
<joey> flip-flop right, right. </joey>
<garnt> If people know your personality
and people know what you'd </garnt>
<joey> like, they don't give it. </joey>
<garnt> It doesn't really matter if
I disagree with your opinion, </garnt>
<joey> I'm still gonna watch it anyway, </joey>
<joey> because I know what you like. </joey>
<garnt> And I take everything you say
with a grain of salt system </garnt>
<joey> and respect about critics is that like, </joey>
<joey> they're not afraid of the
backlash because at the end of the </joey>
<joey> day, that is their opinion. </joey>
<garnt> Right? And it's like, </garnt>
<joey> rather than flip-flopping
on your own words again. </joey>
<garnt> - She's got to double down, </garnt>
<garnt> you got to double down
on Europeans being like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't care. </garnt>
<joey> - If the majority think
that this is a good video. </joey>

video. These reasons, you know? </joey>
<joey> I mean, I've already, </joey>
<garnt> I've already shouted out scam
Cambodia reviews before. Yep. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like he's closed Christian pants. </garnt>

LGTBQ and he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> he's just such a funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - Person. </garnt>
<garnt> His editing is kind of bad. </garnt>
<connor> - But like, man, is he funny? </connor>
<connor> He's so funny. Like he's just great. </connor>
<connor> He's just bring such energy
to shift Tuskegee energy. </connor>
<connor> He's. </connor>
<connor> - Like the gay best
friend, everyone wishes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah man, like if I
need a gossip session. </connor>
<connor> - I would want to have a gossip session </connor>
<connor> with crispy nuts, man. </connor>
<connor> Crispy, crispy. </connor>
