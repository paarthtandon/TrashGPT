<SPEAKER_04> - What's up Mike Wazowski enthusiast? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My favorite, Mike Wazowski. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you're all Mike
Wazowski enthusiasts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm your host, Joey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and with me is Garnt and Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know who we are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, that was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> let's just jump right into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No wasting time. You
guys know who we are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're fucking, how many episodes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 25 at this point, 26? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't remind me man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even know.
- It's just 25 I believe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw a brilliant comment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was on episode
21 or 22 or something- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- That said... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The top comment was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "How has it already been 22 episodes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It still feels like episode four." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I totally agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember how
many episodes it was ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where I was like, "Yeah,
were just like a month </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into this really."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was like episode 18 or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I remember you said that was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that math don't add up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 18 Weeks in a month, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it felt like this year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking hell.
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but what are we
gonna talk about today lads? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, this is the YouTuber episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so we're gonna discuss some
of our favorite Youtubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and just generally discuss
Youtubers that we watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the ones that we wanna talk about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically we just simping
over other content creators. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your favorite Youtuber's
favorite Youtuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Who is it?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Who is it gonna be? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Still wanna bear in mind
that we've said this before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but sometimes people forget it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They have to come here
to be on the podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no exceptions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love all the comments that are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "But they have a TV? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can just get them on a Skype call." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing about this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we can talk about the Calli episode now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cause that's out.
- Now that's it's out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And all the speculation
that they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, she's just gonna
appear on the TV, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we just fucking dunk on them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, "JK, she's right here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Calli was indeed there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, I don't know
if we actually prefaced </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in that episode because it's
been like what, four weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As of us recording this
then it came out, but, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For people who are wondering, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> she was physically sitting
right here as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Calli that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Calli was, yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meilyne he looking at me it's like I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We signed an NDA.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we just want to preference that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like she was actually here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we can say we
signed an NDA, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, we signed an NDA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's pretty obvious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we would have had to sign an NDA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is there an NDA on us signing an NDA? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanna make sure
what's the NDA level? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How many NDAs do you (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We can't disclose that
we've signed an NDA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] You can't
say how it was filmed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't say how it was done, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but you guys know how it was done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's pretty obvious how it was done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we did it.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We did it, we nailed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I've had two hell
weeks back to back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man, you have had the worst
fucking experience on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know. Since this is
a YouTube related thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we will jump into the
Youtubers after this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So on the convention
horror story episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is episode 23 I believe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 22. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it 22?
- Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, wow! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, well that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't remember the episode numbers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that episode we recorded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I spoke about getting
hired to do the Samsung ad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and were like, "He-he that's
funny, I got undercharged." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Turned out it was not he-he funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the company fucking
struck my video down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was just, oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was almost worst that
they replied to our emails. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because normally you just, if it's Sony </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or it's a giant music company- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To explain, they contents
claimed your video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> am I correct? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they gave you a copyright strike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They copystriked your video, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And we copystriked Sea Dogs in the ad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And normally, like as a Youtuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when you've done like from... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially someone in my position </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you just used anime footage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> copyright strikes aren't
anything new for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the normal thing I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is like reply to them being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, this is fair use and everything." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And 90% of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they just don't reply.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they're Japanese companies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I've never dealt with
a copystrike situation- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Were they have replied. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where they've just back to back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm actually...
(Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I almost wished they didn't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like, "Oh my God!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It must be hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like this... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never had a more rude company. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I don't expect
them to be nice to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they don't owe me anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But just being polite would be nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've had some seriously
bad luck with (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean like the whole ultra- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All of my videos have
been claimed twice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I lost a lot of money on that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then this one obviously happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But this one was just frustrating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they hired me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the ad that I'm voicing
in, they struck me for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that reasoning was
because I showed the footage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and in my Fiverr gig that
where they hired me, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the video was for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for people who don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was doing a video where
it was a Fiverr seller </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was a voice actor, and
on my Fiverr gig I said like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, anything you order
will be used in the video." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I was like, "Hey man, you guys know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was gonna use this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One, you should have told me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can you at least give me the..." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause this was
misunderstanding and whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Give me a chance to remove the footage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because on YouTube you can
actually edit the video live, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can actually remove stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we we'll.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all know this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was saying like, "Hey,
just remove this strike, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it takes one button </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'll get rid of the
copyright stuff right away." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like clearly this is not a big deal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> let's just sort this out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And their response was
like, "We're too busy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And bear in mind, it is one button. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is one button to
remove the strike, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's the button
that's just so far away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They replied with
something along the lines of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "We have so many projects going
on, we're extremely busy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bear in mind, our email chain
is like 20 fucking emails. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've got a huge... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> This is bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As if you're not busy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was less buttons to claim
the video in the first place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what the hell? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I told in the email, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You could have emailed me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have removed it ASAP." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, "Well
we don't know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We didn't wanna deal with
talking and all that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause there like, to explain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there are several levels
of copyright strike, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can just claim the content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and give the content
creators zero strikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then if you do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then they can edit out
the copywrited material, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and-
- Which I would have done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which he would have done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, but they went like the nuclear option. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just straight up gave you a strike, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> put a strike in your account- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Took the video down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Took the video down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and so you have zero
control over the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> To explain to people.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And a strike is, I mean,
I'm sure you all know this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but three strikes and your channel's gone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of copyright strikes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I explained that to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like, "Well
you know, not our problem." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Well, I mean, kinda is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you're the one who did this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, it doesn't
really need to be this way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's very easy to fix." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And they just kept saying,
"Well, we don't really care." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was just awful, just awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And fuck, what else happened? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> God, I might have cussing
while I think about the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt giggle) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember you politely saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know, "Hey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I probably need to talk
about this on my channel." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes so, I told them, "Hey..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they were just
being so uncooperative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were even fine with
the idea of me editing it out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But they kept saying, "hey,
just ask YouTube to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just ask YouTube." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem is right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that YouTube, as it should be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't involved with it. It
doesn't involve with this issue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's just a mediator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're just the ones who host it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not their problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They kept saying, "We've
gone through YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so why are you contacting us? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Go through YouTube's system." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't think they understood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that YouTube tells you to contact them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's not their problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - YouTube is like, you
have to talk to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's what we're trying to tell them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like talking to a fucking wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they are like,
they just don't get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think they understand
YouTube's system so well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not only do they not get
it, but it's frustrating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they don't care to understand it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They don't care to
understand, they don't get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because they've got their result, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the video down.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you know, after every... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We sent like 10 emails back and forth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think maybe it even caught them up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they kinda like shrugged it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So nothing's happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So in the email we write saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, well, I hate to say this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we're probably gonna
have to re upload the video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which I am doing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're probably gonna have
to explain in that video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why it's been taken down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which may make you look bad." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And they immediately responded with like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "How dare you try and blackmail us?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, "We will not entertain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nor give in to blackmail." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "What are you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the US government
dealing with terrorists?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We will not negotiate with terrorists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was literally
the vibe of this email. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We will not take this slander. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - They went full fucking Karen mode, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "I am the victim actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How dare you come to my house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you threaten me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's literally the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They literally did the full 180. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] They said
"We will never give in". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We will never give in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Connor]
We will never give in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We will never give in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay actually, guess which
country this company is from? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it will make so much sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just take a guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What country do you think
is super strict with rules? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (sighs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Top of your head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would think in some
kind of Asian country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, European.
- Russia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, Germany. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're following the rules.
(imitating German accent) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That makes sense, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I tried so many routes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like trying to get this
done through YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have even the company saying like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, they don't care that..." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They are totally fine
with me getting the stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> removed from the video
and re uploading it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they just don't want to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't want to remove the strike. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so as also, I asked Fiverr, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I said, "Hey Fiverr, I know
that I did use that footage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's up in the air
and if it's fair use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or not, whatever, et cetera, et cetera." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fiverr, even though I was
critical of them in that video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did say that I think it's
wrong if Fiverr takes... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fiverr takes a bit of the tips, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I don't think they should do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they also charge 20% on everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Fiverr actually reached
out on my behalf to the company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and asked, "Hey, we
know this is a problem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but hey, could you please
put the video back up?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, so Fiverr had your back? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fiverr backed me up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh nice! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what they told Fiverr? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt And Joey] What?
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They said to Fiverr, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We wanna keep the strike on his channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he tried to blackmail us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what they told Fiverr. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No joke, that's what they told. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This company was just so
petty the whole way through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so tragic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And so now I'm just re uploading the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and just explaining that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So do you still have a strike? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Still have the strike
unfortunately, they won't remove it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But at least you're gonna
slightly call them out right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in the video? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, I mean, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're probably not
gonna say them by name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but still-
- I mean it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If you look through the video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you can see the name of the company, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> at least it's there.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like, I dunno... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because the way I've
been conditioned as... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The way I was taught as a kid
was to get problems resolved. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's polite, you know, to ask politely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and to resolve conflicts in adult manner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, be civil about it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah be civil about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the more I'm on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the more, especially as a Youtuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've realized that to get problems solved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and to get shit done, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it goes against everything
I was taught, because... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're the best way
to get shit resolved </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just go out into the
public and go, "Fuck you". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's true though, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because we've been conditioned
now to get a problem resolved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is to make as much fucking noise possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey fanbase, I'm gonna give
you a new target to go off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Seek em.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's unfortunate, because
I always as a last resort, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> tweet about it or make it a public issue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I just don't like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's really- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there's a part of
you that makes you look bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like an asshole being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yo, but I got this following, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'ma set the dogs on this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Release the hounds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Release the hounds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels like that's the
only way to get things done, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when it's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love the fact that the official way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get problems resolved on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is just to fucking at
team YouTube on Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just get people to retweet that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of having a proper
chain of communication. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No, you just got to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as much fucking noise
on Twitter as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not a last resort
to at team YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a requirement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If it's a YouTube problem,
I'll at team YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But this shit was kind of that company, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and honestly their social media... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I found their social
media isn't everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're pretty small. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If I wanted to make them
known, I could have tweeted out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "Hey guys,
go and fucking spam </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their social media ask
them to remove the strike." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't know, I just
didn't wanna do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't wanna use your
power for that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's sad as well,
'cause I could do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and that would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I'm using my power, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then also the only reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they aren't taking me seriously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is because I'm an individual. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly,
- [Joey] right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's unfair
because they're a company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they think that I'm just a fly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that they can just
swat me away every time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which they just kept doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, at any point I
could have just made... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The thing is, right, is that
you don't want to say it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but if people search
for the company's name, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could easily make it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that the stuff that comes
up is pretty bad for them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) Could
have easily have done that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm not going to,
cause I'm not an asshole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You might be a flyer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you're a flyer that's
about six feet long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's gonna be a little
hard to swat you away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like such a
thing, 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, I really wanna
abuse my power right now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go on a power trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really wanna thoroughly
abuse my power right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and make your life hell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you guys are
being absolute assholes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cigar in one hand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's get them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like trying to find a
right balance between like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got my integrity, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna be a good person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at the same time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just the world is making it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super fucking hard sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it fucking sucks
that it's this way, but... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's just that war between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the traditionalist way of doing things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the new age things of doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, you know, even
if YouTube right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is such a massive thing worldwide, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> technically speaking, it's
only been around for what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 15 years?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's just, I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just the age of social media now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it is all about making
as much noise as possible, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you are someone
very much in the wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and your logic is fucked,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Somehow some people are
able to make more noise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than the other person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> therefore they are the right ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they win in the end.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's a very, I
would say backwards way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's just the way the
world is now unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's just the
hands that we've been dealt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Unfortunately with YouTube system, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really sad that it only ever gives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> any benefit to the claimant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like you kind of
don't really have a choice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it sucks because people
who don't wanna do it... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I don't want to do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to make a
fuss about it on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I probably might've
been able to get it resolved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just made it hell for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I just bombed their
social medias and just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It might've worked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but did I want to find out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and would I felt good about it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like probably not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't wanna resort to that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, It's horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the thing about,
especially with YouTube copyright, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that there's just been... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything that's been mentioned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything that people
say is all fucking guesswork. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the thing is,
there is no precedence, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the highest
level this can go up to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like-
- Supreme court? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like court right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's only happened
once between one creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and one creator, which is like H3H3. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's been the only precedence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about anything regarding
YouTube copyright. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We've never had an individual
go up against the company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So nobody knows how that's
gonna end up really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think because the company
doesn't really want that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it'll look bad for them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And no individual wants to be the test. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly, nobody
wants to be the first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you really wanna
be that company picking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on a singular dude? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then that dude also rally
the internet behind him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You probably don't want that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You might win it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but everyone will think you're an asshole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In that situation,
kind of everyone loses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There is no single winner at that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe the creator can come out of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if he's willing to go through it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The creator might come
out with a lot of respect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and might get a lot of
community support and yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it could be worth it, but
it's such a big gamble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It could also completely
go the other way around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It could also completely
just ruin your life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It could bankrupt you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It can not only
bankrupt that individual, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it could also leave an
example for other companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to start abusing that, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Oh well, they
lost it in the court case, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so let's go out and
just fucking snipe down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all these individual creatives." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nobody fucking understands the law anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> None of us really
understand fair use laws. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How the fuck are the fucking jury </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna understand fair use laws? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what, you used anime
ghoul in your video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this company owns said anime ghoul, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but doesn't actually own it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, yes, your honor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Geez, I have to mask even
how world wide YouTube is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How do you sue someone
that's in a different country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with different laws? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if none of you
are an American company, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which laws are you using? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're using YouTube's laws or? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not an expert so I'd love to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I think that's why at least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the majority of anime
Youtubers who have been caught </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> using anime footage in their videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have managed to get away with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because in Japan we
don't have fair use laws, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but in America where YouTube is hosting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we do our fair use laws.
- [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it just never happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Japanese look at that
and were like, "Oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Well I guess we're gonna back away now." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just put in the work that time either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to try and figure out if they can do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is an unfair system because,
it really just fucks over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> any of the small creators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like if you're a small creator, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the best strategy you can go for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is befriend a bigger creator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because if you're ever in any trouble, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you're gonna rely on
them to make noise for you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because you can't do it for yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I can't really think of a better way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go about it aside from that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Except just fucking giving up, clearly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like literally no other
way of going around that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, right?
- Yeah, it sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's kind of unfortunate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause even creatives our sizes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's still difficult to get things fixed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the only creators I
can think of that would be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get shit done is
probably like Mr.Beast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he's obviously... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Youtuber poster boy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If YouTube's really friendly with you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll help you out.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They'll figure out a
way to make it go away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but it's like one out
of how many million channels? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the thing right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's maybe like a hundred, I bet... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No more than a hundred of those people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who can have that kind of power. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause even we're big creators, I guess- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're big creators in the anime field, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but in the overall
fucking scheme of things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're just a fucking pebble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're still decently sized though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah but there's, I
saw this I think in 2020, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like beginning of 2020,
like rough estimate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's I think over 10,000 channels now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with over a million subs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we're definitely expanding more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you'd still think
that the ad revenue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're maybe bringing in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is more than a Google employee, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it might be worth having someone... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but how many
Google employees are there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, true.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I guess that's tough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - At the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes, we may be big in our separate fields </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe compared to
other smaller creators, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or people who don't do stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but in a bigger sense, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the ceiling is very, very high. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It should be nice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you know, there's
like 45% of your ad revenue, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it'd be nice to know that
they give a fuck about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Not just host the videos.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean they're big enough
where they don't care about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't care about.
- Yeah, they don't really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 1 million creators,
1 million subscribers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like nothing.
- True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I guess they didn't
really care about the credits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that can actually affect their reputation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which are obviously the super big ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 0.001%, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I mean, I get it
when you see on Twitter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll be a dude with like 20 subs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like man, "YouTube's so
unfair that the small guys." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, "I mean,
come on you have 20 subs." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you don't really
have much to lose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know you shouldn't be
discriminating against sizes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but also I think there
should be a prioritize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on people who are living off it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they've use the system throughout. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel sorry for
YouTube at the same time as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm like-
- You can't win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm thinking about this
from their perspective </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, how do you solve every problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have on YouTube? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because YouTube right
now is too fucking large, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's too much content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to be able to know what
everything, everyone is doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything being uploaded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like it's just an
impossible puzzle to solve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You jiggle around one thing and
then another piece pops out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it feels like, where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like they are doing
the best that they can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like as creators, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we all are very grateful to YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the sucky thing is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if we have a problem with YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have to make them look
like the fucking devil. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You what I mean.
- Yeah, we do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas my personal opinion is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know YouTube's doing the best they can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know there's some massive problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that happen where some
people getting banned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or some people getting
demonetized by accidents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything, and it can
affect livelihood by... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I look at this also
from the perspective of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hey, this platform is
just fucking massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's gonna be impossible to
solve every problem with a bot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's what they need to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They need to have a bot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you can't have actual
humans looking over everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's being uploaded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah because, hasn't YouTube in terms of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff that Google owns, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hasn't YouTube been in the red </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the past four years or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - YouTube's constantly losing money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's not the
value of making money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the amount of information
that YouTube brings, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Google is priceless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like what, 50 hours of
content uploaded every minute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or second I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's way more than that.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's more than that.
- Way more than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's insane, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But no, it's scary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I guess that comes
with the price of it being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just a brand new type
of entertainment, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure radio and TV had
probably the exact same problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it first started to rise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's only after decades
and decades of trial and error </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they've kind of smoothed it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, what I find funny is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when YouTube first started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get super, super commercialized, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And people will start
having all these problems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with copyright and a lot
of people taking advantage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of the system. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People were like, whoa, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a fucking dying platform, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's go over to Twitch everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then now the Twitch is starting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to burst into the mainstream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're now seeing like the same problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> affect Twitch creators now.
- [Joey And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And everyone's like, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Twitch is getting so hard now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Twitch is getting axed
even harder than YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the new DMCA Law's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are bloody ridiculous on Twitch now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was the one thing
that Twitch was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, thank God we don't
have to worry about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing copyrighted stuff
on our Twitch anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then Twitch was like..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And when Amazon kind
of stepped in was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, about that..."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it's more like the music industry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> has just been stuck in its ways
for like the past 30 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is weird though because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> websites like Newgrounds to this day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can use copyrighted music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they won't do anything about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's 'cause no one owns Newgrounds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Newgrounds is still privately owned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but the thing
is just like is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even when it was in its prime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the music industry never stepped in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and tried to do something about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were just like, "Well..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because the money wasn't there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like when the live streaming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they see all of these
billion dollar buy-ins- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like they are pretty
same but music industry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are like, "Hello..."
- yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically, I feel like
it's just the contents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone tries to find
this new platform where... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean we talked about the
golden age of the internet before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where things were less
regulated and everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but as soon as something
does get popular enough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just an inevitability that companies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just gonna wanna get in on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's going to be more regulated, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're gonna have content creators </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just gonna have less freedom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the unfortunate truth of the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's the unfortunate truth of media. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - God, I hate capitalism. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Down with capitalism. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Should we get into some of
our favorite YouTube channels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or the channels we like watching? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like we all
watch very different Youtubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or I guess...
- Do we? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean we established like before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that like the amount of
YouTube the three of us watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is probably quite different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like what... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's my first question to you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you guys look
for in a content creator? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If anything, if anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I'm the type of
guy, people are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I get asked who
my favorite Youtubers are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in conventions
and panels and everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone expects me to
say anime Youtubers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, my favorite attitude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And because it's my job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I try to watch the least amount
of anime content as I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't want to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One, it's my job, I can't
view animate content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the same way ever again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And two, I don't want it
to affect my own content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also, so many of them suck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I totally agree, like you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> my YouTube viewing time is my off time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly.
- I just maximize YouTube man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Every single moment of my
life I'm watching YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you watch other Youtubers though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - A few. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like other Youtubers that
you don't know personally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I obviously watch your guys' content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like people I'm personally friends with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I very rarely watch other YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who I don't personally know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's some I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel like they're
not quite there yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they're still figuring
it out their style. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because they're new, or? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because they're new. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I find enjoyment in
watching the new channels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of figure out their own way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and seeing their growth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean some of my
favorite channels on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are the tiny ones where
they've only got update videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love those, I love those.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where they have more update
videos than actual content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would name one or two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm also worried that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't wanna bully them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm also worried that
they'll get 10,000 new viewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they won't know how to handle it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- But... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you know the ones
we're talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're out there, they're out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, obvious channels
that we all like and enjoy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like Internet Historian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone fucking loves Internet Historian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean like what else, what else? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on to the podcast
Internet Historian. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nakey Jakey is one of my favorites. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember Nakey,
cause I discovered him... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know when you discover a creator </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's under a hundred thousand subs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, "You're gonna blow up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was Nakey Jakey for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I discovered him before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he even did his fucking
green screen effects, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was just basically try a mix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between donkey and John Tron. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he was just like,
he didn't show his face, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just pure voiceover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But he was someone who I
discovered really early on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I could tell, I
could tell immediately- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Personality was shining through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - His personality was shining through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was gonna blow up eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he did like the first... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The first video where I
thought he was gonna blow up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was he did a video about video game dogs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is so different from
what other people were doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was just so unique. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "That's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's your niche, you've found it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just love his flow of comedy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There are some videos where it's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> One of my favorite videos to this day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is the one where he talks
about water levels in gaming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And it's such a short video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like six minutes long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's just constant, constant jokes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jokes, jokes, jokes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With no room for error, whatsoever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I just love videos
like that where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cut all the bullshit filler out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just say the punchline and
then immediately move on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the type of comedy I strive to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in my thing as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like everyone
thinks of him as just the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who has a green screen
and sits on the ball, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but as someone who's been
following him for ages, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he can do any kind of content-
- oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it'll still be fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do a lot of writing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I assume you think his writing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is also pretty spot on as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think his writing
is fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's brilliant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is really hard and
even I'm still trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to learn this too, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to try and balance analytical, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like your thoughts and
analytics to comedy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I've seen so many creators </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel like even
I might be one of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who sometimes it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this part is analytical
and this part is comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But to combine the two
together seamlessly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is a fucking difficult thing to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And to make it look natural
as well is really hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is
sponsored by Express VPN. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow, Express VPN baby!
(yells) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I understand you're
happy because it's December, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the Christmas spirit time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I have plenty of? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it the big D? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The big, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Which means we can officially start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching Christmas movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeh!
(hosts rejoice) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which you know that I love. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I love them, I love them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But what if you go to Netflix, Jerry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mhh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This horror situation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you discover that your
favorite Christmas movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't available.
(dramatic music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then I will cry and
scream until I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess I just can't get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess I have to give
up on the Christmas spirit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess I'll just get
depression for Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what would happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But get ready to have your mind blown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can use in bold Express VPN </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch any Netflix library in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (puking mimics) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you telling me that Express VPN </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are saving Christmas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They are saving Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this weekend I used Express VPN </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to stream a Christmas classic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Elf", on German Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I know that's your
favorite Christmas movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is everyone's
favorite Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Very fond of "Elf". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so simple. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just opened the app, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hit one button to change my location, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> refreshed Netflix, and
that's it, that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] See, express
VPN lets you control </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you want the sites
to think you're located. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You can choose from almost 100 countries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh my God Garnt! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Just imagine how
many Netflix libraries that is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a hundred Christmases. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a hundred libraries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's at least, that's over five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my gosh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And of course it's not just Netflix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Express VPN works with
any streaming service. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Disney Plus, Hulu, BBC
iPlayer, you name it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Name it, come on, name it, I'm waiting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's be honest, Joey can't name it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But let's also be honest again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are hundreds of VPNs out there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the reason I use Express
VPN to watch movies and shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is because it's ridiculously fast. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> and you can always stream in HD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Express VPN works on

<SPEAKER_03> So you can use to watch
it on whatever you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or on the go on the big screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Big brain move when you use
Express VPN on your fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garner laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The one day man, one day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They'll never know where that cheese is. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> - Woooh, Express Vpn.
(claps and cheers) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Link's in the description. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thank you to Express VPN
for sponsoring this video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back to the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think one thing I respect the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of Nakey Jakey's run in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like Nakey Jakey is
definitely not the only one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who does this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think it's the
type of content creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I especially like
and inspire to be myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the people who can writes scripts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're clearly scripts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they write it and perform it in a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't make it look like
they're reading off a script. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Nakey Jakey is obviously
a great example of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the whole reason
why JonTron as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> blew up is because of that.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's managed to like, as you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mix the whole analytical
side with the joke side, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just so seamlessly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And if we're talking (indistinct) as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a Demo was a perfect
example of that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean Demo kind of
just started as a new wave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of anime YouTube content,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And his style still prevails today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in a lot of people's content.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I certainly look
up to that guy's writing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think every pretty
much every big anituber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does in some way shape or form. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But weird, not even like 10% of the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to being as funny as that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, we're trying really hard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we can't quite get there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like how, cause you
can copy someone's style, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but you can never be that person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause that's kinda like the hard thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about being an independent content creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that you can be influenced by someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but if you're influenced
by them a bit too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then everyone's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Ah, you were trying to be X person." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're just a clone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unlike if you're trying to be X person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> then in the viewer's mind,
all they are going to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is you trying to be X person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it was that problem
right of back in the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever anyone tried
to do any G Let's play. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it doesn't matter if
you were no is similar to him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well this guy's just a
PewDiePie clone, isn't he? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He's just a marker clone.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and am just like, I got those comments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like where I first started
doing clothes party, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were like, "Oh, this guy looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sounds like PewDiePie." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Okay, I get the sounds part, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how the fuck do I look like Felix?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you sound like
Felix, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, Apparently I sound... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I can do Felix impressions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not like I was
trying to do them actively. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because surprise, Felix
wasn't the only Let's Player </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was around back
then and who I watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speaking of, oh go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, speaking about Nakey Jakey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> have you guys watched Scott The Woz? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you seen him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen a few of his videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen a few of his
videos, but I'm not subscribed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking love Scott, I love you Scott. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because he's the opposite of Nakey Jakey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Almost where Nakey Jakey tries on purpose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to not feel like a script, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where Scott feels so incredibly scripted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it makes it almost funnier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, he's just
so extremely consistent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he uploads sometimes like twice a week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's always such fucking good quality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right , right , right.
- But they're so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I feel like a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was at one point as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jon trying to not upload it for so long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they turned Jon Tron
sub-reddit into Scott The Woz. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause he didn't upload for so long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because everyone would
say that Scott The Woz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like Jon Tron but more consistent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt And Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's still very
different styles of humor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like so anal about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> keeping the same level of consistency </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he re-uploaded the whole video once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he accidentally
didn't sensor a swear word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in one of his outfits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - God damn, and that is commitment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just seems like a such a chill dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also Hella awkward
cause there's clips of him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in conventions that he
looks so awkward in like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like the kind of
energy that I'm like, "Man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's so honest." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He can just tell you that
he loves what he's doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the type of genuine Youtuber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you watched any of his videos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like, I've definitely seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at least a couple of his videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come up on recommended, but... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I definitely have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It might not be for everyone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think definitely you can
always watch it and enjoy it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you might not go away being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I fucking love this guy." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But you'll definitely enjoy
it, a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's definitely on my list of people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Every time he's on my
recommended, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I'll give you a go." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It also makes me wonder
how specific of a subject </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about gaming can you talk about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like he did memory cards the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing ) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He did a whole 30 minute
video on memory cards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right, right ,
right. And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know what he talked about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember, but I enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I just remember thinking this video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is totally pointless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's another
channel that's like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I think you showed me
this Connor, but, "Ahoy"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was literally about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when Connor mentioned
that I was like, "Ahoy". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, there's another channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that covers super niche
and specific titles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I for the longest time
thought it was some like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> film studio that hired
the sexiest narrator ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think it's
legit, the narrator guys- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I think it's just one dude, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So to explain to Ahoy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he does video game documentaries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on really, really niche like subjects. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think one of my favorite ones was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he went through the entire history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of exploding barrels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in like video games.
- That was such a good video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's one of those subjects </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you never thought about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until someone brought it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like why is it that when you
see a barrel in a video game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just expect it to explode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just something that
you've just been conditioned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to know, but then you think about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "What is the history behind that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's also like... I'm
looking at his channel now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's also the antithesis of click-bait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) like it goes,
do you know what his video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on explosive barrels is called? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just barrels, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Explosive Barrels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) With a period at the end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I also genuinely don't think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's only maybe one
or two people I can think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that have the same level of
production quality as him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh!
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The production quality of
this man's videos are insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've mentioned before,
but like, LEMMiNO. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's kinda like the insane
kind of production qualities </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're like, "This guy
uploads one every three months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I know why he uploads
one every three months." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's legit like box levels of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He just did a video on what was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what was the first video game ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a very good video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - My favorite one as well is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where does the history of chickens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like healing here come from.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And well, yeah, it's just great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really weird like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are just some Youtubers I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that can just take these
extremely niche topics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and just somehow able
to turn it into a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you'd never thought you needed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then the moment you watch it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like, "All right, I
kind of need this video." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - As I was going through my list, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I did realize what really appealed to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like more so the human aspect- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you know, Noclip by any chance? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They do video game documentaries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are really, really well produced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about game development. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's really reached insane
production, great stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But half the time I end
up just not really caring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like there's
no human aspect to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or a personality
attracting me in the video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just feels like a documentary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which is great and it's amazing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's not like Ahoy,
where it feels so passionate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from one person and so
many of the channels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that were mentioned today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, we've
talked about this before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how to be successful on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like having
that human connection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and having a personality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you are doing a
sort of documentary thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> inserting your own passion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and your own personality
into it as much as possible, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the real selling point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of why people will want
to come back to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like that's why,
(clear throat) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I remember when YouTube went through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this whole video essay boom- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And now I think it's last
starting to die down, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially on anitube as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember when Every Frame a Painting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> came along and started
doing video essays... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Rest in piece, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that was one of the best
fucking channels I swear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God!
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Nerdwriter and
everything came along, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we have this video essay boom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now people, they
don't care so much about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the analytical side of things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they care more about the
personality behind it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right.
- You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They care about the person
telling the narrative, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause why should I listen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to some random person's college thesis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where there are actual
experts on the platform now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which brings me to my next creator, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a video essay channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they did a video essay on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was it Shazam, Kazam, what
was that superhero movie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh Shazam.
- Shazam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shazam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah they were doing a
video essay on Shazam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He's called Ponysmasher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never heard of this channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he was doing a video essay on Shazam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by breaking down how hard it is to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The little problems that need to be solved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when making a movie, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, "Oh, it's
just another video essay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he starts using
first person perspective. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "So, what I had to
do was I had to do this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to do that on this movie." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Wait a minute, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the director of Shazam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making a video essay on his own movie." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Waw! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just like, "What the fuck!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was the director of Shazam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making a video essay on his own platform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember how he ends the video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is he says, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was a point where I was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super obsessed with YouTube video essays, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I started making movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and now he views video
essays completely different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause he admitted himself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as someone who has made movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he doesn't know whether, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can break down the movie's themes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all the back end of
something with the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But he was like, "Yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes it's just like
a complete accident." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just a happy
little accident, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, sometimes he's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, did I mean to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was there any meaning behind
making this curtain blue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sometimes it's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just the only curtain
that was fucking available. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just liked the color that's all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you know.
- That's so cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And hearing it from him,
after I saw that video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, yeah,
he's kind of got a point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> When you've got actual fucking directors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making video essays on your own movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how can other people kind of compete </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with that at that point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the point I want to get to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where eventually if I
ever make my own anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or my own Manga, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just make a video
essay on my own show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That'd be the ultimate flex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I know exactly why they
decided to use these things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I fucking made them, that's why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ambitious goal Joey, ambitious goals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The most primary sources
that you could ever get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also like, going the
complete opposite of that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is experts in the field. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My new worst fucking pet peeve on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is seeing videos of... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I had mentioned this
to you guys in private, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's this new thing on YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where things that shouldn't
be a qualification </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are a qualification, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like reacts to something, I've noticed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And these things will not
stop leaving my recommended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Japanese person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> reacts to every course abroad video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "I don't care." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That is not impressive that
a Japanese person watches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The recent one I saw that
would not leave my recommended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is Japanese person reacts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to Bill Wurtz's history of Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, I don't... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> This should not be a qualification. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get it, there's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What was the other ones? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like doctor reacts doctors, that's fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that's an actual
quantification, that's a job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were just born in a country bro, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Its not like you were
born in like Machu Picchu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about the ruins
or some shit, that's tiny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My favorite ones as well
is the music related ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, I remember
I saw one which was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Jazz drummer reacts
to Tool live concert." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "But Tool is a metal band." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, you don't know
anything about metal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Its like you playing... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh yeah, the other one is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Church drummer reacts to whatever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, you play
at your local church. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not like, you're
not even a professional, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you just play at your local church. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can somebody please
make a YouTube channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out there like, "High student
reacts to high school." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I just want us to go full meme now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's getting ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw, there was a mathematician one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and in the video it was like
"Mathematician reacts to", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I click on the vide and it said guy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a college student showing Math, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually wanted to make a parody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of that video series, which is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "professional degenerate
reacts to Hentai." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should totally do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I gotta make it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gotta make that
before it gets taken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some people saw the lawyer
things obviously with like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, I'm a specialized Japanese person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can react to..." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not bashing on any chance to do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think it's really
weird and not weird, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like unnecessary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's this trend that
makes sense, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You have a professional qualified person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who has been doing this job for years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a lawyer or a doctor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and can actually provide insights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then as with everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as with every YouTube trend, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people like try to bend
it as much as possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, "Yeah, I'm kind of like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have a qualification in X kind of." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know when you're in that job interview </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you try to buff up your fucking CV </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with as much bullshit as
you can possibly imagine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's kind of what it
feels like, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So have you had any past jobs? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, I used to have to take out the trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> every week at my parents'
place. (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That was kind of an obligation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I remember back in the bridge scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where people were just like,
"Yeah, I do sound design." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Motherfucker,
I know what the you do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Talking into a bull
yeti Is not sound design. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude, if you're any
smaller Youtubers watching, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's an idea for you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> react to anything, but just call yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Aspiring entrepreneur reacts to". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'll get clicks like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's free real estate, it's for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, but to be fair though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we mentioned this earlier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but the "Doctor Reacts to Cells At Work"- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That one was good.
- That shit was fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, like when this trend started, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was all for this.
- [Joey And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't often watch reaction videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I watched all of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because the dude was
A, charismatic as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot the name, it was Doctor... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen it, I've seen it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think my favorite one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that guy who breaks down accents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and reacts to accents.
- He so good, the WIRED guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the guy on WIRED, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Derek Singer, I think his name is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah.
- I love those videos so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I basically ripped out your mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you tell me.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I was like,
"Oh man, this is fun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can explain this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not gonna lie, when I
saw that on my sub feed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Fuck, that's a good idea." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wish I did that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean I thought, "Why not, man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been doing this for years." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was actually gonna
do something similar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was gonna name myself,
"Japanese expert." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was gonna react to foreigners in films </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> doing Japanese accents
or speaking in Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, can you still do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I might still do that,
but I don't know... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you a qualified Japanese person? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You weren't born and raised here Joey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I don't know...
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a certificate though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many years experience
do you have being Japanese? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Only 26 years you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The amount of videos I've seen that has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Japanese person reacts to Filthy Frank" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is like way too many. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There there's so many, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like this should not be necessary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's just a Japanese- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also it's like, who cares? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And also you probably
won't get a really authentic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> cause most of the time the
Japanese people that are doing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are doing it in English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- So they're like, you know... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the foreigners that I've spoken to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the Japanese people that I've spoken to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that studied abroad, are very different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the Japanese people who are Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love that half the videos as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like "Japanese
reacts to Filthy Frank." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just an American
born Japanese guy, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "You're an American dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're not even Japanese." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's an interesting point actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would actually like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's interesting content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Say you take a video and actually sub it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then show it to a
Japanese person subbed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and see how he reacts to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That would be interesting I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that would be interesting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but the problem is no one
can be fucked to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just too much effort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What other Youtubers do
you guys enjoy watching? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well I have a Youtuber
who is up and coming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I found him fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like maybe when he had less than 10K subs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he's this guy called Johnstone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he's a Pokemon Youtuber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But unlike every other
Pokemon Youtuber out there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he kind of takes Pokemon challenges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and kind of goes way overboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this the guy who, this
guy beat the whole game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a ditto or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that's Pikasprey.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's another guy who I also follow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So Johnstone is this guy who does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these absurd Pokemon challenges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just condenses them into one video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like SmallAnt is a guy
who also does similar things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's a massive Twitch streamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But Johnstone kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he does these ridiculous challenges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, can I beat the
entirety of Pokemon fire red </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with just one Raj and shit like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he not only puts his
own personality into it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but kind of breaks down
how to do it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if people want to do it, then they can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think it's only recently that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, we were talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who make content
which is very informational, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then try and put their
own personality to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like he's a guy who's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just starting to learn how to do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just kind of growing off of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's been really
cool to watch him grow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a few channels like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I watch, is it Gamechamp3000? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I have it written down here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He does the beading like X game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without collecting a coin or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like, I don't know
why he would do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it sounds like pain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - SmallAnt does that too, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I recently watched him do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Can I beat Pokemon
fire red with only Shinies?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what he would do is like he would... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he would do this all live on Twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just make a video on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So every time the starters would come up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and if none of them are shiny,
he'd just reset the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he'd keep going until
the startle was shiny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like speed runners kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the word I'm looking for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dedication. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or another one was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can I beat all of Pokemon
Emerald without taking damage?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And every time he took
damage he had to reset. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I saw that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I've seen that one.
That one sounds familiar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It went quite viral I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I've seen a few videos like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like no damage
dark souls (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey And Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there is always
a fucking trip to watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I love watching
those kinds of content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I think I've just
gotten so into speed running </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like just people who
are just way too good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at games for their own good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's a fair amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of speed running dedicated channels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just thinking of it, none
of them are quite nearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the level of obviously, Summoning Salt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which everyone loves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Summoning Salts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's Summoning Salt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then kind of everyone else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not to be rude to everyone else, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's just definitely doing something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's clearly appealing to everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like what he does so well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is that he just knows kind of
like how to present a story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's like, okay... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's one of the few
channels where I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really know
his personality, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the stories that he picks
to present on his channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like a banger every time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause if you don't have a
personality in your channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then that puts pressure
to make the subject </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are presenting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has to carry your video, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's normally easier to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a nice, interesting personality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that people want to come back to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're someone like Summoning Salt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who for some reason knows how to present </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most compelling speed running stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every fucking time, I'm just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like watching a movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - His recent one with the
perfect Mario 64 record </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is so good, it's really good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also really love his... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Which one was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The Ninja Gaiden one, the cowboy dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love that guy.
(Garnt giggles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He's so nice and it made
for such a good story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so cool as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I found so many cool speed runners </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because of his videos, as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because the way he kind of sells them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also just kind of lays
out their entire journey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what it is because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> truth be told, he's not
the most charismatic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or interesting presenter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he just manages to write and present </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and kind of tell a story in a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that you just have to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's like,
there's always the hook. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It almost follows the
structure of a movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean?
- [Joey] All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's the hook, there's the beginning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the middle of the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the end is always
like a really big climax </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're like, "Wow,
this was worth sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through like 45 minutes
to an hour watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so I could have seen this climax </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and get invested into this story." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm glad I sat through
45 minutes to know that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that cowboy dude got
a sub 10 in Ninja guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm so glad these efforts
are gonna pay off, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was so worth it, clap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everybody applause. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You try to explain
this content to someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who just knows nothing
about speed running, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like why'd
you care so much about- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because he's tried his best man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's one of those things
where it's like, just watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I think again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is why I love
documentaries and all that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I just love the human
aspect of stories and the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, almost human
life is more interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because weird shit happens
that you couldn't even predict. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's so interesting
and obviously like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also think that Summoning
Salt is really similar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to Frederick Knudsen,
which is like my favorite- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Down the Rabbit Hole?
- Yeah down the Rabbit Hole, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like literally my
favorite channel on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I still haven't seen his new one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I haven't seen his new one either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think the sheer
amount of dedication </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the story and getting
all the facts there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is just insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think every time I get drunk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watch their "Wings Of Redemption". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the problem with Knudsen though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that every time he does upload a video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a yay moment as
well as an oh shit moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's a yay moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he uploads like three months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's an oh shit
moment because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, okay, what day in my calendar is free </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch this video?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know there are some content creators </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that you just watch immediately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's some content creators
where you make mental note </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "They haven't loaded it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, "Okay,
I gotta find time." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like "The Right Opinion"
is the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Every time he uploads, it's like, "oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's another two hour
video about Right Opinion." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's gonna be a banger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but man, I'm not free for like three days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have so much respect
for "Right Opinion" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because normally I can't
stand commentary channels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time-
- yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's just the
biggest free for all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I don't know why
some people are so fucking loud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't know why some people
listen to the other people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's almost always biased. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it's so biased,
it's always a fucking mess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But dude, if "Right Opinion"
makes a video about you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm fucking listening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I was in one of his videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughing) Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Featuring Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I was in one of his videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thanks for that, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I get destroyed by "Right Opinion", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yeah, "Okay
I did something wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> my bad, my bad."
- But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like when people were telling me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was in like a
"Right Opinion" video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head I was like, "Yay" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and shit at the same time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, you got a cameo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got a cameo but it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Is that gonna be good, is my career over? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily I was fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause he has such a good skill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in breaking down the key
components about what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, someone's personal mistakes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He just tells it how it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, without... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He is obviously biased,
but every time he has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> any kind of bias in it,
he says it up front. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And in the end, he lets the
viewer make their own opinion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rather than telling the viewer how... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, what opinion they should have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he presents the facts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he presents his biase
and then he doesn't say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, you should fucking
hate this person." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just says, you can make... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's kinda like you make your own opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, obviously I watched
the fucking four hour video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in one go because I was dying that day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nikocado Avocado.
- Disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got like halfway
through then I was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It felt like it was
just repeating at times, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's because he
does repeat his real life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> multiple times, his mistakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the only video that
I was kind of like meh on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think he made a video on
the animation community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember feeling like, "All right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is kind of like,
all right, kind of meh." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was that the done as a plan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, that one
was good I liked that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was talking about
the animation community </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think how they all rely
on each other for success. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was kind of like
warning that they shouldn't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I really didn't
feel like it was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Okay, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it doesn't really say anything." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I mean, overall, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's just amazing at
presenting an opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Also, Frederick Knudsen by the way is... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because we didn't explain what it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he does documentary on anything basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Choose a documentary on anything- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Any one personal event or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was so well done that
it's just like, "Oh my God!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, he has a video on
"Wings Of Redemption", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who I had no idea who that was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I watched the full two
hour like 30 minute thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's amazing, it's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's nuts how people can just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> make a compelling
narrative about anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when something where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I never knew about this
and never cared about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I guess now that
I'm here, I'm invested." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because I feel like
I watched that content, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not only because it's entertaining, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also as this is my job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh I can appreciate the work so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I appreciate because they
also break down as a Youtuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like how the best way to
present yourself online is in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the mistakes of what not to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Write that down, write that down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's exactly the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they break it down
so well that you can... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If this is your job and
social media is your job, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you can literally take
advice about what not to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the mistakes that
other people have made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a self-help guide. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, it really is, it really is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, don't do that, noted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, wait, before we move on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay here's a question for you guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you guys ever rehearsed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a kind of like an apology video? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no.
(Joey laghing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've never done? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though you've done nothing wrong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though you've done
nothing wrong, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on, you must have thought about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah in my head
I've thought about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I haven't sat there in
front the mirror being like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, no, no, not actually rehearsing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like in my head.
- I've thought about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wake up every morning and I practice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the sigh before it begins, you know the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey inhales and exhales deeply) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is a really hot video to make. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In your head, you've thought about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you've gone okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, there's a few ways to go about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There's the double down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the do nothing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the apologize
and admit wrongdoing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And from what I've seen on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it seems to be unfortunately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that people always want an apology, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the people who apologized
and admit wrongdoing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally get the worst treatment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I notice the people who doubled down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally get away with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So other Youtubers double the fuck down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just go with it.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time, double down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I don't have anything in my past </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I expect I'm gonna need
to make an apology video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but nobody fucking expects me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to need to make an apology video, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So as you see, as a Youtuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I see these trends happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I see like cancel culture happening, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "But what if I did need
to make an apology?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean.
(Joey and Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like V-Soul's music stopped playing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dint need to apologize,
but what if I did? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you watch any other
documentary channels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> similar to theirs, 'cause I have a few. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Actually, you know, on
the note of YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that EmpLemon makes
good ones about YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if I-
- I know his name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably seen a few of this stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like his presenting style, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really gel with, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think the way that
he talks about YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's really well done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's clearly someone who is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I can see parallels between me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the way that he
talks about the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and the way that like I was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like age 10, I was
glued to the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He talks about how... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Realistically let's say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think he made a video
about YouTube likes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, on paper, if you see
90% likes to dislike ratio, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> any mathematician would be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That's great, that's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's 9:1." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But a Youtuber sees that
and thinks, "oh fuck." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why isn't it 95?
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So he basically did a whole video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> explaining how the actual
YouTube like ratio system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like 99% is good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 98% is you've probably off a little bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of your audience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 95% is you've probably said
something a little bit bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And anything below 90
is like, you fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- Which is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is definitely true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he made a video as well
that was really well done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a fuck about NASCAR. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He did a bit of a thing about NASCAR </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He also made a video about
Hungrybox, the smash player. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that was a really
pretty good documentary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do like I do like watching... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not subscribed to any of them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I do like watching Smash compilations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every now and then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean the smash documentary
that came out years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was amazing on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was that the four-hour
smash documentary? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the documentary
that got me into- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Got me into smash.
- Not just got me into Smash, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but got me into YouTube
documentaries as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno who made that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was like this very famous
four-hour Smash documentary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is like way out of date now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it detailed, the very, very start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of the Smash community.
- Again, a human story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They build up the characters
of the story, and it did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Other channels if you guys
like Frederick Knutson, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I know you probably don't
know these channels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's "Anxiety War", I don't
know if you've heard of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not Anxiety War, sorry, sorry, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't subscribe to a
lot of the documentaries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause again, they just take so much time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - True, there's no Anxiety War, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll talk about him though
later, He's fucking strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Atrocity Guide? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> She does videos similar
to Frederick Knudsen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know that name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Her voice is so fucking
chilling and creepy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that even the ones that
aren't scary, feels scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, (panting)
what's gonna happen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What's gonna happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Very good, and then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not subscribed to him, but J Aubrey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - J Aubrey, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every time his video
comes up to my recommended, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, yeah this seems like a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who's the guy who did that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or who is doing the massive crochet- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, I was gonna get on with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's GenoSamuel2.1, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he lives in Japan by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you want to explain that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because Connor showed
us this the other day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We'll talk about... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll be back to Joey
in some other channels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's a channel called GinoSamuel2.1. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And like his whole channel is dedicated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the history of Chris Chan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know who Chris Chan is, he's very- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Infamous?
- Infamous online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the whole point of, if
you know what Kiwi Farms is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a shit talking website. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That whole website was made
to document Chris Chan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's so much information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this one person online. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's probably the most
documented person in history. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the like, it's kind of like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean we watched what, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We watched two episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We watched two out of how many episodes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there are nearly 50 of them now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How long were the episodes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like 40 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - At least 40 minutes each. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we watched an hour
and a half of this- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Prologue.
- This prologue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not even the fucking prologue, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the amount of information
they got about this guy's life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was just fucking mind blowing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - From like age five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - From age five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This episode is sponsored by a Apari. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - shit, is that what
I'm wearing right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at these clean fucking
clothes we're wearing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at this design man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at this drip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this artist owned anime
inspired quality clothing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] I think it is.
- You bet your ass it is boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna lie fam,
this is pretty fucking... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I know I mean with a little
bit, but this is nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look how blinging you

<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking love the bucket hat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's thanks to the
quality fabric by the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and the original art. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you know that, though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is anime inspired as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which is nice for the (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Also, I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I fuck with the color schemes.
- I fuck with the colors too, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really nice.
- I like the fun color code. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I saw this design </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and if they weren't sponsoring me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have bought it anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like so me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> - They'll keep you warm, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll definitely keep you warm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We are inside and I wanna take this off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm too hot right now.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So thank you, I actually love this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Garnt has some of the shirt
designs as he's mentioned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He also has another one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you Apari.
- God damn! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you Apari for
sending me more clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have more clothes to
wear on Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cause I am running out of my wardrobe now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this is the shit
I would wear normally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That design is fucking sexy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, that's some fucking sexy- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also got some facemasks
but they're at home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they're dirty and
I've been using them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So put up an image, there they are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They are really fucking cute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had the most stylish facemask. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I do, I don't wanna clown all these. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I did have the most stylish ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this crisp bucket hat fellas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do like the bucket hat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, no joke, when I go in the sun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not right now obviously, but
when I get in the summer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if I went out without a hat
I would just get a headache. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But now you got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mayline said I was disgusting one time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I sweat in her bucket hat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that she borrowed me.
(hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apari releases new

<SPEAKER_02> these are clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah if you want some slick weeb drip, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then Apari is the place to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So thank you Apari for
sponsoring this episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and back to the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So his whole channel is dedicated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to discussing Chris Chan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're probably thinking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there can't be that much on this dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They've made biopics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about some of the most interesting people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're only two hours long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where on that pod, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's something near 50, or 50. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the reason why his
channel's called 2.1 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is cause I've been watching
this since like episode five- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - His channel got taken down at one point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think episode 15 or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he decided to quit talking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he got out.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He came back, he came- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He just when I thought I was out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they pull me back in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he's back doing it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how far we are
into it but all the comments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And actually Chris Chan
replies to every single video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tries to correct details. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Didn't even question about the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> he's making these videos, huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chris Chan seems to like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, I think it's she now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry for the the naming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, it's really interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I hope that you keep
finishing the thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get to the end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even wanna know how
much a mental toll that is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How far are we through
Chris Chan's life right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think maybe halfway, I'm not sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And how many hours of content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think has been made? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - About 30 plus at the moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, let's do the math. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If each episode is at least 30 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's like 50, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was like 15 episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to just Chris Chan being trolled. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, when you showed
us that at your place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we watched the first two episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we hadn't even made it past age 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - With the majority of the videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have been about trolling Chris Chan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a good chance
they might reply it here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I mean, it's super interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if you wanna... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so bad as well because Chris Chan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is autistic and constantly says it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and constantly says
high functioning autism. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And in the documentary, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you kinda like in the start, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you really want to root for him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's clearly
just been unfortunate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's had a rough life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And his parent as well,
they're super questionable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the moment you're
about to root for him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just like, "I don't like gays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that blacks are less than people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like God fucking damnit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He had us in the first half. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah he literally has
us in the first half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it's like, God damnit, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor grunts) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're so close. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's like the Tiger
King documentary, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They want you to root for Joe Exotic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but they leave out all the
racist that Joe was saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think I would
have rooted for him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just good storytelling, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I find fucking
terrifying about the first two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes of this
documentary that I watched- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sheer amount of information. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was just the sheer of a
sheer amount of information, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the of a sheer amount
of intimate information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I probably wouldn't
even know about my own life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at that age, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let alone someone else's life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Chris Chan, the
one of the first things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that opened wide, like
the whole trolling thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that when it was all started, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm sure the comments will correct me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm wrong on these details, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause people are all
like Historians about him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they call them Christorians? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Christorians.
(hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is what they call themselves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So...
- I love that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Internet Christorians.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When they first started the
dramatica thread about him- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first thing that Chris did was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Correct it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Correct it by overloading
it with personal information, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking that they would get bored. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But he just gave them everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was at that point- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Zero privacy.
- I knew I was hooked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I was fascinated by it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I couldn't believe that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he was the one who invented Sonichu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he's the one who made Sonichu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause Sonichu was just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you don't know what Sonechu is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's probably a picture
of it on the screen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this monstrocity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The massive meme right on the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And for the longest time I
saw that shit everywhere- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was just like,
where did this come from? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now I know it's from the
brilliant mind of Chris Chan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So thank you for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Other good channels
that do documentaries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a guy called Toad McKinley </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he did a two part
documentary on Chris Hanson </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that whole debacle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was really good, actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And how long are these documentaries? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I know you watched
more documentaries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than both of us combined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of documentaries you can leave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on in the background I feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like watching the Chris Chan ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're so long and often it's basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> playing a whole audio clip for 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You get the gist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a podcast about Chris Chan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a podcast about Chris Chan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with someone else narrating his life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And obviously, I
watch J. Aubrey as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think J. Aubrey is good
friends with Right Opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I can tell, they're
styles are similar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but different enough that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their content stands out for themselves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I kind of respect that
content in the same way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they really know how to break down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how public perception can warp an opinion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of a certain person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think sometimes coming to channels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like being told
what my opinion should be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I feel like
sometimes, some narrations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I think some video in J. Aubrey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the way he narrates would be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, you should think this way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure he doesn't intend to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just the way I perceived it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I mean, it's still amazing videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's either one way or the other way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where if commentary channels either, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I know you're a fucking clown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I know no one's gonna
fucking listen to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, someone like Kim Star. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's either one way or the other way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's so many
commentary channels I see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that hit that middle ground, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and think that they are the
fucking Holy grail of opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where it's just like, dude, it's just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you have
some commentary channels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just kind of are commentary channels, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like technically speaking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just the way that they present shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the topic they choose, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of go away from commentary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like perfect example, who
I fucking love watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is Leon Lush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love Leon Lush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> More humor focused, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But technically he's a
commentary channel, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like technically speaking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but the way he presents it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the topics he covers
is just like, just so.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like Cody Ko, with like the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the series that he does, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where he cringes at shit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's just called "Cringe". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't really watch Cody Ko, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or, what's the other guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Kurtis Conner is the other one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like those three, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, 'cause I don't really watch them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watch a lot of... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've really like Danny Gonzales, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think he's really funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mmh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think also the stuff
he does where he bought... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's this video he made, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where he spent like
$15,000 on YouTube ads, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was such a fucking video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I've seen that video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's such a good video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, I didn't know
who you're talking about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I remember that, I
remember watching that video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He has such a good personality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Drew Gooden as well, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you heard of the
channel called "Anxiety War"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- I mentioned it briefly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He basically does how to catch a predator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's his thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But he's a psychopath.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how you can... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He spends all day talking to pedophiles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how you can do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how do you do that?
That's weird, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah that is weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But he goes and meets up
with them and film some. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And some of these dudes... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's one dude he met up with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like eight foot or some shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This guy's built like a brick shit house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he turned up pretending to be a girl. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so he goes up... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He literally just does
how to catch a predator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But instead of going there with
armed police and everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he goes alone with a camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, you're insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how he die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does he have a crew or anything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it's just him. He
took it with a handheld camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many subscribers does he have? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God, Like over half a million. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's like
Chris Hanson hard mode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One health. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think one time the
predator, one of the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, one of the
predators tried to sue him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> One of them did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know if it worked out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the guy's got a strange personality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as well when you're watching him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watch him just for fascination, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to see how this guy does it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But man, it's such a
weird presenting style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's constantly giggling to himself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while he's recording it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really weird, but
it's an interesting watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's something unnerving
about watching it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the content
that he's talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the way that he's
talking about, like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's talking about how
we told someone on Xbox, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's actually some dude
who trying to fuck a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, okay, waw! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm kinda seeing a
pattern when all the content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're recommending and it is very much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just like the human aspect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a human kind of story behind it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a lot of channels that I like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I just think the
guy is a fucking weirdo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't really like the personality, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think they're just
so fascinating to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I reckon you'd love this channel then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that AKI recently recommended to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> called "Soft White Underbelly". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds familiar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's this guy who basically... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like this photographer guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he basically goes around streets of LA </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and he picks up homeless
people for whatever reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they bring him in to interview them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and kind of like talk about their life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and why they're homeless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how they got there and shit like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there's ones where he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he picks up a dude from the street </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and asks what he's about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he ended up being homeless because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he raped his mom or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or did something like this insane crime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And these people just
fucking break down on camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just talking about their life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's really raw, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's so fucking interesting to watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because you
otherwise would never hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about these people's lives, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's like no bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no snarky commentator
or presenter being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so tell us your story
about why you're homeless. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally just listening to a dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> try and communicate with
this clearly broken person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for whatever reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Some of these backstories,
I'm just like, holy shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> How were you alive? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so 50-50 for me with those, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when they're
getting homeless people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm like, it's
such a fine line between, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my eyes being genuine
or just taking advantage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or this is kind of like reality TV, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's kinda like the, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the backstory Olympics. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's an x-factor audition. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where it's just like okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who has the worst, most tragic backstory? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Who do we want to cheer for, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm already out, so I'm always like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, some of them I
could definitely see... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> God, there was a channel where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy interviews meth heads and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember the name of
it off the top of my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's a really good channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But he did like a really
raw, emotional issues... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like with the
way that you present it... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen a bunch of his videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they all seem pretty fucking genuine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, if you say so then I trust you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a gut feeling, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen the fake ones before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this one definitely doesn't
seem like the fake ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just a lot of them
where it's like sad music, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> royalty three and they've
picked up some crackhead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you know, if there's
fucking sad music in the back it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably fucking scripted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you must feel sad
now because of the sad music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's also the sad music, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know they've gone
from the YouTube library, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you've heard it
a million times before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like other channels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I see you're also using Kevin Mcloud. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (cast laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was in a shopping mall the other day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was walking past this makeup section </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were using that fucking ukulele. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (cast imitating ukulele sound) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking ukulele YouTube stock music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's my favorite piece of music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just because I can envision
every video that uses it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like way too fucking white. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The white balance is totally off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's way too bright, way too sunny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the background is way too clean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it always starts with, "Hey guys." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey guys.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Today here's my outfit of the day." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I look back to that period </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just think, well, why ukulele? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Why did every blogger at
one point have a ukulele? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't be sad listening to a ukulele. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't play it like,
"Oh shit I'm about to cry." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The fucking ukulele like
(imitates ukulele music). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's also the kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> my family is dying around
me and I'm crying ukulele. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you guys like "Report Of The Week"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love "Report Of The Week".
- I love "Report Of The Week". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He is in a league of his
own in terms of content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I also think of him as
like a category of creator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I can often compare courageous to him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the sense of that's the
kind of charm that they have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what other creators
do you think they are like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Buffcorell? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was about to say Buffcorell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to shout out my boy, Buffcorell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, how do you describe
Buffcorell as a channel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is just, you can never
leave one of his videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not being happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just a guy literally Buffcorrell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's his name, he's buff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He dances and sings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> His singing is horrible, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but in such an endearing and funny way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you'd love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the boy can dance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The boy can fucking dance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's buff as fuck as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I love this man so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first time you
watch any of his videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone goes on the same trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where like starts dancing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "Okay,
this boy can dance." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please pause this video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and go and watch one video then come back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then he opens his mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like the
fucking worst singing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you've ever heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But then he does it with
such self-confidence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're like, "Damn man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can only respect that."
- You know what he is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he's the epitome of this
is what I do in my room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when I'm alone.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But I decided to get a camera
and start recording myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's so happy dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You're just like, "Man,
I love it,I love it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so infectious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My dream is to one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have a fucking karaoke
sesh with Buffcorell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With Buffcorell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Please Buffcorell, come to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll have you on Trash Taste
and go to a karaoke sesh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That is my fucking dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That is on fucking my list
of things to do before I die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I love as well
the little Easter eggs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he throws around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the fact that he has a
picture of himself on his wall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love that, I love that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fact that the camera quality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is like the same fucking low
HD fucking five pixel camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is like, the one thing I love is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's not even pointing
the camera at himself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He's pointing it at a mirror,
(hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has a reflection of him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Epic dude, epic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's cinematography.
- That's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's channels like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like him and like reported the week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, I don't
care if this is a joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or if they're being a
hundred percent serious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd still entertain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't, I like, I would be impressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if they were putting that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there's no way that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that kind of genuine
happiness cannot like radiate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's the age old question, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like with report of the week, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, is that actually how he is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or easy just doing this
job until it catches on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, that's like kind
of like half the fun of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the memes, I love
the memes of (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's kind of just come
like this content creator </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who I feel like they
just being themselves, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but part of that
personality is so infectious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you cannot watch a video
and not come out happier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I mean, I could be
having the shittest day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put on a Buffcorell video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, okay, my day... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How can I be sad when he's not sad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You see what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) How could
I be having shitty day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - When totally got these sick move, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, Buffcorell Twitter is the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like blessed coast thing I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like, I think
like three times a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he posts a selfie of himself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With like no captions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With like different angles.
(hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the most like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a dude who just
loves himself so much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you can't hate him for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love that, I love that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "You have
so much self-confidence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and man, I respect." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't like quantify into words, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, what is the line between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like vanity and self-confidence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Buffcorell, he fucking
obliterates that line, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he's so vain yet you
just feel happy for him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no negative feelings-
- right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just, ah, I fucking love him man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's this channel like
that's I don't know why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it gives me reported the week vibes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It might be an insult, I dunno, but... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's called Project Farm, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All he does is just review
like engine oil and tool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, and he'll like review
like different tapes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There is truly a channel for everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And he's just so... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there was a video and
he reviews like flex tape, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gorilla tape and could pass them all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, "I don't give a
fuck about any of this", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's so passionate
about reviewing these things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's so genuine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's that fucking channel
that reviews all of the locks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, LockPickingLawyer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - LockPickingLawyer, I love as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like.... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like he's like low key, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the funniest
crazies in the platform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He is, I love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Indestructible lock in
the title, 22nd video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Oh, okay, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's just got to pick this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So LockPicingLawyer is a
lawyer and his whole channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like a lockpicking expert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he just, it's so funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's built up so many in jokes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he's insane at picking locks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like all his delivery is so dry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's got like the driest
delivery you can ever imagine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's why every time he makes a joke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just hits every time.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a video that
he made for April fools, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was breaking into
my girlfriend backdoor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like, ex-girlfriend right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My girlfriend's back door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it was so funny, it was so funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "She didn't
let me in the front door, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so I guess I have to go in
through the back door now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey lauhing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then there was like rust on the key </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that he actually put things like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got to get rid of the brown residues. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like hahahaha!
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's just gotta make sure the hole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like well lubricated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so he can fit in the key and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I love that shit dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like normally anyone else, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this would be like third grade humor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's like the way he delivers it- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the dry shoot for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking kills me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Such a good channel,
such a good channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, Who else is like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think one of my favorite
video of his was like when... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember the exact video name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was like some guy
who had sent him a lock </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's he tried to get picked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by like a professional
lock picker or something- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he said was it was impossible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and he said he was impossible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I saw this one guy on YouTube do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he just destroys this lock in seconds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, if you can do
it in less than two minutes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the challenge was, and
he did it in like 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like he just, he sees a lock </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's already picked
when he picked it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I don't know how this man does it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just hockey, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just like hockey, like on locks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's the best part is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no to these videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no arrogance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He just he's someone that
he doesn't need to flex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- he Just really funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's just really good.
- Like there's minimal intro, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that all three minutes long, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you get exactly what you want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You normally end up like
laughing or giggling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's just such a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love this like non bullshit channels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I like Daily Dose
Of Internet as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because it's just no bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's just like Read it top page. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With no filler, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - From what I've seen on Twitter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's such a nice dude as well.
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, okay, this is like super... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess it's kind of old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but do you know "Imaqtpie". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know "Imqtpie". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was an actually a league pro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He one of a streamer now, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He streamer now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I wanna talk
about him cause like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think he's so funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like, he looks
like a homeless man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like the joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And for like, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but for like six months in my life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I could not get to sleep unless his videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are playing in the background. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's got such a chill voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He does have like that chill Jesus vibe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds like he's permanently stoned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's exactly what I thought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He's just so chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah.
- And yeah, no, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he hasn't been uploading
that much recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I think he been
going through some stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I love your channel, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Keep it up, I love you, man.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Man, what are the
channels do you guys like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if we're talking
about league streamers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or league content creators-
- Gbay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's one content creator I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, now I head out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's one content I want to shout out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is Gbay99, which I follow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been following his
channel for a long while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he used to make like very, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's say like,you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Youtubury videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Youtubury leaked videos,
which is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wrote a diamond where
he basically tries to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get his account to like high diamond </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or high master or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But recently it's been... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know when you see a
content creator evolve </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you feel like that
fat black proud father, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been me with Gbay.
(Connor and Joey) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because recently he's been starting to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> these really in-depth
league documentary where- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And even if you don't like league, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still enjoy it cause
it's such a good story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Because he basically breaks down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the most interesting stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of like the
league E-sports scene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he has two passions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's really passionate about sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's really passionate
about league, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what he does, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is he basically makes
these league documentaries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are basically just
sports documentaries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he goes through this
entire history or this narrative </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and breaks down like it's
a a big sporting event. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you like Summoning
Salt you'll like him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think he's also sending
videos that he's been inspired. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The reason why I started
doing that content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was cause he Summoning Salt doing it- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> speed running is really specific. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he thought, okay, well
I can make it about league. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's been great because
I've seen his transition, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he like, he used to make videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's one of those people that
made video dailies, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he got to this
point where he was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completely burnt out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I then he became the
update video channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a period in his career </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like every two
videos was an update video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, "I'm working
on something big and I'm just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a new direction in my channel." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he made like his
first big documentary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he went from uploading every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to uploading once every three months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like, what every one
of his videos is a banger now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because every one of his... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every story he chooses to present </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like super interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And as someone who didn't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, before I came out
as an anime fan or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like pretend
to be like a sports fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so seeing him presents
league in the same way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's in the same depending way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I see a lot of like
sports documentaries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sports fans talk
about their own sports, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like so refreshing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause nobody did it for him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought it was just like so obvious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that someone could do this basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's also a Exil who does like super, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's more like league
stories about Champions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Still pretty good there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I really enjoy Exil. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's like hot
to recommend to people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who don't know league.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are some gaming
creators that you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apart from the Pokemon ones? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, do you watch Angry Video Game nerd? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every now and then I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like, cause I kind of
grew up watching AVGN </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I liked going back cause
like all of his old stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is on YouTube still.
- I know, I know, I love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love going back and watching
like the Spiderman episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's still my favorite one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's just nice in YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where the platform which
is constantly changing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's changing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just nice having an anchor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Angry Video Game Nerd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- It's just a constant, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, whether
I enjoy the content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it depends on the video, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But It's just nice having
a creator who's consistent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> no drama, just constantly
makes bangers like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I think recently he
made an earthbound video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which was fucking such a good video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, every so often I go back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and see like the parallels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> between what happened
to Angry Video Game Nerd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what happened to
Nostalgia critic, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's kinda crazy, yeah.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's...
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so gearing to see the evolution or- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were like the top two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were the top two
fucking media critic reviewers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just seeing like Angry Video
Game Nerd being the anchor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and whatever the fuck
happened to Nolstagia- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you see his game show? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I did it.
- Yeah, he did game show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He funded it like via crowd funding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He channel called them Ralphthemoviemaker, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't if you know who that is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He does really good movie reviews, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really funny guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Really like Gordon Ramsey asked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just really brutal.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Pretty funny. Don't
agree with this takes always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah, pretty good, good channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But he did a video about the
Nostalgic Critics Game Show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it is bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it looks like a school project </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they spent like $50,000 on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And It's garbage, like it is bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Remember that period in
like YouTube reviewers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they had to have like a
story behind random reviews. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you remember that period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was like channel awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually two hour views, remember that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Unlike the first 30 minutes
it was like a garbage skit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whereas Amy Jean was
like, I can do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but condense it into like 15 minutes, max. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's because
it's also mega cheesy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas like, I think Nostalgia Critic is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like the same thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The same quality, but almost, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, that's kind of,
haven't insulted him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they're kind of the same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they're like,
cheesy, obviously like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Very tongue in cheek. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Very tongue and cheek- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The playing in character as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But obviously the two
wanted to be seen different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nostalgia Critic wanna be
seen as like mega professional, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as Angry Video Game Nerd. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This happy being like, it's
tongue in cheek, it's camp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's so endearing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas seeing the Nostalgia
Critic try to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, what's the movie he made? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like called The
Holy Grail or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like two hours
long and it was terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I swear like, Nostalgia Critic has done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many side projects that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have just ended up being absolutely shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he made...
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He made a fucking parody
album of Pink Floats The Wall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor and Grant shouting) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, I remember that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I didn't, as someone who's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The Wall is like one of my
favorite fucking albums. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's an album that's adored by everybody, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the movie as well it's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I listened to that album, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got like two songs in and
I'm just like, "I can't." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I watched fucking Needle Drops- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As he absolutely destroying it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "Yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is why I love you, Anthony." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was so fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it was just seeing a creator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just trying to do something
that was so unnecessary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's, like you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was someone who obviously
wanted to be respected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be seen as like someone
who did something great, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was just so like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> How can I do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how can I word this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you-
- Self-indulgent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was very
self-indulgent, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it was extra like cringy as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just like seeing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like he was clearly
trying to be like funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and edgy about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Being like, "I'm gonna
trash all over this album </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that everybody loves." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Not everyone
likes this album dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like just chill out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nolstagia Critic is a OG YouTube channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that reviewed movies, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did we explain that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did we mention that by the way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure that everyone who's
listening to this episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> give somewhat about YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Never mind about him, watch
TheNeedledrop, he's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking love him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was in New York times as
well recently, that was cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I almost never agree with his opinions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but hell that guy can talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the thing
I like about critics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The good ones on YouTube is that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't have to agree with them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like damn, they're entertaining. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there Input is
still interesting, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think like there's a lot
of movie channels like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like YourMovieSucksDOTorg. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like his channel a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's did a really good
video on like the Lion King </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Kimba comparisons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like two hours fucking long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a really good video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've really like a channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, obviously don't
agree with all the opinions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's also, probably
one of my favorite movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> critic guys is a guy called SpookyRice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I showed you that right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think you and AKI
were like super into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I showed AKI 'cause I wanted that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause he reviewed like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All the horrible worst horror movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're are like worst horror, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's disgusting movies.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he manages to be
able to sit through it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enough times that he can write </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a comprehensive review about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you just, none of it comes in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he shows it as
well when it happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But imagine that YouTube, Ukulele music, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that kind of personality reviewing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a horror thing like,
"Yeah, so then he ate the Shit" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, "What?" Why are
you saying it like it's a..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't really like that
scene though. (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking love this wall he's intro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a, like, he like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kokue or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like cure the Kohan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he's like, has a logo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then creepy go horns just
like shows up, I'm like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no, there's nothing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he just likes Kohan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess I'm like, all
right, I respect that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's your opinion
on like YouTube intros? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey sighs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I personally don't use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I sometimes I think that I have to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to explain roughly what's
gonna, like the premise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause sometimes the title
doesn't really explain it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I wanna explain it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I try to keep it to a minimum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, my intro is
like two, three seconds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I'm not like fucking AVGN </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I have a fucking
theme song attached to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't mind if you have an intro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if it likes serves a purpose, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but the ones where it
really, really me off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like tutorials. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my fucking God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate tutorial
channels or help channels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have a into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even a
tutorial or help channel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking, I don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> every time I would wanna look
for a Sony Vegas tutorial, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always that fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor mimics beat) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Always fucking editing some Cod footage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughing) I don't know
why it's always Cod, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey claps) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then on top of that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they make a bullshit like
four, five minute intro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to put in their personality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't care, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanna know how to edit thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so you picture it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're trying to install windows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you get to the guy like,
"Yo, what's up fam. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We just hit 5,000 subs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we can get 6,000 if
you really liked this show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you liked this video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't forget to comment, like, subscribe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because today we're gonna be reviewing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the window installer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And when we break down
the windows installer..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, "Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Just tell me how to install windows." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it's like
literally like 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If we hit 500 likes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll do a windows eight installer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know is redundant
when you Google search </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on I'm like how to solve X problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they pull up the
YouTube video that you need, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and literally skip a
minute and a half ahead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, "Here, Google's like here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Here's where I think
you'll enjoy starting." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't need this fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even the Google system
is aware of how shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and pointless the intro is.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've optimized it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What I do is two monitors, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the tutorial one tab, and
you go to text on the main tab. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you go through the text... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you can find it on the text </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before it gets mentioned
in the video, you win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's so fucking shitty, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you have this like
minute and a half of intro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what you do, is you start
watching at times two speed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then the tutorial itself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they speed through the information so fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're like, "Whoa,
Whoa, hold on a second there." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you have to skip back
to be like, "Yo, yo. It-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It could be like a five minute video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the tutorials is
like the last 30 seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So egregious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are some... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I have some other gaming
channels that I think- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got some gaming channels as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know that you watch
Darkk Mane as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think dark Mane is really funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really good comedic delivery like jokes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's literally the definition
of jokes that aren't funny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but when you deliver them well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just so fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's so funny and I met him once, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think he remembers
because he's very briefly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he was super, he was the
exact same as his videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He blew up at Lee content, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he does general gaming stuff as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just a really odd
guy, just really funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is he exactly like he is in his videos? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I met him he seemed like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I, so he does- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's always endearing, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He does like, a very like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what's that, dry delivery
of unfunny jokes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes funny jokes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But either way, it's always funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- And I met him in real life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was wearing like, he
was dressed up as Thanos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And he had like purple,
'cause he's purple- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right.
- He had like a glove on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I met him, and he for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he just like completely unrelated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "I'm Thanos." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh, I see that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "Okay."
(hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "All right." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I met his friend
RedRiotRoss as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He's really funny dude.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really nice guy, makes great content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think also who would come? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, one of my favorite
gaming content creators </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is Core-A Gaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - About the fighting game stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, a funny game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like he does some of the
best analytical content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on YouTube, in my opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because his content is
all about fighting games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but he breaks it down in
a way that's so general, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that anyone, that one makes you interested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in fighting games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I have zero
interest in fighting games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have zero interest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zero knowledge about finding games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I come out of a Core-A Gaming video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Yeah, you know-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are the type of dude
who sees a how to tutorial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, how to stop fishing guns. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's buying a rod on Amazon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that is so gone, gone gets in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've watched the AlphaGo
documentary, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like the next week after I watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this documentary about geos,
I want to buy a geoboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's play geo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because I, like my one niche </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is watching videos I
have zero interest in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like that to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But watching like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching a content creator, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> basically be able to break it down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a way that makes me interested in it- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is my niche and interests. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that is what I wanna
do with like anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like with my own content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's like the
content creator I respect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like with Core-A Gaming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he like breaks down
fighting games on like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like a social level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He goes into like the psychology, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of why people act the way
they do in fighting games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he unlike some... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I honestly, I think like
every video he's done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the banger when it's
like an analysis video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But he literally like
breaks down the psychology </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of what goes into, like the
fighting game community, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why salt in the fighting game community </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like such a big thing. (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he also has like some
really interesting stories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in between all of this analysis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just like the complete package. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's everything you want
in an analytical video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just fighting games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you can have zero
interest in fighting games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can appreciate what he does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because a lot of his
analysis can be applied </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to pretty much just life in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like he, there's a lot of like key ends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of his videos with
like a nice little message. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Which can be applied to
a lot of things in life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like something you can take away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do need to watch more of his stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't think I'm sad, but- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you gotta check them out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think another sure the
gaming channels I like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously the LilKirbs who
does the Mario speed runs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He did the ship post of all time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because obviously Dunkey,
which we all like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that the guy who
does the bows is big- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, so Dunkey did like the whole joke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in his Mario maker video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you guys don't know Dunkey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean you should know Dunkey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's at the biggest gaming channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He did a video where he like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made his own level and got
the world record on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and was like bragging about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then obviously Dunkey
makes any excuses in his videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when he can't beat a Mario maker level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "Oh, you know, my
little brother was playing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was playing with a USB steering wheel." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was blind folded, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this YouTube Qaeda LilKirbs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who also is just a God at Mario. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like an absolute God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who gets like the world
record on everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think he's won like every
Nintendo speed run competition- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - On Mario maker.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He did a video where he
obviously did Dunkey's course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> blindfolded with a steering wheel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I love that level of thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was such an amazing shit post, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's also like a
second layer of enjoyment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually see him do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like he's actually insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's actual fucking God at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's sheer posting
has gotten to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you need to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the sheer posting itself
is just your pure skill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I mean?
- It's insane, it's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also other gaming creators I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if you see Nitro Rad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He does just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know the name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - He does 40 minute like essays on gaming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not that warm feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like watching YouTube in 2014. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just being coze it up, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just watching someone
talking about video games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Really like just be passionate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think there's nothing that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, he's hilarious." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like, there's nothing that's like mega. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "Wow, it should be unique." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just all round, just a great package. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just super such a nice guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just seems really into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and really loves his gaming upstarts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's always the best, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one game on YouTube where I like a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of respect for a
different reason is a RelaxAlax. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Connor] Mmmh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just because like, I got into him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he did this like
amazing analytical view </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on persona five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, I respect
him because his editing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is fucking next level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so bittersweet watching a dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who is like relatively not
that big on the YouTube sphere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who can just crank out like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these incredibly well
edited videos, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like, the whole reason why I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, our editor Mudan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason why I got into his stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because that dude's
editing on his videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is fucking next level, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I respect him as a Youtuber
and as someone who edits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like videos on One note and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if anything, I've gotten a lot
of like good editing ideas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like creative ideas from his videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Being like, "Oh shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I never thought to do something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's pretty cool." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt bad for the dude
when he got in a bit of drama. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he did, didn't he? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think he was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I don't know
what was right and wrong- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I think that he was
uploading a lot of videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about it to his channel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, "Dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think you should
upload this many videos." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think he uploaded like two videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the insisted for a week about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "No, don't do this man." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just double down dude,
we've established this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just double down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do wanna also mention that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we did recommend Youtubers that turnout </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to have done some up stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, we don't know that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're just recommended
based on purely content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're separating the
creators from the creation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as much as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also we don't
follow everything going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean a lot of these dudes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we just watch and like the content, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we don't keep up with what
they do in their personal life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whatever they do, that's on them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, yeah, I'm sure, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure one of these crazy mentioned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is gonna be like, "They've
promoted someone." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They touch the kid or
something, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause obviously when you
PewDiePie recommended YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as he got in shit for that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, yeah, I wanna make that known </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that any creatives that we recommend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please hunt us for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also finally one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have one last gaming creator
that I want to recommend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I've been watching
this guy for like forever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He's called like Caddicarus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he did like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> His whole thing way back was just a dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who used to do just PS1 game reviews. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was kind of sad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I felt like he'd
stagnated for a long time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just doing PS1, PS2 games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was kind of like, "Alright, nice." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He wasn't really growing much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I'd say like last
year he really turned it around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and started doing some really good videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like insane amounts of effort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like hour long videos about
like skateboarding games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's really update. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In like, the amount of edits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this dudes videos are insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - and he's just broadening out a lot more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just making some
really good right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you like gaming content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and also he's British, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it feels sometimes like his jokes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like British kids TV show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's like, it's weird.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because like, you can see.
- But how so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very stupid and very like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, very crack Heady. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it feels very childish at times- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- But it's just, it's good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know, if you're a 12 year old, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can enjoy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if you are 24 year old like I am, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can still enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's a bit silly, but it's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are we talking like
poopoopiipii levels of show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes, yeah, sometimes.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd dig for that, I thought of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like, it's just nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you said earlier,
it's nice seeing a creator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just step it up- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And really like, I
just want to give credit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where credit's due and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's especially nice
to see a creator step up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when they haven't made 70
videos about them leveling up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, just level up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's hard, right,
when you're creator, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're stagnating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been there-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's really hard to just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know what, fuck it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna put all this effort in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna take a risk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It might not work.
- Just try something new. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like, most of the
time it doesn't work out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you have to keep it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to keep taking those risks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get those awards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's nice seeing... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I can relate
somebody who is stuck in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> doing black butler for like two years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can really relate to getting out of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I really wanna give
credit where credit it's due. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I think, I feel
like there is a space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for update videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but at the end of the day, the audience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like for the most part,
don't really give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're gona drop something big, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then just drop something big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- If you're not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then your like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What you can convey in an update video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can be conveyed within your next project. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unless it's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be away for like a month or two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And at this point, that's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> calling in sick for your boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
(hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Right gang, I'm not
gonna be uploading for a month, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just calling in sick." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's also the element
of surprise, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I've noticed that
like whenever I upload </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something big or something
completely different, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with no pre-warning whatsoever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it usually does better than if you do give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> some kind of hints to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because people aren't expecting it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And therefore I think it gets
people talking about it more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's unfortunate
but at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube, it doesn't
recognize the comments, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't recognize any of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It recognized clicks and watch time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So if you can get that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a bigger statement than being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey guys, I'm gonna do some big." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One, one niche Youtuber
I wanna recommend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is Marshall McGee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he is basically a
professional sound designer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who breaks down sound designs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like games and movies and anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like, I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's only had
like 50,000 subscribers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel like, it's
because sound design </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is such a niche topic
that nobody thinks about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he breaks it down into like basically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he hears like a sound from
like dark souls or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, "Okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's how I would like make the sound." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he like breaks down
this entire process </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like layering- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's really hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every sound he does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just like, I feel like sound design </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is one of those topics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just doesn't get enough appreciation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, it's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel like a channel
like Marshall McGee, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like breaking down, what
actually goes into this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like super interesting as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like how much effort
and like knowledge it takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like, okay, this is what I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like how would you take a
sound that doesn't exist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like create it in your head, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like actually make
the sound that you hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in your head into an actual SFX. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, it's like the
cartoon sounds like a Boeing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what makes a Boeing sound? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Nothing makes a Boeing sound effect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember seeing a video a while back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if it's still up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really all video of
this guy who broke down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one sound, in one cartoon
and it was the fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know in Scooby-Doo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when they go running. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when the...
- The running sound. (mimics) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sound, it was just a breaking down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how they made that sound
of why it's so iconic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just finding out what it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and like how they made it in shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like how they came up with that idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, how do you even think of that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just so... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's something that you
just weren't expecting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, Oh, it's probably
just like a bunch of mallets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, Nope, completely wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also strange, I mean like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we think about getting punched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you punch, it doesn't
make it punch sound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You just get punched. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> There was another video where I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a Foley artist explaining like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how the Hollywood makes
the punching sounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they break leak to break
bones and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like break of saller rift </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and make bones crack and shit like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, shit's so interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I definitely do watch a lot
of like music based Youtubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think some music ones are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a guy called Joe Jeremiah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He doesn't upload much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he just like melodies of like games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and animated shows from piano. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just melodies, feel like maladies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We counting the SethEverman is like a- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - SethEverman- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - SethEverman is shit post channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the one thing I fucking love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about the music Youtuber
community, is that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There shit posting game
is on another fucking level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so shit posty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and yet they're all so fucking talented. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously like Davie504 as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Davie504 and like
SethEverman and other one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like, even like Jon
Sudano was another one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the fat dude who like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- He did covers all this songs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> by the replaceable
lyrics with SmashMallow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shittyflute as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, Shittyflute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno, like a lot of the music content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are like consumers,
mostly just shit posting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And music channels... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There literally so
much you can do with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they've gotten really
creative with shit posting- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ten Second Songs is another one- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That really good as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like super talented
dude, but at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you finish the video and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I just watched the post." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That was a post, but it was so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you guys to watch any like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like horror YouTubers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (whispers) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Define horror Youtubers? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like just talk about horror. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Corpse Husband and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Corpse Husband isn't horror, is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or it used to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, he use to do like
creepy pasta stuff, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Just could pasta like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like MrCreepyPasta and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want MrCreepyPasta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I met him in real life, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really, did you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How was he? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thlod. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hope he doesn't watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I feel like it takes
a quirky personality, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was nice but, you
know, out by my British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, 'cause most Americans aren't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm tryna save this now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You were very pleasant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I guess you were a
little bit off, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, don't we have an entire clip that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like Americans
are different species. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, we have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, we do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Check out that clip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There obviously ReingBot
who did the Mr. Anime videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> My unexpected cameo in that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nexpo does some pretty
good ones as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I really like his video of
Redditors Dive Into Turmoil. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's really good, have you seen that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's about where the woman
who asked a subreddit help. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Man has to help subreddit
take custody of the kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the wife killed them both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when she saw the subreddit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yaikes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just really, really- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know that story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have showed you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a really, like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just didn't expect
the video to go that way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a really just chilling video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I highly recommend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I've spoiled it, I recommend it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all know the best
horror channel is a Chills. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My boy Chills. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God!
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The greatest-
- No 10, burger King foot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, I can't tell you how happy I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was in one of his videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- And he said my name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I've made it as a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's peak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you seen the video
where he just talks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's such a genuine and nice guy as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like-
- Chills. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because like that's
just how he talks, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's how he talks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because everybody
thinks he's like purposely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to make this like annoying accent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like videos where he
just like talks off script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just how he talks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You wanna give him a high five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So nice bless him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, Chills I fucking love you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, please come onto the podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It would be the most
basic sounding podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also a guy who popped
up not too long ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Barely Sociable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He does really good videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He did a really good video
on the silk road as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I might've seen that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's a Silk road. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the website that was famous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the deep web for selling drugs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I thought it was some like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mastermind criminal organization, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but it turned out it was just some dudes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like petty and fighting
about getting trolled. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I've seen a
lot of these guys' content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on like my recommended. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's because like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not the type of content
I would subscribe to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if it's like, if it's
an interesting enough topic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm willing to click on
anything on my recommended. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What about educational channel voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What educational channels
do you guys watch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean Vsauce is the one that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't really upload. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They haven't bought in a while, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but is it even Vsauce source anymore? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause he like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's doing like minefield or mine. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't seen any other
channel called Dong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you remember that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then YouTube forced him
to change it to like Ding, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because Dong was obviously- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - See was like penis, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't believe that, that's awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are we counting like
engineering video educational? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like engineering
has had like a resurgence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> within this past few years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thanks to creators like
Michael Reeves, Willam Osman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mark Rober. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Mark Rober. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I wish they were around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was in fucking university. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I didn't know
engineering could be cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> until they started making content man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think especially like
the posting ones like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Michael Reeves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean I found Michael Reese
when he was doing like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when he was branded as like the laser guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He made one video about
a laser pointing in his eye </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and for like months, his
channel was like everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was the laser dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was so it's so cool
seeing and blow up and also just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> making engineering. Cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Like William Osman and Mark Robert. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I think the latest video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the latest creator I discovered
was a stuff made here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love stuff, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He's just, he's just like
someone who is just, I don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is about
him that like stands out like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even more. Cause he's not,
he's not a poster one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's, he's like a very
serious engineering one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but he just makes these really
cool contraptions and some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the stuff he makes takes so
much effort. It's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How high the bar? The bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the bar for like good engineering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The explosive bat. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What the? Like, like
he made a baseball bat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it has like four shells
in it when you hit it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It explodes and object
to thing that yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically he basically the
concept was he wanted to make a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> baseball bat that anyone could
use to like get a home run. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd like to, to like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Break the world record
for home run. And so he, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just puts shotgun shells
into this baseball bat and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> breaks down his entire
process about how to make this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feasible. And it's like the first, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first problem he had
to overcome was like, he, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he made a baseball bat that worked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but anyone who would use it
would break that arm if they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used it. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like his level or his
like knowledge and level of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> engineering is just like
on a different scale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Fantastic presentation
and great presentation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's actually a Japanese, YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't watch many Japanese. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But because frankly they're all quite man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's one Japanese Ichiba
who like blew up recently or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like quite recently
who's like kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like halfway between
engineering and just absolute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> post. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. And, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and he does these videos
where it's basically just him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> having fun. It's the guy who
like a himself on like a call. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> He, he does like, he basically is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was the one who popularized the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if you carve out a watermelon
and then you boil salt water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a thousand degrees and
you pour it in the watermelon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explodes, I found that he did apparently, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the UN a recent
one that he did was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like, I love popcorn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm going to make a, I
think it was like a 50 meter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long popcorn container and
just fill it up with popcorn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he did that and it's
massive and it's all filled up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with popcorn, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then he took it one step
further and he invited his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> friends and he pranked them by
making this fake room in his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> studio so that the popcorn would
fall in as if it would keep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was insane. And
the videos are so short. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He just manages like condense
that it's like a five minute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like, it sounds
like David doebrick right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just doing it. Same thing is he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he just does the most insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there was another one
where he like, you know, he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he wanted to replicate the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the force of someone going into space, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but obviously you
couldn't afford a rocket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what he did was he created
this contraption where it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would explode underneath him
and it would just inject, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it flew like 50 meters into
the air and like almost broke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his neck and he's just
laughing the entire time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like this guy's a psycho,
but he's so fun to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And Japanese cubes are like
insane, but that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, he's a Japanese teacher, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like he can only speak
Japanese and all that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but he just presents things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so visual that you don't
have to understand what he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying to be such an entertaining video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we're getting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're now getting to the point in YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where to stand out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you need to like have genuine
qualifications and experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> behind the stuff you do,
because it's like some of these, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of these creators that
we've mentioned can easily get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> jobs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the, in their field,
in their professional field. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, decos, I think he's only like 18, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> am I like a wizard engine? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus Christ. I mean, it
goes to show that right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause like the quality of the
engineering is like so insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then you have like the top
channels that doing it. Like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I have an engineering
degree and I'm like baffled. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like apps three years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I have a master's in engineering
and some of the stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're coming up with this,
just like, man, this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this what I would have
done if I had stayed in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> engineering course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And he made the surgery robot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what the? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I, I met him as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like the
nicest dude ever. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we were at the anime
awards and he was leaving and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't really get
a chance to talk much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now came over just to say bye to me. Like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds like, wow, dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like people don't normally
do that. That's really fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And Lily Petri was super nice. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what I've seen the offline
TV crew just seemed like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Trashy stuff like TV collab. When. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - When the world opens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when the world opens up and
we can fly to places or that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can fly to places who the knows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So many educational channels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like obviously like everyone
wants you to CPG gray. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To watch Tom Scott. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Where's Tom Scott. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I subscribe to Tom Scott, but man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his videos will not leave my room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He says one of those channels
that I just know we've got, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I don't even need to
subscribe to your channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I used to, I used to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever I used to go to the
YouTube studio in London, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's always there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just editing his videos
and I never said hi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I felt bad editing, but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He seems like a machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I respect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I respect because I respect
his work ethic because he has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a schedule. I don't
know how he's able to upload. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So consistently with like the,
the amount of videos he has. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Corona and he's somehow
still going abroad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like, he has like
really interesting ideas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So consistently like his, his video where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where it was about like this
video has X amount of views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just fall back guy.
He's the one he made there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I knew, I knew his name was familiar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah.
- We don't have red shirts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what impresses me the most
actually is how he's able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> present his information
with like zero cuts it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like without a script, just,
just in, just in one test. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> How does he do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You get like a Disani
video about like the Sony, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the water bottle. It's
like a five minute video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Does it all in one tape, down the street. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How are you doing?
This is so professional. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So good. I'm reading off a script. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And even I need like
five takes to get one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do love the memes
of like, Oh, I'm here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you seen those memes? Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Breaking, breaking down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The Tom Scott. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously this cook has got cook is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because everyone loves him. I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, we're going to notch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wasn't he? Like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't he try to change his
name to like in a nutshell, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> start in a nutshell. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I like Veritasium as one
of these really good terms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Amazing. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like obviously smarter every day as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you guys watch, I've seen Mike Boyd, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the guy like loons things like
he'll like spend like a week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just learning something and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he won't stop the video
until he does it. So like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he'll learn how there's one
video where he learned to us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shattered glass with his voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I've seen that everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he just learns like
completely useless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know a boy in a band did kind
of a parody of that where he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> learned to sing in 30 days. Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. That was cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Which was really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Highly recommend it.
There's also like casually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> casually explained is also
kind of similar to like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I, I, so like is, is he
educational or is he meme? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you know? Do you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Salmonella, salmonella? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He does like casually explained, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, because here's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's the part, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing like there's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like engineering and
what educational Youtubers are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then there's like casualty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> planes and tear zoo who are
just like, I mean the, the tape, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what they say is
technically correct. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Is anyone actually watching
them to be like educated? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Really? Nah, probably not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you watched Jewish Jay
foreman? I do not watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He does videos mainly about London, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like history of London
and stuff. And like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just so insane. How well
produced these videos are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I also met him ages ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He doesn't remember because
he was like four years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And he's just
obsessed with London and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but his videos are so well
done. And it's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, he'll, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he'll just do a shot where
he's just in the middle of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> street in London for like two seconds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he has to get a
camera man. He had to get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they had to set it all up.
It's like, it's in the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wow. And it's just all
to talk about London. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Most of the time I'd highly recommend it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you like just general
history about London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fair enough. I mean recently, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I've definitely found myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to not watch a lot of
the YouTube videos from like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the really like big
like corporate channels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't really like
the corporate channels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to look at like Wyatt
and Fox channels and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, it's just like a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I want you to channel
called chatter sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I feel just so sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. That name sounds familiar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They always do the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like why New York has big skylines? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why electric calls on in America? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like such generic titles of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why Walmart
is big. And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every single video is so lifeless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. And like, it's informative. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I will say there's sad. There,
there is one kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd say cooperation kind of
video that I do enjoy. I'm not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if this is
the name of the channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the name of the series
is like big, great story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They actually have like really
cool and interesting stories. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think one of my favorite
videos of them was like, they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they were in Japan and there
was this like Japanese person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who sells painting made
in Microsoft Excel. What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't seen that.
I've never seen that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So there's this guy who, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was this Japanese guy who just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he just wanted to express himself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cost zero skills of Japan. Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We do a lot of things in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like he had zero skills
in like painting and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, art skills. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he just side, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like making pictures in
Microsoft Excel and the actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like he he's been doing it for
so long that they'd started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to become really good. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was just like such a
like uplifting story to just be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like, it doesn't really matter
what your tools are now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is a big grid step. That
is the big story. Always. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Super concise as well.
They're not too long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There's also another story
about this soup that is being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like made in Thailand or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like 50 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like been boiling for
50 years. I don't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember watching it and
it was just like, they, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they didn't want wash the place at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So the oil had been built up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there was a mountain
next to this massive pot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you been there?
I have not been there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're going to go back down
when you go to Thailand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you ever like take us to Thailand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I'm sure will happen.
Eventually we really want to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually want to like
see if it's good or not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> If you guys want a channel
called a captain disillusion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 3D, like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Blender. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Breaks things down. So well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And he like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's too talented for
YouTube as well. I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There were just some channels out there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like cartel digital is one
that was just way too talented </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel bad. Cause he
doesn't upload often. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you can tell that he like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe he just wants to
do a bit more. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I found them ages ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause he's been uploading
for like 10 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like his first videos are in
like three 60 P Oh Jesus. So. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean he came up with at the
same time as like Freddie w </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and a rocket jump. I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think they didn't blow up
until like two years ago. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I remember, I
remember he was like back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> back in the day, it was like
Freddie w and rocket jump, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking over the YouTube scene
and then every other VX B </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> effects specialist was
like after him. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, you know, they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they kind of like did their
own thing and then that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that like gave way to like
other people like corridor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> digital. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, there's also another channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the, you know, the Jonny
Harris, the guy left Volks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy used to be the boarders on Fox. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> Sound good. Quality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd recommend it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's already been blowing
up a lot on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm sure you probably seen
the videos and you recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the video of like why'd you
Americans eat dessert for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> breakfast. That blew up a ton. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I might have seen that
one, one, like, as I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like once I never used to
watch Voxer or anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the earworm
series is so good. Like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's essentially like
a one person who's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In charge of that. </SPEAKER_02>

just like does all these like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> documentaries on like music
history and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> Walker right now. I'm very proud. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm proud of you boys. I'm
proud of you, but overall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course we have to talk

<SPEAKER_00> - What is it called? </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> It's a really refreshing because
no one's talking about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> anime, but like my next knife

<SPEAKER_03> Definitely got a lot more
talk and discussion on crunch. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> not even glossy paper mailers. Seriously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a PowerPoint slides. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't actually care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had a great time making
it. I got a banger of a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I ever wanted.
This is like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that student that turns into
homework five minutes before </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> - Got it. I got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get points with this. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, Hey,

<SPEAKER_02> Thank you very much to the
sponsor of this episode book. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll go back to the video.
So questions for you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is there anything else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone you want to shout out
who has actually influenced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your own content or anything
about your own channel? Oh man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've, I've so many people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like I feel the majority of at
least making you sound like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> panel. I go right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's always a question I
get asked at every panel who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> inspired you, Joe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess I'll go first then. Cause like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess the first one I
want to shout out is Philip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> DeFranco. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I've been watching
films since 2006 and he's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, he's been the one content
creator who I've basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> followed for his entire career
because I followed him from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the beginning and you know,
he at, at the moment he's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, does a lot of the
news and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know, I, I started, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started seeing his progression
when he was like more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> villagey and just talking
about stuff on the internet and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> girls and everything like
that. And I like, he was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like probably the
biggest inspiration for me. Not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not as like for the content of my channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but how to approach YouTube
as a job. And as, as, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a business, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I probably would not be
here right now if it wasn't for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Phil, because basically during my break, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was at the BBC and I
was like trying to figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to come back to YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of the stuff he said
before about how YouTube was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and content creators should
think about their career as like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a, as like a proper career
and how it's like broadened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> broaden their income and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I basically got a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of that from a lot of the
things Phil had been saying for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like years. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So here's the person I want
to shout out. Cause he, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he has been like a massive
inspiration for me and I took a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of what I'm doing now or
the way I'm doing now behind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the scenes from all the advice
that he's given over the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> years. For me, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno like my biggest
inspirations for like how to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube and like how to present
myself on YouTube weirdly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> enough came from like all of the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of the big OJI YouTube
is back in the day. So like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the AFA mentioned like AVG and
like I used to watch a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his stuff and like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically YouTube is that
everyone knows like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Felix, obviously grumps, if
we're talking like actual, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like regular voguers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like Ryan Higa was like a
massive ankle, right knee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I used to watch like every, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he got a video that came out
just cause like it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good. And it's just like
such a like personable dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, definitely like the
way like he used to like vlog, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially like where he would
just sit in front of a camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and talk about whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I took a lot of inference
from that because that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do. I just come in front of
a camera and just talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And like a, you know,
like smashed back in the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they had like such
overwhelming power in the YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sphere where it was basically
if you're on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like anywhere before 2012, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was impossible
to not watch them. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. So it was because like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess like when I first
got into like YouTube burrs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I never really went directly
to like a niche that I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interested in. Cause I
just wasn't aware of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I would just basically
watch like all the big guys and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they influenced me, you
know, in small parts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like in terms of like
Anna CIB is probably like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably demo was my, probably
like my biggest influence, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which energy of it hasn't
been influenced by demos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I think demos influenced
everyone in like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at least a little way because
I was around before demo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel like it's even, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's impossible to like think
of any two contents before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> demo. Like, I mean like off the demo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it all he changed the
field completely. Absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Absolutely. Come back demo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I cannot think of my
inspirations. I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously I was watching
my own inspiration. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I know I've taken like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've definitely been taking
bits and pieces, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like definitely like pots of, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Peter Popsie growing up,
watching him in high school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching him do bits and pieces, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think from like a lot
of different people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But I can't think of like any
one of top of my head that has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> been like huge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you watch so much
content, especially on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's not just one person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because otherwise you just end
up being exactly like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Exactly. I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure we can distill down a
lot of our influences and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know, take bits here and
there, but at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe I can break it down and figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> out exactly which ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really like gave him my style. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. It's hard to say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause obviously I, I
pivoted my content so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know there was inspirations there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, it's, it's, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not to say that like, you know, we, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we still get inspired to this day. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Without new influences and
whatnot, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure like the majority of the YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as we talked about today have
influenced us in some small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> way. We have just listed
probably 90% like our influence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Today. And basically,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just, just in this two hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Is there any one else
you guys want to shout out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got a bunch of channels
that we didn't really like talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about that I could just speed run through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Let's buy an old gas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No brakes. God Tia challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Love, love, love all gas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No brakes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I showed you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. He's like the modern day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kassem G. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Donna put Kassem G but more
political because Kassa McGee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was more like, let's just
throw a topic out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like also castle actively
made fun of them in a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way. Like have some GS
pulled install videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Like some of the
best content on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Actually. If anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe Kassem G might have
inspired me at the time. Like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really enjoyed his way of
how he would insult them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but not insult them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But honestly, he doesn't
really do anything anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now he's just an extra in
movies. Like the transformer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was he? I don't even know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to know what
he's up to now, but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All gas, no brakes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What I love about him is that
he doesn't even need to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much. He just lets the stupid
people do the stupid thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Willing to go there and
he's friendly with them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He gets them to talk to him
and it's really hard to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think. And a lot of
journalists just can't get them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He gets like, everyone knows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's just going to be nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like he's going to show everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like some of my favorite ones were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when he went to like the
COVID party. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just the biggest cesspool
I've ever seen. However. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The time he goes somewhere,
somehow people bring up Jews. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I dunno, like
he'll go to somewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Jews. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get brought up for being the
problem. And it's like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is like sleep the lone man, hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I loved it on a PO I think
he was on the history podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where he mentioned like, he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason like his influences
that like I could go all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these places all around the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the backyard in America is so crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you not want to document? Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so true. Don't blame him man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a guy called honest
guys who does like videos about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Prague. I've no interest
in going to Prague. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've already been, but he just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he's just so passionate about Prague. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love it. Talking about videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching videos that
you have no interest in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to shout out Ristic
studies who makes essays about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> magic? The gathering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, I don't know a
single thing about magic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The gathering. I do not even
know the rules of magic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never played magic in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I play magic a little bit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the way that he breaks down
these concepts in magic are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just so interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I think one of my favorite
videos of his is he goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through like the history of
like the rarest card in magic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like how much it sold for
everything in black Lotus or the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> black Lotus. He made a video
on that and like how to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like how people like actually
verify like that these cards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's cool. And then like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause he starts off
talking about not the heat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He starts off, not even
talking about magic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You start us off this video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this video talking about rare
baseball cards and the history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like how these like all these cards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how these cards have sold for so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he pivots that into
magic and it sounds like a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dog. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he's a great con and
he's editing as God's here as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well. Speaking of magic, but
on the actual, like regular, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a channel I watched
quite regularly called Chris </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Ramsey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I've Oh, is it
the guy who does the opens? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He does. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He's he's, he's like a
professional magician, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but he also has his own
YouTube channel where he, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he got famous off of like get
buying these like super hard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 3D puzzles and like solving them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But he also just does these
like videos where he like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he basically like he did the
train before it was a train. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He actually does like the
professional magician reacts like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like he actually has
qualifications cause he's actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a professional magician and
he like kind of like tries to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like, he obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magician doesn't tell
their secrets. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he like kind of reacts
to it and says like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a good magic trick
because of this. And like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he kind of pinpointed
in ways where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you wouldn't really be able to see a list. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You were in the same
field and like he's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know what
camera he uses, but Holy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his camera quality is like red camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I want to know what
camera he uses the most insane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> quality camera that I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obviously loved Linus tech tips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So that video where he talked
about possibly retiring Blake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> broke, that broke me as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? Like it's such a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like such an honest video
and you just can't help it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't, you know what that felt like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It felt like leaving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You felt like that talk where it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your dad's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so me and your mom are going
to break up and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know, I know it's confusing times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's exactly what I
felt like, man, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly it's not your fault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Trust me. It's like, we were
just, we've tried everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If anyone deserves to retire
it's lineup, the man has been. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a, a staple of
YouTube and he's been, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's been on the grind, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's been on the grind and
he's just like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's obvious that his, you
know, the company's built up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone just loves to work. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just so great. It's so great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Seeing people like he would
just see me who seemed lovely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You could be the biggest
dictator at all. I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he just seems like
such a genuine nice guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speaking of Linus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we got to talk about his
latest collaborator too mad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the mic off crack head of YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like my love to his content
so much. But my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go out there with ADHD, one
of his videos and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my attention span is destroyed right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Friend, who you have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who you just can't introduce
to people like you're so funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I love you, but I can't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So he said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's the one friend that you'll
proud to know that he's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friend of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you're also ashamed to
say that he's a friend of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a bunch of other
channels value select two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just shown you guys a million times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This guy does like skits and
he's probably the best skit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel on YouTube.
Doesn't really good music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like January music as well, just so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he hasn't blown up yet.
He hasn't blown up insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've literally been like
touting this guy to everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know for like months, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every time I go to
someone's house, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give me the ox code. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll put on a song. You've had no ship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Speaking of other skit channels, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to shout out
Britain, Nick, this is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like a channel that's
been like around for years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. But he, he's also a skit channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he's one of those videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's one of those channels
that uploads once every year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One video. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like a two minute skit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most of the time to five minutes gear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But his skits are so densely
packed that it's like another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> level of quality. Like every, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every scene in the skits
leads into the other scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perfectly. The writing is just
like, so top-notch, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, when you see like a scene in a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like a sitcom or
something and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gone through like a
hundred different rewrites. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the kind of the
quality I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But because he, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's been around for like
nine years or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but because he only uploads
once every year, he just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he just doesn't like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't do that on YouTube anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I also, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's quantity, but cracked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like that one friend
who like is just a piece of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But then the actually funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I do love that you'll know that
dad's complete con but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> she funny crack it. He
just does discord humor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So perfectly such a good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He is discord as a person.
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A guy who, when I
used to do prank calls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he doesn't really give any views anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was called house hotel. And like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's so good at prank calling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he knows all the like scams
inside out really good way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was influenced by him
with your scam call. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to really like his
videos. And I thought I found it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I really liked how he dealt
with it and he would keep them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a few other
channels as well called us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy kit Boga as well.
He does pranks really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's a guy who,
God don't know his name, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he hadn't said the engine Kohl center, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that video was insane.
And that was really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there's, there's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a lot of content
creators that I don't know their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> channel name, but I
can name their content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if I say, Hey, those two
Indian guys that built stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously like critical. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well obviously we talked about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like proceeded and
critical the same thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like different content
they're talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they do the same
thing essentially. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But pro CD is like talking
about food and Adam and and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> meme and critical is just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like critical.
We could do a video about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's like one of the few
content creatures that can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> literally do a video about anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he, like, he can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he can make it like the top
10 massacres of all time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'll be like, man, if
the Holocaust a number one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not leaving this video, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my favorite video where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a video of the only
critical chromate, which was a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was so disgusting, but
so good at the same time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, I hate you so
much, but Dan, this is yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Another YouTube. I think
we've all watched is the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you won't know his name, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but Q army Japan is what it's called, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but he's the dude who makes knives. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Makes nice out of everything.
I got a smoke out of jello. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I comment on one of his videos is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate to be in a jail cell with him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a guy called virtually vain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He also did prank calls. He
didn't really upload much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He did one recently, but he was
like the God of prank calls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You did like a great African, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like he did like African
dictator or something for calls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But this man is that the
King of prank calls up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you guys know sorrow TV? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He doesn't have that. That

<SPEAKER_01> - Just the he's like the only
channel I like that does like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Reddit videos. Like when
he like reads a sub Reddit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like all the other ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you talking about the ask
Reddit videos where it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like this computerized
voice. I was just like awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. This is like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Whenever Sydney does
any makeup or anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just hear ask Reddit this time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I might be out those videos, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Our TV is like, actually
like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> A video that shouldn't require talent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She brings a ton of talent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's our team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He's so good at doing voices
and like voicing the like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Reddit thing. It's like, wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone was just
dogs. Wait, wait, is it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is it actually just the
same ask Reddit threads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like this it's like
a professional voiceover </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> essentially. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like voice to them and
I'm just like, man, they, they, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they leveled up. Their
voice actually got boy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Nice guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually like a guy who's amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is like doing voices. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you're so good at
like, I'm a voice actor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like hearing like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like Morgan Freeman or like
narrate and ask Reddit threads. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He'll swap the voices really well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Soak it with comedic timing, James. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He doesn't really upload anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Griffin is like a guy that does lap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of sounds familiar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's the guy who does like
the one dude 50 voices or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever. He's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nana's shout out to Nana's
cause now this has been around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> knows. Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remembered yanas back when she was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she was like the daughter
of fortune and just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just seeing her like debut,
like debut as a V Chiba, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like such an obvious choice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know you didn't think about
it until it happens. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the VCU I'm just like,
that's the perfect matter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course she wants to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> she was a beach you buy
before Vichi was existed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was voice acting online
since like 2013, 2014. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was still like the staple. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I pitched posting. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's crazy to see that
she's like peaking now. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really cool to
see someone doing well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Who's been around for so long
a node city obviously. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like circle tunes HD as well.
That guy just a move stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really like how he
was basically. Cause he, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he can animate. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He does. He doesn't need to animate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like it's
better because of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You must see in his videos,
it's the guy who has like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he he's basically like
an animation Youtuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but instead of actually animating, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he just like goes into
Photoshop and just like wiggle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wiggles, like your. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Models around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Jenny Nicholson as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Up. It's not jump as good as
the gaming Youtuber who like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he was the first person who
actually did VR gaming videos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but just made it like
he, he, like I said, he, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he has this perfect line
of like comedic analysis on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> literally just like VR games. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I I've I've I've not
seen any other content creator </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that focuses on VR games except for him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And he, he definitely set the bar high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well the is cold, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's been at my
recommended a bunch of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he like makes video games and
like he made like among us in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 3d and he like remade full
guys in like two weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't insane. I call
them just to shut the comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll let me know that guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there any one you think
is like a low-key Wiebe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, it's like these
last couple of years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like people who we thought had
no affiliation to animate or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like Yama we've forgot
Carson. Call me, call us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh yeah. He is he's
he's not a low-key weep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He's a, he's a full degenerate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Come to Japan already cast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hang out with, to say
anyone we've spoke, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> good about on or we like probably can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have to come on the
podcast? Yeah. Come to Japan. </SPEAKER_02>

we watch. Come on, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Man. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> We could find. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've got drunk planning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. But I'm sure there's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's plenty more
recommendations for you guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure you guys watching. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have a lot of recommendations
to go and watch tonight, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this has been like such
a dense episode of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recommendations. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like write that down right
away. Please slow down please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just rapid fire recommendations. Like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I feel like we did gloss
over a lot of the obvious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bigger content creators. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Many creators that I was
already affiliated with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So obviously ditis and Emily. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's amazing. I don't
need to mention that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We didn't mention our friends
because you guys should know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> by now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I've talked to you
in a DM, that probably, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that probably means that that
means I already know you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? And yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's probably a good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just waiting for the
comment being like, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if only they did this with anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you guys actually watch that? Like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I watched John super eye patch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched the cow. I want
to shout out beyond Ghibli, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beyond Ghibli does
amazing animated videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's, it's hard to describe like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like an anime YouTube channel. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because that's what I do, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like how do I, how do I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how do I describe this
animal YouTube channel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically he does amazing
anime analytical content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did a great one on recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, I think check
him out was pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think they have a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lot of misses, but when
they hit, they hit good. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've got to give a shout out
to my boy shaves like, Nope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Not going to last at times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just looking forward to
being on his digest in the kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> section. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. I'll need you digest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is a series a where Chaves, this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this energy where it goes
through basically like some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like some of his favorite
YouTube videos to do with like in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube is least favorite
least favorites as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is like the one series. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've pretty much think every
anime, YouTube watches, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though, even if they don't want to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I told him I'm like everyone watches, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone doesn't want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every attitude of a secretly
wants to be on the good side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, did I make it
onto the good one this week? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The reason I like watching
it is because my taste in what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes a good YouTube or like
what makes an interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube video is so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a good critic. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You can just appreciate the
cake that he's doing and don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give a about you if you disagree, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is more often than normal. I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't worry. Shaves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll do more interview videos for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like the worst thing
you can do as a critic is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> flip-flop right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If people know your personality
and people know what you'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like, they don't give it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't really matter if
I disagree with your opinion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm still gonna watch it anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I know what you like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I take everything you say
with a grain of salt system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and respect about critics is that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not afraid of the
backlash because at the end of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day, that is their opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? And it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> rather than flip-flopping
on your own words again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's got to double down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you got to double down
on Europeans being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If the majority think
that this is a good video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think it's a good
video. These reasons, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I've already, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've already shouted out scam
Cambodia reviews before. Yep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like he's closed Christian pants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's talks a lot about
LGTBQ and he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just such a funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> His editing is kind of bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, man, is he funny? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's so funny. Like he's just great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just bring such energy
to shift Tuskegee energy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the gay best
friend, everyone wishes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah man, like if I
need a gossip session. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would want to have a gossip session </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with crispy nuts, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Crispy, crispy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm recommended. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I know that like the positivity
is going to be that she's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> funny. She's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's really the anatomy
YouTube channels I watch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately. Yeah.
- I mean, you know, we, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we basically just did a
two and a half hour long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recommendation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's just jump right
into it. We jumped right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Today in awesome. I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I've watched
Malana my YouTube channels, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't okay. I don't
subscribe to anyone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if it appears on my feed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's normally means it's
like a good video that's worth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching because like my, my, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my subscription feed for anime,
YouTube was is just Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. That's awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Him to watch the best of the
week that shade recommends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'll be like, God, this is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I'll take a limb on it because. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I clearly have different tastes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I respect his work on the lights. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean he did two
ferrous Garn Legon video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I did watch the two hour
things long, but Bruce Good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll give him that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The men did good. Voiceover was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we should probably end this
video with a special thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> today, today in like, that's
all we're going to call it from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> our trash taste. </SPEAKER_03>
