<garnt> youtube comments </garnt>
<joey> i thought the old intros better i like </joey>
<garnt> the old studio better yeah i remember </garnt>
<connor> when joey put effort into his intros </connor>
<connor> about trash taste yeah right </connor>
<garnt> remember when like half of my intros </garnt>
<joey> would get the episodes demonstrated </joey>
<connor> it's so annoying they lost like </connor>
<connor> thousands of dollars joey one of those </connor>
<garnt> couldn't resist being constructed </garnt>
<connor> australian yeah </connor>
<joey> i can't help them i have to fight the </joey>
<connor> ocean to say all the bad words can you </connor>
<connor> guys tell i'm absolutely ripped today i </connor>
<joey> went to the gym the first time in two </joey>
<joey> months i was about oh my what i'm </joey>
<connor> absolutely pumped right first time in </connor>
<garnt> two months first time two months my body </garnt>
<connor> is dying so you signed up to the new gym </connor>
<connor> your new place i did i did </connor>
<connor> and it's it's different and the </connor>
<joey> etiquette is slightly different so it </joey>
<garnt> kind of threw me off wait did you sign </garnt>
<garnt> up by yourself </garnt>
<joey> uh yeah yeah it's impossible </joey>
<joey> i don't believe you i was trying to i </joey>
<joey> don't believe you i shouldn't remember </joey>
<joey> how i did it and it was </joey>
<joey> confusing because it was all blur </joey>
<joey> he was asking dave and i was like yes </joey>
<garnt> well that's just every interaction i </garnt>
<garnt> have with a japanese person in japan </garnt>
<connor> they ask me something and i just say yes </connor>
<connor> here's how good my japanese has gotten </connor>
<connor> to this point now yeah i can it's kind </connor>
<connor> of like i'm i'm kind of filling in the </connor>
<connor> blanks </connor>
<connor> it kind of feels like you're doing one </connor>
<connor> of those mario party mini games where </connor>
<connor> you you see a part of the sequence and </connor>
<connor> you're like i think i know where the </connor>
<joey> sequence is going it's like going into a </joey>
<joey> mario party game without looking at the </joey>
<joey> controls right it's like 100 percent i </joey>
<connor> think i think this is out so now now i </connor>
<connor> i'm getting to the point where i'm </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm accustomed to </connor>
<connor> the normal flow of signing up to things </connor>
<connor> so i kind of understand what they're </connor>
<connor> saying </connor>
<connor> and i understood most of what was told </connor>
<connor> of me and a lot of it was just like hey </connor>
<connor> read this and i'm like oh sorry it's </connor>
<joey> just really weird when they pulled the </joey>
<joey> knife out and made me science selling my </joey>
<connor> blood you know it's like oh that's you </connor>
<connor> know i guess that's true the rectal exam </connor>
<connor> was a bit weird </connor>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> is it </garnt>
<connor> i don't know we fact check that </connor>
<joey> come in fact listen when i went in there </joey>
<joey> it looked american yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> they all do because all the gyms used </joey>
<garnt> white people to uh advertise yeah </garnt>
<garnt> advertise their gym </garnt>
<joey> at the front of our old gym there was </joey>
<joey> like it was like five banners of just </joey>
<joey> like really attractive white guys and </joey>
<garnt> girls like </garnt>
<garnt> i've never seen a japanese person be </garnt>
<connor> advertised on a gym before it is weird </connor>
<connor> having japanese just white people is </connor>
<connor> like the standard it's like </connor>
<joey> i think it's my i think it might just be </joey>
<joey> because like going to the gym in this </joey>
<joey> country is like a [ __ ] luxury because </joey>
<garnt> of how expensive that was no it's not </garnt>
<garnt> just that who the [ __ ] what japanese </garnt>
<garnt> person has time to go to a gym that's </garnt>
<connor> true also most of it don't mostly happen </connor>
<connor> these people are in shape right and the </connor>
<connor> people that aren't in shape i don't </connor>
<connor> think they care about being in charge no </connor>
<connor> yeah they have like they're like i've </connor>
<connor> got everything i need in my life yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah you're in shape uh i've got my my </connor>
<joey> seven levels like why are you working </joey>
<joey> out i wasn't just like naturally in [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> how did you get fat how did </connor>
<connor> basically yeah pretty much uh yeah i </connor>
<joey> signed up and i don't know i i mean i </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty yeah like i said i'm pretty </joey>
<joey> sure antoine fitz is american we had a </joey>
<connor> fact check and it was an american yeah i </connor>
<joey> was assuming it was america </joey>
<joey> that sounds american like joyfit 24 yeah </joey>
<joey> that that's not [ __ ] american yeah </joey>
<garnt> that sounds japanese that sounds like </garnt>
<garnt> what a japanese people think american </garnt>
<garnt> people think yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yes you're joyful in your your </connor>
<joey> fears and it's over 24 hours so yeah so </joey>
<connor> it's a joy i mean anytime fit this is </connor>
<joey> much better signed up to it </joey>
<connor> uh didn't really know what the [ __ ] was </connor>
<garnt> going on they took my picture i got the </garnt>
<connor> key thing i signed my life away they </connor>
<garnt> asked me my card yeah it worked out so i </garnt>
<garnt> i believe i'm signed up so </garnt>
<connor> that's good i i walked in yesterday and </connor>
<garnt> nobody stopped me </garnt>
<garnt> one thing i've noticed uh about moving </garnt>
<garnt> is like you know having to cancel </garnt>
<garnt> memberships and having to cancel stuff </garnt>
<garnt> is like ten times easier than signing up </garnt>
<garnt> to something yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's the opposite in the west right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah cause like i i was dreading </garnt>
<joey> having to cancel my gym membership </joey>
<joey> because i remember when we signed up to </joey>
<joey> a gym membership it took like 45 minutes </joey>
<joey> to an hour of just reading forms so i </joey>
<joey> was just like so me and cindy had to go </joey>
<joey> cancel gym membership and we said one </joey>
<joey> word which was just like we would like </joey>
<joey> to cancel our membership and we had to </joey>
<joey> find one piece of paper yeah it took </joey>
<joey> five minutes take five why can't signing </joey>
<joey> up be that easy yeah why would you like </joey>
<connor> no leaving fees just like yeah use the </connor>
<joey> gym until like the end of the month it's </joey>
<connor> like it's like everything you're not </connor>
<connor> supposed to do as a business right it's </connor>
<connor> like why it's like i love how how </connor>
<garnt> hesitant they are to sign you up to you </garnt>
<garnt> it's like are you sure you want to give </garnt>
<garnt> us money every month yeah yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> why i'm [ __ ] here just let me get in </garnt>
<joey> for christ's sake </joey>
<garnt> exactly the moment you leave they're </garnt>
<garnt> like oh thank god all right here you go </garnt>
<joey> take it get the [ __ ] out </joey>
<garnt> like i had to change over my internet as </garnt>
<garnt> well and that was </garnt>
<garnt> surprisingly painless because they were </garnt>
<garnt> like no worries did you want to cancel </garnt>
<garnt> your internet or did you want to move to </garnt>
<garnt> a new place and i'm just like it's is </garnt>
<joey> which one's easier not like it's both </joey>
<garnt> the same it's just </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> exactly it's just like yeah where's the </garnt>
<joey> catch where's the camera but then why is </joey>
<joey> it like such pulling teeth when you're </joey>
<joey> like signing up for like water or </joey>
<joey> gasoline </joey>
<joey> are you sure you want water in your </joey>
<joey> place it's like yes please thank you </joey>
<connor> like i only just okay so i moved to our </connor>
<connor> current place like what five almost six </connor>
<connor> months ago right and i only just </connor>
<garnt> finished finalizing my water stuff </garnt>
<garnt> really yeah because like for some reason </garnt>
<garnt> because i got like a new bank account </garnt>
<garnt> and wither came a new card and for some </garnt>
<joey> reason they didn't allow me to use my </joey>
<joey> new bank account </joey>
<joey> because it's not under the same name or </joey>
<joey> some kind of well you said you said the </joey>
<connor> b word bank </connor>
<connor> in japan </connor>
<connor> yeah so i was like but but i've done it </connor>
<connor> before at my previous place and it was </connor>
<joey> pretty painless right so i was like okay </joey>
<joey> i mean you know it's just changing a </joey>
<joey> bank account how hard could it be famous </joey>
<joey> last question how hard could it be </joey>
<garnt> nothing with the word bank in japan is </garnt>
<joey> ever easy but what i don't understand </joey>
<connor> right is that okay so i signed up and </connor>
<connor> i'm like okay i want to change to my new </connor>
<connor> bank because like you know my money </connor>
<connor> situation has changed in this new place </connor>
<garnt> and they were like sure no worries we'll </garnt>
<garnt> send you a form you can fill out all </garnt>
<garnt> your information and then mail it back </garnt>
<garnt> to us i'm like all right email is also a </garnt>
<garnt> thing but anyway so they so so i think </garnt>
<garnt> about a month after that phone call </garnt>
<garnt> finally the form comes in i was like all </garnt>
<joey> right i don't know why this took a month </joey>
<joey> to stand out but sure </joey>
<joey> fill it in in five minutes send it off </joey>
<joey> two months later </joey>
<joey> i get a phone call and they say </joey>
<joey> uh so your bank is not </joey>
<joey> able to be used oh my god i'm like </joey>
<joey> ciao tomate </joey>
<joey> you could have told me that on the phone </joey>
<joey> three months ago </joey>
<joey> why is it now after all this like </joey>
<joey> waiting and sending out a form that </joey>
<joey> you're finally like </joey>
<connor> jk </connor>
<joey> they're gonna call you up and be like </joey>
<garnt> yeah by the way the rate of inflation </garnt>
<joey> has changed so significantly in the past </joey>
<joey> two months that yeah details all over </joey>
<joey> again yeah right have you been paying </joey>
<joey> for water since then so before it just </joey>
<joey> used to be like a bank transfer like </joey>
<joey> every month automatically but since then </joey>
<joey> i've had to like get the form they mail </joey>
<joey> you the form that says the amount and </joey>
<joey> then i have to go to the uh family mart </joey>
<joey> or the yeah </joey>
<garnt> and do it by cash yeah which just like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] me up because sometimes i don't </garnt>
<connor> check my mail every day and then there </connor>
<connor> was one month where i almost like got my </connor>
<connor> water stopped oh my god because they </connor>
<connor> just straight up didn't send me my form </connor>
<connor> and i'm like and then they called me and </connor>
<joey> they were like uh so you haven't paid </joey>
<joey> for your thing i'm like they haven't </joey>
<joey> given me the [ __ ] form what am i </joey>
<joey> supposed to do </joey>
<joey> am i supposed to be like am i supposed </joey>
<joey> to go and go to my life </joey>
<joey> am i supposed to go to the company being </joey>
<garnt> like uh sorry i don't have the form but </garnt>
<joey> like trust me </joey>
<garnt> i owe you guys this i i have to pay i </garnt>
<garnt> have to give you this money i've </garnt>
<garnt> realized right that when i first moved </garnt>
<garnt> here i thought oh my god i can pay my </garnt>
<garnt> bills at the the local companies yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this is amazing this is great yeah now i </garnt>
<garnt> realize it's just to avoid banks yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's just like this whole car this </joey>
<joey> country has set up a system where the </joey>
<joey> banks just don't need to do anything but </joey>
<connor> they still have to have all your money </connor>
<garnt> yeah basically </garnt>
<joey> yeah and they give you like what is it </joey>
<joey> like 0.001 </joey>
<connor> interest or something like that the </connor>
<joey> interest gets wiped out by every every </joey>
<connor> time you want to take out money that's </connor>
<garnt> true </garnt>
<garnt> like you you basically there's less </garnt>
<garnt> interest than the p the the fees you pay </garnt>
<joey> for like any service yeah japan is the </joey>
<joey> only country where like hiding your </joey>
<joey> money under your mattress might be a </joey>
<joey> better investment than putting it into a </joey>
<garnt> bank honestly </garnt>
<connor> it's probably safer </connor>
<connor> don't spend money in the country like </connor>
<garnt> people just don't no they don't yeah so </garnt>
<joey> they're like why would we give you </joey>
<garnt> interest if people are going to keep </garnt>
<joey> money in their bank </joey>
<joey> weirdly is like a weird like </joey>
<joey> money-saving mentality in this country </joey>
<joey> even for people who have the money to </joey>
<connor> spend so yeah apparently the one of the </connor>
<connor> reasons uh why they didn't want to give </connor>
<connor> more money out of people during the the </connor>
<connor> peak pandemic is because uh people just </connor>
<connor> don't spend the money so they would just </connor>
<connor> be giving money that wouldn't help </connor>
<connor> stimulate the economy yeah because </connor>
<connor> people wouldn't go out even if you gave </connor>
<connor> them a thousand bucks most people just </connor>
<connor> would just gonna keep it right right i'm </connor>
<garnt> not gonna like i would that's not </garnt>
<garnt> surprising because like domestic tourism </garnt>
<garnt> is massive here it's just a massive </garnt>
<joey> issue but it's from here but it is right </joey>
<joey> it's like 90 of the economy yeah exactly </joey>
<connor> right but like </connor>
<connor> from what i understand of the domestic </connor>
<connor> tourism here it is like a massive luxury </connor>
<connor> yeah if you will can't afford to go from </connor>
<connor> what i understand and also don't have </connor>
<garnt> the time yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think the biggest resource for any </garnt>
<garnt> japanese person especially working is </garnt>
<connor> time yeah i don't have time to do </connor>
<connor> anything if you ever go to a ryokan </connor>
<connor> right if you stay there for two nights i </connor>
<connor> guarantee you're probably like one out </connor>
<connor> of 100 people who are staying there for </connor>
<connor> more than one night oh yeah everyone </connor>
<connor> leaves the next day always i've noticed </connor>
<garnt> that like if i go and park my car it's </garnt>
<garnt> full next day empty the car park yeah at </garnt>
<garnt> like two o'clock because no one's </garnt>
<garnt> checking in until like four yeah and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> the only [ __ ] who apparently stayed </garnt>
<garnt> even though it makes more sense to have </garnt>
<connor> a hotel room for at least two days </connor>
<connor> because you at least get one full day of </connor>
<garnt> the room yeah that never made sense to </garnt>
<garnt> me because how can you enjoy the day </garnt>
<connor> because that means you spend </connor>
<garnt> most ryokan you can't check into check </garnt>
<connor> in until three or four and they won't </connor>
<garnt> let you check in early as well yeah even </garnt>
<connor> if there's space even if they're spaced </connor>
<garnt> with japanese hotels and it's not just </garnt>
<garnt> ryokans it's hotels as well even if they </garnt>
<garnt> have space in the hotel you still can't </garnt>
<joey> check in until the check in time i feel </joey>
<joey> that the problem though is that like the </joey>
<joey> the main demographic that goes to your </joey>
<joey> cons for one night is usually like </joey>
<joey> retirees yeah right </joey>
<joey> itself is the exploring right but you </joey>
<connor> know what sucks like is the fact that </connor>
<garnt> you don't even get like a full 24 hours </garnt>
<garnt> when you buy one knife yeah that's </garnt>
<connor> that's why i like in my head i'm like </connor>
<connor> this is so inefficient and it's true </connor>
<connor> this is why like you should never ever </connor>
<connor> like even if you stay in like let's say </connor>
<connor> you're staying in kyoto right yeah you </connor>
<connor> should never change hotel every night </connor>
<garnt> because you're just wasting yeah wasting </garnt>
<garnt> time wasting uh wasting time that you </garnt>
<garnt> could have in the hotel room yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> get the breakfast as well or whatever i </garnt>
<connor> don't know you you know carrying your </connor>
<garnt> bags around pain in the ass yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> plus plus like when i'm on a holiday </garnt>
<garnt> when i'm staying in a hotel or ryokan </garnt>
<garnt> when i want to relax </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to think about what time i </garnt>
<garnt> need to wake up the morning after that's </garnt>
<connor> true right i want at least one day when </connor>
<connor> i'm just like if i want to lie in i can </connor>
<connor> lie in you i want to crack some beers </connor>
<connor> open with the boys i want to know maybe </connor>
<connor> lie until like 10 o'clock you know </connor>
<connor> whatever yeah but in ryokans like you </connor>
<connor> have to wake up at eight because most </connor>
<garnt> people are only staying there for one </garnt>
<garnt> night and you know they they have to </garnt>
<joey> wake up early to check out yeah </joey>
<joey> on japan's side of things like having to </joey>
<joey> sleep or getting to sleep in is like the </joey>
<joey> privileged way of enjoying it it's like </joey>
<joey> wow </joey>
<connor> you would stay here for more than one </connor>
<joey> night what the [ __ ] you privileged [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> i uh </connor>
<joey> was uh i can't remember when i went to </joey>
<joey> ryokan but i went to one and </joey>
<joey> i remember i was just i loved it but </joey>
<joey> then i was absolutely appalled that they </joey>
<joey> made us check out at 9am yeah oh really </joey>
<joey> is this privilege or i don't know if </joey>
<joey> this is my privilege i've never seen </joey>
<joey> that before like 9am not 9am bro give me </joey>
<connor> a chance to like brush my teeth i don't </connor>
<garnt> even wake up at night holy [ __ ] i'm </garnt>
<garnt> trying to relax out here you have to </garnt>
<garnt> check out at 9am and i guarantee like </garnt>
<joey> earliest check-in is like four yeah </joey>
<connor> that's the thing it's like what are you </connor>
<connor> cleaning for so long </connor>
<connor> well not surely this cannot take that </connor>
<connor> long </connor>
<connor> the one thing that i love about like </connor>
<connor> american hotels is that whenever i've </connor>
<connor> always asked for late checkout they've </connor>
<connor> always given it to me like </connor>
<connor> if it's like an hour extra like they </connor>
<connor> always chill about it like sometimes </connor>
<connor> they maybe they've charged me like 20 30 </connor>
<connor> bucks extra but japanese hotel i </connor>
<connor> remember one time i said in the hotel </connor>
<connor> room um in nigata yeah and the hotel </connor>
<connor> room itself was 90 dollars </connor>
<connor> for an extra hour right with seventy </connor>
<connor> dollars </connor>
<connor> just for one extra hour what to stay in </connor>
<connor> the room past eleven right and i was </connor>
<connor> like i was like </connor>
<connor> did i hear that correct can you can you </connor>
<connor> say that again like watch it or please </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> seventy the room was ninety how does </connor>
<connor> that make any sense </connor>
<connor> tell me like [ __ ] be down because </connor>
<joey> because because i think to them anything </joey>
<joey> past that time limit is an extra day no </joey>
<garnt> it's it's to them they're offering late </garnt>
<joey> check out without offering late check </joey>
<joey> out you know what i mean like </joey>
<garnt> it's like we got late check out but it's </garnt>
<garnt> not really late check out what it is </garnt>
<garnt> late check it out it's not like </garnt>
<connor> nothing's late about it </connor>
<connor> it's empty as well it was like like pete </connor>
<connor> corona there was nobody staying here why </connor>
<joey> were you trying to swindle me well yeah </joey>
<connor> they're fighting for their life man they </connor>
<joey> need that extra money </joey>
<joey> because no one's staying there they're </joey>
<connor> like oh let's charge this guy 70 bucks </connor>
<connor> i'll give you i'll i know i know it's </connor>
<connor> not culture i'll tip you man just leave </connor>
<connor> me alone don't charge me 70 bucks for </connor>
<connor> this [ __ ] what do i need to do who do i </connor>
<joey> need to say </joey>
<joey> it's weird though because like most like </joey>
<garnt> high-end yokans especially they're </garnt>
<garnt> usually quite lenient with uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> late checkouts and stuff like we just uh </garnt>
<garnt> myself and aki and a few others just </garnt>
<garnt> came back from this yokan and yamanashi </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like they said the checkout was </garnt>
<joey> like 9 30. yeah we were there till like </joey>
<joey> 11. and they were like yeah you're good </joey>
<joey> it's like okay then why are you kicking </joey>
<joey> us out at 9 30 if that's the case </joey>
<garnt> did you ask them for late check out or </garnt>
<garnt> did were they just like no they were </garnt>
<joey> like they said the night before they </joey>
<joey> were like oh yeah so it's 9 30 check out </joey>
<joey> is that okay and we were like uh we </joey>
<joey> might be here for longer is that okay </joey>
<joey> and then we're like okay </joey>
<joey> i'm like then why did you tell me that </joey>
<garnt> was the checkout time like what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> maybe just most japanese people just </joey>
<garnt> don't ask yeah </garnt>
<joey> most japanese people like those are the </joey>
<garnt> rules we must follow same rules i know </garnt>
<connor> it's just wrong they're like really anal </connor>
<connor> about getting their if it says 12 they </connor>
<connor> are so paranoid about checking out after </connor>
<connor> like one minute after twelve years yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i feel that's just like japanese culture </joey>
<connor> in general though like we're very strict </connor>
<joey> on time like yeah every time because </joey>
<connor> nobody has it here but hotels it's like </connor>
<connor> i don't want to be like fighting for my </connor>
<connor> life 10 minutes before check out like </connor>
<connor> yeah just i'll i'll i'll come i'll come </connor>
<joey> 20 minutes after no one's gonna care no </joey>
<joey> one knows give your </joey>
<connor> no one has ever cared man i'm trying to </connor>
<garnt> enjoy this bathtub you gave me you know </garnt>
<garnt> what i mean like come on </garnt>
<garnt> it's like how can you enjoy it when </garnt>
<joey> you're stressed about time and and i </joey>
<connor> guess that's why i'm so </connor>
<joey> like confused as to why people stay in </joey>
<connor> ryokans for like one night because i </connor>
<connor> feel like you need a minimum of two </connor>
<connor> nights to enjoy the experience </connor>
<garnt> three nights if you really just want a </garnt>
<garnt> relaxing weekend or whatever that's </garnt>
<joey> that's that's real privilege in japan </joey>
<joey> yeah like i've never heard of anyone's </joey>
<connor> like a japanese person staying at a </connor>
<connor> dylcon for more than one night because </connor>
<connor> to them it's like because to them that </connor>
<garnt> one night is probably the equivalent to </garnt>
<garnt> like a week to something yeah yeah you </garnt>
<connor> know it's like oh my god finally like a </connor>
<joey> night where i'm not working and just get </joey>
<garnt> to like do whatever the [ __ ] because </garnt>
<garnt> another thing about ryokans is that </garnt>
<garnt> there's like they really pressure you to </garnt>
<garnt> go to breakfast </garnt>
<garnt> i'm already a breakfast guy </garnt>
<garnt> especially not a ryokan breakfast guy </garnt>
<garnt> you know like i don't need a </garnt>
<garnt> three-course meal for breakfast which is </garnt>
<garnt> basically what those breakfasts are </garnt>
<joey> american breakfasts think they're big oh </joey>
<connor> no no </connor>
<connor> breakfast makes american breakfast look </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] tiny yeah death by a thousand </connor>
<joey> bites bro like they just </joey>
<connor> they keep giving you tiny pieces and </connor>
<connor> they keep coming and they keep and they </connor>
<connor> won't stop </connor>
<joey> and you know you know it's over when </joey>
<joey> they finally ask like do you want some </joey>
<connor> tea or coffee but by that point you're </connor>
<connor> already dead yeah they've already </connor>
<garnt> stuffed you yeah you've stuffed it i </garnt>
<garnt> actually felt bad when everyone got mad </garnt>
<garnt> at you about the breakfast tweet in your </garnt>
<garnt> uh and your hotel because it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> like one of the few times i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> i agree with connor </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like yeah yeah i you don't need </garnt>
<connor> that much food for breakfast you really </connor>
<connor> don't </connor>
<joey> i just you know i i'm a simple man for </joey>
<connor> breakfast i don't really eat it i tend </connor>
<connor> to eat it if i've got something big </connor>
<connor> about to happen yeah like yeah yeah you </connor>
<connor> know the cycling special all right yeah </connor>
<garnt> i'll have some breakfast because that's </garnt>
<garnt> just a wise choice yeah you have to </garnt>
<garnt> exercise but if i'm not exercising i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not eating breakfast yeah give me a </garnt>
<connor> cereal bar at most right i'm i'm not </connor>
<connor> really big on it i'd rather have a nicer </connor>
<garnt> lunch yeah i'm not hungry when i wake up </garnt>
<connor> no no i don't know how people can just </connor>
<garnt> wake up and go like yeah i feel like a </garnt>
<garnt> buffet yeah no because like if i have a </garnt>
<joey> big breakfast uh which i'm i've rarely </joey>
<joey> enjoyed the big breakfast because i'm </joey>
<joey> not hungry for breakfast yeah like that </joey>
<joey> means i'm just not gonna eat lunch or </joey>
<joey> that means i'm just gonna get hungry for </joey>
<joey> dinner at this really weird time yeah </joey>
<joey> which is like a bit early for dinner but </joey>
<garnt> like too late for lunch right it like </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] up my eating schedule the worst is </connor>
<garnt> being you know when you like </garnt>
<garnt> you're kind of hungry when you wake up </garnt>
<garnt> because you maybe didn't eat too much </garnt>
<garnt> the night before yeah and then like it </garnt>
<connor> really you really start to get hungry at </connor>
<joey> like 11. that's the worst time because </joey>
<connor> you're like [ __ ] it's too early for </connor>
<joey> lunch but yeah i'm holding out but i </joey>
<joey> don't want breakfast </joey>
<joey> for breakfast i'm holding out here for </joey>
<connor> my goddamn life </connor>
<connor> and uh </connor>
<joey> oh my god i just i think i think what it </joey>
<connor> is is that i i hate the feeling of like </connor>
<garnt> having a food coma before 12 p.m yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's like because you you're just </garnt>
<joey> tired </joey>
<connor> in the morning and i'm like i don't want </connor>
<connor> that do you down a bunch of water when </connor>
<joey> you wake up yes i mean i'm normally full </joey>
<connor> from that as well i i drink </connor>
<connor> a lot of [ __ ] i drink i drink a lot </connor>
<connor> of water you drink water a lot of water </connor>
<garnt> just in general no i i do i i i don't </garnt>
<garnt> see why that's unhealthy </garnt>
<garnt> i'm a [ __ ] hydro homie that's why i </garnt>
<connor> am joey probably welcome to the club </connor>
<connor> i'll probably drink like 500 milliliters </connor>
<joey> of water yeah yeah i i drink at least </joey>
<joey> like minimum two or three years yeah i </joey>
<connor> also just want to get stuck in with my </connor>
<garnt> day like if i need a shower i want to do </garnt>
<garnt> that i go start working right i just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of want to i kind of want to get on </garnt>
<garnt> with my day i don't know i don't really </garnt>
<connor> want to sit around [ __ ] around and just </connor>
<garnt> eat something yeah like like having </garnt>
<garnt> having like a fry up that that means </garnt>
<garnt> something that means it's like a special </garnt>
<garnt> occasion you know it's like i can't have </garnt>
<garnt> a fry up every day i don't even </garnt>
<joey> recommend you have a fry up every day </joey>
<joey> but like even cereal </joey>
<joey> even just cereal to me is just that's a </joey>
<joey> big meal for breakfast yeah to me like i </joey>
<garnt> a lot of people say breakfast is the </garnt>
<garnt> most important meal of the day um i </garnt>
<connor> don't know how accurate that is no </connor>
<connor> that's the [ __ ] cereal companies </connor>
<garnt> the cereal companies have tricked us </garnt>
<garnt> making us think that these [ __ ] carb </garnt>
<connor> monstrosities are necessary i do not </connor>
<connor> need corn flakes and i wake up </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] the most i'll eat for </garnt>
<garnt> breakfast is a single banana </garnt>
<garnt> like i'll have this </garnt>
<garnt> important chemicals in the cornflakes to </garnt>
<connor> turn you gay </connor>
<connor> so they've got the frogs get that's </connor>
<garnt> right frosties only many frosties look </garnt>
<connor> the most i have for breakfast is like a </connor>
<garnt> banana and that's like oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's that's me that's me done yeah </connor>
<connor> i know the fruit companies aren't trying </connor>
<connor> to convince me to freak out </connor>
<joey> big big fruit companies farming </joey>
<joey> corporations </joey>
<joey> well no because it's like the whole </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] uh the whole uh you know the </joey>
<joey> whole the whole chart [ __ ] came from </joey>
<joey> the the pyramid of what you should eat </joey>
<connor> in your day and you should eat this much </connor>
<joey> better oh yeah it's just complete </joey>
<joey> nonsense the food pyramid scheme well </joey>
<joey> yeah and like the whole idea of that you </joey>
<connor> need to eat these uh corn flakes which </connor>
<connor> offers no nutritional value in the </connor>
<joey> morning and stuff like that like wheat </joey>
<joey> was at the bottom right yeah it's like </joey>
<garnt> no it's like no it's not it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> all pioneered by these uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> companies but way back that yeah they </garnt>
<garnt> had an agenda to promote their stuff </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and of course if if if you're the </garnt>
<garnt> kellogg's team you're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> and you you have your scientific </garnt>
<garnt> research team yeah of course you're </garnt>
<joey> gonna be like hey </joey>
<joey> hey uh kellogg's scientific team could </joey>
<joey> you maybe maybe you know i'm not saying </joey>
<joey> to excuse the results but like if there </joey>
<joey> was some kind of correlation that said </joey>
<connor> that callux is good for breakfast yeah </connor>
<joey> really help us out here that would i'm </joey>
<joey> not i'm not saying you should convince </joey>
<joey> the world that fruit loops is healthy or </joey>
<joey> anything you know just like just maybe </joey>
<joey> like a hint </joey>
<connor> that contract for five years is you know </connor>
<connor> not gonna be necessary if no one's </connor>
<garnt> buying cornflakes so uh uh you know i </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> i i don't know what age i just was like </connor>
<connor> no more cereal for me i won't do it i </connor>
<garnt> don't really ever eat cereal anymore i i </garnt>
<connor> wasn't i wasn't brought up in a cereal </connor>
<joey> household so i never got the craving of </joey>
<garnt> it and there's a toast house yeah and </garnt>
<joey> not like cereal to me always tastes like </joey>
<garnt> a sweet like a dessert what do you go </garnt>
<connor> for it depends i will say and i've just </connor>
<connor> shot on cereal for like five minutes </connor>
<joey> yeah but i do like i do like bran flakes </joey>
<joey> i really really like i love brands yeah </joey>
<joey> they're good but like i remember one </joey>
<joey> time </joey>
<garnt> one time as a kid when i discovered </garnt>
<garnt> brown flakes i thought these are so good </garnt>
<garnt> that i just will keep eating them all </garnt>
<garnt> day yeah so i had the whole box in one </garnt>
<connor> day </connor>
<garnt> and uh that was me in cocoa puffs yeah </garnt>
<joey> and uh yeah but bran flakes is like yeah </joey>
<connor> fiber on crack </connor>
<connor> oh lord my toilet activity that day yeah </connor>
<joey> i was </joey>
<joey> i i imagine they they had the they were </joey>
<joey> filming lord of the rings mordor scenes </joey>
<connor> out of my my bathroom than that yeah it </connor>
<joey> was [ __ ] horrible i was nothing </joey>
<joey> so much pain there's nothing worse than </joey>
<connor> an overly fibrous [ __ ] oh my god i was i </connor>
<connor> was scared i was genuinely scared and i </connor>
<connor> was like 12 years old and i was like why </connor>
<connor> do they make them taste so good yeah </connor>
<joey> i've got flakes oh my god yeah i used to </joey>
<joey> have a [ __ ] horrible diet when i was </joey>
<connor> little but everyone does </connor>
<connor> your parents are like yes go on eat </connor>
<connor> those gummies that were made in the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> turtles sewer yeah cause like because </joey>
<joey> like my my parents had no retaliation on </joey>
<joey> giving me my sister like cocoa puffs and </joey>
<joey> like uh fruit loops and like yeah </joey>
<joey> nutrigrain and all the [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> sugary cereals i understand you know now </connor>
<connor> when you're a parent that it's it it </connor>
<connor> seems very difficult because you're </connor>
<connor> already </connor>
<connor> kind of struggling just to get by the </connor>
<connor> last thing you want to do is start like </connor>
<connor> comparing cocoa puffs with you know it </connor>
<garnt> it shuts the kid out for 10 minutes give </garnt>
<connor> them the [ __ ] cocoa puffs right yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah but then later on you're like all </garnt>
<connor> right maybe i shouldn't have given that </connor>
<connor> kids uh four slices of nutella bread </connor>
<connor> everywhere maybe maybe 50 grams of sugar </connor>
<garnt> for breakfast yeah that wasn't a good </garnt>
<garnt> idea i feel like it was a blessing that </garnt>
<connor> i didn't just like i didn't discover </connor>
<connor> nutella until like i wasn't oh yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so so my god if i discovered </connor>
<connor> nutella as a kid which a lot of people </connor>
<garnt> did </garnt>
<garnt> i like my diet would have been destroyed </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> my diet was destroyed because it's like </joey>
<connor> oh okay you had cocoa puffs for </connor>
<connor> breakfast and then my mom would pack </connor>
<connor> nutella sandwiches for lunch </connor>
<connor> and i'm just like how did i not gain a </connor>
<joey> million [ __ ] pounds from you yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah luckily when you're young it's much </joey>
<garnt> easier </garnt>
<joey> young young and asian people for my </joey>
<joey> asian metabolism that's like the life </joey>
<joey> hack right there right exactly i </joey>
<garnt> despised that my mom kept up with like </garnt>
<garnt> what was healthy because it just meant </garnt>
<garnt> that i i never got to eat anything fun </garnt>
<garnt> and all the kids around me always had </garnt>
<garnt> like remember the one there's one kid </garnt>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> unfortunately but he always had </joey>
<garnt> chocolate spread sandwiches okay i </garnt>
<joey> actually that sounds so [ __ ] cool </joey>
<garnt> yeah this man had literal chocolate </garnt>
<connor> bread man i'm out here eating my [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> cheese sandwich like a peasant </joey>
<joey> this man is eating like a king he's </joey>
<joey> getting chocolate spread with his </joey>
<connor> chocolate yogurt bro oh my god </connor>
<connor> his parents unfortunately set him up to </connor>
<connor> fail </connor>
<connor> it was good </connor>
<connor> when i tried it i thought oh this </connor>
<connor> doesn't taste good </connor>
<connor> does it not no chocolate spread doesn't </connor>
<connor> and like chocolate mousse and all that i </connor>
<garnt> didn't really like that yeah and uh i </garnt>
<garnt> think chocolate mousse tastes good </garnt>
<garnt> maybe just because it wasn't normalized </garnt>
<connor> for me i i hardly had it so every time i </connor>
<connor> did have it i'm just like oh i'm having </connor>
<connor> chocolate for a meal this is uh this is </connor>
<connor> a life hack right here this is exciting </connor>
<connor> uh i love cheese strings cheese straight </connor>
<joey> cheeseburgers awesome </joey>
<connor> even now i enjoy eating the chicken yeah </connor>
<joey> she's peeling it off yeah yeah that's </joey>
<joey> the thing i i definitely enjoyed this </joey>
<garnt> process like trying to get it as thin as </garnt>
<joey> possible as well just like like trying </joey>
<joey> to get like that perfect like it's just </joey>
<connor> like oh yeah </connor>
<joey> oh i don't know if they have this do </joey>
<joey> they have oddly satisfying moments yeah </joey>
<joey> southeast asia strings </joey>
<connor> they don't think they do it's just like </connor>
<connor> this like it's it's it's it's all cheese </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's it's it's in all the </garnt>
<garnt> imports it's like supermarkets it's like </garnt>
<connor> not real cheese i don't know how they do </connor>
<garnt> i don't know it's not real cheese but it </garnt>
<garnt> tastes better than real cheese in a </garnt>
<joey> sense but then it doesn't but like it's </joey>
<joey> like cheese flavored plastic it's it's </joey>
<garnt> like playing a mini game to eat cheese </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason that just adds to </garnt>
<garnt> the flavor i don't know why </garnt>
<joey> we've never had it yeah i used to i used </joey>
<garnt> to do this thing when i was little i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if i'm the only one but like </garnt>
<garnt> i would i wouldn't like rip it and then </garnt>
<garnt> immediately eat it yeah i would kind of </garnt>
<joey> rip it and try and like create a perfect </joey>
<connor> pile of like perfectly strung up jesus </connor>
<joey> that's like that's like hannibal </joey>
<joey> and then i like put it in a row and i'm </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> my name is joseph </connor>
<joey> displaying it </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh my gosh never had a cheese never had </garnt>
<connor> it you're missing out you're missing the </connor>
<joey> the flavor is [ __ ] but yeah i feel i </joey>
<garnt> feel if you're an adult and you've never </garnt>
<joey> had string cheese as a kid it's a kind </joey>
<garnt> of a tall hurdle to like get it there </garnt>
<garnt> are some things that i try nowadays in </garnt>
<garnt> japan and i'm like i've never had a </garnt>
<joey> japanese childhood but i feel the </joey>
<joey> childhood in this certain snack you know </joey>
<joey> what i mean like </joey>
<joey> like so some of the stuff we tried in </joey>
<joey> the combini episodes right with uh with </joey>
<connor> that that [ __ ] crisp thing that was </connor>
<connor> like that was just like one big whatsit </connor>
<connor> or whatever my ball oh yeah oh my ball </connor>

<garnt> see myself eating this as a kid oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> they also had like the fishcakes which </connor>
<joey> was vile they're like oh the what the </joey>
<joey> carmelical maybe uh like the fish and </joey>
<connor> cheese or something oh yeah oh yeah yeah </connor>

<joey> damn </joey>
<joey> damn just like just </joey>
<joey> anything that was like of that size i </joey>
<garnt> was just trying to feel yeah like i </garnt>
<garnt> realized there are some things that if </garnt>
<garnt> you didn't grow up with it uh you </garnt>
<connor> probably wouldn't enjoy it like in time </connor>
<garnt> in in thailand we have this snack called </garnt>
<joey> taro which is like yeah taro which is </joey>
<joey> basically just dried fish quiet </joey>
<garnt> southeast asians </garnt>

<garnt> what is it it's just like dried fish </garnt>
<garnt> right it's just </garnt>
<joey> yeah yes it's like it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> because when i think of tower i think of </joey>
<connor> the purple uh like sweet potato i have </connor>

<joey> fish drinks basically fishing like </joey>
<connor> cheese strings but with fish they took </connor>
<connor> the fish </connor>
<connor> yeah they stopped making strings out of </connor>
<joey> everything </joey>

<garnt> bread coming out i'll just put it on top </garnt>
<joey> you know what else is actually good at </joey>
<joey> with is on rice </joey>

<garnt> apparently the guy said it was good so i </garnt>
<garnt> was like all right well if the guy on </garnt>
<garnt> the internet said it was good </garnt>
<garnt> obviously it must be true they must be </garnt>

<connor> jokes i think it doesn't have like an </connor>
<connor> aesthetic that is quite as appealing as </connor>
<connor> future jojo has so much joints has so </connor>
<connor> much style and stuff to go around with </connor>
<connor> it yeah uh but but i think becky is </connor>
<connor> always more [ __ ] stupid </connor>
<joey> as one of those like illustrators where </joey>
<joey> i'm like are you really good at drawing </joey>
<garnt> or are you really [ __ ] so like like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<garnt> there are some scenes where i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> damn that's an amazing shot and then </garnt>
<garnt> other scenes i'm like i don't think this </garnt>
<joey> man has ever seen a human being in his </joey>
<joey> life </joey>
<garnt> because that is not how anatomy works </garnt>
<garnt> it's like you take a character and </garnt>
<garnt> you're like let's make this a muscly </garnt>
<garnt> character and you're like what what </garnt>
<garnt> proportions do you think is reasonable </garnt>
<garnt> reasonable for a muscly character and </garnt>
<garnt> then the author just went all right </garnt>
<garnt> multiply that by ten and then that's the </garnt>
<connor> that's like the every character every </connor>
<connor> single character even the weak </connor>
<connor> characters are like built like bricks </connor>
<garnt> yeah right it's insane and like i could </garnt>
<garnt> tell you some plot points and i will and </garnt>
<garnt> they won't even spoil it for you because </garnt>
<garnt> it won't make any [ __ ] sense right so </garnt>
<joey> at one point during the show the main </joey>
<joey> protagonist becky uh starts shadow </joey>
<joey> boxing right that's my favorite [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> scene is it the mantis so yeah that as </joey>
<joey> well but so he starts </joey>
<joey> this is it's like a 10 year old kid and </joey>
<connor> he's like look i'm going to show you </connor>
<connor> that i'm going to fight an opponent and </connor>
<connor> so he starts fighting the air and then </connor>
<garnt> he starts fighting um mike tyson yeah oh </garnt>
<garnt> this one this one mike tyson appears out </garnt>
<joey> of thin air and mike tyson isn't there </joey>
<garnt> but mike tyson is landing blows </garnt>
<garnt> and then he's fighting him back and then </garnt>
<garnt> the kid can see the spirit of mike tyson </garnt>
<garnt> and then this just happens </garnt>
<connor> and then he's like and then the main </connor>
<connor> character is like oh yeah mike tyson's </connor>
<connor> weak and then he just summons a praying </connor>
<connor> mantis that beats the [ __ ] out of it but </connor>
<connor> then he starts fighting the praying </connor>
<joey> mantis that's imaginary yeah yeah in in </joey>
<connor> a room right like </connor>
<connor> like some military guys like hey come </connor>
<connor> fight and then he's like no and then he </connor>
<connor> just kidnaps george bush and it's like </connor>
<connor> what's going on what is what is going on </connor>
<joey> what is going on he's talking about </joey>
<joey> biscuit oliver right yeah then he </joey>
<connor> kidnaps in this plot he kidnaps george </connor>
<joey> bush yeah so he can go to prison yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but like so then he can beat </joey>
<connor> up all the prisoners why would george </connor>
<connor> bush help you go to prison if if if you </connor>
<joey> kidnap him they would just what does it </joey>
<joey> make any sense i love how bucky just </joey>
<joey> like is so with the times like you know </joey>
<connor> exactly when part three was so </connor>
<connor> watching becky right is like if you only </connor>
<connor> learned about america through trash </connor>
<joey> taste yeah yeah it's literally </joey>
<connor> sure the [ __ ] they they say about it </connor>
<connor> there's this one [ __ ] uh they i i had </connor>
<connor> to pause it because i just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> laughed my ass off </connor>
<connor> and uh this is one point where this </connor>
<connor> american prison guard is about to die </connor>
<connor> and uh the two japanese guys one of them </connor>
<connor> saves the japanese guy saves the </connor>
<connor> american and the other japanese goes why </connor>
<connor> would you save an american he's never </connor>
<connor> going to care about you he's american </connor>
<connor> i just paused it and it was like what </connor>
<connor> what does that mean what is this just </connor>
<joey> like casual like what is this </joey>
<connor> in my country and why would you save an </connor>
<connor> american they wouldn't care about you </connor>
<joey> yes </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> my fa my favorite barkies and though </joey>
<joey> i'll never [ __ ] figure and i can't </joey>
<joey> wait for them to adapt this i think it's </joey>
<garnt> part four uh and it's when uh </garnt>
<connor> barack obama comes out yeah yeah because </connor>
<connor> he gets so in the manga he's like newly </connor>
<connor> elected right so he's like you know the </connor>
<connor> era of when this was written and uh like </connor>
<joey> hama yujirah like the main like the dad </joey>
<joey> guy who's like the most powerful guy </joey>
<joey> he's like he goes to talk to obama </joey>
<joey> because of course he can </joey>
<connor> sit down with any president he wants </connor>
<connor> like the main antagonist could just sit </connor>
<joey> down with anyone yeah just because he's </joey>
<joey> so busy because he's so built it's just </joey>
<joey> like it's safe but like but like obama </joey>
<joey> at first is like i've heard of that man </joey>
<joey> i don't trust him </joey>
<joey> i don't trust him at all but like i need </joey>
<joey> to see is he the real deal i need to see </joey>
<joey> if he's the real deal so then he comes </joey>
<joey> into the room and he's like show me </joey>
<joey> you're the real deal and </joey>
<joey> and use your and eugero goes all right </joey>
<joey> bet and he grabs like a handful of sand </joey>
<connor> and he crushes it in his hand and turns </connor>
<joey> it into a diamond moment </joey>
<joey> i didn't even i didn't even know what </joey>
<joey> he's gonna do </joey>
<joey> and then obama's like you are the real </joey>
<joey> one </joey>
<joey> shakes hands </joey>
<connor> so there's like like this show big </connor>
<joey> muscle if you if you if you haven't </joey>
<connor> watched mackie you like you're honestly </connor>
<garnt> doing yourself at this point it's so fun </garnt>
<garnt> because like get past the start it can </garnt>
<connor> be a little jank but like the anime is </connor>
<garnt> really good it's really funny because </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm surprised that meme culture </garnt>
<joey> just hasn't picked up on bucky memes </joey>
<garnt> right because so much of this is [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> meme i know right like </joey>
<connor> that's one of the things </connor>
<connor> it's so [ __ ] funny so apparently </connor>
<joey> right because these there's these three </joey>
<connor> characters becky uh the the uh yuji </connor>
<joey> rohan yeah and and oliver biscuit the </joey>
<connor> other guy yeah this is three guys that </connor>
<joey> are so dangerous and so powerful because </joey>
<joey> they're muscles right yeah that half of </joey>
<joey> the the gps in the world is is on it's </joey>
<connor> in the air </connor>
<connor> solely to track down </connor>
<connor> it's only the track them in this world </connor>
<connor> right and so whenever they run above two </connor>
<garnt> kilometers an hour the gps has to all </garnt>
<joey> the gps in the world has to stop working </joey>
<joey> yeah just to track these tracks </joey>
<garnt> so and there's a whole section where </garnt>
<connor> they explain that when people are </connor>
<connor> driving or using their phone the gps </connor>
<connor> just doesn't work correctly because some </connor>
<connor> of these characters decided to go for a </connor>
<joey> light jog </joey>
<joey> you can't make this [ __ ] up who thought </joey>
<joey> of this [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> i'm telling you man </connor>
<connor> like that's the thing if people if you </connor>
<joey> thought jojo was ridiculous yeah judges </joey>
<connor> witches it could be as ridiculous as </connor>
<connor> barking at times and you combine that </connor>
<connor> with then also another part in another </connor>
<connor> season where yucha rohana again the main </connor>
<connor> antagonist meets muhammad ali and he and </connor>
<connor> he's he's like you could you can't beat </connor>
<connor> me because you took off to do important </connor>
<connor> human rights things yeah but i respect </connor>
<connor> you because you did that and it's like </connor>
<garnt> what is going on is it one of the </garnt>
<garnt> antagonists like muhammad ali's son yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah but even though he's weaker than </connor>
<connor> him because he went to he he took time </connor>
<connor> about his career yeah to to argue for </connor>
<connor> civil rights yeah great we love you but </connor>
<connor> then muhammad ali jr is just like cocky </connor>
<joey> yeah and then he gets like </joey>
<joey> but then he like but then he like </joey>
<joey> kidnaps like the main like love </joey>
<joey> interesting bucky and then gets beaten </joey>
<joey> up by like five dudes for five days </joey>
<joey> straight just like over and over and </joey>
<joey> over there was also obviously i love </joey>
<joey> where it's like hannah makoda who's like </joey>
<joey> my favorite [ __ ] character he's like </joey>
<joey> he he's like bored so he's just like oh </joey>
<joey> man everyone's weak everyone's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> wait no one can stand up to me except </joey>
<joey> one man humble you you know what i'm </joey>
<joey> gonna go pay him a visit so he goes and </joey>
<joey> pays him a visit he's just like walking </joey>
<connor> down the street and he's like so we're </connor>
<joey> gonna start fighting and he's like right </joey>
<joey> here like yeah </joey>
<joey> that's in the middle of a crowd but then </joey>
<joey> a kid comes up and it's like oh my god </joey>
<joey> eudro i'm a massive fan of you and like </joey>
<joey> hands him like a shkishi right it's like </joey>
<joey> can you sign this </joey>
<joey> and you know normally you think he pulls </joey>
<joey> out a pen does the same no this is a </joey>
<joey> humble user he's built different yeah </joey>
<joey> what he does is he stabs he gets his </joey>
<joey> finger he stabs the shikishi and then </joey>
<joey> slices it into four quarters with his </joey>
<joey> finger until it's like all broken apart </joey>
<joey> and the kid's like </joey>
<joey> oh my god thank you so much and hanayama </joey>
<joey> card is like man i'd be happier with </joey>
<joey> that than a signature for me </joey>
<joey> and i was like what is this and then </joey>
<connor> they start beating the [ __ ] out of each </connor>
<connor> other it's just like it is insane like i </connor>
<connor> i'm sure if you don't know anything </connor>
<joey> about becky that probably sound made no </joey>
<joey> sense and it doesn't make it doesn't </joey>
<joey> make any sense don't mean context </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i still don't quite understand what the </joey>
<connor> story is and i've watched three seasons </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't get the point of course </connor>
<garnt> because i'm like you watch the netflix </garnt>
<connor> season yeah and that's like seasons </connor>
<joey> aren't even the beginning of the story </joey>
<joey> because the netflix seasons are like </joey>
<joey> starting season two yeah it's like a </joey>
<garnt> sequel to an anime or like the manga </garnt>
<garnt> that came out like decades ago and then </garnt>
<connor> it's been going longer yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> mgi has gotten a lot better as well in </connor>
<garnt> the season the cgi is kind of jank in </garnt>
<connor> the first season i think but still watch </connor>
<garnt> it it is really fun i mean i would say </garnt>
<joey> like the animation especially compared </joey>
<joey> to jojo isn't as good but </joey>
<connor> like you don't watch it for the </connor>
<joey> animation you watch it from like the bat </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] crazy scenes it's just like it's </connor>
<connor> just insane how they decide fights and </connor>
<connor> it's like imagine if a world was decided </connor>
<connor> purely by muscle </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like muscles can solve every world </garnt>
<connor> issue in the world guns in this world </connor>
<connor> are meaningless compared to muscles like </connor>
<connor> guns don't do anything guns are a </connor>
<connor> suggestion </connor>
<connor> guns are for normal human beings and </connor>
<connor> they don't operate in the same world </connor>
<garnt> that the characters do like it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> like every single character is an </garnt>
<garnt> avengers level threat that's just that's </garnt>
<connor> just what it is right and </connor>
<garnt> every single time you think you've met </garnt>
<connor> the strongest character no they he they </connor>
<connor> introduce some new character that is </connor>
<joey> even stronger who's the main one in uh </joey>
<garnt> the part three again is it the the </garnt>
<garnt> prehistoric guy is it the first human uh </garnt>
<connor> no no no so so i believe they've done </connor>
<garnt> what they did with the first uh season </garnt>
<garnt> well it's certainly one season split </garnt>
<garnt> into two oh i think that's what they've </garnt>
<joey> done here so the first arc is just </joey>
<joey> through the prison yeah yeah and then </joey>
<joey> the next arc is the prehistoric yeah the </joey>
<joey> pickle right but this this arc opens up </joey>
<connor> with um </connor>
<connor> a press conference from like a safari </connor>
<connor> where </connor>
<connor> like all these people died to this giant </connor>
<connor> mammoth elephant which killed hundreds </connor>
<connor> of people and </connor>
<connor> and uh animals yeah </connor>
<joey> and in this press conference he's like </joey>
<joey> one man killed this this 500 </joey>
<joey> meter tall man well that's what i know </joey>
<joey> like and then like the press conference </joey>
<connor> is like no no no it didn't and then it's </connor>
<garnt> like what is this what is this </garnt>
<garnt> it's so dumb </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i love about bucky is that </garnt>
<connor> every character has such as this batshit </connor>
<connor> crazy backstory yeah that the way they </connor>
<connor> get introduced with this like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> crazy backstory and you have like </connor>
<connor> speedwagon like </connor>
<garnt> basically a narrator just going over </garnt>
<garnt> their entire background doing all these </garnt>
<garnt> like batshit crazy things and you think </garnt>
<garnt> it can't get crazier until it [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> does every time i've like almost caught </joey>
<joey> up to the manga and i'm like how how did </joey>
<joey> they top the first human ever who ever </joey>
<joey> lived who beat a [ __ ] tyrannosaurus </joey>
<joey> rex with his bare hands i i i even </joey>
<joey> though i know sort of what the next arcs </joey>
<joey> are about yeah this is an arc about them </joey>
<connor> fighting prehistoric creatures right </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah we're just like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> they just bring them back to life and </joey>
<joey> they're like let's see if they stand up </joey>
<joey> to the humans today </joey>
<connor> like like like jurassic park instead if </connor>
<connor> they turned in to test the humans </connor>
<connor> instead of like test seeing what the </connor>
<joey> dinosaurs could do it's like let's see </joey>
<joey> what the humans can do against the </joey>
<joey> dinosaurs because humans are humans are </joey>
<joey> too boring in this world yeah apparently </joey>
<joey> because it's just like every you know </joey>
<connor> no normal martial arts master is good </connor>
<connor> enough anymore now yeah but it's just so </connor>
<connor> funny because like the main protagonist </connor>
<connor> which is the main character's dad it's </connor>
<joey> just like that [ __ ] insane and also just </joey>
<connor> hilarious yeah it's just like he's so </connor>
<joey> insane some of the [ __ ] he says it's </joey>
<joey> actually insane and there's just the </joey>
<joey> fact there's a whole whole scene </joey>
<garnt> dedicated to him watching his son having </garnt>
<garnt> sex and that was that was what sold me </garnt>
<garnt> on the first honestly if </garnt>
<garnt> if i can't sell you on becky is that </garnt>
<joey> that there is a scene where he is about </joey>
<joey> to lose his virginity and his dad comes </joey>
<joey> in giving him advice yeah in like the </joey>
<joey> creepiest way uh </joey>
<joey> the fact that people haven't watched </joey>
<connor> this is just mind-blowing he literally </connor>
<joey> squats down next to the bed and says </joey>
<connor> eat her yeah </connor>
<connor> he's like [ __ ] [ __ ] every day drunk </connor>
<joey> every day answer your instincts let your </joey>
<connor> instincts take over become an animal </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] what you want and then top it off </joey>
<joey> bucky turns [ __ ] super saiyan levels </joey>
<joey> up like powerful after he loses his </joey>
<garnt> virginity </garnt>
<garnt> if they have they have like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> because like they actually have sex </garnt>
<joey> and they turn the sex scene into a jojo </joey>
<garnt> fight </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he's just like oh sex sex is like a </garnt>
<connor> battle </connor>
<joey> i'm gonna be honest though it is in real </joey>
<joey> life </joey>
<connor> you're like trying to think of like ten </connor>
<joey> things at once make sure you do it right </joey>
<connor> it's not an accurate sex in the anime </connor>
<connor> change my mind no on top of that right </connor>
<connor> not only is this the hype is sex scene </connor>
<connor> in anime immediately after that you </connor>
<connor> don't need this no [ __ ] goku super </connor>
<joey> saiyan i'm going to save the world this </joey>
<joey> man powered up more than goku ever </joey>
<joey> wishes he could by losing his virginity </joey>
<joey> they these people can sense that this </joey>
<connor> man lost his virginity they did </connor>
<joey> he was he was fighting that's right </joey>
<joey> because one of the prison guys like </joey>
<connor> tries to come off no no not one two </connor>
<connor> before this our main character was so </connor>
<connor> weak that he couldn't face one of these </connor>
<connor> dudes one-on-one yeah after sex two of </connor>
<connor> them come in and they cannot face him </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> this man's aura this man's nan has </connor>
<connor> increased so much from busting a nut </connor>
<joey> that like they can't even think of </joey>
<joey> he somehow developed like hockey power </joey>
<garnt> it's it's it's like gone preen versus </garnt>
<connor> postman </connor>
<connor> it's like if god turned into his dad </connor>
<connor> after nothing it's insane like it's this </connor>

<garnt> episode and then watch the next episode </garnt>
<garnt> and i would like </garnt>

<connor> you get you get on and off time so i </connor>
<connor> normally just i have it down below </connor>
<connor> like on the floor so i do my through my </connor>
<connor> reps and i just kind of watch like one </connor>
<connor> minute and then american next rep and </connor>
<connor> then so that kind of get a balance i </connor>
<joey> can't do that like yeah if i'm doing </joey>
<joey> reps like i need to be like fully </joey>
<connor> concentrated yeah i i need like like it </connor>
<garnt> is really hard to [ __ ] focus when </garnt>
<garnt> they're telling me about this gps </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] just like laughing too much to </garnt>
<connor> do this bucky would be [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> impossible to watch in the gym </connor>
<connor> they're all they're the most muscular </connor>
<joey> men on earth talking about like the </joey>
<joey> insane amount of strength and muscles </joey>
<joey> they have that's my goal right now </joey>
<joey> doing a squat while someone is talking </joey>
<joey> about how they gain their muscles and </joey>
<connor> becky is like the most like pump thing </connor>
<connor> on earth dude like you can't not go for </connor>
<connor> the extra rep you know what that's right </connor>
<connor> it's insane </connor>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<connor> i it is it is kind of difficult i you </connor>
<garnt> kind of have to pick and choose </garnt>
<garnt> now in my head i have like media for the </garnt>
<garnt> gym i'm like this is gym media this is </garnt>
<garnt> stuff that i can watch in the gym </garnt>
<garnt> because i don't care too much about it </garnt>
<garnt> but i want to watch it right right and </garnt>
<connor> if i if i care a lot </connor>
<garnt> i'll stop watching it after one episode </garnt>
<garnt> and save it yeah i know i like it yeah </garnt>
<connor> um and i'll save it for when i want to </connor>
<garnt> watch it if not the secret to getting </garnt>
<garnt> connor to watch anime going to the gym </garnt>
<garnt> basically basically get me to do </garnt>
<garnt> something like that </garnt>
<connor> make me not watch </connor>
<connor> but obviously right now i've i've not </connor>
<garnt> been watching anything at all because </garnt>
<garnt> i've been just watching league of </garnt>
<garnt> legends but yeah so yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> i'm very tired today yeah i had four </garnt>
<joey> hours of sleep because i've been </joey>
<joey> watching league of legends yeah really </joey>
<garnt> good this year sounds like your guy's </garnt>
<joey> problem yeah i would talk about it but </joey>
<garnt> i i know joey's not interested exactly </garnt>
<joey> it's been amazing </joey>
<joey> basically it's been one of the most </joey>
<garnt> hypeles years in the group stage i feel </garnt>
<joey> like i hear that every fight </joey>
<garnt> every year it's like </garnt>
<connor> hardest well they told you league of </connor>
<garnt> legends is probably the only esport i </garnt>
<connor> try to keep up with at least for the </connor>
<connor> worlds um it is really entertaining and </connor>
<joey> uh i'm sure it is if i i'm sure if i </joey>
<garnt> like understood the rules i i think i'd </garnt>
<joey> really get into it as well because i </joey>
<garnt> like watching esports stuff but what i </garnt>
<garnt> actually enjoy about worlds specifically </garnt>
<garnt> worlds is that you get i get the same </garnt>
<garnt> feeling from worlds as i get watching </garnt>
<garnt> like say the world cup or something </garnt>
<garnt> right where like even even in the </garnt>
<garnt> smaller stages you have like really </garnt>
<garnt> small regions and you have like regions </garnt>
<garnt> that are like across the world and even </garnt>
<garnt> though you have like </garnt>
<garnt> certain countries in certain regions </garnt>
<garnt> that are stronger than others </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it still feels like a global </garnt>
<garnt> event where you see fans from all over </garnt>
<garnt> the world especially when we had a crowd </garnt>
<garnt> you know just like cheering for even </garnt>
<garnt> like teams that are not so well known </garnt>
<garnt> that are like up-and-coming regions and </garnt>
<garnt> i really like i love that in sporting </garnt>
<garnt> events when it's when it's not just like </garnt>
<garnt> one kind of country but it's like a </garnt>
<joey> global kind of event well but that's </joey>
<joey> what i mean right it's like i feel like </joey>
<garnt> league for me would be like any other </garnt>
<joey> sport that i just don't know the rules </joey>
<garnt> of like i feel like once you teach me </garnt>
<joey> the rules of like what's going on like </joey>
<connor> how you know what's a good play what's </connor>
<connor> that problem is you need to learn how to </connor>
<joey> play league yeah yeah right but i don't </joey>
<joey> want to do that yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like you know it's like again </joey>
<joey> like learning any sport right it's like </joey>
<joey> once you know the rules i think you can </joey>
<joey> have a really fun time of just watching </joey>
<joey> it because watching and playing is </joey>
<garnt> totally different yeah because that </garnt>
<garnt> that's the reason i got into league as </garnt>
<garnt> an esport as opposed to like maybe like </garnt>
<garnt> i i remember trying to get into the </garnt>
<garnt> overwatch esports scene [ __ ] me and oh </garnt>
<garnt> my god like the game aside which i don't </garnt>
<joey> think is as good of a spectator sport as </joey>
<joey> say league or something like i remember </joey>
<joey> uh i went to an event with uh with our </joey>
<joey> mates and i found out that you know they </joey>
<joey> had teams from like different cities </joey>
<joey> from across the world right yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it's really upset yeah yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> they were like oh my god they have a </joey>
<joey> team from london i can't remember what </joey>
<joey> the exact name was spitfire london </joey>
<joey> spitfire they had a team from london </joey>
<joey> spitfire i was like great we've got some </joey>
<joey> representation for the uk and london and </joey>
<joey> i remember the team walks out and </joey>
<joey> everyone is korean and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> what </joey>
<garnt> why would you lie to me like this why </garnt>
<garnt> would you lie to me i'm really confused </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't understand it but it's like a </garnt>
<joey> franchise model </joey>
<joey> you know like football teams where yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah you sell the slot to whoever does </connor>
<connor> it but </connor>
<joey> they have so i guess there was no </joey>
<connor> londoner who was good that wasn't </connor>
<garnt> not a single londoner to my knowledge </garnt>
<garnt> the way that overwatch had done it is </garnt>
<connor> that they had these team names decided </connor>
<connor> yeah that you could buy in and you would </connor>
<connor> give i don't know if you could choose </connor>
<connor> but yeah it kind of ruined it because </connor>
<connor> you know as much as you know i'm you </connor>
<connor> know league of legends has so many </connor>
<connor> you're allowed to bring in foreign </connor>
<garnt> imports yeah um but there's like a </garnt>
<garnt> maximum cap to how many people you can </garnt>
<connor> import from other countries that's right </connor>
<connor> you know if you're rooting for europe </connor>
<garnt> yeah you would like to see european </garnt>
<joey> people yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<joey> it's like a japanese rugby team at one </joey>
<joey> point where there were less japanese </joey>
<joey> plays than there were actually </joey>
<connor> there was a japanese team that qualified </connor>
<connor> for the main event and that's the first </connor>
<connor> time the first time i ever happened in </connor>
<connor> history because no one in japan gives a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] about league of legends so this </connor>
<connor> like really small [ __ ] team qualified </connor>
<joey> for the main event and i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] it this is the anime plot line </garnt>
<connor> right here what the [ __ ] why am i </connor>
<garnt> watching anime i think it's got a strong </garnt>
<joey> niche here but it just struggles because </joey>
<garnt> there's not a big pc culture here no no </garnt>
<connor> unfortunately and i i don't really see a </connor>
<joey> pc culture taking off anytime it's </joey>
<joey> but it's i don't think it's like </joey>
<connor> dedicated to games like lee yeah i think </connor>
<garnt> it's just mobile gaming is just too </garnt>
<connor> massive here it is yeah um for like </connor>
<connor> people because as we said people don't </connor>
<connor> have time but like stuff like apex is </connor>
<joey> blowing up so i think that's been a real </joey>
<garnt> big push for pc i think apex is like </garnt>
<garnt> v-tubers so yeah that's like that </garnt>
<connor> yeah apex is doing very well and v-tube </connor>
<connor> is only just especially at least in </connor>
<connor> japan very much pushed it yeah i think </connor>
<joey> because i think before that like the </joey>
<connor> biggest pc game we had here was like pub </connor>
<connor> g [ __ ] oh yeah yeah but and like that </connor>
<connor> was like the best in the dirt and i </connor>
<connor> think that was like the biggest it had </connor>
<joey> ever gotten in japan in terms of like a </joey>
<connor> pc game </connor>
<connor> pc like bangs are popping up a bit in </connor>
<garnt> japan they are </garnt>
<garnt> pc cafe gaming cafes </garnt>
<garnt> because we had them in london but there </garnt>
<connor> was one um and it was so goddamn </connor>
<connor> expensive yeah yeah it was like 15 an </connor>
<connor> hour what yeah and it was it's like </connor>
<garnt> it's it's i understand that you you know </garnt>
<garnt> you're a business you've got to make </garnt>
<garnt> money and london real estate isn't cheap </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but also you know that it has to </garnt>
<connor> come up maybe a reasonable amount i've </connor>
<connor> got a pc at home </connor>
<garnt> come on like five bucks an hour i'll buy </garnt>
<joey> food i promise i'll buy food you know </joey>
<garnt> you know i i don't yeah yeah yeah it </garnt>
<connor> seems like a bit of a rip it's a bit too </connor>
<connor> much because yeah if i want to have a </connor>
<connor> full gaming session with the boys in the </connor>
<connor> cafe yeah i spent like a hundred bucks </connor>
<connor> yeah right yeah and bro i can but if i </connor>
<connor> want to play like what about the entire </connor>
<connor> steam library for that yeah what if i </connor>
<garnt> want to play like a game of like civ 2 </garnt>
<garnt> which is like 12 hours </garnt>
<joey> of rip then yeah it's like 300 dollars </joey>
<connor> for a game it's like what the [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> i think in countries like korea it's a </connor>
<connor> lot more affordable because they rely </connor>
<garnt> more on like you buying food and drinks </garnt>
<connor> and stuff which i would prefer i'll buy </connor>
<garnt> food and drink if yeah exactly </garnt>
<connor> because i feel like in the uk it's like </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's a strange concept you </connor>
<garnt> know it is yeah in korea it's just a </garnt>
<connor> normal way to socialize yeah well yeah i </connor>
<connor> noticed that in korea it was at north </connor>
<garnt> korea in the uk uh it was either uh </garnt>
<garnt> chinese students who were there all day </garnt>
<garnt> yeah where it was kind of like uh </garnt>
<connor> british people who would be like oh </connor>
<connor> we'll play pc for an hour </connor>
<joey> gaming outside the house </joey>
<joey> what's all this switch is it like the </joey>
<joey> switch on mario </joey>
<connor> unless you're a rich foreign student i </connor>
<connor> don't know you should be there all day </connor>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<connor> it's a shame really because i would i </connor>
<connor> would love to game in a pcb that's </connor>
<garnt> that's why that's why we want to go to </garnt>
<garnt> korea yeah i mean we don't really want </garnt>
<garnt> to go we've been saying this before </garnt>
<connor> but we've always just wanted to spend </connor>
<connor> like 12 hours a day gaming in a that's </connor>
<joey> my idea of a vacation sounds great </joey>
<connor> sounds like an amazing vacation to me </connor>
<garnt> turn off my phone just game yeah look at </garnt>
<connor> me just game just game should get some </connor>
<garnt> toxic gaming in there yeah because i i </garnt>
<connor> realized how like small </connor>
<garnt> like how unpopular pc gaming was in </garnt>
<garnt> japan when i actually joined the </garnt>
<connor> japanese league of legend servers and i </connor>
<connor> was just like great join a japanese </connor>
<connor> league of legend servers perfect way to </connor>
<connor> practice my japanese and game at the </connor>
<connor> same time yeah a little did i realize </connor>
<garnt> until like about like 50 games in no one </garnt>
<garnt> on the japanese league of legend server </garnt>
<garnt> speaks japanese no it's all chinese </garnt>
<garnt> everyone speaks chinese or english right </garnt>
<garnt> because no one japanese is playing the </garnt>
<garnt> japanese service ever it's just like </garnt>
<connor> chinese chinese people smurfing on the </connor>
<connor> chinese people just go to like have fun </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and what i realized is that it's the </garnt>
<connor> most toxic server in the world that i've </connor>
<connor> been to that's because no one japanese </connor>
<connor> is playing yeah it's so it's all smurfs </connor>
<connor> from other countries just like </connor>
<connor> just like being toxic on the server </connor>
<connor> um so yeah i can see why japanese like </connor>
<garnt> especially with league at least why it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't so popular in japan </garnt>
<garnt> apex is a different deal but uh </garnt>
<garnt> basically the secret to getting a game </garnt>
<garnt> popular in japan i guess is just to </garnt>
<garnt> appeal to vcu right just put some gotcha </garnt>
<garnt> in him </garnt>
<joey> put some gotcha in league and you're all </joey>
<connor> good you've got the japanese market oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's a good social game as </garnt>
<garnt> well it's very easy to hop in and play a </garnt>
<garnt> few games </garnt>
<garnt> if you ever guys want to yeah one day </garnt>
<garnt> one i saw you playing minecraft the </garnt>
<connor> other day yeah exactly yeah i'm i'm </connor>
<garnt> so disappointed you started without me </garnt>
<connor> what do you mean i was invited you guys </connor>
<garnt> didn't ask me come on self boys i saw </garnt>
<garnt> you dying in the lava like five times </garnt>
<joey> listen we don't talk about it yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah we'll play minecraft yeah i've got </garnt>
<connor> to get myself situated first because </connor>
<joey> i've recently just moved as well it was </joey>
<connor> a new place was good it was an </connor>
<connor> interesting uh moving experience mostly </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> of all the [ __ ] that uh sydney has built </garnt>
<garnt> up over the years </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> okay so we hired the same moving company </garnt>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> uh so there's this main guy and he knows </garnt>
<garnt> that we're youtubers because he moved uh </garnt>
<garnt> he moved all the trash all the trash day </garnt>
<garnt> stuff right um i don't think he was </garnt>
<garnt> prepared like he knew that we were anime </garnt>
<garnt> fans right but i don't think he was </garnt>
<garnt> prepared for some of the stuff that </garnt>
<garnt> sydney had like just within her closet </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> i remember so poor man yeah before </garnt>
<garnt> before </garnt>
<garnt> so before before they do the move they </garnt>
<garnt> also have to like scout the place just </garnt>
<garnt> to see what they have to move and how </garnt>
<garnt> many trucks they have to rent out and </garnt>
<garnt> sydney sydney was just like you know </garnt>
<garnt> what i know the stuff i know my room's a </garnt>
<garnt> bit of a bit of a nuclear like wasteland </garnt>
<garnt> right now you know i'm gonna clean it up </garnt>
<garnt> a bit right so what she does is she uh </garnt>
<garnt> takes off all like the lewd posters off </garnt>
<garnt> the wall right she's like i'm gonna i'm </garnt>
<garnt> cleaning up my room right now she's not </garnt>
<garnt> gonna notice cleaning up clear cleaning </garnt>
<garnt> up my room so she takes off all the loot </garnt>
<garnt> posters thinking she's got a job done </garnt>
<garnt> i've got nothing to worry about </garnt>
<garnt> what she forgets </garnt>
<garnt> right is there's no posters on the wall </garnt>
<garnt> but there's just a massive pile of sex </garnt>
<joey> toys in the corner </joey>
<joey> that she just somehow forgot about </joey>
<joey> you really know how numb she is to that </joey>
<joey> kind of [ __ ] now right where it's like </joey>
<joey> oh yeah there's nothing wrong with that </joey>
<joey> right yeah </joey>
<connor> right there and it's the 10 kilogram </connor>
<connor> boobs that are just uh lying on the </connor>
<joey> floor so she forgets to hide that but </joey>
<joey> she takes soft the slightly lewd posters </joey>
<connor> off the wall </connor>
<joey> this is distasteful </joey>
<joey> so the guy opens the door and is greeted </joey>
<garnt> by just the 10 kilogram boobs that is </garnt>
<garnt> just sitting on her desk </garnt>
<garnt> that she somehow just forgot about </garnt>
<connor> absolutely </connor>
<connor> he probably wanted to like get out of </connor>
<garnt> there </garnt>
<connor> yeah and uh yeah so </connor>
<connor> i'll figure after we get everything </connor>
<connor> packed up obviously he like they they </connor>
<connor> hired different people uh so he he's </connor>
<connor> seen all this before but obviously his </connor>
<connor> employees haven't seen this right oh no </connor>
<connor> and uh so they have to they have to pack </connor>
<connor> everything up right and um so </connor>
<connor> uh how it was they packed everything up </connor>
<connor> there were about like four men just </connor>
<connor> loading learning stuff into the two </connor>
<connor> trucks that we had uh sydney stayed </connor>
<connor> behind </connor>
<garnt> um sydney stayed behind to clean up the </garnt>
<garnt> place after we'd all we were all driving </garnt>
<garnt> to our new place to unpack everything um </garnt>
<garnt> and i sat with them in one of the vans </garnt>
<garnt> and i sat with them with two of them and </garnt>
<garnt> two of them weren't the main guys they </garnt>
<garnt> were just one of their employees yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just like it was like a good </garnt>
<joey> 15 20 minutes of silence right </joey>
<garnt> and uh we were just driving along yeah </garnt>
<connor> and each and the guy next to me just </connor>
<garnt> goes </garnt>
<garnt> so interesting stuff you got there </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like oh oh my god and i know so </garnt>

<joey> it like you couldn't have just put in </joey>
<garnt> like the moving box </garnt>
<garnt> we let the movers pack a lot because </garnt>
<joey> what i did with all my loot [ __ ] is that </joey>
<garnt> i packed it in a box separately before </garnt>
<joey> the moving people came so they had no </joey>
<joey> idea of all the curse [ __ ] i have in my </joey>
<connor> house </connor>
<garnt> i'm trying to pack as much stuff as i </garnt>
<garnt> could but there's too much stuff yeah i </garnt>
<connor> just because when they pack stuff i just </connor>
<connor> lost track of everything i was like i </connor>
<connor> don't know which box everything's in </connor>
<garnt> yeah i tried to like i tried to like </garnt>
<garnt> help them and like try to keep track of </garnt>
<garnt> everything and then like about two hours </garnt>
<garnt> in you realize i don't know where </garnt>
<connor> anything is anymore yeah and so like </connor>
<connor> even like a month after i was like which </connor>
<garnt> box is that one specific thing i need </garnt>
<connor> him i tear up in all the boxes can't </connor>
<garnt> find it i'm like well i'm [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i still haven't found my </garnt>
<garnt> wireless headphones uh which is </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere in one of the boxes um i i </garnt>
<garnt> like you forget about the little items </garnt>
<garnt> that you kind of need in day-to-day life </garnt>
<garnt> um until you're staring at about 20 </garnt>
<garnt> boxes in front of you and you realize </garnt>
<garnt> that oh this this one thing is in one of </garnt>
<joey> these boxes i guess how does that happen </joey>
<joey> every time i swear like it doesn't </joey>
<joey> matter who i ask how far they're moving </joey>
<garnt> how much stuff they have every move </garnt>
<garnt> items just like go into like some donny </garnt>
<garnt> darko [ __ ] happens where it just like </garnt>
<garnt> disappears into a void on the way it's </garnt>
<garnt> like because like you you you look at it </garnt>
<garnt> because i had that as well where i was </garnt>
<garnt> like okay i'm missing like two or three </garnt>
<garnt> items at least yeah i went back to the </garnt>
<garnt> old house obviously not there ring up </garnt>
<garnt> the moving company they say they don't </garnt>
<garnt> have it i'm like well then where the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] did it go you're not going to tell </garnt>
<garnt> me it's in one of these boxes because </garnt>
<connor> you open it all up and it's still not </connor>
<garnt> there yeah yeah i'm like what did i do </garnt>
<connor> with it where did it go man i miss </connor>
<garnt> moving as a student you just had like </garnt>
<connor> two suitcases yeah yeah exactly right </connor>
<garnt> like you just chuck everything away you </garnt>
<garnt> don't need because the thing is when </garnt>
<garnt> you're moving when you have like an </garnt>
<connor> apartment and stuff you just forget how </connor>
<connor> much [ __ ] just is hidden yeah so so you </connor>
<connor> pass </connor>
<connor> such a nightmare yeah you packed the big </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] and you're like oh i'm like 80 done </connor>
<garnt> then somehow you add another three hours </garnt>
<garnt> of packing on top of that because </garnt>
<garnt> there's so just so much [ __ ] that's just </garnt>
<connor> accumulated </connor>
<connor> randomly i was surprised how much [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> was in my kitchen yeah yeah yeah but i </connor>
<connor> thought my kitchen was like two two </connor>
<connor> boxes three boxes yeah yeah it was like </connor>
<connor> 15 boxes just kitchen [ __ ] i'm like </connor>
<connor> how is this </connor>
<connor> what </connor>
<connor> why do i own so many spoons and plates </connor>
<connor> what is this </connor>
<joey> i didn't know i owned that much [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah i'm like why do i have like four </connor>
<joey> different types of plates i don't know i </joey>
<joey> only use one it's because you like go </joey>
<connor> deep into like coppers that you open </connor>
<connor> like once every like a couple of months </connor>
<connor> and it's like oh okay i didn't realize i </connor>
<joey> had </joey>
<joey> 17 bottles of [ __ ] dishwashing liquid </joey>
<connor> just like sitting back there yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> oh dude man getting rid of all the </connor>
<garnt> cardboard after moving was done don't </garnt>
<garnt> talk to me about that i don't talk to </garnt>
<connor> you about 19 000 i probably had a </connor>
<connor> japanese forest worth of cardboard in my </connor>
<joey> apartment at one point luckily the </joey>
<joey> service we ordered they took all the </joey>
<joey> cardboard with them because they </joey>
<joey> unpacked it all for us </joey>
<connor> but doesn't that doesn't that service </connor>
<connor> cost like 10 grand yeah but we were </connor>
<garnt> sponsored yeah i know yeah yeah [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> wow nice nice for some nice for some i </garnt>
<connor> just haven't </connor>
<connor> i just can't in good faith pay 10 grand </connor>
<joey> for them to move my stuff oh no if i </joey>
<joey> didn't get sponsored by it i wouldn't </joey>
<connor> pay for it i just yeah like the one that </connor>
<connor> they charged me like two i think two </connor>
<connor> grand yeah which i was like </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> okay yeah okay that makes sense i guess </connor>
<connor> it's a full day of work it's a full tank </connor>
<joey> it's a truck you're like talking </joey>
<joey> yourself out of it </joey>
<connor> you're throwing away stuff too yeah that </connor>
<joey> makes sense </joey>
<joey> okay it makes it somewhere </joey>
<joey> somewhere you know </joey>
<garnt> they gotta make a profit man this guy </garnt>
<joey> you know um but struggling out here </joey>
<connor> uh yes i saw your moving company someone </connor>
<connor> was moving into my building </connor>
<connor> and it was like the whole place had been </connor>
<connor> like taken over by them there was like </connor>
<joey> 15 of them yeah yeah like like the </joey>
<connor> elevator and like the outsiders </connor>
<connor> no wonder they cost like 10 grand they </connor>
<connor> they've got the whole dark goddamn </connor>
<connor> japanese workforce here doing their </connor>
<joey> stuff </joey>
<joey> they really they really are like i don't </joey>
<joey> know why i guess they're really prideful </joey>
<joey> of their company or something but like </joey>
<joey> they love plastering their logo all over </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] i mean it works it seemed </connor>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] yeah it seemed like a </garnt>
<garnt> military operation yeah it's like it's </garnt>
<joey> like that scene from the anime where </joey>
<joey> they called the sdf they're like oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<garnt> get the sdf down here man this the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> this is </joey>
<connor> man if you've got a family you got kids </connor>
<connor> and [ __ ] and you're doing pretty well </connor>
<joey> for yourself i get it i [ __ ] trying to </joey>
<joey> move with my kids like </joey>
<joey> i would like i would not want to be in </joey>
<joey> my situation that i was in plus kids </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i understand that it's like </joey>
<joey> yeah just bring in the [ __ ] sas bring </joey>
<connor> in the marines yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> bring in john cena to do it like i i i </joey>
<joey> do not want or especially if you were </joey>
<connor> you know like you know in your 60s 70s </connor>
<connor> 80s oh god yeah </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> as you get older you know you won't be </connor>
<connor> moving nearly as often you know i still </connor>
<garnt> don't know if i'm going to move in two </garnt>
<connor> years four years you know but once i'm </connor>
<garnt> like 40. i'm probably going to be </garnt>
<connor> staying there for a good amount of time </connor>
<garnt> yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> wow that is a late time to settle down </garnt>
<connor> yeah brian's setting anytime soon are </connor>
<garnt> you kidding me i know i i i get you </garnt>
<garnt> unless i become a billionaire hedge fund </garnt>
<garnt> man then i'll just buy 15 properties and </garnt>
<garnt> live in whichever wherever </garnt>
<joey> sweet i want to </joey>
<joey> maybe fly </joey>
<garnt> one day these stocks are gonna turn </garnt>
<garnt> green and i tell you man i tell you </garnt>
<garnt> you can't settle down if you're settled </garnt>
<garnt> in five different countries at the same </garnt>
<connor> time </connor>
<connor> the grain big brain </connor>
<connor> because i i'm still going through that </connor>
<connor> phase where i'm like i'm in my 30s now i </connor>
<connor> should probably think about where i want </connor>
<garnt> to settle down but </garnt>
<connor> that just like that just like terrifies </connor>
<connor> me i feel like settling down is when </connor>
<connor> you're </connor>
<connor> you know you know when you're stopped </connor>
<garnt> when you're working in a place that you </garnt>
<garnt> feel like it's gonna be your end home i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think i'm gonna live in japan </garnt>
<garnt> forever no um i can't speak the goddamn </garnt>
<joey> language </joey>
<garnt> and even if i did i'm like would i want </garnt>
<connor> to raise a kid here probably not yeah um </connor>
<garnt> so i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there's like a lot of there's a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of different factors that go into like </garnt>
<garnt> my long-term settlement like where i </garnt>
<garnt> would want to settle down like i i do </garnt>
<garnt> like asian culture and you know </garnt>
<garnt> i do like live in japan but a big thing </garnt>
<garnt> about asia is that i don't want my kids </garnt>
<garnt> to go to school here because my god they </garnt>
<garnt> put so much pressure on exams and </garnt>
<garnt> schooling here that i'm just like this </garnt>
<connor> is this is too much this is too much i </connor>
<connor> remember i saw a post that was on </connor>
<connor> facebook you know japan per capita has </connor>
<joey> like the least exams of any country and </joey>
<joey> it was like before high school yeah and </joey>
<joey> i was like i was like oh that's great </joey>
<connor> yeah so just let them be happy until age </connor>
<joey> 12 and then just [ __ ] them together </joey>
<joey> they're really happy and it's like give </joey>
<joey> them heaven for about 12 years and then </joey>
<joey> give them hell for the next three that </joey>
<garnt> make that makes so much sense because </garnt>
<garnt> japanese kids are like so [ __ ] cute </garnt>
<garnt> you're like whenever you see school kids </garnt>
<joey> they're so nice say hello you know they </joey>
<joey> they just they're just so inquisitive </joey>
<joey> and everything and then like they </joey>
<joey> suddenly it's like it's before they </joey>
<joey> learn right now it's just like a flip </joey>
<joey> but i swear like every japanese teenager </joey>
<joey> goes to the same moody teenager face oh </joey>
<joey> yeah like it's it's like there is no </joey>
<garnt> exception </garnt>
<garnt> i'm telling you kids get cocky when they </garnt>
<connor> learn racism </connor>
<connor> as it is right it's like </connor>
<connor> it's just like because i can tell like </connor>
<connor> because you know sometimes with japanese </connor>
<connor> kids right just from looking at them you </connor>
<connor> don't know how old these some of these </connor>
<connor> kids are like there are some like 10 </connor>
<connor> year olds that look 30 and there are </connor>
<connor> some 30 year olds that look 10. yeah you </connor>
<connor> know so and but like you can always tell </connor>
<connor> though when it's like a middle school </connor>
<connor> japanese kid and a high school japanese </connor>
<connor> kid not from their looks but from their </connor>
<connor> attitude how happy they are yeah how </connor>
<connor> happy they are </connor>
<connor> yeah and just from their attitude </connor>
<connor> towards how i guess they like talk to </connor>
<connor> foreigners i guess in a sense like high </connor>
<connor> school students are very scared of </connor>
<connor> talking yeah they are but middle school </connor>
<garnt> and like elementary school japanese kids </garnt>
<garnt> love talking to people </garnt>
<connor> trying to coach children in the street </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i'm not going around going </connor>
<joey> like hello to every child but yeah like </joey>
<garnt> in my older shoes in my old apartment </garnt>
<garnt> the only people who would ever like </garnt>
<joey> converse with me are like the little </joey>
<joey> kids yeah whenever i get stuck in the </joey>
<joey> lift and i'm like oh what do you want to </joey>
<garnt> go to where did you come from where did </garnt>
<joey> you go i'm just like </joey>
<joey> what is going on they love talking to </joey>
<joey> and then i don't know what happens </joey>
<joey> something in high school happens where </joey>
<joey> they just suddenly become paranoid of </joey>
<connor> foreign </connor>
<connor> they ruin their life yeah i guess yeah </connor>
<connor> and then with the expectations but you </connor>
<joey> also know but you also know which high </joey>
<joey> school student dropped out because </joey>
<joey> they're very happy yeah yeah they're </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah hello how are you yes i'm </joey>
<joey> not in school anymore doing really good </joey>
<joey> for myself thank you very much don't </joey>
<joey> have to go through 17 exams a year i </joey>
<connor> just wouldn't want my kid going through </connor>
<connor> the system yeah yeah same yeah also if </connor>
<connor> japanese banks are like this god knows </connor>
<connor> god knows what the rules are like were </connor>
<joey> japanese schools </joey>
<joey> oh my lord i think it depends like being </joey>
<connor> a parent having to deal with it it's </connor>
<connor> like i think i think though it depends </connor>
<connor> heavily on the school that you go to </connor>
<connor> like obviously like i think public </connor>
<connor> schools definitely have it the worst i </connor>
<connor> think that's the same with any country </connor>
<connor> out there uh but you know if you go to </connor>
<connor> like if you take your kids like a </connor>
<connor> private school or even an international </connor>
<joey> school like i think it gets a little bit </joey>
<connor> better yeah probably </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> i don't plan on having kids anytime soon </connor>
<garnt> no i mean either that's that's that's a </garnt>
<garnt> problem for like future me to figure out </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's a trash taste episode 5000 i </connor>
<garnt> think yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> definitely </garnt>
<connor> episode five thousand terry's kids [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> himself in school </connor>
<connor> am i right </connor>
<garnt> can you relate </garnt>
<connor> uh so i went fishing this weekend i know </connor>
<joey> i know we were talking about a trash </joey>
<connor> chase fishing special i'm sorry guys i </connor>
<joey> can't believe you'd do that too </joey>
<joey> where the [ __ ] was my invite ask me lynn </joey>
<garnt> maylin was one who invited me mainly </garnt>
<joey> what the [ __ ] i play i blame </joey>
<joey> i trusted you maylene </joey>
<garnt> yeah melin just uh invited us uh me and </garnt>
<garnt> cindy if uh we wanted to have like a </garnt>
<joey> kind of kind of like a double date where </joey>
<joey> uh we go fishing together and uh </joey>
<garnt> i've really [ __ ] enjoyed it i look </garnt>
<joey> like you're enjoying it like you're </joey>
<joey> about to shoot yourself on the boat oh </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah so like okay so this is </garnt>
<garnt> like so this is the first time where i </garnt>
<garnt> went sea fishing so it wasn't like it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't uh fishing in a river or a lake </garnt>
<garnt> which i've done before </garnt>
<connor> before uh so </connor>
<connor> so it is it is an entirely different </connor>
<connor> experience right mostly because </connor>
<connor> i've never been seasick in my life right </connor>
<joey> and we were talking about this so on the </joey>
<joey> journey up there everyone's like oh does </joey>
<joey> anyone here get seasick which is if you </joey>
<joey> get seasick and you're about to go </joey>
<joey> fishing on the sea probably a bad idea </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but none of us had ever been </joey>
<joey> seasick before so we're like great </joey>
<joey> fishing on a c easy um what we didn't </joey>
<joey> realize is what i didn't realize is that </joey>
<garnt> when you're actively doing doing things </garnt>
<garnt> and having to concentrate things on top </garnt>
<garnt> of being on the sea and being on the </garnt>
<garnt> edge of a boat it like amps up your sea </garnt>
<garnt> sickness to 10 so this is the first time </garnt>
<garnt> i'd ever felt queasy on a boat right </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> but i mean the uh the entire thing was </garnt>
<connor> like aside from having to deal with the </connor>
<connor> seasickness it was it was pretty damn </connor>
<connor> fun so what happened is we </connor>
<connor> uh we went down to yokohama and we went </connor>
<connor> to the port there </connor>
<connor> and so we are they we have they have </connor>
<joey> this package where you basically go out </joey>
<joey> to sea for about four hours </joey>
<joey> i think it was like yeah about about </joey>
<joey> four years yeah decent amount of time </joey>
<joey> and basically whatever you catch you can </joey>
<joey> keep and you can do whatever you want </joey>
<joey> with the fish so back when i went </joey>
<joey> fishing </joey>
<joey> in wisconsin we have whatever we call we </joey>
<joey> could only keep a certain amount but </joey>
<garnt> here you can like keep whatever you want </garnt>
<garnt> and you can cook them afterwards as well </garnt>
<garnt> um and so yeah so we went out to see um </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember at the beginning </garnt>
<garnt> so it was me sydney maylin and marky </garnt>
<garnt> right and </garnt>
<garnt> so obviously it was our first time so </garnt>
<garnt> the fishman was trying to teach us how </garnt>
<garnt> it was done yeah right and within the </garnt>
<garnt> first hour malin catches two immediately </garnt>
<garnt> right and she's she's just she's just on </garnt>
<garnt> fire right now she's like i'm a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> natural i'm a [ __ ] natural imagine </garnt>
<garnt> how smart yeah she was so [ __ ] smug </garnt>
<joey> uh didn't catch anything for the rest of </joey>
<joey> the trip </joey>
<joey> it's like karma compilation yeah </joey>
<joey> and like and like on the opposite side </joey>
<joey> of things which was sydney and while </joey>
<joey> melin was like catching her first two </joey>
<joey> with him now sydney was like struggling </joey>
<joey> to get like the real down right like </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> the the fisherman was like next to her </joey>
<joey> for like a full-on hour like explaining </joey>
<joey> to her then explaining her to her again </joey>
<joey> yeah and like like here he was like </joey>
<joey> eagle-eyed on her just trying trying to </joey>
<garnt> make sure that she was doing everything </garnt>
<garnt> correctly because she was not getting </garnt>
<garnt> any catches </garnt>
<garnt> um and then somehow like after an hour </garnt>
<garnt> in she just starts [ __ ] reeling and </garnt>
<garnt> fish like it's no business she starts </garnt>
<garnt> catching like four or five fish at the </garnt>
<joey> end of it learns the controls </joey>
<joey> can finally play the game </joey>
<garnt> and then there's maki uh which uh poga </garnt>
<garnt> who's maiden's husband mackie a poor guy </garnt>
<joey> caught i uh i think i think he caught </joey>
<joey> like one fish at the end and so did i i </joey>
<joey> actually no actually i caught like three </joey>
<joey> or four but most of them were two well </joey>
<joey> that's very different to one </joey>
<joey> i caught one fish that i could keep and </joey>
<garnt> the rest were just like too small to </garnt>
<joey> even like to even be worth right now </joey>
<garnt> right kills babies because stabs them </garnt>
<joey> throughout because because maki </joey>
<joey> unfortunately was like way too seasick </joey>
<joey> to be able to function for most of the </joey>
<joey> trip yeah which </joey>
<joey> which is the thing where melin </joey>
<joey> uh melin also was seasick and so was i </joey>
<joey> to be fair uh but </joey>
<joey> mainland being male in was didn't want </joey>
<joey> to admit it because uh she she uh she </joey>
<joey> was like really silent after about an </joey>
<joey> hour and she was just sitting down and i </joey>
<joey> was like man you're right and she was </joey>
<joey> like yep yep i'm cool i'm just i'm just </joey>
<joey> uh just a little bit tired a little bit </joey>
<connor> tired uh she told me afterwards that she </connor>
<connor> just didn't want to admit she was </connor>
<joey> seasick in case like me or cindy would </joey>
<joey> be like oh no little baby </joey>
<connor> your medicine for seasickness yeah you </connor>
<joey> can you can </joey>
<joey> which we totally would have done anyway </joey>
<joey> but as soon as soon as maki mentioned </joey>
<joey> that he was feeling seasick she turns to </joey>
<joey> me and sydney was like maki seasick </joey>
<joey> she's seasick i'm taking care of maki </joey>
<joey> he's stay sick </joey>
<joey> wow </joey>
<joey> i'm like wow </joey>
<connor> what an awesome </connor>
<joey> bro </joey>
<garnt> that's a brother and i'm just like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> seasick as well you know obviously i'm </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not you know it's it's normal to get </garnt>
<joey> seasoned </joey>
<joey> like the blinking like </joey>
<joey> you know what hey you know what </joey>
<garnt> it was so funny because uh maki did uh </garnt>
<garnt> the marquis first catch right uh he </garnt>
<garnt> um he reeled in two little like super </garnt>
<garnt> small fish they were like baby fish </garnt>
<garnt> right they were like this big you know </garnt>
<garnt> you can't you can't really do anything </garnt>
<connor> with them so it's like at this point you </connor>
<garnt> just catch and release it yeah yeah and </garnt>
<connor> it was the first like baby fish we </connor>
<connor> caught on the day and this was about two </connor>
<connor> hours in and so he caught them and i was </connor>
<connor> like oh look at the little baby fish </connor>
<connor> though you know we should probably </connor>
<connor> probably release them so we uh he takes </connor>
<connor> the hook out and </connor>
<connor> he starts like he puts them back in the </connor>
<connor> ocean and they start swimming off and i </connor>
<garnt> swear to god this thing's like this is </garnt>
<garnt> like a scene from the simpsons right you </garnt>
<garnt> can see them swimming off and sydney in </garnt>
<garnt> her little in her little you know you </garnt>
<garnt> know when sydney is just like talks </garnt>
<garnt> about a dog or talks about any animal </garnt>
<garnt> she's like go swim little baby swim swim </garnt>
<garnt> and then as soon as she finishes saying </garnt>
<garnt> that out of nowhere a seagull appears </garnt>
<joey> and just dive bombs the fish out of the </joey>
<joey> water </joey>
<joey> and eats it </joey>
<joey> and the four of us are just </joey>
<garnt> we're just standing there looking at </garnt>
<joey> this [ __ ] atrocity in silence </joey>
<joey> and we're just like </joey>
<joey> well [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> the circle of life yeah it's it's the </connor>
<joey> circle of life seagull annihilates tiny </joey>
<connor> faces nature has been restored </connor>
<garnt> oh my god oh but it was actually like it </garnt>
<garnt> was actually like a really fun </garnt>
<garnt> experience how much was it to go out on </garnt>
<garnt> the boat it was like about a hundred </garnt>
<garnt> dollars so </garnt>
<garnt> per person </garnt>
<garnt> and you can catch as much fish as you </garnt>
<garnt> want and </garnt>
<garnt> and afterwards so you you go catch the </garnt>
<garnt> fish and um </garnt>
<garnt> afterwards you uh they have different </garnt>
<connor> services </connor>
<connor> so off so you can go to an uh izakaya </connor>
<connor> where they can cook the fish or you can </connor>
<connor> go to an onsen </connor>
<connor> and uh so there's this onsen that we </connor>
<connor> went to which is perfect for like if </connor>
<joey> you're fishing for four hours it's </joey>
<connor> surprisingly tight yeah it's like way </connor>
<joey> more fishing on the sea is way more </joey>
<joey> active than doing lake fishing </joey>
<joey> or river fishing right because you're </joey>
<joey> you're basting against the current and </joey>
<joey> you're constantly like it's way more </joey>
<joey> it's way more active because uh i don't </joey>
<garnt> know what they call it but uh they they </garnt>
<garnt> gave you like this little cage right </garnt>
<garnt> so you got the bait which is on the hook </garnt>
<garnt> and then next to the bait is this little </garnt>
<garnt> cage where you basically stuff in </garnt>
<garnt> um stuff in like fish like dead fishes </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> chunks oh is that what it's called yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay so oh that oh that's why it's </garnt>
<garnt> called a chum bucket </garnt>
<connor> oh my god it makes so much sense now is </connor>
<connor> like just </connor>
<garnt> mashed up fish yeah so they gave us a </garnt>
<garnt> chum bucket i guess i i was i was </garnt>
<garnt> struggling to find the worst describe </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] thing it's a chum bucket </garnt>
<garnt> man discovers spongebob for the first </garnt>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> so we </garnt>
<garnt> had a chum bucket and so we had to fill </garnt>
<garnt> up this cage full of chum and the the </garnt>
<garnt> cage itself </garnt>
<garnt> would uh attract the fish school with </garnt>
<garnt> the smell right and the bait itself </garnt>
<garnt> would like attract the fish uh to bite </garnt>
<garnt> on it yeah unfortunately like the chum </garnt>
<garnt> would like disintegrate within like you </garnt>
<garnt> know within like a good five five </garnt>
<garnt> minutes so like every every every five </garnt>
<garnt> minutes you'd have to like put it down </garnt>
<garnt> pick it back up put it down pick it back </garnt>
<garnt> up </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<garnt> fill it up fill it up again fill up the </garnt>
<garnt> uh chamber uh fill up the chum cage with </garnt>
<garnt> more chum from your chum buckets and so </garnt>
<garnt> it was actually like way more of an </garnt>
<joey> activity that's what god's new favorite </joey>
<connor> word is now we're gonna be feeling like </connor>
<connor> we're gonna be hearing this a lot </connor>
<garnt> and so it was a way more active </garnt>
<garnt> uh it was made way more active than </garnt>
<garnt> the other kind of fishing i experienced </garnt>
<garnt> so i was actually pretty tired um i was </garnt>
<garnt> it was i worked up a good sweat and my </garnt>
<garnt> god the onsen afterwards </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> you know you know how you know how after </garnt>
<garnt> a hard day's work or how you've done </garnt>
<connor> like you know after hard day's work god </connor>
<connor> catches one baby fish damn that was a </connor>
<connor> hard day's </connor>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<garnt> i did catch one fish i caught the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest fish of the day oh sydney caught </garnt>
<garnt> the most fish but i caught the biggest </garnt>
<connor> fish </connor>
<garnt> which was the tastiest though huh was </garnt>
<connor> yours the taste mine was of course it </connor>
<connor> was mine of course what fish did you </connor>
<connor> catch </connor>
<joey> um the tasty one </joey>
<garnt> what kind of food you have uh i can't </garnt>
<joey> remember the type of fish i had i </joey>
<joey> believe it was a sea fish </joey>
<garnt> you remember the type of fish that we </garnt>
<garnt> were catching </garnt>
<joey> a tire </joey>
<joey> oh that's not the shitty cheap fish </joey>
<joey> right that's like the </joey>
<joey> the taste right yeah that's the [ __ ] you </joey>
<joey> put in the can that's like the cheap </joey>
<garnt> like when you go to sushi places that's </garnt>
<garnt> like the cheapest one yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's the white one right yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> when you cut it open it's like really </connor>
<connor> really white with the uh silver outline </connor>
<joey> right it's like the it's like the blue </joey>
<joey> with like a little bit of yellow in the </joey>
<joey> fish i think yeah i'm totally wrong </joey>
<garnt> maybe i'm just [ __ ] like they do have </garnt>
<joey> like different services where you can </joey>
<joey> catch different types of fish but like </joey>
<connor> the good fish that sounds cool though </connor>
<garnt> i'd like to do that the good things </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> special you know oh yeah next time </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> next time because uh you go to this </garnt>
<garnt> onsen and while you're in the onsen just </garnt>
<garnt> chilling out with the boys or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> they're preparing your fish right so </garnt>
<garnt> they take your fish and uh </garnt>
<garnt> and so they take take your catch and </garnt>
<garnt> they feed it to you uh afterwards which </garnt>
<garnt> is like </garnt>
<connor> what you said that just made me i had </connor>
<joey> the immediate image of somebody coming </joey>
<joey> out back here's your horsemacher </joey>
<joey> open your mouth open here comes the </joey>
<joey> airplane </joey>
<garnt> which is which is great i mean </garnt>
<garnt> what what better what better spice can </garnt>
<connor> you why didn't you catch monkfish in </connor>
<connor> runescape that is a high level fish </connor>
<connor> or shark you can't catch </connor>
<joey> like like 15 fishing or something you </joey>
<connor> know it wasn't high enough level you </connor>
<joey> can't catch you just leveled up that </joey>
<joey> fish yeah you can catch different types </joey>
<joey> of fish but the best fish come out like </joey>
<garnt> seven a.m so it's like a seven a.m oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and i'm just like you know </garnt>
<garnt> what i'd like to try fishing i'm not </garnt>
<joey> doing that </joey>
<joey> yeah that's that's that's like after you </joey>
<joey> know five tries or something that's </joey>
<garnt> that's when you're like dedicated that's </garnt>
<garnt> when you have like your own fishing rods </garnt>
<connor> and all that [ __ ] you know </connor>
<joey> you know you're legit when you've got </joey>
<connor> your own equipment yeah yeah fishing </connor>
<connor> order is just one of those devices that </connor>
<joey> i feel like is such a big investment </joey>
<connor> just because of how annoying it is to </connor>
<joey> maintain oh yeah and like that that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> breaks so easily also like when you get </joey>
<garnt> like super serious there's like </garnt>
<garnt> different rods for different fish yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah it's like oh my god it's like </joey>
<garnt> i learned that from tales of rice i'm </garnt>
<garnt> sure i'm you know i'm sure when i'm if </garnt>
<garnt> i'm if i'm 50 and i haven't decided the </garnt>
<joey> hobby yet i think as a white person that </joey>
<joey> is the default hobby i have </joey>
<garnt> yeah i think oh yeah when i get to 50 </garnt>
<joey> we'll see that and golf or like the two </joey>
<joey> things i'm gonna be like yeah we'll see </joey>
<garnt> if i have a hobby by then i don't know </garnt>
<joey> maybe i will you don't have a hobby now </joey>
<joey> i can't be streaming </joey>
<connor> cancel </connor>
<connor> he still streams right i'm pretty sure i </connor>
<connor> think so [ __ ] yeah so you know there's a </connor>
<connor> future man i i mean maybe i'm already </connor>
<connor> like low on energy now there's lots of </connor>
<garnt> people who want me to be i'm sure you </garnt>
<garnt> say that but you stream more than me and </garnt>
<connor> joey combined yeah </connor>
<connor> i feel like i'm really low on energy but </connor>
<connor> then you guys always don't stream much </connor>
<joey> so i don't know maybe i think there's a </joey>
<joey> difference between low and energy and </joey>
<joey> can't you know not being [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah right it's like i'm not low on </connor>
<joey> energy i just can't be [ __ ] yeah maybe </joey>
<garnt> maybe yeah yeah i mean i i can't tell if </garnt>
<joey> i'm like i am low on energy a lot of </joey>
<joey> times because i have to like who am i </joey>
<joey> kidding who am i kidding i have to </joey>
<joey> conserve my energy for trash taste </joey>
<joey> people think i talk a lot and then no </joey>
<joey> it's just like i can serve all my all my </joey>
<garnt> like social energy for [ __ ] trash </garnt>
<garnt> chase every week and then i like i've </garnt>
<garnt> reset every week </garnt>
<joey> takes a lot of time it's hard work in </joey>
<connor> this in this show honestly though if i </connor>
<garnt> stream then that's my work done for the </garnt>
<connor> day because i can do it in the night </connor>
<garnt> how do i have energy after i've been </garnt>
<garnt> working all day to also stream which is </garnt>
<connor> to me work </connor>
<connor> sometimes you start streaming and then </connor>
<joey> you just kind of get energy as you're </joey>
<joey> streaming it's kind of i get that </joey>
<joey> sometimes it happens like sometimes i'm </joey>
<connor> really dreading it's called being an </connor>
<connor> extrovert </connor>
<garnt> like literally it's like you're getting </garnt>
<garnt> you're gaining the energy </garnt>
<joey> yeah you know that you're stifling the </joey>
<garnt> energy from social interaction right </garnt>
<garnt> for me it's the opposite like i have a </garnt>
<garnt> certain amount of energy and i have to </garnt>
<garnt> expel that during the day basically </garnt>
<garnt> spell expel i'll be [ __ ] it out </garnt>
<joey> don't bring [ __ ] out we have to [ __ ] out </joey>
<connor> my energy </connor>
<joey> no more [ __ ] we promise no more [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> this is like god goes to the toilet and </joey>
<joey> sydney's like are you expelling your </joey>
<joey> energy honey </joey>
<joey> during my energy exploration period </joey>
<connor> how else is the moving stuff going are </connor>
<garnt> you kind of getting settled in is it </garnt>
<garnt> dreading yeah it's uh because this is </garnt>
<garnt> it's a bit different now because i lived </garnt>
<connor> in an apartment and this one's a house </connor>
<connor> and uh bougie i know </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] at this point i was actually i was </connor>
<connor> actually really lucky to get this house </connor>
<connor> because the previous owner has gotten a </connor>
<connor> job abroad </connor>
<connor> and so he was very desperate to find a </connor>
<connor> tenant so we got it at like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> amazing price because we were like when </connor>
<connor> we were looking for other places we were </connor>
<joey> we were we didn't even know if we were </joey>
<joey> going to move because i remember talking </joey>
<joey> to you guys because you both were moving </joey>
<joey> you wanted bigger places and i'm like </joey>
<joey> i'm actually really happy with my place </joey>
<joey> was a good size though yeah it was a </joey>
<joey> good size and i was just like i'm only </joey>
<joey> going to move if i can find like a </joey>
<joey> decent enough upgrade and we saw other </joey>
<joey> places which for the budget that was set </joey>
<joey> and nothing was really like nothing </joey>
<connor> really standing out i was just like </connor>
<connor> whatever maybe i'll just stay for </connor>
<connor> another year and then this was like the </connor>
<connor> last house that uh we looked at because </connor>
<connor> the stage and was like yeah we have we </connor>
<joey> have one more on offer um </joey>
<connor> that's uh that you might enjoy </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah we saved the best for last and </joey>
<joey> uh so we looked at this house and it was </joey>
<joey> like twice the size of any other place </joey>
<joey> they'd shown us for the same price yeah </joey>
<garnt> and we're like what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> um there is there is a catch though </garnt>
<garnt> which is i don't know what the exact </garnt>
<garnt> contract was called but we only have it </garnt>
<garnt> for a maximum of two years so that was </garnt>
<connor> the cash you have to get out so after </connor>
<connor> two years we have to get switches if </connor>
<connor> you're like get really settled in you </connor>
<joey> really like well remember when we were </joey>
<joey> looking for places for the trash taste </joey>
<joey> office that we one of the places we were </joey>
<garnt> considering i don't know if we talked </garnt>
<garnt> about us on camera but one of the places </garnt>
<garnt> we were considering was exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah the first place we found it </garnt>
<garnt> was like this like three-story house </garnt>
<garnt> that was like oh yeah this is like looks </garnt>
<joey> like a perfect space but then we found </joey>
<connor> out that oh yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> it was like it was owned by an expat who </joey>
<joey> was overseas now but he was like i'm </joey>
<joey> coming back in two years so you better </joey>
<connor> get the [ __ ] out yeah oh yeah yeah i do </connor>
<connor> think this one's actually better in the </connor>
<joey> end i think the studio is definitely </joey>
<joey> definitely better in the end but like </joey>
<connor> initially when we were looking at new </connor>
<connor> studios that was one that we were like </connor>
<joey> really happy with good price good </joey>
<joey> location </joey>
<connor> so in in the end what what made you move </connor>
<connor> there was just because the like the </connor>
<garnt> house the house is from the house the </garnt>
<garnt> location was amazing the house is </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing um and i was just like i </garnt>
<connor> i move on average every two years anyway </connor>
<garnt> yeah so like i i'm i'm </garnt>
<garnt> let's do it as we just discussed i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> one to settle down so i just i like </garnt>
<connor> mixing it up you know yeah </connor>
<connor> i like getting changed yeah </connor>
<connor> and as annoying as it is like i do like </connor>
<garnt> it but also like two years is a long </garnt>
<connor> time if you think about it it is very </connor>
<garnt> long so to me at least two years is like </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] long time especially for </connor>
<garnt> youtube something exciting about </garnt>
<garnt> upgrading a little bit as well you're </garnt>
<garnt> like you know i've been working hard i </garnt>
<garnt> just have a little bit of an upgrade you </garnt>
<joey> know yeah i'm giving myself a pound on </joey>
<garnt> the back i mean my new place like three </garnt>
<garnt> times more expensive than my old one but </garnt>
<garnt> that's because i didn't know how i was </garnt>
<garnt> gonna </garnt>
<connor> do financially when i moved here yeah i </connor>
<garnt> didn't wanna i didn't i mean yeah when i </garnt>
<connor> first moved here i had [ __ ] the </connor>
<connor> choice yeah you had to you know i don't </connor>
<garnt> want the bedroom i had a one bedroom </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah same here because when i moved </garnt>
<connor> here sydney just didn't have a career </connor>
<connor> yet so it was like it was i remember </connor>
<connor> that yeah yeah you're paying everything </connor>
<connor> a lot of it was on a lot of it was on me </connor>
<connor> to like well she she you know she </connor>
<joey> obviously paid for it as well but uh a </joey>
<joey> lot of it </joey>
<joey> a lot of it was if it rested on you yeah </joey>
<joey> if like if sydney falls through and her </joey>
<joey> youtube career doesn't take off then all </joey>
<joey> of this is gonna fall on me yeah and </joey>
<connor> that's why i was like that's what i was </connor>
<connor> thinking about but now it's a lot more </connor>
<connor> comfortable we can both share the cost </connor>
<connor> so we were able to have like a bigger </connor>
<garnt> budget but still not stupidly large </garnt>
<connor> um and yeah we just found a nice pretty </connor>
<joey> nice house and then sydney's crew took </joey>
<connor> off and we went stupidly lost </connor>
<connor> in my mind i was like because we were </connor>
<connor> living so far away well to say where we </connor>
<garnt> live now kind of like are we allowed to </garnt>
<garnt> say well </garnt>
<garnt> it was very far away not very far away </garnt>
<garnt> it kind of was kind of wasn't i also </garnt>
<connor> lived really far away from the station </connor>
<garnt> so i felt like double damage yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like for me i lived literally three </garnt>
<garnt> minutes away from this super close so </garnt>
<connor> like i was like five minutes like i just </connor>
<connor> had like a nice distance yeah and then i </connor>
<connor> lived like ridiculously far away yeah </connor>
<connor> like i didn't you were like halfway </connor>
<joey> between two stations i remember </joey>
<connor> basically yeah yeah and so i had the </connor>
<connor> really annoying case of just like i'm 50 </connor>
<connor> minute walk to one station 20 minutes to </connor>
<connor> the other yeah yeah which like doesn't </connor>
<connor> seem like a big deal but when you're </connor>
<connor> some days when you have to go back and </connor>
<connor> forth multiple times it really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> felt dreadful yeah and i just got to the </connor>
<connor> point where i'm like okay i'm doing well </connor>
<connor> for myself i'm just going to spend the </connor>
<connor> extra money just to get somewhere that's </connor>
<connor> super close and that i can focus more on </connor>
<connor> work don't have to worry about traveling </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> now i don't have to worry too much about </connor>
<connor> and before i always had a plan precisely </connor>
<connor> when i was leaving the house yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because i had to get i had to look what </connor>
<garnt> the train was i had to make sure i was </garnt>
<garnt> getting the express train because where </garnt>
<garnt> we were was so far away that you could </garnt>
<garnt> get an express train that saved you </garnt>
<garnt> quite a significant amount of time and </garnt>
<garnt> so normally commutes are about an hour </garnt>
<garnt> for me yeah which is quite a long time </garnt>
<garnt> and you do have to really like think </garnt>
<connor> okay why am i leaving the house but now </connor>
<connor> now i can just kind of be like i </connor>
<connor> generally know what time i need to leave </connor>
<joey> yeah i kind of like the commute though </joey>
<joey> because like </joey>
<connor> me currently i'm also like </connor>
<connor> just like travel distance for me like to </connor>
<garnt> the office for example is like pretty </garnt>
<garnt> much the same as it was yeah right it's </garnt>
<joey> not that much different time wise it's </joey>
<connor> just in a different way i always </connor>
<connor> complained about it because for me i </connor>
<connor> definitely valued distance </connor>
<connor> from like where i was going right a lot </connor>
<joey> like i really liked the commute though </joey>
<garnt> because it puts my mind off of work for </garnt>
<connor> even i like it i </connor>
<connor> i liked it until a certain point because </connor>
<connor> commuting here was fine </connor>
<garnt> commuting back is a [ __ ] nightmare </garnt>
<joey> because like that's i would always dread </joey>
<garnt> it right because commuting i don't mind </garnt>
<garnt> staying on the train but when it's like </garnt>
<garnt> when you're going back after we finish </garnt>
<garnt> filming trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> normally like in london it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> rush hour is from let's say five o'clock </garnt>
<connor> till seven o'clock right where like the </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] tube is packed you're not </connor>
<connor> getting a seat and you're like a sardine </connor>
<connor> for some reason the [ __ ] rush hour in </connor>
<connor> tokyo starts from like four till like 9 </connor>
<connor> 30 at night right no no it doesn't it </connor>
<connor> doesn't end it's just it just goes it </connor>
<connor> goes until midnight yeah yeah so so like </connor>
<connor> so it's like the commute back was just </connor>
<connor> like a nightmare i would like dread it </connor>
<garnt> so i would dread the commute back every </garnt>
<garnt> time so it's it was just </garnt>
<garnt> normally if i was in london i would just </garnt>
<garnt> wait out the rush hour but in japan </garnt>
<garnt> there is no waiting out the rush out you </garnt>
<connor> just you just got to deal with it yeah </connor>
<connor> it depends right because like some like </connor>
<connor> you said you don't mind the commute </connor>
<connor> that's good i mean very op for you you </connor>
<connor> can get a much bigger place you have a </connor>
<garnt> much bigger place than me uh </garnt>
<garnt> so it's it's kind of like i don't know i </garnt>
<garnt> just i hated commuting yeah and to me </garnt>
<garnt> i felt like i could spend my time better </garnt>
<garnt> and i did want to spend my time </garnt>
<connor> differently like like streaming right </connor>
<connor> like an extra hour of streaming is a big </connor>
<connor> difference oh yeah yeah so that would go </connor>
<joey> like a long way so yeah i think for me </joey>
<connor> as well it's because like </connor>
<connor> an hour commute for me now is so much </connor>
<connor> better than what i first had when i </connor>
<connor> first moved here because when i first </connor>
<connor> moved here i lived in a place that was a </connor>
<connor> 25 minute walk to the closest station </connor>
<connor> you know and it was like way out of </connor>
<connor> tokyo kind of thing so like you know </connor>
<joey> commuting into tokyo would be like an </joey>
<joey> hour and a half two hours which is the </joey>
<joey> walk don't get me wrong it's fine </joey>
<joey> walking is not the problem it's walking </joey>
<garnt> in the summer </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah sometimes you know you can't </garnt>
<connor> always be what you'd like you sometimes </connor>
<connor> you have to carry a bunch of [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> and that's where it really [ __ ] sucks </connor>
<connor> i'm so glad that finally i'm able to </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] wear a sweater right right it's </connor>
<connor> so nice now like </connor>
<connor> speaking of weather though like </connor>

<joey> just was like here for two days and then </joey>
<connor> it's like all right see it just turned </connor>
<connor> into winter it's it's always like that </connor>
<joey> i'm so glad though because i can finally </joey>
<garnt> wear some drip right right without </garnt>
<garnt> dripping myself yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's [ __ ] disgusting for like the </joey>
<garnt> middle of september it was so gross yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean like i just like how japan </garnt>
<garnt> decided that it was going to be hot </garnt>
<garnt> until it wasn't one day and then it just </garnt>
<connor> decided it was it literally was it it </connor>
<garnt> went from 25 to 14 in one day yeah and </garnt>
<connor> and it doesn't look like it's going back </connor>
<connor> how does that happen </connor>
<connor> weather japan has four seasons everybody </connor>
<garnt> that's what they tell you </garnt>
<connor> no they don't it has pain for six months </connor>
<garnt> then mild discomfort for two and then </garnt>
<connor> the rest are okay i guess yeah it's kind </connor>
<garnt> of correct </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's kind of right </connor>
<garnt> one biggest thing going back to the </garnt>
<garnt> house one biggest thing that i've had to </garnt>
<joey> go to get used to uh living in the house </joey>
<connor> is uh living on the ground floor now </connor>
<connor> right oh yeah i've </connor>
<joey> only lived i've only lived in japan i </joey>
<joey> mean it's like i've only lived in </joey>
<joey> apartments in japan before and i was </joey>
<connor> like quite high up in my old apartment </connor>
<connor> so you know what you know i could stand </connor>
<connor> next to the window and uh be pretty </connor>
<garnt> confident that no one was going to see </garnt>
<connor> me you know you know yeah </connor>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> especially you know </garnt>
<connor> when you sleep you sometimes you just </connor>
<connor> sleep in boxes as a as as </connor>
<connor> as you do and sometimes sometimes you're </connor>
<joey> just out of the shower and you don't get </joey>
<connor> dressed yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly you didn't get dressed straight </joey>
<joey> away you put on your boxes or whatever </joey>
<joey> and just walk around the apartment um </joey>
<joey> and uh i i kind of realized that you </joey>
<joey> can't do that in houses </joey>
<joey> so our house has like pretty big [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> windows right yeah and so i have a </garnt>
<garnt> shower put on my boxes and uh </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> the bathroom uh or my shower room and my </garnt>
<garnt> wardrobe is on different floors right so </garnt>
<garnt> finishing the shower go up to the go up </garnt>
<garnt> to my living room and just you know </garnt>
<garnt> chilling you know before i put on some </garnt>
<joey> clothes um go up to go up to my window </joey>
<joey> to like admire the view </joey>
<joey> as you do sometimes just admire the </joey>
<connor> sunshine on the ground floor </connor>
<garnt> admire the pavement </garnt>
<garnt> on on the first floor on the first wow </garnt>
<garnt> it's a little elevation a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> across me direction yeah so it changes </garnt>
<garnt> everything yeah because you know </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes when i was on when i was on </garnt>
<garnt> the when i was on like the eighth floor </garnt>
<connor> back in my old apartment sometimes you </connor>
<connor> just like to look down breathe in the </connor>
<connor> sunshine and i thought i'd do the same </connor>
<connor> routine uh so i was just standing in my </connor>
<connor> window um and then </connor>
<connor> uh someone opens their uh </connor>
<connor> someone goes out to the balcony to put </connor>
<joey> out some clothes </joey>
<joey> and uh me and them need eye contact and </joey>
<joey> um i i'm totally not used to this </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> back in when you're an apartment i was </joey>
<joey> used to just being by the window and </joey>
<joey> nobody could see you because you're too </joey>
<joey> high up to be seen yeah um and then so </joey>
<garnt> we make eye contact and then they </garnt>
<garnt> immediately just </garnt>
<garnt> close the closed sliding door again and </garnt>
<garnt> then i realize i'm just standing next to </garnt>
<garnt> my window with my boxes out and people </garnt>
<connor> can very visibly see me and i'm like 20 </connor>
<connor> meters away it was this person they were </connor>
<garnt> like across the road so like 10 meters </garnt>
<joey> away yeah it's like 10 meters away so </joey>
<connor> they had 4k definitions </connor>
<joey> literally caught in 4k my god if it was </joey>
<garnt> mailing and she would like be </garnt>
<garnt> she would have seen my nipples and </garnt>
<garnt> everything [ __ ] scarred for life </garnt>
<joey> there my god fallen right off the </joey>
<joey> balcony yeah i'm not </joey>
<connor> in shock </connor>
<garnt> are you liking a new playstore so far </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah really liking it </garnt>
<garnt> also another thing uh </garnt>
<garnt> i had to go back to my house by myself </garnt>
<connor> to pick up some stuff uh pretty late at </connor>
<connor> night and uh </connor>
<connor> it's uh it's it's pretty scary to go </connor>
<connor> back it's it's creepy as [ __ ] to go in </connor>
<connor> the house and i didn't i didn't realize </connor>
<connor> that until i went in </connor>
<garnt> because when you're in apartment there </garnt>
<garnt> are like lights </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> outside of your building yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> there there are lights and there are </garnt>
<garnt> people living next to you yeah you go in </garnt>
<garnt> this house um and it's just pitch black </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just by yourself and you're </garnt>
<garnt> like you know what i wasn't afraid of </garnt>
<garnt> the dark until i experienced this and </garnt>
<connor> i'm so creepy about an empty apartment </connor>
<connor> pitch black there was something really </connor>
<garnt> weird about it yeah an apartment's like </garnt>
<garnt> i can handle an apartment because the </garnt>
<garnt> worst thing if you if something happens </garnt>
<garnt> if like a [ __ ] murderer is there or a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] burglar is there you can scream </garnt>
<joey> and people are people around you i don't </joey>
<connor> know yeah you have too much confidence </connor>
<joey> in people yeah i think i think i think </joey>
<garnt> you like your neighbors a little too </garnt>
<joey> much </joey>
<joey> i don't know maybe it's probably just </joey>
<connor> like a placebo but </connor>
<connor> feels murderous in japan i'm sure </connor>
<connor> apartments yeah </connor>
<connor> maybe it's placebo but it feels safer it </connor>
<connor> just feels </connor>
<connor> it i don't know it's like having a night </connor>
<connor> light you know it feels like it feels </connor>
<connor> like it's not too far away from your </connor>
<connor> front door whereas in the house you're </connor>
<connor> kind of just there by yourself and uh we </connor>
<connor> we have a detached house as well so </connor>
<connor> um so it feels like you're just </connor>
<connor> completely there </connor>
<connor> isolated whereas in an apartment </connor>
<connor> you know there there's the apartment </connor>
<connor> block where there's people outside </connor>
<connor> sometimes going in and out there's </connor>
<connor> lights even at night time um so just i </connor>
<connor> don't know right it just it just feels </connor>
<connor> like you're a bit more isolated it feels </connor>
<garnt> scarier uh i could see why people can </garnt>
<garnt> get scared of ghosts now in japan </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> because it's [ __ ] creepy as [ __ ] oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah definitely </garnt>
<connor> i don't want to talk about ghosts yeah i </connor>
<joey> got rinsed from the comments last time </joey>
<joey> did you actually wait what did you say </joey>
<joey> oh when i talked about ghosts people </joey>
<joey> were very angry that i spoke about i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you don't believe him yeah </joey>
<joey> but then it was one of those that was </joey>
<joey> another one of those times i was like </joey>
<connor> damn i wish i could like go write a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] script on why i don't believe in </connor>
<joey> ghosts and why they're stupid new videos </joey>
<joey> why i don't believe in ghosts 50 yeah </joey>
<connor> there was a there's a guy who made like </connor>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> he made a follow-up video about us </joey>
<joey> talking about ghosts basically oh really </joey>
<connor> yes basically </connor>
<connor> saying my point but eloquent and </connor>
<connor> actually and actually explaining </connor>
<garnt> what is this video called is bob with </garnt>
<connor> his name dark viper a u i think he </connor>
<connor> watches trash tastes a lot </connor>
<connor> he's a speed runner and while he was </connor>
<connor> speed running games he was just giving </connor>
<connor> this amazingly amazingly eloquent </connor>
<garnt> explanation as to why people believe in </garnt>
<garnt> ghosts and why </garnt>
<garnt> generally like a coping thing and </garnt>
<garnt> whatnot yeah you know it's stuff that i </garnt>
<garnt> normally agree with but it's one of </garnt>
<connor> those things that you can never change </connor>
<connor> if someone believes in ghosts you're </connor>
<connor> never going to change their mind yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but but it's like but for me to be </connor>
<connor> like i don't believe in it sometimes </connor>
<connor> people get offended by that they're like </connor>
<connor> never experienced it even if i did i </connor>
<joey> wouldn't care but the thing is i've </joey>
<connor> never experienced it but i still believe </connor>
<joey> in it yeah yeah because it's i don't </joey>
<connor> know it's it's cool </connor>
<connor> i understand that it's nice to believe </connor>
<joey> in but it's just one of those things </joey>
<joey> that i'm just like maybe i'm just too </joey>
<connor> boring i don't know to me it just </connor>
<garnt> doesn't make sense i mean to me i </garnt>
<garnt> believe it yeah </garnt>
<connor> but that's i didn't believe it until i </connor>
<garnt> experienced something and then i did </garnt>
<connor> believe it so yeah but again i always </connor>
<garnt> think there's a logical explanation for </garnt>
<garnt> everything oh no of course of course </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i think there's there's always a an </garnt>
<connor> explanation that might be boring might </connor>
<connor> not be immediately obvious uh that can </connor>
<joey> explain it well i mean yeah like every </joey>
<joey> every mystery ever in history you know </joey>
<garnt> that's ever been solved has turned out </garnt>
<joey> to be not magic right it's like yeah </joey>
<connor> there's always there's always something </connor>
<connor> behind it yeah yeah there's there's </connor>
<connor> always there's always some like we just </connor>
<connor> don't have the capability to understand </connor>
<connor> certain things and yeah i guess the </connor>
<connor> people use that argument for you that's </connor>
<garnt> that could mean that we don't ghosts </garnt>
<garnt> could be real we don't understand that </garnt>
<garnt> we're like yeah but everything else in </garnt>
<joey> our world thus far has proven to be the </joey>
<joey> case that stuff like that doesn't tend </joey>
<joey> to be yeah i believe in like the the </joey>
<connor> supernatural or like the paranormal but </connor>
<joey> i don't believe in 99 of the media that </joey>
<connor> comes out this is like i guess </connor>
<connor> that i really despise and this is one </connor>
<connor> thing that i absolutely hate about and </connor>
<connor> which really leads me to feel strongly </connor>
<garnt> against it is the whole industry that's </garnt>
<garnt> propped up around yeah no no exactly </garnt>
<garnt> ghosts uh you know i don't agree with </garnt>
<connor> fortune tellers spirit mediums that </connor>
<connor> stuff it's so predatory at times yeah </connor>
<connor> that it makes me just want to like just </connor>
<connor> get rid of it all just yeah no no one </connor>
<connor> don't believe in ghosts because if one </connor>
<connor> person believes in ghosts then there has </connor>
<garnt> to be someone who then gets into </garnt>
<garnt> believing into ghosts and then falls </garnt>
<garnt> down this whole rabbit hole uh their </garnt>
<garnt> husband dies someone comes to them tells </garnt>
<connor> me i'll let you speak to husband for </connor>
<garnt> fifty dollars </garnt>
<connor> yeah that is predatory and that's like </connor>
<connor> that's kind of different that's just </connor>
<garnt> people taking advantage of people who </garnt>
<garnt> are like very vulnerable and very just </garnt>
<garnt> looking for answers and </garnt>
<connor> but i believe there are people out there </connor>
<garnt> who i wouldn't class as vulnerable </garnt>
<connor> but maybe gullible more so oh yeah </connor>
<joey> there's nothing bad happen to them </joey>
<connor> they're maybe more likely to believe </connor>
<connor> this kind of stuff and i suppose you </connor>
<garnt> can't argue that they're not getting </garnt>
<garnt> what they want </garnt>
<garnt> they're paying for some [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but that's kind of what in my eyes it's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] but that's me by paying well </garnt>
<garnt> maybe they'll ask for oh so i have </garnt>
<garnt> friends very good friends who go to </garnt>
<garnt> fortune tellers and stuff and i just </garnt>
<garnt> flat out just do not believe fortune </garnt>
<garnt> challenges </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> i just you know i think there is um </garnt>
<garnt> there are a lot of questions that would </garnt>
<connor> be a raise oh so you know how to read </connor>
<connor> fortunes then uh why don't why are you </connor>
<connor> not very fortunate why are you not using </connor>
<joey> this to your ability why do you not own </joey>
<connor> about 10 portions a fortune's able to be </connor>
<connor> changed is this something you know and </connor>
<connor> and if if not why why is god just </connor>
<joey> bespoke uh bestowed you with this </joey>
<joey> knowledge yeah the old people and why </joey>
<joey> are you not using it to your owner yeah </joey>
<joey> i just find that there are so many </joey>
<joey> questionable actions </joey>
<joey> and ultimately it all comes down to the </joey>
<connor> fact that you're charging money yeah </connor>
<joey> you're getting paid well um </joey>
<joey> you're free to believe in whatever the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] you want as long as you're not like </joey>
<joey> extorting people yeah i mean </joey>
<garnt> when you when you add when you add money </garnt>
<connor> into the mix of course it's going to get </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] messy especially especially if </connor>
<connor> you try to like monetize this and i </connor>
<connor> think i think yeah if you want to give </connor>
<connor> away a fortune for free go ahead no yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> but like i you know to like claim that </connor>
<connor> you have some kind of special power or </connor>
<connor> something well there's no way to prove </connor>
<connor> that and yes right now whether you </connor>
<connor> believe in ghosts or not there is no </connor>
<connor> tangible proof </connor>
<garnt> for or against for me like i believe i </garnt>
<garnt> believe in the supernatural i believe in </garnt>
<garnt> supernatural things because to me i </garnt>
<garnt> believe that </garnt>
<garnt> at the moment there is so much about the </garnt>
<garnt> universe and the world that even science </garnt>
<connor> consciousness yeah i believe that i </connor>
<garnt> believe i'm i'm near certain that alien </garnt>
<garnt> species out there exist that we have not </garnt>
<garnt> been able to you know come across </garnt>
<garnt> because the universe is too big but like </garnt>
<connor> the whole concept of modern ghosts and </connor>
<connor> the way that we understand them i think </connor>
<garnt> is completely incorrect but what is the </garnt>
<garnt> concept what is the concept of modern </garnt>
<connor> ghosts like the idea that someone would </connor>
<connor> die and they're just going to hang </connor>
<connor> around a place haunting it like what </connor>
<connor> like are you serious no no that's not </connor>
<joey> gonna i believe in it no no god no well </joey>
<connor> but it's also </connor>
<connor> but it's also because like a lot of like </connor>
<connor> shintoist belief revolutions right on </connor>
<connor> that i understand that and i kind of </connor>
<connor> come up with it that's why i you know </connor>
<connor> it's one of the it's very tough for me </connor>
<connor> to argue uh again like i'm not prepared </connor>
<joey> i think we're going to talk about it </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah no i'm not eloquent enough </joey>
<connor> don't watch this video this time </connor>
<joey> that's great i don't know like i i just </joey>
<connor> generally am of a scientific mindset uh </connor>
<joey> that's just absolutely appreciated </joey>
<joey> most of the time i am generally </joey>
<connor> favorable towards the sciences </connor>
<joey> like i don't believe in like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like people who can read like star signs </joey>
<connor> and meridian lines yeah i'm sure if you </connor>
<connor> if you presented some kind of paranormal </connor>
<connor> activity that we had and we really sat </connor>
<connor> down and we really went through it and </connor>
<connor> we really started poking holes in it we </connor>
<garnt> could probably you know debunk most </garnt>
<garnt> things oh yeah i'm sure and any of the </garnt>
<joey> stuff that is generally when you say </joey>
<joey> it's unsolvable or nothing to explain </joey>
<joey> there's generally a massive lack of </joey>
<connor> information or not enough stuff </connor>
<joey> but that's what i mean right it's like </joey>
<connor> it's it's a lot like like ufo footage </connor>
<connor> where it's like yeah i believe in ufos </connor>
<joey> but i don't believe in 99 percent of the </joey>
<connor> photos or videos </connor>
<joey> yeah exactly like a lot of the the </joey>
<joey> scandalous stuff yeah yeah same with </joey>
<joey> ghosts but ufos for sure because we know </joey>
<joey> that they exist but there's there are </joey>
<joey> tons of unidentified objects we don't </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> but there are also a lot of like you </connor>
<connor> know haunted videos and like paranormal </connor>
<connor> activity like videos and photos that are </connor>
<connor> just like it's no matter how you look at </connor>
<connor> it it's unexplainable it's become such a </connor>
<connor> and yeah i think i feel like you just </connor>
<joey> hate the culture around it right i do i </joey>
<joey> really do i don't think </joey>
<joey> i never talk about this because i'm just </joey>
<joey> like yeah i believe in ghosts and i </joey>
<joey> hardly mention it because it's just like </joey>
<joey> i believe in it because i've seen it i </joey>
<joey> don't really like like to talk about it </joey>
<joey> because it's just it's my experience </joey>
<joey> right it's just you can't force someone </joey>
<joey> to believe in her i don't know i i don't </joey>
<garnt> want other people to believe what like </garnt>
<garnt> experience what i experienced that's </garnt>
<garnt> just my experience i think it's done </garnt>
<garnt> personally but i will never be like </garnt>
<garnt> you're a stupid person for believing in </garnt>
<joey> it yeah and i'm and i'm not going to be </joey>
<joey> like how dare you </joey>
<garnt> yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> you guys you guys have some form of some </garnt>
<garnt> belief in it i would never be like i </garnt>
<garnt> think you guys are stupid because you </garnt>
<joey> believe in it i personally to me it </joey>
<connor> feels dumb yeah the idea of it yeah but </connor>
<joey> i don't care if anyone else no and and i </joey>
<joey> and i i'm completely fine with people </joey>
<joey> who don't believe in it because you know </joey>
<joey> it can't be helped right it's like you </joey>
<joey> haven't experienced it of course you're </joey>
<garnt> not gonna believe in it yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> like to me it's like the opposite sense </garnt>
<garnt> where yes i i completely agree the </garnt>
<joey> culture is very messy it's very very </joey>
<joey> sensationalized which i hate psychics </joey>
<joey> are </joey>
<garnt> there's yeah so many like people who </garnt>
<garnt> have debunked people who have monetized </garnt>
<garnt> this that how can you not know that a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of people are just predatory but at </garnt>
<garnt> the same time i do believe there is a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of things that have not been able to </garnt>
<garnt> explain </garnt>
<garnt> with current science and i think it's </garnt>
<garnt> even i think i think it's naive to not </garnt>
<garnt> think that there is not something more </garnt>
<garnt> out there that hasn't been explained yet </garnt>
<garnt> because there's so many there's so much </garnt>
<garnt> about you know there's so much we don't </garnt>
<garnt> understand we we take for granted </garnt>
<garnt> because science says science has evolved </garnt>
<garnt> and progressed so much that we forget </garnt>
<garnt> how much we still do not [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> understand yeah </garnt>
<garnt> about just the united </garnt>
<garnt> we don't understand stand situation and </garnt>
<garnt> we don't have the tools to be able to </garnt>
<connor> explain it i i don't think that a </connor>
<garnt> paranormal explanation is the correct </garnt>
<garnt> one because you know we didn't know we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know what caused like cholera for </garnt>
<garnt> a long time yeah you know i'm sure at </garnt>
<garnt> some point they thought it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> the devil right </garnt>
<joey> one of those things where it's like </joey>
<joey> generally when we've come to at least my </joey>
<joey> belief is that when we we just don't </joey>
<joey> have the tools or the knowledge of </joey>
<joey> subsequent fields or physics or math to </joey>
<connor> understand certain things but also most </connor>
<connor> of the time it's so [ __ ] minuscule </connor>
<connor> what happened it doesn't [ __ ] matter </connor>
<connor> like if your door closed one night and </connor>
<connor> it was real spooky it's like why would </connor>
<connor> anyone delve deep into trying to </connor>
<joey> disprove you your door uncomfortably </joey>
<joey> closed it's called a draft </joey>
<joey> but like there are so many things that </joey>
<connor> are so </connor>
<connor> not worth explaining oh yeah generally </connor>
<garnt> most of the [ __ ] that is spooky is so </garnt>
<garnt> not worth </garnt>
<garnt> wasting time on trying to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> because there's so little information </garnt>
<garnt> that we have yeah that's not worth </garnt>
<garnt> explaining anyway well that's the </garnt>
<garnt> problem </garnt>
<connor> one more thing </connor>
<connor> i also do want to acknowledge that there </connor>
<connor> is you know the whole psychic stuff and </connor>
<connor> and all that i do understand that there </connor>
<connor> is a market that is pure entertainment </connor>
<connor> yeah right i could go to a fortune </connor>
<connor> teller they could tell me a bunch of </connor>
<connor> nonsense i don't believe a word they </connor>
<connor> said but it was fun to hear the funny </connor>
<connor> words that they did </connor>
<joey> i understand that's an angle and i'm </joey>
<joey> fine with that i like your funny words </joey>
<joey> magical things magic man thank you for </joey>
<joey> telling me that i'm going to be wealthy </joey>
<connor> i appreciate that but i'm i'm also like </connor>
<connor> going to hear when i've i've i've gone </connor>
<connor> to a fortune teller before because i </connor>
<connor> like i i like to experience what kind of </connor>
<connor> generic way they're going to tell me </connor>
<connor> about my future yeah i love to </connor>
<connor> understand the way that they're trying </connor>
<connor> to do it yeah but that's not of a place </connor>
<connor> of uh </connor>
<connor> me genuinely believing it but i do think </connor>
<connor> that is kind of </connor>
<connor> a bit </connor>
<connor> there are a lot of people out there who </connor>
<connor> really believe in this stuff yeah yeah i </connor>
<garnt> i i almost my mom's one of those people </garnt>
<connor> and i'm like i'm like some sometimes my </connor>
<garnt> mom like takes me to a fortune teller </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like mom again my mom again you </garnt>
<garnt> get the same [ __ ] spiel every time </garnt>
<connor> proven that you know they say generic </connor>
<connor> things it can apply to anything it's </connor>
<garnt> called reading code cold reading is a </garnt>
<garnt> technique it's a psychological technique </garnt>
<joey> but that's the thing i have i almost </joey>
<joey> have an appreciation for these psychics </joey>
<joey> not so much in the supernatural sense </joey>
<joey> but more on the psychological sense of </joey>
<connor> being like darren brown is more along </connor>
<garnt> i'm not he always says he's not psychic </garnt>
<joey> but like just using the faults of the </joey>
<garnt> human yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> psychology </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and that's like more interesting </garnt>
<garnt> anyone who's good at that would never </garnt>
<garnt> claim to be psychic or yeah nothing like </garnt>
<garnt> that they understand that it's a lot </garnt>
<garnt> more than that because psychic really </garnt>
<garnt> undervalues what you're doing yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> really </garnt>
<garnt> magic brain thing yeah like do i do i </garnt>
<garnt> believe in like psychics and people who </garnt>
<garnt> can cold read and stuff like that no do </garnt>
<garnt> i believe there are people out there who </garnt>
<garnt> can maybe sense some supernatural things </garnt>
<garnt> yes i do i died really yeah i don't care </garnt>
<garnt> enough i mean i mean i think it's </garnt>
<joey> because again like god and i have </joey>
<garnt> personal experience of either ourselves </garnt>
<joey> or someone we know this comes from just </joey>
<garnt> my understanding the the brain is just </garnt>
<joey> so flawed in many ways and that of </joey>
<garnt> course yeah you know there's been like </garnt>
<garnt> uh i know someone gave an argument this </garnt>
<garnt> i saw a comment that was arguing about </garnt>
<connor> this and it was just like if you can't </connor>
<connor> prove it what's the what's that really </connor>
<connor> horrible argument method where it's like </connor>
<connor> if you can't prove it's </connor>
<connor> not real </connor>
<connor> then it then it is real yeah and it's </connor>
<garnt> like no no no no no you need </garnt>
<garnt> the burden is proving that it's real not </garnt>
<garnt> that it isn't well that's that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> this is what i i find the most annoying </garnt>
<garnt> about arguing the subject is that for </garnt>
<connor> some reason it's on the burden to me to </connor>
<connor> prove that you don't have magical sixth </connor>
<connor> sense no prove to me </connor>
<joey> concretely that you do that's the same </joey>
<garnt> people who say like oh yes proof is a </garnt>
<joey> synonym for true it's like no it's </joey>
<garnt> really not well that's that's the thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way to prove it right now and </garnt>
<connor> that's why it's we call believing it </connor>
<garnt> but there's there's so many things right </garnt>
<joey> have you watched naruto </joey>
<garnt> there's that he doesn't just say that </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] it's like </connor>
<garnt> shut the [ __ ] up i'm about to [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> leave right now okay so like believe it </connor>
<joey> there's so many like you know i'm trying </joey>
<joey> to argue a point here joey don't argue a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] point here there's just so many </connor>
<connor> goddamn clips of people you know where </connor>
<connor> they they go to people who are like yeah </connor>
<connor> i can talk to the dead or i can feel the </connor>
<connor> dead and then they show them pictures of </connor>
<connor> people who aren't dead they're like </connor>
<connor> hey they're not dead they're like oh </connor>
<connor> well you know it's like this happens so </connor>
<connor> many goddamn times so it's like at what </connor>
<joey> point are we just gonna be like come on </joey>
<joey> this is just [ __ ] literally everyone </joey>
<joey> who claims they can do this somewhere </joey>
<garnt> another when they put the test they fail </garnt>
<joey> like rarely </joey>
<garnt> no one ever passes these tests why but </garnt>
<garnt> like most of the time like most most of </garnt>
<garnt> the people i've met who have stories </garnt>
<garnt> around this it's got nothing to do with </garnt>
<garnt> this the sensationalized [ __ ] you see on </garnt>
<connor> tv that's true </connor>
<garnt> but that's that's what also makes it </garnt>
<garnt> very difficult to have this discussion </garnt>
<garnt> yeah people have their beliefs they're </garnt>
<garnt> so strong in their beliefs that they </garnt>
<connor> don't consider that they could have </connor>
<connor> maybe experienced something that wasn't </connor>
<garnt> there yeah more often than not they </garnt>
<connor> never </connor>
<garnt> like arguing about someone with their </garnt>
<connor> religion right which is right </connor>
<garnt> you never like it's it's just it's just </garnt>
<garnt> a lose-lose argument because either you </garnt>
<garnt> believe in religion or you don't and </garnt>
<joey> like neither according to the other side </joey>
<joey> neither is right or wrong terrible at </joey>
<connor> admitting our own faults as human beings </connor>
<joey> right there's so many like you know you </joey>
<joey> go to criminal cases there's so many </joey>
<joey> like uh trials and stuff where </joey>
<joey> eyewitness testimony has been given and </joey>
<joey> they swear 100 they have nothing to lose </joey>
<joey> by lying about this that they saw </joey>
<joey> something happened that turned out it </joey>
<joey> didn't happen and that their memory </joey>
<joey> because memory is so unreliable and </joey>
<joey> feelings are so unreliable and what you </joey>
<connor> see is never exactly what you remember </connor>
<connor> it to be these things we are so terribly </connor>
<connor> inconsistent as humans that i find it </connor>
<connor> hard to believe that one person who </connor>
<connor> experienced sang so </connor>
<connor> so wildly kind of outer worldly and that </connor>
<garnt> we don't is it out of worldly though i </garnt>
<connor> mean </connor>
<garnt> there are big there are there are bigger </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] mysteries out there </garnt>
<connor> it's case by case sometimes i've heard </connor>
<connor> stuff where i'm like no and there's some </connor>
<connor> things i'm like you know that just </connor>
<connor> sounds like you had an experience that i </connor>
<connor> wouldn't describe as um like that's like </connor>
<connor> a ghost thing it's like you just had an </connor>
<connor> experience yeah that isn't like a ghost </connor>
<connor> or haunted i think you felt something </connor>
<joey> and i thought that was a you thing i </joey>
<joey> don't think that was the world that you </joey>
<joey> know what i mean i feel like that's you </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<garnt> i was in the same room with you at the </garnt>
<connor> exact same time i would not have </connor>
<connor> experienced the same thing as you right </connor>
<connor> because it is entirely </connor>
<connor> a thing that that is happening to you </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's a mental thing that's </connor>
<connor> going on i don't think it's a thing </connor>
<connor> that's in this like physical world or </connor>
<connor> this material world or whatever i think </connor>
<connor> it's something that if you put two </connor>
<connor> people in the same room and one of them </connor>
<connor> is having that kind of experience and </connor>
<connor> they're feeling things yeah like when </connor>
<connor> you when you went on that tour or </connor>
<connor> whatever you know there's like if you go </connor>
<connor> on a tour and you know haunted house and </connor>
<connor> why one person feel things and one on my </connor>
<connor> doesn't i don't think it's a ghost </connor>
<connor> choosing oh spooky on the god you know </connor>
<connor> yeah i think it's you are setting your </connor>
<connor> your mind is capable you believe that </connor>
<connor> that could happen you are a person who </connor>
<connor> is susceptible to feeling that you could </connor>
<connor> be haunted so you go into a place </connor>
<connor> expecting maybe i could be haunted i'm </connor>
<connor> open to this idea something happens you </connor>
<connor> feel something and then you your mind is </connor>
<garnt> like haunted or well </garnt>
<garnt> i could argue the i could argue the </garnt>
<connor> complete opposite right because i would </connor>
<connor> never yeah yeah i totally agree no </connor>
<garnt> because like you you arguing the </garnt>
<garnt> mentality that they're susceptible to </garnt>
<garnt> believing in this thing but right on the </garnt>
<garnt> opposite of on the opposite side of the </garnt>
<garnt> fence you are someone who is so adverse </garnt>
<garnt> to this idea that you would you're </garnt>
<connor> where in your head it's just like oh </connor>
<connor> that just happened that was a bit weird </connor>
<connor> all right anyway brush it off possibly i </connor>
<connor> think that it's </connor>
<connor> it's really tough because like you said </connor>
<connor> if it did happen i i would probably just </connor>
<connor> i would probably think of a logical </connor>
<connor> conclusion as to why that happened </connor>
<garnt> exactly and more often than not i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i can adequately explain what </garnt>
<connor> happened where other people around me </connor>
<connor> whether that was a noise or something </connor>
<connor> that happened i can normally be like </connor>
<joey> well that's what i find this whole like </joey>
<connor> i guess culture to be interesting about </connor>
<connor> right is that like we don't know like </connor>
<connor> both sides don't know and yeah it's the </connor>
<connor> conversation of the believer versus the </connor>
<joey> non-believer who is right who the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> knows but it's fun to talk about yeah i </connor>
<connor> think unfortunately there's people who </connor>
<connor> argue my side more often than not argue </connor>
<joey> the point that people who believe the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] are dumb yeah and so it kind of </connor>
<connor> makes this really horrible </connor>
<joey> but of course like that that like this </joey>
<joey> whole sensationalized side of it </joey>
<joey> that's just that's just an image problem </joey>
<joey> right because </joey>
<garnt> it is it is so much of an image problem </garnt>
<garnt> because so much of the the media around </garnt>
<garnt> the supernatural is like sensationalized </garnt>
<garnt> especially especially like [ __ ] with </garnt>
<connor> like halloween you like </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] tv is unfucking watchable </connor>
<connor> no i agree in halloween because </connor>
<joey> everything is like ghost specials yeah </joey>
<connor> that's all the [ __ ] that's why like </connor>
<joey> even though i wasn't i wasn't saying </joey>
<joey> like you're [ __ ] stupid if you </joey>
<joey> believe this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> the last time we spoke about this i got </joey>
<connor> like the comments people like were </connor>
<connor> saying to me they were some of them were </connor>
<connor> like really [ __ ] rude about it they </connor>
<connor> were like connor's just he just thinks </connor>
<connor> everyone's stupid if they don't believe </connor>
<connor> him like no they didn't say that it's </connor>
<garnt> like i personally i think that stuff to </garnt>
<connor> me yeah is is dumb yeah but i would </connor>
<connor> never be like you're a dumb person i </connor>
<garnt> believe well i i think the important </garnt>
<garnt> thing is that you like people recognize </garnt>
<connor> it is a belief and people have </connor>
<garnt> experienced it sometimes </garnt>
<joey> people can believe different things but </joey>
<garnt> you never want to make them feel like </garnt>
<garnt> they've been discredited for feeling the </garnt>
<connor> way they do i think that's why we have </connor>
<connor> such a tough political climate right </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> because because for a long time all </connor>
<connor> these really uh </connor>
<connor> extreme beliefs were like oh you're </connor>
<joey> stupid they're the most i think that's </joey>
<joey> the problem as well is that there's </joey>
<joey> really a difference between people who </joey>
<garnt> have a belief of like this could be true </garnt>
<connor> and then the people who swear that is </connor>
<connor> true yeah and like like i'm one of those </connor>
<connor> people together yeah and they get mixed </connor>
<connor> together and it's like and that's where </connor>
<connor> like the bad image comes like i'm </connor>
<garnt> definitely one of those people who is </garnt>
<garnt> the former where it's like i believe </garnt>
<garnt> this could be a possibility and i find </garnt>
<garnt> it more fun personally to think of it in </garnt>
<joey> that sense but i'm not going to come out </joey>
<joey> and say like ghosts are real 100 no cap </joey>
<joey> no no i mean all right like i'm not </joey>
<garnt> going to say that like we just discussed </garnt>
<garnt> you can't prove ghosts are not real but </garnt>
<garnt> you can't prove ghosts of [ __ ] views </garnt>
<joey> yeah exactly but like i have more </joey>
<connor> enjoyment </connor>
<connor> i hate the argument of you can't prove </connor>
<garnt> it's not really i personally have the </garnt>
<garnt> enjoyment of thinking you know what </garnt>
<joey> there is a possibility we just don't </joey>
<joey> know and that's what i find exciting </joey>
<joey> about believing in this thing yeah i </joey>
<garnt> feel great for me for me it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's less of just it's less of just like </garnt>
<garnt> this is a fun thing for me to believe </garnt>
<garnt> and it's more of just like you know </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's had different experience i've </garnt>
<garnt> had like my own experience as well and i </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't i guess like i couldn't </garnt>
<garnt> logically explain it and so what </garnt>
<connor> happened was well </connor>
<connor> at this moment with my experiences and </connor>
<connor> what i've seen it's more likely for me </connor>
<connor> that it exists and it doesn't exist and </connor>
<connor> am i open to the fact that maybe what i </connor>
<connor> experienced wasn't real you know i'm </connor>
<connor> open either way but right now based on </connor>
<garnt> my experience i'm just like yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> believe it and that's what i think i </garnt>
<joey> believe </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's all about whether you're </connor>
<connor> no cat facts no printer it's all about i </connor>
<connor> guess like whether you're just like </connor>
<joey> naturally susceptible to i guess like </joey>
<joey> believing in things like spirituality </joey>
<connor> yeah i think that kind of definitely is </connor>
<joey> uh if you didn't grow up with that side </joey>
<joey> right i feel it's a little harder yeah </joey>
<connor> it definitely comes i mean </connor>
<connor> everyone around me was quite religious </connor>
<connor> christian or catholic etc </connor>
<connor> um i just i think </connor>
<garnt> my problem probably uh where i started </garnt>
<garnt> to grow a disdain towards that stuff is </garnt>
<garnt> i just didn't enjoy it when i was </garnt>
<garnt> younger like i hated church i hated all </garnt>
<garnt> that stuff right </garnt>
<garnt> and then you know when you get older and </garnt>
<garnt> you discover the internet you're like oh </garnt>
<connor> wow i can do my own research and then </connor>
<connor> you start like googling stuff and yeah </connor>
<connor> and then uh i don't know i think i was </connor>
<joey> very and then the four chance scientists </joey>
<connor> come out shadows </connor>
<joey> um yeah i i think is entirely reflective </joey>
<joey> of how i view the world like i </joey>
<joey> you know i guess what like what's the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] meaning of life bro boy what </joey>
<joey> rogers bro you're gonna bring that out </joey>
<joey> man what is this [ __ ] trash chase </joey>
<connor> right now okay like why why what are we </connor>
<connor> what is it what is our purpose man what </connor>
<joey> are we doing rick and morty it's too </joey>
<joey> deep down the stand rig </joey>
<joey> i don't know man it's just like oh you </joey>
<connor> know the same reason why when i look at </connor>
<connor> a i look at a fish what's the what's the </connor>
<connor> fish doing what's the fish's purpose </connor>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> to get in my stomach that's right </joey>
<connor> exactly perfect just be [ __ ] eaten by </connor>
<joey> someone else right yeah so </joey>
<joey> like you said he's sitting around being </joey>
<connor> like so what is the purpose of this so i </connor>
<connor> sit here and i look at like all these </connor>
<connor> animals that just there to be eaten or </connor>
<connor> to survive and i think that in some </connor>
<connor> senses we're just the same we're not </connor>
<garnt> we're not we don't have some grand </garnt>
<garnt> purpose to have some spiritual </garnt>
<garnt> experience it's just we're just here to </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] eat and get on with our [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> life </garnt>
<garnt> if i want to play some goddamn league of </garnt>
<garnt> legends for 12 hours a day that the </garnt>
<garnt> universe has allowed me because i've </garnt>
<connor> done my duty which is survive and now i </connor>
<connor> can mentally destroy my life be a league </connor>
<connor> but you know i think once you've done </connor>
<joey> once you've survived that's it i believe </joey>
<joey> i believe they call that a nihilist </joey>
<connor> the problem is is that now we just have </connor>
<connor> now now survival is just the rules have </connor>
<connor> changed man you're used to being a sigma </connor>
<connor> male man no it's hard are they gonna pay </connor>
<joey> bills [ __ ] man i gotta be sigma mail </joey>
<connor> while i pay the bills [ __ ] that single </connor>
<garnt> mail don't pay your bills number one </garnt>
<garnt> sigma mail grinds bills pay you </garnt>
<connor> yeah i don't know because that's you </connor>
<garnt> know i i don't really believe there's a </garnt>
<joey> lot of uh a lot of [ __ ] going on in life </joey>
<joey> i just kind of think that you just kind </joey>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> just find that you get to get popped and </joey>
<connor> you just what you're doing that's fine </connor>
<connor> i i wish that i could have some more </connor>
<joey> enjoyment out of it </joey>
<joey> i would but that's just not how i feel i </joey>
<joey> don't know why that's fine man i wonder </joey>
<connor> what made me feel that way well how do </connor>
<connor> you guys feel about it is he comfortable </connor>
<joey> talking about it yeah yeah sure um yeah </joey>
<joey> i guess like i don't know for me it's </joey>
<joey> like at least with like the whole ghost </joey>
<joey> thing for me is like obviously i had </joey>
<joey> that story i told you guys about my </joey>
<connor> sister going through you feel like it </connor>
<connor> reflects your kind of spiritual </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i i believe more i have a </garnt>
<connor> lot more um </connor>
<connor> respect for spirituality then i do </connor>
<joey> religion i think i organize religion i </joey>
<garnt> agree </garnt>
<garnt> i agree with the podcast we're talking </garnt>
<connor> about this yeah </connor>
<garnt> we don't want to go too deep </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god we're we're like take we're </garnt>
<garnt> taking on every topic that you shouldn't </garnt>
<connor> be talking about right now </connor>
<joey> let's talk about </joey>
<connor> for me personally it's like again </connor>
<connor> because i did grow up in uh </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean like yeah it was like the </connor>
<connor> whole shintoist belief and you know used </connor>
<connor> to go to temples all the time and you </connor>
<connor> know would hear stories about it yeah </connor>
<joey> you know my grandparents like being very </joey>
<joey> you know shintoist and just believing in </joey>
<joey> again like that whole spirituality and </joey>
<joey> like that like i like spirituality yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah like </joey>
<joey> i like something </joey>
<connor> you know i can get behind anything that </connor>
<connor> the general belief is be good and you </connor>
<garnt> will get good like yeah you know being </garnt>
<joey> nice to people like when i was a kid you </joey>
<garnt> know my grandma would tell me like uh </garnt>
<garnt> you know like don't throw the rubbish in </garnt>
<garnt> the river not because it's bad for the </garnt>
<garnt> pollution but because the river god is </garnt>
<garnt> going to get angry at you and i'll come </garnt>
<garnt> back to bite you in the ass i'm like oh </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] well i don't want to anger them </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'll do that right right it might </garnt>
<garnt> be a little bit of an ass backwards </garnt>
<garnt> logic but you know as a kid like that is </garnt>
<joey> i think a healthy way to like look at it </joey>
<joey> that's a logical explanation get behind </joey>
<joey> anything but it's generally just be a </joey>
<joey> nice person yeah exactly just give back </joey>
<joey> yeah that's like because i feel like i'm </joey>
<connor> i want to do that just myself i don't </connor>
<connor> need some um </connor>
<joey> kind of uh belief system for me to do </joey>
<connor> that yeah i just want to be a good </connor>
<joey> person and do that right </joey>
<joey> i'm not walking around as a 27 year old </joey>
<joey> going oh [ __ ] i better not anger this </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> right but like at the back of my mind </connor>
<joey> there is a part where it's you know </joey>
<connor> it builds like not only respect for </connor>
<connor> surroundings around you but also just </connor>
<connor> becoming a better person and it's like </connor>
<connor> you do what you have to believe in as </connor>
<connor> long as you're not hurting anyone else </connor>
<connor> believe what you have to believe in to </connor>
<garnt> be a better person no because uh like my </garnt>
<connor> experience was you know obviously i was </connor>
<connor> raised up to be a buddhist and </connor>
<connor> everything like that in my life yeah i </connor>
<connor> mean okay so i was so his here's a bit </connor>
<joey> more behind that backstory right so i </joey>
<joey> was a monk when i was like a kid yeah </joey>
<joey> write it down write it down </joey>
<joey> uh so as i said before i was among two </joey>
<joey> times my life one time as a kid one time </joey>
<joey> as an adult </joey>
<garnt> so the kid thing was basically doing it </garnt>
<garnt> so i could like you know give good karma </garnt>
<garnt> to my family because that's just how </garnt>
<connor> that's just how i was great you know i </connor>
<connor> was too gently i thought you're on about </connor>
<joey> reddit then </joey>
<garnt> finally enough karma was the concept </garnt>
<garnt> that existed before ready </garnt>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<garnt> um so so then i you know so then after </garnt>
<garnt> that i went to university grew up and </garnt>
<garnt> everything and then i had this i i had </garnt>
<garnt> this you know uh spiritual experience uh </garnt>
<connor> with with uh </connor>
<connor> with with some people and then after </connor>
<connor> having that experience i kind of just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i don't know what the right word or the </connor>
<connor> right term to like coin this as but i </connor>
<connor> just kind of realized that i didn't know </connor>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] i believed right yeah </garnt>
<connor> right because because because i had this </connor>
<garnt> experience that i couldn't explain </garnt>
<garnt> logically and i was like an engineer </garnt>
<joey> before so i'm just like everything </joey>
<joey> scientifically </joey>
<joey> scientific everything can be explained </joey>
<joey> logically had this experience and then i </joey>
<joey> kind of realized </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] what do i believe right and then </joey>
<garnt> then and then at that point i've </garnt>
<garnt> realized everything that i believed </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't because i actually believed it </garnt>
<garnt> but it was just because that was what i </garnt>
<connor> was raised to believe so yeah that's </connor>
<joey> that's one thing that's really difficult </joey>
<joey> because i mean you have to be raised </joey>
<joey> so it's kind of hard to get an unbiased </joey>
<garnt> view of like a a religion or a </garnt>
<garnt> spirituality because you often have so </garnt>
<garnt> much like baggage or kind of backstory </garnt>
<connor> with that kind of thing so it's often </connor>
<garnt> hard to look at it critically yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> like that that was like actually a huge </garnt>
<garnt> turning point in my life that like </garnt>
<garnt> basically put my clean uh put me like </garnt>
<garnt> put me on a clean slate and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> okay i'm going to become a monk now and </garnt>
<garnt> that was like that was like the actual </garnt>
<garnt> point when i'm like damn i'm going to </garnt>
<garnt> become a monk not because my parents </garnt>
<garnt> told me to but because i need to like </garnt>
<garnt> figure this [ __ ] out yeah myself and </garnt>
<garnt> figure out is this what i actually </garnt>
<garnt> believe or is it </garnt>
<garnt> or is it something that was instilled to </garnt>
<garnt> me as a kid and so that was like that </garnt>
<garnt> was like the big decision maker to be </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm gonna start something new in my </garnt>
<garnt> life i'm going to like try to </garnt>
<connor> experience this lifestyle not because </connor>
<connor> not because anyone told me to but </connor>
<connor> because i chose this i chose to </connor>
<connor> experience this and whatever comes out </connor>
<connor> of this experience and what whatever </connor>
<connor> comes out of these beliefs are my own </connor>
<connor> and that's why right now i you know so i </connor>
<connor> became a monk when you were [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> alone by yourself with your thoughts for </connor>
<connor> four uh for four weeks or a month two </connor>
<connor> months uh you have a you have a lot of </connor>
<connor> time to think about [ __ ] right yeah and </connor>
<connor> so in these in these like two months you </connor>
<connor> be i basically just like had time to </connor>
<connor> rewind my entire life and basically </connor>
<connor> break down </connor>
<connor> why </connor>
<connor> i believe the things i do and why i'm </connor>
<connor> the person i am yeah and </connor>
<connor> like after becoming a monk and after </connor>
<connor> having that time to myself and you know </connor>
<connor> studying you know i already knew about </connor>
<connor> you know buddhist the british religion </connor>
<garnt> and the buddhist beliefs and the and so </garnt>
<garnt> i after that i knew what i believed out </garnt>
<garnt> of let's say what the traditional </garnt>
<garnt> religion teaches you yeah but i also had </garnt>
<garnt> my own beliefs and my own views on top </garnt>
<connor> of that i think that's why it should be </connor>
<connor> though i think that's you should take </connor>
<connor> the cause of something you like a </connor>
<joey> structure that you and like a of a </joey>
<joey> spirit or whatever that you like and </joey>
<joey> then just kind of add your own like </joey>
<joey> things that you really want to i mean </joey>
<joey> japan is pretty notorious for that right </joey>
<joey> and it's like yeah this is what we </joey>
<connor> believe i don't know like the whole </connor>
<connor> thing with that karma as well like i i </connor>
<connor> almost in like a scientific way i think </connor>
<connor> that if you know if if generally if </connor>
<joey> you're a good uh you know your positive </joey>
<connor> impact on on people i think just it just </connor>
<connor> comes back like yeah every reaction is </connor>
<connor> do i believe there's this cosmic system </connor>
<garnt> well like like god's keeping track </garnt>
<joey> of someone's keeping dragging like oh </joey>
<joey> you're all naughty </joey>
<connor> i'd like to think so yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean i could just go and do whatever </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] i wanted yeah yeah yeah yeah so </joey>
<garnt> it's going to soup kitchen soup kitchen </garnt>
<connor> but do i believe in like in general if </connor>
<garnt> you're a good person that it will come </garnt>
<connor> back 100 yeah of course of course i </connor>
<garnt> truly believe that and like </garnt>
<garnt> that's that i guess is the biggest thing </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest change before like before me </garnt>
<garnt> just being told what to believe and </garnt>
<garnt> actually like deciding what i believe </garnt>
<garnt> it's like once you decided it or once i </garnt>
<garnt> decided it nothing can change my opinion </garnt>
<garnt> because i was like i'm so like set in my </garnt>
<garnt> beliefs because this is basically </garnt>
<garnt> everything that i've built from my </garnt>
<garnt> entire experience of life and the only </garnt>
<garnt> thing that can change this is new things </garnt>
<garnt> i experience because like </garnt>
<garnt> because that and to me that's why i </garnt>
<garnt> guess </garnt>
<garnt> nothing really phases me when it comes </garnt>
<garnt> to like arguing about my beliefs like my </garnt>
<connor> core beliefs because i'm i'm sorry i'm </connor>
<connor> very set in it i don't i don't really </connor>
<connor> feel like i have anything controversial </connor>
<connor> either i just kind of like yeah man just </connor>
<connor> be good i mean like you say like you had </connor>
<connor> all this whole experience but i mean </connor>
<connor> ultimately we came to the same </connor>
<connor> conclusion right </connor>
<connor> through our own means right i think </connor>
<connor> that's what it's about i don't know i i </connor>
<joey> don't have a problem with how however </joey>
<connor> you want to do your life just don't yeah </connor>
<joey> don't be a negative impact </joey>
<joey> again you're free to believe whatever </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] you believe just don't like </joey>
<garnt> hurt or inconvenience others yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> like what pisses me off is when people </joey>
<connor> try to put their beliefs on other people </connor>
<joey> like yeah i have my core beliefs and i </joey>
<connor> firmly believe them but i would never </connor>
<joey> try to say hey this is my experience and </joey>
<garnt> you should experience and believe </garnt>
<joey> exactly the same thing as me because </joey>
<garnt> because to me to me you can't you can't </garnt>
<garnt> force that on someone you know you can </garnt>
<connor> you can raise a kid but i hope my kid </connor>
<connor> goes to the exact same thing that i went </connor>
<connor> through when they realized [ __ ] i i need </connor>
<connor> to like decide this [ __ ] for myself yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm sure there's a lot of people </connor>
<connor> watching this i've never thought about </connor>
<connor> this deeply and you know for that that's </connor>
<connor> not exactly a bad thing because </connor>
<garnt> it's something that i never had to think </garnt>
<garnt> about until i had some experience that </garnt>
<garnt> forced me to like put myself put me in </garnt>
<connor> this position to think about it there's </connor>
<garnt> not there's no you can just go your </garnt>
<garnt> whole life and you've been you've been </garnt>
<garnt> raised to believe a certain thing yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and you just never questioned it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i always found quite like </garnt>
<connor> odds because i was always questioning </connor>
<connor> everything from like the get-go like </connor>
<connor> anything they told me i was like no yeah </connor>
<connor> i wanna i don't believe that </connor>
<connor> you know which is strange because i i </connor>
<connor> i guess that's why i'm so adverse to </connor>
<connor> stuff like that because ever since a </connor>
<connor> young age i can remember i was the </connor>
<garnt> annoying kid who was like no i don't i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think that's right </garnt>
<garnt> you know but that's just because i i </garnt>
<connor> don't know how i i don't know where i </connor>
<connor> got that mindset from but i've always </connor>
<joey> been like that </joey>
<joey> i guess just some people just don't </joey>
<garnt> really question things because they just </garnt>
<garnt> think oh if i just follow what everyone </garnt>
<garnt> else believes and if i just follow the </garnt>
<connor> crowd then nothing can go wrong right so </connor>
<connor> you're telling me i'm a sigma manager </connor>
<joey> i'm saying that you're a leader </joey>
<connor> you're a leader in your own mind i don't </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<garnt> yeah i just think some people just have </garnt>
<joey> never thought that deeply about it and </joey>
<connor> that's fine well there's there's a lot </connor>
<joey> of people i've met in your life dude </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of people i've met who are </joey>
<joey> just happy yeah you know they're just </joey>
<joey> kids </joey>
<joey> and they've they've never like they've </joey>
<garnt> honestly i wish i was more like that </garnt>
<connor> because my god like some people out here </connor>
<joey> an existential crisis in the bathtub </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> meanwhile members of the church of the </joey>
<joey> flying spaghetti monster are like we're </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] happy dude we got there we got a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] spaghetti monster on our side </joey>
<garnt> yeah for me for me i just think just </garnt>
<garnt> don't try to put your beliefs on other </garnt>
<garnt> people try to accept what anyone else </garnt>
<garnt> believes even if it's like different </garnt>
<garnt> from yours you can believe what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> you want you can like if people want to </garnt>
<joey> hear about your experiences and give you </joey>
<joey> that opportunity then go ahead tell your </joey>
<joey> experiences tell your beliefs but if if </joey>
<joey> if they're not interested which a lot of </joey>
<joey> people are not going to be interested </joey>
<joey> then just give them that don't get </joey>
<joey> offended don't don't get offended and </joey>
<garnt> don't get offended when they believe </garnt>
<garnt> something different as well definitely </garnt>
<connor> understood that whole aspect of it </connor>
<connor> getting really angry about other </connor>
<connor> people's </connor>
<joey> well like being like how dear you don't </joey>
<connor> believe the same thing i believe that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah i never got that either </connor>
<garnt> it just seems very like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know it's like you're very like </garnt>
<connor> like self-concerned about like yeah </connor>
<joey> weird feeling </joey>
<connor> and [ __ ] like that it's like she's gonna </connor>
<connor> be able to be comfortable somewhere yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i guess uh if you have a a dietary </connor>
<garnt> requirement yeah it's not a big deal </garnt>
<connor> it's like it's like one meal of my life </connor>
<garnt> that we won't be able to eat pork like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i think i think i'll be all right </garnt>
<joey> like i'm not offended yeah </joey>
<joey> it's fine i'm good </joey>
<connor> you know and even then it's like it's </connor>
<joey> you know it's uh it's it's kind of </joey>
<joey> strange i don't know </joey>
<joey> it's deep it's deep so we're going a bit </joey>
<garnt> of a lighter topic </garnt>
<garnt> where's the poop there's not enough poop </garnt>
<joey> in this episode i just [ __ ] myself </joey>
<connor> so i've been addicted to like a new type </connor>
<connor> of video recently like i know what </connor>
<garnt> sometimes sometimes the youtube </garnt>
<garnt> algorithm just works in like mysterious </garnt>
<joey> ways right you know what you know what a </joey>
<joey> story that starts off with that sentence </joey>
<joey> isn't going to lead to anything yeah so </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> i get this video recommended on my </connor>
<connor> youtube which is like oh uh </connor>
<joey> someone sharing cow hooves and like they </joey>
<garnt> get instant relief from bubbles oh my </garnt>
<connor> gosh </connor>
<connor> yes </connor>
<connor> videos that i would never subscribe for </connor>
<connor> but are pleasantly surprising when i </connor>
<connor> watch them yeah stuff like restoration </connor>
<garnt> uh cleaning cars yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> there was one that was like testing </garnt>
<garnt> mouse traps </garnt>
<garnt> and this guy worked on a farm and he </garnt>
<garnt> just had like every single goddamn mouse </garnt>
<garnt> trap on yeah yeah and it was just like </garnt>
<joey> weirdly like like weirdly like kind of </joey>
<connor> like oh that's cool how the trap works </connor>
<joey> yeah so i'm watching my style so i kind </joey>
<joey> of feel bad i feel i feel the same way </joey>
<joey> about like guys who are in like massive </joey>
<joey> ant farms and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> that makes me so anxious yeah whole </connor>
<joey> living it's like damn like a whole life </joey>
<joey> like one [ __ ] one [ __ ] up and like </joey>
<garnt> you're just it just ants everything's </garnt>
<joey> everywhere you burn the house now i mean </joey>
<garnt> he doesn't have to invite people over </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think he gets out of having to have </garnt>
<garnt> the friends over yeah yeah oh yeah i </garnt>
<connor> wouldn't invite you but i've got the end </connor>
<connor> phone </connor>
<garnt> yeah i remember just watching the cowher </garnt>
<garnt> videos and i was i've never been i've </garnt>
<garnt> never seen something that i've been that </garnt>
<joey> is like disgusting but weirdly relaxing </joey>
<joey> as well it's it's yes this it's because </joey>
<garnt> that [ __ ] comes off so clean it's it </garnt>
<garnt> comes off so clean and just it's kind of </garnt>
<connor> like you know it's it's kind of like </connor>
<garnt> scratching an itch or something like </garnt>
<connor> that you know where she's like six year </connor>
<garnt> videos </garnt>
<connor> yeah just just </connor>
<garnt> like seeing the seeing the pus come out </garnt>
<garnt> of like the cowl hooves it's like </garnt>
<garnt> disgusting but like for some for some </garnt>
<joey> reason when you see the words instant </joey>
<joey> relief in the title you're just like i'm </joey>
<joey> happy for the cow man i'm i'm happy at </joey>
<joey> least </joey>
<garnt> in the title is just like i feel better </garnt>
<garnt> now i feel better for the couch it's </garnt>
<connor> disgusting what you should just do with </connor>
<connor> cows if we did we're doing this well </connor>
<connor> they're just like chilling just with </connor>
<connor> their like disgusting toes yeah they </connor>
<joey> were just like just you know standing </joey>
<joey> out in the paddock just chewing grass </joey>
<joey> being like well i'm in insufferable pain </joey>
<garnt> right now but you know what am i [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah because because like i got </connor>
<garnt> like evolution kind of [ __ ] up there </garnt>
<connor> like my feet don't just collect [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yeah i'm unable to clean them yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because like these these cow hooves are </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] hard because what they have </joey>
<joey> to do used to share them is like razor </joey>
<joey> sharp and they can like </joey>
<joey> barely barely get through them so how </joey>
<garnt> the [ __ ] these cows can survive without </garnt>
<garnt> humans is just beyond me because i've </garnt>
<connor> seen some of the cow videos put them in </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] cages </connor>
<joey> maybe the reason why like you know when </joey>
<joey> cows tip over and they can't get up it's </joey>
<joey> not because they can't get us because </joey>
<joey> they don't want to [ __ ] they're like </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> thank god </joey>
<garnt> my feet breathe jesus because like i </garnt>
<garnt> imagine it's just like the worst ingrown </garnt>
<connor> toenail you've ever had but you don't </connor>
<connor> have anything to cut it yeah and like </connor>
<connor> i've had some pretty bad ingrown </connor>
<garnt> toenails so i feel some kind of </garnt>
<garnt> spiritual connection to the cow just </garnt>
<joey> seeing this pus come out right if god </joey>
<joey> were to make a video like that he put </joey>
<joey> like instant relief hashtag relatable </joey>
<joey> say oh [ __ ] if it's relatable yeah i </joey>
