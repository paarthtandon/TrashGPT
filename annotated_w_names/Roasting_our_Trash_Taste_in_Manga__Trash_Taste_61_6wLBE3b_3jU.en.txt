<connor> welcome to this episode of trash taste </connor>
<connor> with me your host connor and the boys </connor>
<garnt> joey and gant that's us that's us </garnt>
<garnt> nice of you to be hosting uh the manga </garnt>
<connor> episode right i was gonna get into that </connor>
<garnt> gone okay we're all gentlemen here we're </garnt>
<joey> all we're all uh connoisseurs of the </joey>
<garnt> fine arts we'll read words </garnt>
<garnt> you know the trash taste law right you </garnt>
<garnt> you know our character development and </garnt>
<garnt> you know you know the best reader of all </garnt>
<connor> time is obviously connor exactly </connor>
<connor> i am reading </connor>
<joey> that's it librarians wish they could </joey>
<connor> have connor's brain right now they they </connor>
<connor> wish they could access this fountain of </connor>
<garnt> knowledge </garnt>
<garnt> and we thought obviously the best host </garnt>
<garnt> for the manga centric episode which we </garnt>
<garnt> are going to be doing today we don't </garnt>
<connor> choose host scan </connor>
<garnt> it's a rotation yeah and it just the </garnt>
<joey> stars aligned they were sending us a </joey>
<joey> message just like it's connor's turn </joey>
<connor> caught a mustache who's the mongoose </connor>
<garnt> episode yeah so that's what we're doing </garnt>
<joey> today like you've hosted the dojinchi </joey>
<connor> episode as well i just realized my </connor>
<connor> complete chance and now you've also </connor>
<joey> hosted the manga episode right gonna say </joey>
<connor> i read yeah </connor>
<joey> i'm somewhat of a reader myself </joey>
<garnt> anyway yeah as we've said this is the </garnt>
<garnt> manga episode of trash taste where we're </garnt>
<connor> gonna be discussing our favorite mangas </connor>
<connor> on our favorite preferred method which </connor>
<connor> is gonna be the three by three which you </connor>
<connor> see on there we've talked about manga in </connor>
<connor> the past in a lot of different episodes </connor>
<connor> but uh i don't think we've actually </connor>
<joey> established like what our all-time </joey>
<joey> favorite manga is or like our manga </joey>
<garnt> tastes cool yeah it's it's really weird </garnt>
<garnt> because when we were thinking about what </garnt>
<garnt> if what haven't we like specifically </garnt>
<garnt> talked about on theme in an episode and </garnt>
<garnt> i was like wait a minute we've never </garnt>
<garnt> talked about manga and for some reason i </garnt>
<garnt> just assumed that we already had yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because it feels like we have right yeah </garnt>
<joey> exactly but like it just i was like well </joey>
<joey> we did the anime once obviously we did </joey>
<connor> the mongols right right </connor>
<connor> and of course i'm a bit uh </connor>
<connor> thinking i was thinking about the fact </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> i wonder because the movie one that we </connor>
<connor> did recently uh is probably gonna have a </connor>
<connor> lot more variation i feel like this must </connor>
<joey> be some more overlap this time right </joey>
<garnt> yeah i'm i really don't know like </garnt>
<connor> there's one or two i'm like i'm pretty </connor>
<connor> sure if it's not on your list you would </connor>
<joey> put it on your list anyway there's at </joey>
<connor> least one i know that i probably i mean </connor>
<connor> yeah you're kind of limited in your i </connor>
<garnt> mean you're so expensive i mean i i know </garnt>
<connor> i've probably got at least one that's </connor>
<garnt> the same as you i think i might have one </garnt>
<connor> that's the same as joey as well here's </connor>
<connor> what i realized uh when i recently read </connor>
<connor> uh records of ragnarok yeah is that i've </connor>
<connor> only read really long running manga yeah </connor>
<connor> i've not i don't think i've read a </connor>
<connor> single manga that had like less than 150 </connor>
<connor> chapters </connor>
<garnt> i would actually agree with you on that </garnt>
<connor> i've it's okay so i realized when </connor>
<connor> picking my three by three is that there </connor>
<connor> isn't that much choice or there isn't as </connor>
<connor> much choice as there is in the anime </connor>
<connor> world right of like manga that really </connor>
<connor> left a deep impression on me and that's </connor>
<garnt> because like manga you know if if you </garnt>
<garnt> watch a season of anime it actually </garnt>
<garnt> takes less time to consume it than </garnt>
<garnt> reading a really long running manga </garnt>
<garnt> series because if it's like a like a one </garnt>
<garnt> shot or like a one volume kind of thing </garnt>
<garnt> it probably was not going to leave that </garnt>
<garnt> deep of an effect on me i don't know man </garnt>
<joey> i've read a lot of one shots that were </joey>
<joey> like man this is </joey>
<connor> dead ass better than some like yeah </connor>
<connor> donald trump one shot </connor>
<garnt> that was good that left an impression on </garnt>
<garnt> me i didn't expect to see manga donald </garnt>
<garnt> trump but </garnt>
<garnt> surely that given uh </garnt>
<connor> i didn't realize how much i missed death </connor>
<connor> note until i read that one shot and i </connor>
<garnt> was like damn we kind of need a sequel </garnt>
<connor> to death he was just playing with us </connor>
<connor> that's the worst part is that it was </connor>
<connor> like it was like uh you know like the </connor>
<connor> pro coming back and just styling on </connor>
<garnt> everyone and then being like see you by </garnt>
<connor> the way yeah i mean like just being like </connor>
<connor> i could come back yeah i could kill it </connor>
<joey> it's like that villain wrestler who just </joey>
<joey> comes in clotheslines and then </joey>
<connor> builds all your furniture leaves yes </connor>
<connor> yeah but then i also realized making </connor>
<connor> this 3x3 is that i really haven't read </connor>
<garnt> as much manga as i have watched anime i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i i'm i'm unfortunately not the </garnt>
<garnt> manga man that's probably joey right i </garnt>
<connor> think i think in your head you feel like </connor>
<joey> manga is easier maybe maybe because </joey>
<connor> you're you can speak you can read </connor>
<joey> japanese fluently maybe </joey>
<joey> it is because you can just pick them up </joey>
<joey> yeah you should go to the store pay two </joey>
<joey> bucks get the manga and you're good to </joey>
<joey> go i mean as someone called the anime </joey>
<joey> man i obviously read a lot more monkeys </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> you know as we all know about it </joey>
<joey> and i i do think that if that was the </joey>
<joey> case i think i would probably read more </joey>
<joey> yeah but i think because the fact that </joey>
<connor> i'm not i do enjoy reading digitally i </connor>
<connor> like the ease of it but i do find that </connor>
<connor> it's a little more </connor>
<connor> i don't know it feels harder to get into </connor>
<joey> yeah i don't know why i mean digitally </joey>
<connor> yeah when i'm reading it i like it yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah but it's getting into it where i'm </joey>
<joey> like i don't know because when you when </joey>
<connor> you see it in the store you can pick it </connor>
<joey> up you can flick it through you're like </joey>
<joey> oh okay there's no better feeling than </joey>
<joey> like a physical right right right that's </joey>
<connor> when you really get into it right manga </connor>
<connor> because unlike normal books you have to </connor>
<joey> actually just read it </joey>
<joey> it pops right out you can see oh okay oh </joey>
<joey> and it feels a bit more intimate i guess </joey>
<joey> and i i guess like most the manga that i </joey>
<connor> put on my three by three i actually read </connor>
<connor> i've read on paper </connor>
<connor> and uh i feel like i don't know if </connor>
<connor> that's a complete coincidence some of </connor>
<connor> them some manga i know are really good </connor>
<connor> and i purposely will not read it unless </connor>
<garnt> it's physical copies yeah um other manga </garnt>
<garnt> i kind of like i maybe read online and </garnt>
<garnt> if it's like good then i try to go out </garnt>
<garnt> my way to buy physical copies </garnt>
<connor> yeah but i mean i like i'm saying i </connor>
<connor> think that for me at least a little bit </connor>
<garnt> anime is slightly easier to consume it </garnt>
<garnt> really depends i don't really understand </garnt>
<joey> how i consume manga </joey>
<joey> i don't really get it i think i like it </joey>
<joey> i understand but i don't think i </joey>
<joey> i get it it depends on the series for me </joey>
<joey> definitely like there are somewhere just </joey>
<joey> like i really [ __ ] struggled to like </joey>
<joey> get into the manga but for some reason </joey>
<joey> it's really easy to watch the anime vice </joey>
<garnt> versa yeah also another thing when i was </garnt>
<garnt> picking my three by three is like i </garnt>
<garnt> really did i tried not to pick </garnt>
<garnt> titles that already had like a big anime </garnt>
<garnt> adaptation or had or something that i </garnt>
<garnt> watched the anime and i feel like it </garnt>
<connor> doesn't make a change </connor>
<connor> you're trying to be like like i don't </connor>
<connor> watch the meme i don't read the means no </connor>
<garnt> because it's trying to be the artist </garnt>
<garnt> okay for example like i don't think </garnt>
<joey> there's any point me putting one piece </joey>
<joey> on on my on my three by three so it is </joey>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<connor> because the manga is the one with </connor>
<connor> everyone asking me why when i started it </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah because like the manga is </garnt>
<garnt> amazing but i feel like with that you </garnt>
<garnt> could easily you could either read the </garnt>
<garnt> manga or watch the anime and you could </garnt>
<garnt> either have like a good experience on </garnt>
<joey> each and everybody i don't think there's </joey>
<joey> a single person watching trash taste </joey>
<joey> that doesn't know what one piece yeah </joey>
<garnt> and i'm just like and i'm just like do i </garnt>
<connor> really need to tell my trash taste </connor>
<garnt> viewers that i am a one piece fan </garnt>
<connor> do you really need to know that i </connor>
<connor> i was my japanese class this morning and </connor>
<joey> uh it was like they made me listen to </joey>
<joey> like japanese people speak and tell them </joey>
<joey> what they were saying and i got totally </joey>
<joey> thrown off in one audio clip because </joey>
<joey> there was a woman talking about her </joey>
<joey> dress but it's one of the other ones </joey>
<connor> yeah one pizza and i was like </connor>
<connor> oh she likes red one one </connor>
<connor> piece </connor>
<garnt> i was like so thought i couldn't listen </garnt>
<garnt> to the rest of it like yeah should you </garnt>
<garnt> say one piece like the anime that you </garnt>
<connor> know we should have like the ptsd </connor>
<connor> yeah i was like one piece </connor>
<garnt> i can't escape it </garnt>
<garnt> when i was first getting into one piece </garnt>
<garnt> i really wanted to buy the manga volumes </garnt>
<garnt> obviously </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i typed in one piece on ebay and </garnt>
<joey> i'm just like don't give me a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dress i want the manga give me the manga </joey>
<connor> and i scroll down it's just like dress </connor>

<connor> right claymore one punch man berserk </connor>
<connor> jojo black butler gantz vinland saga and </connor>
<connor> i show 21. i wasn't expecting black </connor>
<garnt> butler there for some reason actually </garnt>
<garnt> okay i thought you were more of a fan of </garnt>
<garnt> the anime i didn't realize you wrote the </garnt>
<connor> manga of that yeah i've read what </connor>
<garnt> chapter i read up to i've read a good </garnt>
<garnt> chunk of black below i haven't caught up </garnt>
<garnt> because i know that a bunch of [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> happened and there's a lot of big plot </garnt>
<garnt> twists that i know about but i haven't </garnt>
<garnt> read yet right uh but i've read most of </garnt>
<garnt> black butler and it's so so much better </garnt>
<garnt> in manga format than anime because the </garnt>
<garnt> first yeah really the first okay the </garnt>
<garnt> first season is basically like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like a i don't know episodical slice of </garnt>
<garnt> life kind of thing that doesn't really </garnt>
<garnt> progress the story that much yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> the second season is just non-canonical </garnt>
<garnt> right of black butler </garnt>
<garnt> saw that sorry </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<joey> you know people kind of want to be like </joey>
<joey> oh he's the black butler guy but yeah i </joey>
<joey> don't like it i don't want to talk about </joey>
<joey> it now um but yeah the third season of </joey>
<joey> black butler the anime is based on like </joey>
<joey> the manga and it's amazing like it's </joey>
<joey> like a really morbid part it's really </joey>
<garnt> dark and you kind of realize how good it </garnt>
<garnt> can be yeah um but yeah the manga is a </garnt>
<garnt> really really good good read and i'd </garnt>
<garnt> recommend it if you kind of like the </garnt>
<garnt> idea of black butler but don't want to </garnt>
<garnt> go through with the anime yeah and i </garnt>
<connor> wouldn't have read it if it wasn't for </connor>
<garnt> my youtube videos yeah because like i've </garnt>
<garnt> heard the second season of black butler </garnt>
<garnt> is that different from the manga </garnt>
<connor> yeah completely </connor>
<connor> um but like genuinely give the manga a </connor>
<garnt> shot it's it's pretty good so what's </garnt>
<garnt> like different about the manga than the </garnt>
<garnt> anime that would you would recommend the </garnt>
<connor> manga over it </connor>
<connor> well it's like way more serious way more </connor>
<garnt> like it doesn't like [ __ ] around and it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't really feel like because the </garnt>
<joey> anime very much feels like it's kind of </joey>
<joey> just yowie bait at times yeah yeah it's </joey>
<joey> definitely generally pertained to its </joey>
<joey> audience yeah and it's very and the </joey>
<joey> first season again it's very casual it </joey>
<connor> doesn't really </connor>
<connor> it it does it does cover a lot of the </connor>
<connor> same things but it does it in a way that </connor>
<joey> i've just i think oh okay i watched </joey>
<joey> season one of the anime and i thought it </joey>
<joey> was like it's fun it's fun but the the </joey>
<connor> manga does it so much better it does so </connor>
<joey> much more justice and i feel today's </joey>
<joey> like art style is a lot just like more </joey>
<joey> gritty and like kind of different it's </joey>
<connor> so good well she gets better as well and </connor>
<connor> it's so good and the third seed of black </connor>
<connor> bat like covers like a circus arc yeah </connor>
<connor> and it's so good and the anime does it </connor>
<connor> justice </connor>
<garnt> of circles </garnt>
<joey> is like the anime finish now or or is </joey>
<joey> the manga finish sorry i think the man </joey>
<joey> is still going the manga is still </joey>
<connor> ongoing oh it's still going it's still </connor>
<connor> going okay it's quite long running and </connor>
<connor> um i don't know how many volumes around </connor>
<connor> i think we're over like 13 at this point </connor>
<joey> i think it's way more quite a lot i </joey>
<joey> think it's like over 20 now is it really </joey>
<connor> over 25. i think i've already read up to </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> 10 </joey>
<joey> all right but i really enjoyed it i </joey>
<joey> wanted i don't know why i stopped i'd </joey>
<joey> probably go and read it because you know </joey>
<connor> when you catch up to a certain point </connor>
<garnt> you're like i'm done yeah </garnt>
<connor> for me like my manga reading habits is </connor>
<connor> that i just love binge reading martial </connor>
<connor> yeah so much i can't once </connor>
<connor> 30 now volume 30 of black butler i know </connor>
<joey> i've read over </joey>
<joey> half i think right but i don't know how </joey>
<joey> long ago that was because i think what </joey>
<garnt> was happening is that i got really burnt </garnt>
<joey> out on it because i read so much of it </joey>
<joey> in like your space and your entire </joey>
<joey> career was yes </joey>
<joey> yeah then that happened then i got which </joey>
<joey> but i think this is probably going to </joey>
<joey> remind me to get back into it </joey>
<connor> because with one punch when i did that </connor>
<connor> as well which we'll talk about later </connor>
<connor> yeah but genuinely i think even though </connor>
<connor> if you've seen the show i would give it </connor>
<connor> a shot yeah i've definitely i i did </connor>
<connor> remember giving the black butler manga a </connor>
<connor> go like after i finished watching season </connor>
<connor> one yeah because i just at that point </connor>
<joey> season two had already finished airing </joey>
<garnt> and i just heard yeah don't watch season </garnt>
<connor> two yeah so i was like all right time </connor>
<garnt> for the manga then and i just never got </garnt>
<connor> to it yeah and there's some it's </connor>
<connor> really really dark at times like you </connor>
<joey> forget like the main premise is that in </joey>
<joey> black butler he hits a demon and then </joey>
<connor> he's made a contract with him yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> to have his life at the end yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and like they kind of play off it a lot </connor>
<garnt> in the anime and make it seem like oh </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of hot huh it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> okay you know but uh yeah in the manga </garnt>
<garnt> they constantly remind you sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> like oh [ __ ] he just like murders people </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah they're straight up and </garnt>
<garnt> they're not afraid of like showing like </garnt>
<garnt> really morbid stuff yeah some really </garnt>
<garnt> good plot twists you know like i won't </garnt>
<garnt> spoil some of them but there's some </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] up [ __ ] that happens in </garnt>
<garnt> that right and it's really worth giving </garnt>
<joey> it a shot even though all the stereo not </joey>
<joey> stereotypes what the all the uh what's </joey>
<joey> the word </joey>
<joey> facade i guess facade or the </joey>
<joey> preconceptions that a lot of the western </joey>
<connor> anime fans have i think in japan it's </connor>
<joey> pretty [ __ ] popular i think oh yes </joey>
<joey> but it's popular but it definitely does </joey>
<joey> have like a strong female audience yeah </joey>
<connor> i mean sebastian is iconic yeah i mean </connor>
<joey> being the sexy man </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean he was like the sexy </garnt>
<garnt> man of anime for like the early two the </garnt>
<connor> early to mid-2000s i still argue if you </connor>
<connor> make a list of top five sexiest anime </connor>
<connor> characters sebastian's on like yeah he </connor>
<garnt> is just sexy he just has that like she </garnt>
<connor> has that like cult folks hit the pubs </connor>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> it's black butler in it like he's just </garnt>
<garnt> he's just an icon of his time for like </garnt>
<garnt> anime and manga at the time like for </garnt>
<joey> like there's there's a few like i'd say </joey>
<joey> characters in like anime that just </joey>
<joey> personified a certain character trait </joey>
<joey> like do you think of yandere for our </joey>
<connor> generation he's [ __ ] you know right </connor>
<joey> right you know what i mean you think </joey>
<connor> sexy man it's sebastian from black </connor>
<garnt> butler yeah don't think anyone's </garnt>
<joey> replaced him yet yeah i know i mean the </joey>
<connor> one that got close was maybe like yuri </connor>
<connor> from uranus oh yeah but even then even </connor>
<joey> then </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah i don't think he's just i </connor>
<connor> don't think he's just charming </connor>
<garnt> is just a staple of like it's like the </garnt>
<connor> sexy butler yeah of and but also just </connor>
<connor> very swat very charismatic yeah like </connor>
<connor> it's very entertaining and i feel like </connor>
<joey> sebastian does carry it a lot of the </joey>
<joey> time because he's just so fun and even </joey>
<joey> though he is like obedient he's just he </joey>
<joey> makes it so entertaining yeah and and </joey>
<joey> you know again and even my videos i </joey>
<joey> didn't didn't even remotely do him </joey>
<joey> justice he's such he's so witty and so </joey>
<joey> clever in the anime and the manga sorry </joey>
<joey> it's it's so he's so fun to watch </joey>
<joey> and the uh you know the third season of </joey>
<garnt> the anime is good and the uh book of </garnt>
<garnt> murder i think it's called is that </garnt>
<garnt> correct book of murder is pretty fun </garnt>
<garnt> it's like kind of like a mini whodunit </garnt>
<garnt> right all right within like in like two </garnt>
<garnt> hours it's pretty fun that's cool yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's uh obviously </garnt>
<garnt> sebastian solves everything and does it </garnt>
<garnt> magically which is always fun because </garnt>
<connor> because it's like what if shakamoto </connor>
<connor> became a butler later on in life </connor>
<garnt> that that is </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like sebastian and sakamoto are </garnt>
<garnt> just like they're lyrics </garnt>
<joey> you know what i mean they're literally </joey>
<joey> the same person </joey>
<joey> sakamoto is just sebastian in school </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> because they literally have the same </connor>
<connor> kind of like it's </connor>
<connor> maybe maybe sakamoto is a little more uh </connor>
<connor> tongue-in-cheek yeah but sebastian very </connor>
<connor> much has the same kind of uh visual </connor>
<connor> humor a lot of the time and does like a </connor>
<garnt> lot of </garnt>
<garnt> you know he's the joke is often that he </garnt>
<garnt> is just so insanely competent at </garnt>
<garnt> everything he's just so op he is </garnt>
<garnt> literally opie as [ __ ] but it's amazing </garnt>
<garnt> like it's so good i just love it it's so </garnt>
<garnt> and it's i feel like there's </garnt>
<garnt> this not a manga that that has the same </garnt>
<garnt> feeling as black butler i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> there's a single manga that feels like </garnt>
<connor> it or anime show that has the same kind </connor>
<garnt> of vibe yeah yeah yeah i feel it </garnt>
<garnt> definitely like created a staple for </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> genre like there's probably a lot of </garnt>
<connor> manga that's imitating black butler 100 </connor>
<connor> percent </connor>
<connor> yeah because there's not many manga out </connor>
<connor> there that do like </connor>
<connor> deal with like pretty intense themes </connor>
<connor> they have like all these like thriller </connor>
<connor> aspects they also have the the you know </connor>
<connor> the what parts that appeal to the fuji </connor>
<connor> is quite a lot yeah right so it kind of </connor>
<connor> mixes a lot of genres together and i </connor>
<joey> think even jana tobaso herself said that </joey>
<joey> she didn't even know what genre she'd </joey>
<joey> put it in </joey>
<joey> because it's so it touches on so many </joey>
<connor> genres throughout the manga yeah that's </connor>
<connor> why i think it's super unique and worth </connor>
<garnt> worth reading </garnt>
<garnt> okay did you watch the anime or read the </garnt>
<garnt> manga first anime first okay i should i </garnt>
<connor> should have expected that actually yeah </connor>
<connor> so anime i got into so i watched the </connor>
<connor> anime yeah and you know i thought </connor>
<connor> wow i just watched it and i thought it </connor>
<connor> was kind of man that's kind of boring </connor>
<garnt> i thought it was okay you know i thought </garnt>
<connor> season two was god awful yeah and at </connor>
<garnt> this time book of six hadn't came out </garnt>
<joey> yet and uh basically i i did that and </joey>
<joey> then someone was like oh you should uh </joey>
<joey> you should just do like character </joey>
<joey> impressions for my youtube channel yeah </joey>
<garnt> well okay i did a few and then sebastian </garnt>
<connor> just happened to be the one that i tried </connor>
<garnt> first and i thought it sounded nothing </garnt>
<garnt> like him </garnt>
<garnt> like a british butler guy right oh my </garnt>
<garnt> god it's him but looking back i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't even sound like j michael </garnt>
<garnt> taylor </garnt>
<garnt> but you know i'm sure he was offended </garnt>
<garnt> that people were i'd be offended </garnt>
<garnt> uh and then i did that and then i got </garnt>
<garnt> you know i got surrounded by people who </garnt>
<joey> loved it and you kept like telling me </joey>
<connor> read it read it yeah i was like </connor>
<joey> reluctant i was like no so wait what </joey>
<joey> what was the first manga you ever read </joey>
<connor> first is it on the three by three </connor>
<connor> that you like distinctly remember it </connor>
<joey> might have been black but no it must </joey>
<joey> have been black butler yeah blackballer </joey>
<joey> it was black butler and i didn't read </joey>
<joey> any for like two years right </joey>
<garnt> he just thought manga equals blackboard </garnt>
<connor> because </connor>
<garnt> the reason why i actually got into i </garnt>
<garnt> remember this next i did a manga dub of </garnt>
<joey> uh part of the uh the uh a couple of the </joey>
<connor> boat arcs called the campaign companion </connor>
<joey> just the border the white sock the book </joey>
<joey> of atlantic is it </joey>
<joey> book of atlantic i think we called it </joey>
<joey> because they made a movie about it i </joey>
<joey> haven't watched the movie um i did a </joey>
<joey> comic dub of a portion of that and so uh </joey>
<joey> yeah i just ended up reading it because </joey>
<joey> i was like oh this song looks cool and i </joey>
<joey> had it out of context and i was like oh </joey>
<joey> okay uh well this is cool i'm gonna go </joey>
<garnt> read the rest and i started reading it </garnt>
<garnt> and i read past that point and then i </garnt>
<connor> stopped right but everything before i </connor>
<garnt> enjoyed but i'm probably gonna go finish </garnt>
<garnt> it yeah because what i want to know is </garnt>
<garnt> that i'm looking at most of these and </garnt>
<garnt> i'd say </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of these have come from </garnt>
<garnt> recommendations literally from us </garnt>
<garnt> telling you like go out and read it i </garnt>
<joey> know exactly which one's got recommended </joey>
<garnt> i know which ones i recommended </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> so let's do it in the order of i watched </garnt>
<garnt> that i read them yeah yeah yeah yeah go </garnt>
<garnt> go for it okay so next up was one punch </garnt>
<garnt> man okay yeah so what what inspired you </garnt>
<joey> to read one punch man i guess the </joey>
<joey> animator yeah season one was too good </joey>
<joey> how can you you can't [ __ ] block me like </joey>
<joey> that right like season one was so good </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and uh </joey>
<connor> i saw the manga and i was like oh a lot </connor>
<connor> of the times when i'd see the manga and </connor>
<connor> i when i wanted to go further like past </connor>
<connor> the anime we start reading the mark and </connor>
<connor> everything ah it's not the same yeah </connor>
<connor> but one punch was the one where i was </connor>
<connor> like holy [ __ ] this is insane yeah like </connor>
<connor> this this artwork is just </connor>
<joey> insane yeah i noticed you have two </joey>
<connor> murata yusuke manga yeah i love his art </connor>
<connor> man </connor>
<connor> yeah and he's so good at visually </connor>
<connor> conveying like action action and also </connor>
<garnt> just kind of like metaphors i've seen </garnt>
<garnt> godly yeah let's talk about i swear like </garnt>
<garnt> because i think especially in sports </garnt>
<connor> anime yeah sports anime a lot of times </connor>
<garnt> live and die by the metaphor yeah right </garnt>
<connor> right because how how because concepts </connor>
<connor> need to be explained yeah yeah because </connor>
<garnt> like how can you convey a certain move </garnt>
<garnt> or a certain like aspect of a sport that </garnt>
<garnt> people who are do not understand a sport </garnt>
<connor> can easily understand you go for </connor>
<connor> metaphors and by far the manga that does </connor>
<connor> the best of visual metaphors is i sure </connor>
<connor> 21. you know [ __ ] your high q and your </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] christmas </connor>
<garnt> this is why i would want him to do a </garnt>
<garnt> chat anime you would explain the concept </garnt>
<garnt> of chess through metaphors </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah like this is a pin and he'd </garnt>
<joey> figure out some weird [ __ ] way of </joey>
<joey> showing it i would love that but yeah </joey>
<joey> sadly it's not popular in japan </joey>
<joey> big rip but yeah one punch man i i just </joey>
<joey> like dude this one was still to this day </joey>
<connor> one of my favorite mangas out of all of </connor>
<connor> these i still think that one punch man </connor>
<connor> is </connor>
<connor> maybe one of my favorites right it's so </connor>
<joey> hard it's that's the difficult one </joey>
<joey> because you have jojo because jojo is </joey>
<joey> there as well and i think jojo might be </joey>
<joey> my favorite obviously um </joey>
<joey> but ah i think jojo is my fa is it like </joey>
<joey> because i have a difference between my </joey>
<connor> favorite and the one i enjoyed the most </connor>
<connor> yeah right and i think i enjoyed one </connor>
<connor> punch man the most because it was just </connor>
<connor> pure fun yeah yeah but jojo is my </connor>
<connor> favorite because there's so much about </connor>
<connor> jojo that i love oh yeah and i love the </connor>
<connor> style of jojo i love all of that and i </connor>
<connor> feel like giorgio is so much more than </connor>
<connor> just the margaret it's experience </connor>
<garnt> it's a culture you know you don't just </garnt>
<garnt> read jojo you believe it you live it you </garnt>
<garnt> experience it you become jojo there's </garnt>
<connor> just something about jojo which we'll </connor>
<connor> talk about later but yeah just there's </connor>
<connor> something about it um but one punch man </connor>
<connor> man like i finished season one </connor>
<connor> and i was like okay i'm gonna check it </connor>
<connor> out i'ma see what happens after yeah </connor>
<connor> because it ends because i mean after you </connor>
<connor> watch the boros fight uh which you know </connor>
<joey> if you haven't if you don't know what </joey>
<joey> one punch man is i'm gonna explain to </joey>
<joey> you it's a guy who beats everyone in one </joey>
<joey> punch that's literally it and he's a man </joey>
<joey> and at the end of the season one of the </joey>
<joey> anime he has this amazing fight that is </joey>
<joey> so visually stunning yeah and just </joey>
<joey> amazing and it's so hype but it's </joey>
<joey> probably one of the coolest animated </joey>
<joey> fights in anime yeah um </joey>
<joey> and i was like okay i have to know where </joey>
<joey> this can go because everyone's saying </joey>
<joey> the story is amazing onwards so i </joey>
<joey> started reading it and i was like oh </joey>
<garnt> okay this is pretty cool the next arc </garnt>
<garnt> starts and i'm like okay this is really </garnt>
<garnt> interesting right because we start the </garnt>
<garnt> uh what's known as the monster arc yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and the garo arc </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and they introduce gara which is </garnt>
<garnt> like the one of the main characters </garnt>
<garnt> going forward in the in the anime and </garnt>
<joey> manga and season two covers uh i'd </joey>
<joey> probably say the beginning just barely </joey>
<joey> the beginning of one of the the it's a </joey>
<joey> long rock yeah it's very long it's still </joey>
<joey> ongoing on the on the manga um yeah i </joey>
<connor> started reading it and i was like god </connor>
<connor> damn this man's drawings are just </connor>
<garnt> another level yeah yeah actually insane </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's insane because i remember </garnt>
<connor> reading one punch man before the anime </connor>
<connor> came out because everyone was hyping it </connor>
<connor> up so i was like it was the one show </connor>
<connor> when i'm just like let me let me just </connor>
<connor> see let me just read like a chapter or </connor>
<connor> two just to see </connor>
<connor> what can i what i can expect so i tried </connor>
<connor> reading a chapter or two and then i read </connor>
<connor> everything that was out you can't then </connor>
<connor> you can't pick that up and not read </connor>
<connor> everything that's impossible and then i </connor>
<connor> remember reading and being like there's </connor>
<connor> no way the anime is gonna live up to </connor>
<connor> this fight </connor>
<garnt> i was just like there's no [ __ ] way </garnt>
<garnt> but like not not because the r is like i </garnt>
<garnt> think some of the best art that's </garnt>
<garnt> available i mean there's </garnt>
<connor> when you turn the there's a panel right </connor>
<connor> where saitama punches so hard yeah the </connor>
<connor> clouds split yeah yeah and in this panel </connor>
<connor> you like the detail on the earth yeah </connor>
<connor> and the clouds is insane no there's some </connor>
<connor> panels that are literally just animated </connor>
<connor> keyframes yeah where you read it and </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's just like it's just like </connor>
<connor> an anime because it's just basically </connor>
<connor> keyframes right so like i was very very </connor>
<joey> impressed at you know the team at mad </joey>
<joey> house for be being able to put their own </joey>
<joey> spin on his amazing [ __ ] art yeah </joey>
<joey> like living up to this amazing art but </joey>
<connor> even without that one punch man is some </connor>
<connor> of the best battle shown in like 100 </connor>
<connor> arts yeah that you can find in all of </connor>
<connor> anime and manga yeah and i think that </connor>
<connor> we're i'm very glad that one punch man </connor>
<connor> season one was animated the way there </connor>
<connor> was because i think anime season one </connor>
<connor> is more of a comedy yeah and then season </connor>
<connor> two onwards is an action i feel like the </connor>
<connor> comedy very much takes a seat after the </connor>
<joey> first arc well yeah because i mean you </joey>
<joey> can only do so much with that single </joey>
<connor> concept right yeah but but like the way </connor>
<garnt> that they made it work every time was so </garnt>
<garnt> genius and funny like one punch man </garnt>
<garnt> season one is one of the funniest shows </garnt>
<garnt> in anime yeah and in the manga i feel </garnt>
<garnt> that although the art is much better i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like the comedy doesn't hit as hard </garnt>
<connor> because the comedic timing is super </connor>
<connor> important for jokes and i feel like you </connor>
<connor> can't have as good comedic timing when </connor>
<connor> you're reading something as when you're </connor>
<garnt> experiencing it the joke i think i think </garnt>
<joey> it's just like a different experience or </joey>
<connor> difference it's a difference but a joke </connor>
<connor> a joke read aloud will always be funnier </connor>
<connor> than a joke you've read </connor>
<connor> like that's just oh </connor>
<connor> i don't know i disagree </connor>
<joey> i thought that too until i read like </joey>
<connor> stuff like guinta </connor>
<connor> yeah but i bet the gintama animes </connor>
<connor> delivers the lines funnier </connor>
<joey> i don't know it's hard to say like </joey>
<joey> sometimes it does yes but then there are </joey>
<joey> some chapters that i i think gintama is </joey>
<joey> the only manga that's genuinely made me </joey>
<joey> laugh out loud reading it yeah and </joey>
<joey> that's like a very powerful thing to say </joey>
<joey> right because like </joey>
<joey> again it's like as you said a joke is </joey>
<connor> much funnier said out loud yeah but it's </connor>
<connor> like timing timing you know everything </connor>
<connor> playing into the joke yeah there's so </connor>
<connor> many aspects that can help elevate the </connor>
<joey> joke i think that i think that comes </joey>
<connor> down to at least with manga how good you </connor>
<connor> are at like framing yeah right and i </connor>
<connor> think munata yusuke is so [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> at framing yeah like a concept yeah that </connor>
<connor> he can just somehow do that with comedy </connor>
<joey> as well he already proved it with actual </joey>
<connor> 21's like action scenes yeah and he this </connor>
<joey> man can also do comedy as well i'm like </joey>
<garnt> what can this man not do yeah i've read </garnt>
<connor> the original one webcomic oh yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> how was that </connor>
<connor> yeah it's it's a it's a lot harder to go </connor>
<connor> to </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<joey> but also i know so explain one can't </joey>
<joey> draw that's why so the original the </joey>
<joey> original yeah the original uh one punch </joey>
<joey> man is a webcomic i'm sure you guys know </joey>
<joey> this it's a webcomic and then um </joey>
<joey> picked it up and was like hey let me </joey>
<joey> draw good for you like real good yeah </joey>
<connor> and and then published in shonen not </connor>
<connor> jump it used to be jump right jump plus </connor>
<connor> jump plus now right it's once a month </connor>
<connor> which is painful because i think uh juan </connor>
<connor> did weekly is it i believe the webcomic </connor>
<connor> is over now right is it um kind of like </connor>
<garnt> it's not over it's just on hiatus oh </garnt>
<connor> okay cause i've read up to everything </connor>
<connor> that's out and it's just kind of in the </connor>
<connor> middle of an arc right now </connor>
<connor> yeah but like the manga </connor>
<connor> right now is adapting </connor>
<connor> the it's so it's in the monster arc </connor>
<garnt> stuff yeah it's it's still in the </garnt>
<garnt> monster arc so it's taken the webcomic </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like a like a basis and </garnt>
<garnt> just really expanding on that yeah i've </garnt>
<connor> noticed because that they've </connor>
<connor> in the the difference between the hmong </connor>
<connor> and the webcomic is that they've </connor>
<connor> put aspects of the story that happened </connor>
<connor> they've moved them around yeah the manga </connor>
<connor> into like better timings yeah yeah like </connor>
<connor> there's some characters that got their </connor>
<connor> backstory um </connor>
<connor> in the webcomic at a certain time that </connor>
<connor> they were shifted to them when they were </connor>
<connor> having a fight yeah they got the </connor>
<connor> flashback and their backstory uh like </connor>
<connor> there's a superhero called super black </connor>
<connor> alloy </connor>
<connor> who is a man that is super muscular yeah </connor>
<connor> that's his thing and he gets his </connor>
<joey> flashback at a different time but in the </joey>
<joey> actual uh the redone manga he gets it </joey>
<joey> during one of his fights with garu right </joey>
<joey> um which i noticed was oh okay that's </joey>
<joey> interesting i didn't i didn't know they </joey>
<joey> were mixing things around yeah um but </joey>
<connor> yeah the manga is </connor>
<connor> oh my god just take one look at some of </connor>
<connor> these panels and you'll be you'll be </connor>
<garnt> yeah you'll be reading it </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's definitely one of the best </connor>
<garnt> action manga i've ever read if not the </garnt>
<connor> best honestly uh yeah it's hard i can't </connor>
<connor> think of anything that in terms of pure </connor>
<connor> action and fights that comes close in </connor>
<connor> mind yeah i mean i haven't read many so </connor>
<joey> i can't say but i mean i still think </joey>
<garnt> it's one of the best it's definitely one </garnt>
<connor> of the best yeah this episode is </connor>
<garnt> sponsored by expressvpn </garnt>
<connor> um </connor>
<garnt> using the internet without expressvpn </garnt>
<garnt> it's like taking a call on the train or </garnt>
<garnt> bus on speaker for everyone to hear and </garnt>
<connor> who wants to do that no one did you know </connor>
<connor> that your internet service provider can </connor>
<connor> see every single website you visit </connor>
<connor> you're joking no i'm not joking i might </connor>
<connor> as well just strip in front of them but </connor>
<connor> did you know there is a way that you can </connor>
<garnt> stop it using expressvpn goddammit they </garnt>
<garnt> won't even see a website that you go to </garnt>
<garnt> this west vpn creates a secure encrypted </garnt>
<garnt> tunnel between your device and the </garnt>

<connor> description back to the shop i i really </connor>
<connor> like uh </connor>
<connor> i really as you said terraformers </connor>
<connor> terraforms is great actually that was a </connor>
<joey> great moment yeah but like </joey>
<connor> the story is kind of mad at times yeah </connor>
<joey> but the action is spot on it's so cool </joey>
<joey> i've spoken about terraforms before but </joey>
<joey> terraformers is just uh it's a manga </joey>
<connor> which is one of my favorites and i've it </connor>
<connor> has like a ridiculous amount of chapters </connor>
<connor> i think like 400 something i think it </connor>
<joey> has </joey>
<joey> it's like 30 it's almost 30 volumes i </joey>
<joey> think yeah and it's like i think they </joey>
<connor> just started a new arc yeah when i </connor>
<joey> stopped reading it and it felt like it </joey>
<connor> was going to be the last and biggest arc </connor>
<joey> and i was like [ __ ] me i think it's </joey>
<connor> already finished has it finished i think </connor>
<connor> has it i don't know no way because i </connor>
<joey> only read up to him around like </joey>
<connor> volume like 11 or 12. so the concept of </connor>
<connor> terraformers uh which i </connor>
<connor> dude i was so [ __ ] sold on this </connor>
<joey> concept because i was like that's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] bad yes it's very cool so </joey>
<joey> they're they they sent a mission to </joey>
<joey> explore uh the moon </joey>
<joey> and when they got there there was </joey>
<joey> cockroaches that could just they were </joey>
<connor> just ripped like giggity chat like </connor>
<garnt> giga chances </garnt>
<joey> someone had shot their fridge into the </joey>
<joey> moon and they had cockroach on there </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> sorry </connor>
<connor> it's like giga chad cockroach i know we </connor>
<connor> spoke about terraforms before on like </connor>
<connor> the third episode or something yeah it's </connor>
<connor> been a while yeah so there's uh there's </connor>
<connor> cockroaches on the moon and turns out </connor>
<connor> they're not just any normal cockroaches </connor>
<connor> they're giga chad cockroaches that are </connor>
<connor> like super human beings super smart but </connor>
<connor> have the senses of cockroaches yeah so </connor>
<connor> this whole team dies that goes there and </connor>
<connor> you see this right away so it's not a </connor>
<connor> spoiler um so that then earth goes and </connor>
<connor> they're like we must do something so </connor>
<connor> they go and get </connor>
<connor> warriors or people they think are worthy </connor>
<connor> to fight and they inject them or in </connor>
<joey> their dna with insect dna yeah </joey>
<connor> so each one of them has insect </connor>
<connor> attributes so one of them is like a </connor>
<connor> praying mantis mixed with a human and so </connor>
<connor> he can punch really like lightning fast </connor>
<joey> one of them i think they inject it with </joey>
<joey> like a flea so they can jump really yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah and one of and this was </connor>
<connor> an i was sold one of them got the uh </connor>
<connor> what is the [ __ ] what's it called it's </connor>
<connor> the shrimp that can like flick at like </connor>
<connor> all the punches </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's the manta shrimp that can </garnt>
<garnt> break clash by flicking the air yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah in front of it </joey>
<joey> and i was like oh [ __ ] i know the men to </joey>
<joey> strip this badass </joey>
<connor> and so then they send them to the moon </connor>
<connor> to go and uh do research and fight back </connor>
<connor> again </connor>
<connor> and it's so [ __ ] cool because then it </connor>
<connor> turns into like a political thing </connor>
<joey> because obviously if there's [ __ ] on the </joey>
<joey> moon there's gonna be a lot of countries </joey>
<joey> arguing about what's going on there and </joey>
<joey> who did it yeah was this here how many </joey>
<connor> how many chapters they have </connor>
<connor> 22 volumes okay is it over or is it </connor>
<joey> still gone </joey>
<joey> yeah it's a </joey>
<garnt> three years ago yeah and it was still </garnt>
<joey> ongoing yeah was it yeah when did it end </joey>
<joey> a couple of years ago right 2014. no oh </joey>
<joey> i think it started in 2014 didn't it it </joey>
<connor> started 2011. oh [ __ ] where when did it </connor>
<joey> finish </joey>
<connor> really there's no way i could have read </connor>
<connor> everything because when i finished </connor>
<joey> reading it it was not </joey>
<garnt> done going are they yeah pretty sure are </garnt>
<joey> you sure it's over </joey>
<connor> either way you need to catch up on yeah </connor>
<joey> by the way i need to catch up and it was </joey>
<connor> such a fun manga and if you like one </connor>
<connor> punch man i think you'll love </connor>
<garnt> terraformers i i'm curious how did you </garnt>
<joey> find terraformers because what's the </joey>
<garnt> anime </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm so sorry </garnt>
<garnt> what what convinced you from the anime </garnt>
<garnt> to be like i'll read the manga maybe the </garnt>
<connor> blue maybe the manga is better yeah okay </connor>
<connor> so terraformers had an anime adaptation </connor>
<connor> and it was notorious for being </connor>
<connor> absolutely dreadful because what they </connor>
<connor> did was they made this extremely gory </connor>
<connor> anime yeah and they were like this is </connor>
<connor> great let's just censor everything yeah </connor>
<connor> but they did it in the worst [ __ ] way </connor>
<connor> they literally put black dots and bars </connor>
<connor> across the screen so there were some </connor>
<garnt> scenes where you couldn't see anything </garnt>
<connor> it's literally infamous because i </connor>
<connor> remember one of the first screenshots </connor>
<connor> yeah because i remember i read some </connor>
<connor> performance before the anime came out </connor>
<joey> and i was just like how are they gonna </joey>
<joey> adapt this because some of these scenes </joey>
<joey> are pretty like brutal pretty gory </joey>
<garnt> and then i saw that i think the famous </garnt>
<garnt> scene is where like the cockroach is </garnt>
<garnt> holding someone's head yeah and it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like he's just holding a black </garnt>
<connor> circle </connor>
<connor> because dude this i i'm still convinced </connor>
<connor> right if this had like a good anime </connor>
<connor> adaptation like a solid animation like </connor>
<connor> not one punch man level but close to it </connor>
<connor> yeah right of the action scenes being </connor>
<connor> done that well this would be like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] oh yeah and that's what i was </joey>
<garnt> looking forward to because i remember i </garnt>
<connor> i got recommended the manga from like </connor>
<connor> one of my friends who was like dude you </connor>
<connor> have to [ __ ] with that this is amazing </connor>
<connor> right i was like oh because could you </connor>
<connor> imagine the shock people would get when </connor>
<connor> they're like this there's a scene right </connor>
<connor> where uh it's very early on so it's not </connor>
<joey> really a spoiler but one of the scene </joey>
<joey> because they all the teams drop in </joey>
<joey> different locations on the moon so you </joey>
<joey> kind of get like play by place where all </joey>
<joey> the different teams are on the moon and </joey>
<joey> one of the scenes where one team just </joey>
<connor> goes out of the ship and immediately </connor>
<connor> just they see a flash and someone's lost </connor>
<connor> their head already yeah yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> hold on [ __ ] and i was like right after </connor>
<joey> she was injected as well </joey>
<connor> all right here comes he comes apart </connor>
<connor> where she kicks us yeah he immediately </connor>
<connor> dies yeah and it's like oh [ __ ] they're </connor>
<connor> they're stronger yeah and it's like </connor>
<connor> everything about this show is so hype </connor>
<connor> and like reading the manga is like okay </connor>
<connor> how are they gonna build on this and </connor>
<connor> they just keep finding ways to make it </connor>
<joey> more and more interesting yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] and the art style is so cool </joey>
<garnt> honestly honestly </garnt>
<connor> like the manga just never stops kicking </connor>
<connor> off it's it's like permanently just </connor>
<connor> kicking off it's really popping off </connor>
<connor> and if there's not fights there's some </connor>
<connor> like game of thrones political [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> going yeah yeah yeah and it's like all </connor>
<connor> right just as we're on the moon doesn't </connor>
<connor> mean that china doesn't hate russia like </connor>
<connor> yeah there's stuff going on yeah it's </connor>
<connor> like it's so </connor>
<connor> it's so good and it's yeah and i love </connor>
<garnt> how they introduce like i love it when </garnt>
<garnt> shows when there's a lot of characters </garnt>
<garnt> that it's like this is the character </garnt>
<garnt> this is where they're from this is the </garnt>
<garnt> height this is their ability and you're </garnt>
<garnt> like sick sick thank you and i can </garnt>
<garnt> mentally remember that information </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because the the how i discovered </garnt>
<connor> terraformers is moving on to the next </connor>
<connor> show on your list which is gantz like i </connor>
<connor> i literally finished dance i was like i </connor>
<connor> need more shows like yeah it's very </connor>
<connor> reminiscent i i think it's just like how </connor>
<connor> brutal and unpredictable like </connor>
<connor> unpredictable it is in terms of who's </connor>
<connor> gonna live who's gonna die and i feel </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> it's you know it's it's the meme wedge </connor>
<connor> where if you can't predict what's gonna </connor>
<connor> happen or who's gonna die it's like oh </connor>
<connor> it's gonna like the game of thrones but </connor>
<garnt> like the first time i actually was </garnt>
<garnt> like properly shocked at who lived and </garnt>
<garnt> who died was [ __ ] gans </garnt>
<garnt> which i don't know if how much we can go </garnt>
<garnt> into spoilers about gans but </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> you cannot predict who dies </joey>
<joey> yeah and and the anime was like </joey>
<connor> it was decent it was pretty solid i feel </connor>
<connor> like if you are between the ages of like </connor>
<connor> even though you shouldn't be reading </connor>
<garnt> this for 16 but if you are at the age of </garnt>
<garnt> six no no no no no this this is like the </garnt>
<garnt> perfect i i think i watched the anime </garnt>
<garnt> when i was 16. this is like the most i'm </garnt>
<garnt> 16 and i want to be experiencing badass </garnt>
<garnt> okay there's a scene that happens very </garnt>
<garnt> early on right yeah this is quite </garnt>
<connor> graphic um where </connor>
<connor> so i was explaining the premise right so </connor>
<connor> against what happens is uh wait wait how </connor>
<joey> does it very very start it starts with </joey>
<joey> the the two main characters jumping in </joey>
<garnt> front of a train yeah so oh that's one </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah so the two characters die </garnt>
<connor> in a train crash or like that scene was </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yes yeah so they died pretty </connor>
<joey> brutally in a train crash um and </joey>
<connor> afterwards they wake up in this room and </connor>
<connor> this black </connor>
<connor> circle has transported to them to this </connor>
<connor> room along with a lot of [ __ ] along </connor>
<connor> with other people who have just died and </connor>
<connor> they're all wearing suits and everyone's </connor>
<connor> wearing a suit they kind of look like </connor>
<connor> they're wearing like [ __ ] suits or </connor>
<connor> whatever suits yeah </connor>
<garnt> and uh they're told that they have to go </garnt>
<connor> kill this alien oh no they they don't </connor>
<connor> wear the suits that's all the weather </connor>
<garnt> suits yeah they're thought to wear some </garnt>
<garnt> people don't want to wear this yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it looks it looks like it looks like a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] uh it does like a gibson yeah it </connor>
<garnt> does kind of look like a [ __ ] suit right </garnt>
<garnt> and there's just a moment in this anime </garnt>
<garnt> that either manga it's a slight spoiler </garnt>
<garnt> but not really early on uh where </garnt>
<garnt> like a girl gets transported in the room </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like a teenage boy and he's </garnt>
<garnt> like let's have sex and she's like okay </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just have sex and you see it you're </garnt>
<connor> like whoa okay what </connor>
<joey> and they don't they don't do it </joey>
<joey> terraformers in the animals </joey>
<garnt> in the anime there's literally two sex </garnt>
<garnt> scenes in the anime yeah and he just </garnt>
<connor> stopped having sex there in the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> hallway of this house and it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> like whoa okay uh i haven't experienced </connor>
<connor> this before in a manga yeah just [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> happening all right this is this i don't </joey>
<joey> even think dogen's gonna get into the </joey>
<connor> segment </connor>
<connor> literally just girl appears like do you </connor>
<connor> wanna have sex because we're dead and </connor>
<connor> he's like yeah sure yeah </connor>
<garnt> and i remember watching literally </garnt>
<connor> watching dance when i was about like </connor>
<connor> yeah 15 16. that is the most i'm 16 and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like oh my god </connor>
<garnt> they're sharing a sex scene </garnt>
<connor> what do you mean </connor>
<joey> when i read it like last year you know </joey>
<joey> it's it's one of those shows that </joey>
<joey> there's nothing quite like it yeah well </joey>
<joey> this is really fresh holy [ __ ] i haven't </joey>
<joey> experienced anything like this yeah and </joey>
<joey> it doesn't hold punches you know and the </joey>
<connor> whole aspect is that they have to </connor>
<connor> uh kill these demons that exist in the </connor>
<garnt> human race aliens aliens yeah they they </garnt>
<garnt> say that there's been aliens that have </garnt>
<garnt> been living in the human world and then </garnt>
<garnt> they have to like kill them and so </garnt>
<connor> they're worth points and there's x </connor>
<connor> amount of points to come back alive yeah </connor>
<garnt> exactly or you know there's there's </garnt>
<garnt> different things that they can do with </garnt>
<garnt> points right they can bring people who </garnt>
<garnt> have died before back to life as well um </garnt>
<connor> the point is that to kill an alien first </connor>
<connor> you you you think it's like an easy </connor>
<connor> thing to do yeah but like it's really </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] difficult to kill these </connor>
<connor> aliens and every arc there's a different </connor>
<connor> alien that they need to kill and there's </connor>
<connor> a difference </connor>
<connor> and it gets harder and harder and </connor>
<connor> progressively like more and more people </connor>
<joey> will die to the point where you can </joey>
<joey> never really expect who's going to live </joey>
<joey> and who's going to die yeah um and i </joey>
<joey> remember like i feel like </joey>
<joey> i feel like the peak arc was part two </joey>
<joey> because it's like separated into three </joey>
<joey> parts i think yeah i think part two was </joey>
<connor> the best uh part three had some really </connor>
<connor> really good moments i feel like there is </connor>
<connor> a certain climax to gantz that really </connor>
<connor> like it really it made me </connor>
<connor> really existential yeah yeah i know </connor>
<connor> you're on it yeah and without spoiling </connor>
<connor> two specific details when they find the </connor>
<connor> creator of these balls </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] scene just like i remember </connor>
<connor> reading the events of that scene and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<joey> oh my god this man did like 10 tabs of </joey>
<garnt> lsd yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's it's so it's so like giga brain </connor>
<joey> existentialism but yeah i mean awkward </joey>
<joey> have you read anything else by auckland </joey>
<connor> yeah i i've i know he did the uh ini was </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah i've heard i know of the </connor>
<connor> other stuff he's done and it's all </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] from yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> the the most recent one he did was this </connor>
<connor> one called gigant </connor>
<connor> i've heard of </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like giggit and god put together </joey>
<connor> another just awful uh gig is also just </connor>
<joey> like i i've started reading it's just </joey>
<garnt> real no it's still going </garnt>
<garnt> to take that long </garnt>
<joey> it's really [ __ ] good but it's like </joey>
<joey> you know it's an okuhiro manga because </joey>
<connor> it's just [ __ ] there is uh there is </connor>
<connor> one scene that i will warn you is </connor>
<connor> extremely questionable uh in the in the </connor>
<connor> world oh yeah and we spoke about this </connor>
<connor> before in the podcast extremely </connor>
<connor> questionable just giving you a heads up </connor>
<connor> uh yeah it's a little racist they're </connor>
<joey> quite racist i mean ice shield has a </joey>
<connor> similar sign yeah yeah yeah yeah i think </connor>
<joey> we spoke about this before in the </joey>
<joey> podcast as well but just get a heads up </joey>
<joey> if you do go into it there is like that </joey>
<connor> moment yeah um it's very yikes and like </connor>
<joey> uh okay uh </joey>
<garnt> all right </garnt>
<joey> what i love about gantz and uh </joey>
<joey> terraformers it's just it's pure bat </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] insane fun oh yeah yeah it is and </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's kind of like the edgy 16 </garnt>
<connor> year old in you but like there are </connor>
<connor> somebody brings out the 16 year old in </connor>
<connor> you that thinks like just fighting and </connor>
<garnt> death is badass but like there's there's </garnt>
<garnt> like two like kind of different </garnt>
<garnt> categories i put this in you know </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's like the edgy 16 year </garnt>
<joey> old kind of shows where it brings that </joey>
<joey> out of you and it remembers what you </joey>
<joey> felt like when you were 16. and then </joey>
<joey> there's shows like elf and lead and </joey>
<joey> mirai nikki </joey>
<joey> elephant yeah that you watched and i'm </joey>
<joey> just like damn why the [ __ ] did i ever </joey>
<connor> enjoy this </connor>
<garnt> yeah i can look back and i'm like that </garnt>
<joey> was good yeah that was a look back i'm </joey>
<garnt> like why was this even remotely popular </garnt>
<joey> i was like i was like </joey>
<joey> 10 out of 10 when i was 16. i'm just </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> was i this easy to trick when i was 16 </garnt>
<connor> when i saw blood </connor>
<garnt> when you were 16 this is this is new to </garnt>
<garnt> you like yeah this [ __ ] is exciting </garnt>
<garnt> you're like whoa </garnt>
<garnt> you can do this yeah oh </garnt>
<connor> it's artistic yeah it's just like it's </connor>
<garnt> it's it's crazy yeah i remember a point </garnt>
<garnt> when elfin lead was literally when i </garnt>
<garnt> joined the community elephant lead was </garnt>
<garnt> considered like a modern day classic </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't know i think </garnt>
<connor> if you thought the anime was good read </connor>
<connor> the manga because it's like completely </connor>
<connor> different and i was like all right that </connor>
<connor> is no different no it is it is very it's </connor>
<connor> actually more [ __ ] in the manga oh oh </connor>
<joey> okay but like you know 16 year old aj me </joey>
<joey> was like how how could they improve on </joey>
<joey> this and then you read it now and i'm </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> all right yeah i mean i think i've like </connor>
<connor> watched like full moon alchemist before </connor>
<connor> it you know yeah yeah yeah then just </connor>
<garnt> going from that where i was like okay </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah i was like i was like looking </connor>
<joey> at my monitor on like all like with all </joey>
<connor> these [ __ ] pop-ups everywhere like </connor>
<joey> whoa what the [ __ ] you just cut them up </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah with like ghost arms like what </connor>
<garnt> yeah from i think that like the next </garnt>
<garnt> show after elfin lead and miranda was </garnt>
<garnt> probably a karmico kill </garnt>
<garnt> where </garnt>
<garnt> um where i remember he got so [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> popular and i'm just like i watched the </joey>
<joey> anime okay that is what i'm 16 yeah i i </joey>
<garnt> am 16 like i i'm i'm 14 and this is deep </garnt>
<connor> yeah i am convinced right okay i like </connor>
<connor> alpha i know evelyn i like how can i get </connor>
<garnt> killed i'm just gonna say it right now i </garnt>
<garnt> like it okay okay i don't care what </garnt>
<joey> people say okay i like it [ __ ] you i </joey>
<joey> like that did you finish it the anime </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<garnt> i think this will make sense okay this </garnt>
<garnt> is how i i view it sure </garnt>
<garnt> pov you're a fairy tale fan </garnt>
<garnt> you're tired of fairy tale you want </garnt>
<garnt> something a little edgier you go </garnt>
<connor> immediately to act make a kill yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's it feels think about it yeah it </garnt>
<connor> is literally fairy tale with but fans </connor>
<garnt> but with way more edge because it feels </garnt>
<connor> like fairy tale in many aspects where </connor>
<garnt> it's like this is dumb dumb [ __ ] why </garnt>
<connor> specifically fairy tales because people </connor>
<joey> who like make a kill are fairy tale fans </joey>
<joey> you are right you're all right it is </joey>
<connor> literally uh if you are a fairytale fan </connor>
<connor> i bet you love i can make a kill yeah </connor>
<garnt> you are right </garnt>
<garnt> think about it think about it say i </garnt>
<garnt> agree with seven deadly sins no </garnt>
<connor> but that's that's all kind of the same </connor>
<garnt> seven deadly sins i think people know </garnt>
<connor> it's slightly different i think </connor>
<connor> so we need to make a chart of like what </connor>
<connor> you're likely to like based on which </connor>
<connor> show we just get like </connor>
<connor> yeah we do right i think i think if if </connor>
<connor> seven deadly sins is on one end it's </connor>
<connor> like yeah hunter hunter is on the other </connor>
<connor> end i think yeah yeah yeah and then what </connor>
<connor> other shootings are there like i don't </connor>
<connor> know just like i don't know [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> seven deadly sin somewhere to me i can't </garnt>
<garnt> make a kill is just like the generation </garnt>
<garnt> they go into seven deadly sins or fairy </garnt>
<garnt> tale and then they also much mirai nikki </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like what if we just </garnt>
<garnt> combine the two what if we just combine </garnt>
<garnt> the two and that and then you get a calm </garnt>
<garnt> and go kill when you're like great i you </garnt>
<garnt> it you require </garnt>
<garnt> even less brain cells to enjoy this </garnt>
<connor> brilliant i i even though i recognized </connor>
<connor> the ending was [ __ ] dumb for i can </connor>
<connor> make a kill i liked it i thought it was </connor>
<connor> fun i had a great time watching that i'm </connor>
<garnt> not afraid to admit just the the plot </garnt>
<joey> twist yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it was come the [ __ ] off but i </joey>
<connor> still had a lot of fun like before that </connor>
<connor> i had a lot of fun with the show i </connor>
<joey> really enjoyed it yeah admittedly as </joey>
<connor> much as i planned on coming to kill </connor>
<joey> first like five six episodes pretty fun </joey>
<connor> yeah it's just like brainless fun but </connor>
<connor> you know what else i read that i read </connor>
<joey> all of as well well it's remembered now </joey>
<joey> sorry would you have anything else no no </joey>
<joey> i'm just gonna say i wrote all of dead </joey>
<joey> man wonderland oh really yeah oh that's </joey>
<garnt> also i'm succeeded yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> this is just sure because oh russian </connor>
<connor> back now </connor>
<joey> you know what i went on the thing where </joey>
<joey> i was like the anime ending sucked yeah </joey>
<connor> i was like i want it i had this uh this </connor>
<connor> was like two years ago i read it i had </connor>
<joey> the feeling i was like you know what i </joey>
<joey> just want to finish and and manga to an </joey>
<connor> anime that didn't get an ending </connor>
<joey> announcement okay wonderland yeah and </joey>
<joey> the manga was definitely better but the </joey>
<connor> manga had a [ __ ] ending too yeah i mean </connor>
<joey> not as bad as the anime but it was still </joey>
<connor> not yeah yeah it was still [ __ ] it was </connor>
<connor> fine that my wonderland was very five </connor>
<joey> yeah i think i was exactly the same </joey>
<connor> because i i finished dead man wonderland </connor>
<connor> and i like the anime a lot yeah the </connor>
<connor> anime was great until about episode 10. </connor>
<connor> yeah and then there's the last couple of </connor>
<joey> episodes where they're just like oh ran </joey>
<connor> out of budget yeah yeah basically and so </connor>
<connor> i was like okay okay i need to see how </connor>
<connor> this is yeah yeah um so what are we </connor>
<garnt> talking about </garnt>
<garnt> do we need to talk about jojo do we </garnt>
<garnt> really need to talk about george do you </garnt>
<connor> want to talk about joe apart </connor>
<joey> to read seven yeah uh i haven't actually </joey>
<joey> read julian yet but it's about to end as </joey>
<joey> at the time of uh recording this they </joey>
<joey> just announced that it's gonna end next </joey>
<joey> month yeah next month i'm probably gonna </joey>
<connor> speed run reading to julian yeah </connor>
<joey> so that i can talk about it </joey>
<joey> like i'm i think i'm like one volume </joey>
<joey> behind right now and it's pretty [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> good so far i'm surprised they're ending </joey>
<joey> it this </joey>
<connor> soon though because i'm not gonna go </connor>
<connor> i've heard that it was not too long ago </connor>
<connor> that we got introduced to the main </connor>
<connor> villain so yeah i'm not gonna i don't </connor>
<connor> wanna </connor>
<connor> i don't wanna say anything because i </connor>
<joey> don't know anything that's just what i </joey>
<joey> know so because everyone was telling me </joey>
<joey> that it had so much much left but </joey>
<joey> whatever i'm gonna i'm probably gonna </joey>
<joey> read it i might make a video about it i </joey>
<connor> don't know if i should on my main </connor>
<joey> channel it's pretty good maybe i will </joey>
<joey> maybe i'll i wouldn't say it's as good </joey>
<garnt> as i think it would be on brand for you </garnt>
<joey> right yeah it'd be on brand for you i in </joey>
<garnt> my opinion it's not as good as like </garnt>
<joey> seven part six or seven but it's up </joey>
<connor> there it's still pretty good it's jojo </connor>
<connor> we'll see how we'll see how this uh how </connor>
<connor> your feelings will change in the news </connor>
<joey> yeah i mean i don't know like the ending </joey>
<connor> of jesus might be [ __ ] amazing right </connor>
<connor> yeah true who knows but yeah jojo i mean </connor>
<garnt> i mean it was the jojo manga that made </garnt>
<joey> you a jojo fan right yeah so it was </joey>
<joey> definitely i was watching part five </joey>
<joey> and i wanted more of part five because </joey>
<joey> it hadn't fully aired yeah we were only </joey>
<joey> like ten episodes in and i was really </joey>
<connor> enjoying it </connor>
<connor> so i went and picked up the manga and i </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] loved it like i said such a </connor>
<connor> great time um </connor>
<joey> it's a shame that it's the english </joey>
<joey> official releases are quite slow mm-hmm </joey>
<joey> um i think we're they just finished </joey>
<connor> part four </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean like really yeah oh geez </garnt>
<connor> like a lot of people forget that jojo </connor>
<connor> just like was this super [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> underground manga that only like a </connor>
<connor> select few people really read before the </connor>
<joey> anime became a thing and so there was </joey>
<joey> dust yeah in the west and so like there </joey>
<joey> was just no interest to translate it </joey>
<garnt> officially until the anime came out now </garnt>
<garnt> it's weird seeing it become this like </garnt>
<garnt> massive one of the most biggest anime </garnt>
<joey> franchises i made a video on what was it </joey>
<joey> it was like i had this series like back </joey>
<joey> in the it's like five years ago i had </joey>
<connor> this series where i would like go into </connor>
<connor> manga and like kind of find like myths </connor>
<connor> and like kind of secrets and stuff like </connor>
<connor> that and kind of talk about it yeah i </connor>
<connor> remember i made a video on it was part </connor>
<garnt> three oingo boingo and there's that like </garnt>
<garnt> you know the moment </garnt>
<garnt> i made a video on that five years ago no </garnt>
<garnt> views </garnt>
<joey> no views at all i was like oh my god and </joey>
<connor> that's when i realized i was like oh no </connor>
<connor> one in the west knows jojo yeah </connor>
<connor> at that point i feel like jojo was such </connor>
<garnt> a 50 50 on whether it would do well yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think it just i'm really surprised </garnt>
<joey> that it did it just got i think it just </joey>
<connor> got lucky with the with the memes i </connor>
<garnt> think so yeah it was it was like it was </garnt>
<garnt> like so perfected for meme culture that </garnt>
<garnt> it was like so ahead of its time yeah </garnt>
<connor> and it's it's really weird because you </connor>
<joey> it wasn't really memed until part three </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah the anime came out </joey>
<joey> i guess i feel like i i did not see </joey>
<joey> anything about it until part three came </joey>
<connor> out and then i saw i never stopped uh </connor>
<joey> seeing the d.o versus jotaro like steam </joey>
<connor> sale memes you know </connor>
<joey> you'd see a ton of memes with the aurora </joey>
<joey> and all that yeah yeah that's when it </joey>
<joey> really started picking up steam i think </joey>
<joey> and then it started i then i think the </joey>
<connor> um people started realizing how good the </connor>
<connor> anime adaptation was and then part i </connor>
<connor> remember it really kicked off during </connor>
<connor> part four yeah airing in the west was </connor>
<connor> when it started really getting some </connor>
<connor> steam yeah and then part five just like </connor>
<connor> insane </connor>
<connor> yeah the part five anime adaptation of </connor>
<connor> jojo really like centered into like this </connor>
<connor> like because the [ __ ] jordano's theme </connor>
<connor> yeah did numbers for the meme community </connor>
<connor> oh yeah yeah and jojo in general i mean </connor>
<connor> how many people got into part jojo in </connor>
<connor> general </connor>
<connor> from the journal's team yeah because i </connor>
<connor> mean </connor>
<garnt> it's like the um what was the undertale </garnt>
<garnt> theme uh megalovania </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's it's up there with megalovania </connor>
<garnt> in terms of like obviously it's the </garnt>
<garnt> anime community yeah right because think </garnt>
<garnt> of like iconic meme music that came out </garnt>
<garnt> in the past 10 years what what have you </garnt>
<garnt> got there like actual like iconic like </garnt>
<garnt> super iconic </garnt>
<garnt> theme megalovania there's probably some </garnt>
<connor> other that i'm forgetting yeah </connor>
<garnt> i think that was joking there wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> really an explosion of like jojo never </garnt>
<joey> exploded you just slowly crept up in </joey>
<garnt> popularity until you couldn't you </garnt>
<joey> couldn't like it was inescapable yeah </joey>
<connor> i've really helped since part five </connor>
<connor> started airing it really blew up yeah i </connor>
<joey> feel like a noticeable change yeah in my </joey>
<joey> opinion part five is probably one of the </joey>
<joey> only parts where it's actually better in </joey>
<joey> the anime yeah yeah part four i think </joey>
<joey> you can go either all part four was yeah </joey>
<joey> either three three two and one hundred </joey>
<garnt> percent the market yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think part three was like dragged out </garnt>
<connor> too much in the anime yeah you can </connor>
<connor> speedrun it yeah </connor>
<garnt> you could be like all right </garnt>
<joey> obviously don't do that but you can you </joey>
<joey> can get through it at a good pace yeah </joey>
<joey> um but the part three of the anime is </joey>
<joey> very slow which i think jojo in general </joey>
<joey> is better in manga also because you have </joey>
<joey> part six and seven which are very good </joey>
<joey> part seven being especially notorious </joey>
<joey> for being just amazing </joey>
<connor> part seven is possible is amazing part </connor>
<connor> seven is where i feel like iraqi really </connor>
<connor> came into his own and finally made like </connor>
<connor> the perfect jojo part where there was no </connor>
<connor> pacing issues yeah i feel like every </connor>
<connor> part of jojo had some kind of weird </connor>
<joey> pacing at some point or another every </joey>
<joey> character was fun and like memorable </joey>
<connor> yeah like so so for example like part </connor>
<connor> three it drags out a bunch part two is </connor>
<joey> very short and sweet you don't really </joey>
<joey> get too much but it's very nice and </joey>
<joey> that's why part two is i mean joseph's </joey>
<joey> the only redeeming factor about that </joey>
<joey> the villain's boring yeah right part one </joey>
<connor> i mean it's no touristy </connor>
<joey> it's quite boring i won't lie it has a </joey>
<connor> lot of charm as a jojo but at least it's </connor>
<connor> short all right it's very short you can </connor>
<joey> read through it part four </joey>
<joey> kira who is the arguably one of the best </joey>
<joey> villains in jojo isn't there for the </joey>
<joey> first half so you kind of get a slice of </joey>
<connor> life for the first part which is which </connor>
<connor> is fun but it takes a while for it to </connor>
<connor> kind of find its footage yeah if if </connor>
<connor> you're not a fan of that kind of stuff </connor>
<connor> then </connor>
<connor> you can easily like fall off it yeah and </connor>
<connor> be like why is this popular yeah why do </connor>
<connor> people like this um plot five is very </connor>
<joey> solid uh i think that uh jordana is one </joey>
<connor> of the weaker joe joe bros uh joe joe </connor>
<joey> pros jojo's um you know bootstrap really </joey>
<connor> does carry oh yeah yeah yeah um and then </connor>
<connor> part six you know it's good it also has </connor>
<connor> a bit of a controversial ending um i </connor>
<connor> really like i like it but some people </connor>
<connor> don't like it i can understand why </connor>
<connor> people wouldn't like it i feel that some </connor>
<connor> parts of part six are a little weak but </connor>
<connor> part seven is like from start to finish </connor>
<connor> banger every single character banger </connor>
<connor> like the villains even like the side </connor>
<joey> villains i mean it is it does have kind </joey>
<garnt> of the least memorable jojo's though uh </garnt>
<joey> johnny uh yeah i don't know i feel like </joey>
<joey> johnny doesn't get good till like the </joey>
<connor> last quarter maybe johnny comes into his </connor>
<joey> own yeah yeah but i feel like jono </joey>
<connor> doesn't really come into his own no at </connor>
<garnt> any point no sorry if we're going on a </garnt>
<connor> whole talk about jojo um watch or read </connor>
<garnt> jojo just just talk about it jojo fans </garnt>
<garnt> being jojo fans exactly right you need </garnt>
<connor> to read it because then you can </connor>
<joey> experience part 7 which you should 100 </joey>
<garnt> read it is amazing no you can't skip to </garnt>
<joey> it don't do that yeah because part 7 has </joey>
<garnt> so many references to previous parts </garnt>
<joey> you'd be spoiling it read it all it's </joey>
<joey> amazing yeah yeah uh all right what else </joey>
<joey> feelings are vinyl and saga did you put </joey>
<connor> this on your list or not or we're gonna </connor>
<garnt> get it i uh i didn't put this on my list </garnt>
<connor> oh okay yeah i almost did but then i was </connor>
<connor> like yeah the anime is out villain saga </connor>
<connor> gets to go on my list wonks the banger </connor>
<connor> two because they uh spell a welsh town </connor>
<garnt> correctly </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's got one of the most badass </garnt>
<garnt> like antagonists in like manga and he's </garnt>
<garnt> welsh yeah welsh as well of course i i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't i knew you would love this skull </garnt>
<connor> lads </connor>
<connor> represent represent they went to like </connor>
<connor> somewhere and that i was so glad that </connor>
<garnt> they i want i really want to because </garnt>
<garnt> obviously i read it in english yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> really want to see how they spelled this </garnt>
<garnt> welsh town yeah </garnt>
<connor> like because it's like it was like </connor>
<connor> or something right yeah and i was like </connor>
<connor> how the [ __ ] do you how the how on earth </connor>
<connor> do you </connor>
<joey> i don't remember how i'm pretty sure i </joey>
<joey> got up to that part but i don't remember </joey>
<connor> how they spelled it i really want to see </connor>
<joey> how they spelled it i was like oh that's </joey>
<connor> a funny name because how on earth did </connor>
<garnt> you put the sound they probably don't </garnt>
<garnt> they probably didn't yeah they already </garnt>
<garnt> did yeah they probably did like </garnt>
<garnt> but uh yeah though honestly memes aside </garnt>
<connor> um vinyl and saga is amazing like i </connor>
<connor> think even if </connor>
<connor> i had read more than 10 manga </connor>
<garnt> it would still be on there it is so </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] good it's on hiatus and it's </joey>
<joey> still amazing is it on hiatus yeah isn't </joey>
<joey> it i don't know i think i i feel like </joey>
<connor> it's still i read up to a certain point </connor>
<garnt> i caught up and then i stopped yeah what </garnt>
<garnt> what is it about like all these like </garnt>
<garnt> sane and manga the sane in classics i i </garnt>
<joey> would like to call them that just </joey>
<joey> eventually goes </joey>
<joey> masterpieces always go on yeah saying </joey>
<garnt> that masterpiece is always going to go </garnt>
<connor> on hiatus right and it's just villain </connor>
<connor> saga is just amazing and like </connor>
<joey> the you when you realize it's a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> prologue the first arc is just a </joey>
<garnt> prologue yeah and yet it's still one of </garnt>
<connor> the best stories okay </connor>
<garnt> what do you think for because if you've </garnt>
<garnt> seen season one villain saga you know </garnt>
<garnt> what the prologue is you know what the </garnt>
<garnt> main are the main beginning arc is what </garnt>
<garnt> do you think of the farmland arc </garnt>
<garnt> i really like the farmland </garnt>
<garnt> i'm excited to see the reactions </garnt>
<connor> so the farmland </connor>
<connor> okay so we won't talk too much about it </connor>
<connor> we'll spoil it but it changes the pace </connor>
<garnt> drastically yeah if okay so if you think </garnt>
<garnt> that if you go into season two thinking </garnt>
<garnt> that it's going to be in the same vein </garnt>
<connor> of season one you're going to be </connor>
<connor> disappointed the way i find a feel about </connor>
<joey> it right right is that </joey>
<connor> berserk and villain saga they have a </connor>
<joey> crossroads and they both went different </joey>
<joey> ways with it yeah yeah whereas you know </joey>
<joey> for example guts right never stops </joey>
<connor> becoming violent yeah god's argument </connor>
<joey> becomes more violent every time yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah and you know vinland saga tries to </connor>
<connor> make a character that maybe feels a </connor>
<connor> little bit more guilty about that yeah </connor>
<garnt> and so that's what was really </garnt>
<garnt> interesting for me is that they weren't </garnt>
<garnt> just like okay this guy's good at </garnt>
<garnt> killing yeah that's what he does now </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he just keeps killing he's like no </garnt>
<garnt> he he actively like he matures he </garnt>
<connor> doesn't want to keep doing that that's </connor>
<connor> and that's what's so interesting about </connor>
<connor> it and really recommend reading it it is </connor>
<connor> just amazing it's like a huge artistic </connor>
<joey> risk he took with that oh yeah i think </joey>
<garnt> it paid off </garnt>
<connor> it's like his the the worst thing he did </connor>
<connor> was making the prologue so [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> like like imagine that being the worst </connor>
<garnt> thing you could do you made it so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] good that people expected you to </garnt>
<garnt> keep doing that yeah yeah and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> he he keeps doing it but in a completely </garnt>
<garnt> different type of story yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> it's like villain saga is [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> incredible but like the prologue is so </garnt>
<garnt> different than the rest of the story </garnt>
<garnt> that if you come into it with the same </garnt>
<garnt> expectations you're gonna just get </garnt>
<garnt> whiplash you're gonna be like where's </garnt>
<garnt> the action where's the killing where's </garnt>
<garnt> the violence there was so much of this </garnt>
<garnt> in season one and i was just like well </garnt>
<garnt> once you've realized that the story was </garnt>
<garnt> never about that that the story was all </garnt>
<connor> about </connor>
<connor> they were building it up the whole time </connor>
<garnt> yeah when you realized that everything </garnt>
<garnt> that his father said at the beginning </garnt>
<joey> was what the story was meant to be about </joey>
<garnt> from the from the get-go and everything </garnt>
<garnt> else was just like everything else was </garnt>
<garnt> like a bigger tangent than anything that </garnt>
<garnt> we've ever gone on yeah you know and </garnt>
<garnt> that was yeah yeah season one's just a </garnt>
<connor> time but it's so true to life because </connor>
<connor> even if your dad told you [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> wouldn't [ __ ] listen to him yeah but </connor>
<connor> then you'll realize when you're an adult </connor>
<connor> he was right all along exactly that's </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry i went against you father it's </connor>
<connor> so good because it's so like even though </connor>
<connor> the situation's obviously crazy but even </connor>
<connor> though it's not that unbelievable </connor>
<connor> because you know it's it's set on like a </connor>
<connor> real part of history yeah you know </connor>
<connor> it it builds characters in such a </connor>
<connor> compelling way that are so realistic and </connor>
<connor> every single character in this show </connor>
<connor> you're like i believe that could be a </connor>
<connor> dude yeah yeah i believe that i i see </connor>
<connor> parallels to myself and some of these </connor>
<joey> characters that are uncomfortable yeah </joey>
<joey> and that's what i loved about it it was </joey>
<joey> so good and it presented war in a </joey>
<joey> horrific way yeah as war should be yeah </joey>
<joey> and so if you haven't please do yourself </joey>
<garnt> a solid and and read vineland </garnt>
<connor> it is amazing </connor>
<joey> if you like vikings i just just you know </joey>
<connor> just just at least read if ask a lads or </connor>
<garnt> at least watch the anime for asking </garnt>
<garnt> because he is honestly like i think one </garnt>
<garnt> of my favorite characters oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> oh he's straight up my guy and also i </connor>
<garnt> mean </garnt>
<joey> i'm very excited for the reaction to </joey>
<joey> anime fans and my only fans to the </joey>
<joey> season </joey>
<garnt> two yeah to be like hey when does when </garnt>
<garnt> does stuff happen </garnt>
<garnt> so how long are they going to how long </garnt>
<connor> are they going to stay on this farm it </connor>
<connor> goes from like doom to runescape in like </connor>
<joey> like one chapter it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like doomed it's like </joey>
<garnt> like stardew valley or something like </garnt>
<connor> that i guess that's spoilers enough </connor>
<garnt> right yeah i mean berserk we've we </garnt>
<garnt> literally just talked about berserk yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's a classic for a reason i've spoke </connor>
<connor> about claymore before yeah um claymore </connor>
<connor> again is uh very similar to i guess </connor>
<joey> berserk in some ways yeah i'm stock fans </joey>
<garnt> would you say you enjoyed it enough that </garnt>
<garnt> if you had read more manga you think you </garnt>
<connor> would still be in yours i don't think it </connor>
<connor> would be on here if i'd read </connor>
<connor> some other big names that i know i would </connor>
<connor> enjoy </connor>
<connor> um i think it's got a benga first half </connor>
<joey> yeah and then loses its steam yeah you </joey>
<joey> know there's some stories where you're </joey>
<joey> reading the manga and you're like this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] planned everything yeah </joey>
<joey> like a blueprint yeah yeah he knew </joey>
<joey> exactly what was gonna happen and he </joey>
<joey> knew exactly where this was going </joey>
<joey> whereas with claymore i feel like </joey>
<connor> they would he was </connor>
<connor> they were just writing it and he had a </connor>
<connor> core idea and he just didn't or they i </connor>
<connor> don't know if it's a guy or a girl yeah </connor>
<connor> uh they just didn't really know how they </connor>
<garnt> wanted to finish it but that that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's the i believe george armada talks </garnt>
<garnt> about this there's two ways of writing </garnt>
<joey> stories and there's the architect and </joey>
<joey> the uh </joey>
<joey> something like something to do with like </joey>
<joey> growing plants or something yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> one likes to design everything like a </joey>
<joey> building you have every single aspect </joey>
<joey> like out perfectly and the other it's </joey>
<joey> like a greenhouse you just kind of grow </joey>
<joey> things see where it goes see what goes </joey>
<joey> with it i definitely feel like that is a </joey>
<joey> riskier way of doing stories but also </joey>
<joey> can lead to some super interesting </joey>
<connor> results yeah and i feel like claymore </connor>
<joey> just kind of lost and i feel like the </joey>
<joey> the architect like type is like the the </joey>
<connor> downside to it is like you could build </connor>
<connor> too much and then you kind of have to </connor>
<joey> like oh should i have to pick up all </joey>
<connor> these right here </connor>
<connor> maybe you build too much of the world </connor>
<joey> yeah sometimes it's a bad thing i mean </joey>
<connor> you can pull up </connor>
<garnt> right just like hunter hunter introduced </garnt>
<garnt> like seventeen thousand things yeah </garnt>
<joey> there is it's just harder to maintain </joey>
<connor> yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> breaks down and you put more bricks down </connor>
<joey> and then you forget the foundations you </joey>
<connor> laid yeah you start building a chimney </connor>
<joey> where you've already built like a </joey>
<joey> fireplace on the other side it doesn't </joey>
<connor> make it like any sense something except </connor>
<connor> maybe i'm running out of bricks i don't </connor>
<connor> know how much time left my back hurts i </connor>
<connor> can't draw [ __ ] i should have thought </connor>
<joey> about this or you could just be like a </joey>
<connor> rocky and just be like yeah i'm just </connor>
<connor> gonna plant the scene here and see how </connor>
<connor> it goes which is what i love about he </connor>
<garnt> that is the perfect example of that kind </garnt>
<garnt> of writer iraqi literally just gives you </garnt>
<garnt> ideas and then he just keeps expanding </garnt>
<connor> on it yeah and you can tell he has some </connor>
<connor> idea where he wants it to go but you can </connor>
<connor> tell also </connor>
<connor> you can tell there's so many moments </connor>
<joey> where he just like and he even says it </joey>
<joey> himself right when he just decides to do </joey>
<joey> things he doesn't remember half the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> he wrote </joey>
<joey> it's such a fun way and it leads to such </joey>
<joey> fun writing yeah 100 but yeah claymore </joey>
<garnt> although </garnt>
<connor> an amazing concept amazing first half </connor>
<garnt> yeah definitely and the art is so good </garnt>
<connor> you're beyond that that's amazing yeah </connor>
<connor> it's one of the best [ __ ] love what </connor>
<garnt> is it what is it about dark fantasy </garnt>
<connor> where just the art is just always about </connor>
<garnt> i don't know it's it's it's like a rite </garnt>
<connor> of passage right oh you want to write a </connor>
<garnt> dark fantasy show me your drawings you </garnt>
<connor> better have godly and for some reason </connor>
<connor> i'm a simple man um i like rankings so </connor>
<connor> whenever there's characters and they </connor>
<connor> have ranks </connor>
<connor> and like </connor>
<connor> a true gamer they're clearly defined as </connor>
<joey> this is number one strong this is number </joey>
<connor> two strong i don't know why i love that </connor>
<garnt> but you're a gamer yeah because it's </garnt>
<joey> like i mean i i feel like there's just </joey>
<garnt> something embedded into like yeah humans </garnt>
<garnt> that i just like rankings we love </garnt>
<connor> ranking things yeah and i love and then </connor>
<connor> the story aspect of number seven could </connor>
<connor> actually be stronger than number two </connor>
<joey> yeah in some ways and that's super </joey>
<joey> interesting why you like one punch man </joey>
<connor> i love the hero rating system </connor>
<connor> i think it leads to such interesting </connor>
<connor> like characters in really strange ways </connor>
<connor> um like yeah i love the bicycle man in </connor>
<connor> there yeah i mean that's just why that's </connor>
<connor> just part of like showing an anime right </connor>
<garnt> we need to rank people because people </garnt>
<connor> like ranks people like i love it what </connor>
<garnt> what are the what are the youtubers </garnt>
<garnt> going to make videos about if we can't </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] rank exactly right in japanese </connor>
<garnt> companies you get ranked on your </garnt>
<joey> performance yeah with a rank and uh like </joey>
<joey> a grade i want to be number one yeah so </joey>
<connor> like it's it's like they they love doing </connor>
<garnt> it everything needs to be ranked here </garnt>
<connor> like a bidet rank </connor>
<connor> what i love is how everyone's just found </connor>
<connor> out like </connor>
<garnt> power ranking things just like people </garnt>
<garnt> just you could power rank the most </garnt>
<garnt> mundane things </garnt>
<garnt> this is why it's here this is literally </garnt>
<connor> what tealistic yeah it's literally just </connor>
<connor> powerful yeah yeah yeah um and then </connor>
<connor> obviously i shield 21 which is uh i've </connor>
<connor> watched crocodile basket i i've read </connor>
<connor> i've watched your mushy pedal uh what </connor>
<connor> other sports anime have fans </connor>
<connor> i've watched haikyuu slam dunk i haven't </connor>
<connor> read slam dunk i'm gonna read slam dunk </connor>
<connor> but so far this is my favorite sports </connor>
<joey> story oh yes yes it's awesome and again </joey>
<joey> like the visual this single-handedly got </joey>
<joey> me into american football yeah i i still </joey>
<connor> don't know the rules fully yeah um but i </connor>
<joey> had a fun time i mean it's very deviated </joey>
<garnt> from real life it is i'm like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> watching real american football and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like where are the metaphors </garnt>
<joey> where where </joey>
<joey> you're not gonna lie like i was like oh </joey>
<joey> you know when i when i read this because </joey>
<joey> i was like in the prime of my childhood </joey>
<joey> when this was in show and jump right so </joey>
<garnt> everyone like everyone was trying to </garnt>
<joey> like do rodeo drives and like double </joey>
<joey> that ghost </joey>
<joey> this is the one move that is probably </joey>
<joey> like the most feasible </joey>
<connor> if i ever throw a football ever again </connor>
<joey> you bet i'm gonna like picture a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> angel behind him </joey>
<joey> there's a panel where like he throws </joey>
<joey> this ball and it's like this amazing </joey>
<joey> artwork of like this angel yeah the </joey>
<joey> angel throw or something </joey>
<connor> this panel it's like a spread and it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] beautiful yeah yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> just oh it's so good i think some of the </connor>
<garnt> best is where you see the battle of the </garnt>
<connor> metaphors and i think it just makes the </connor>
<connor> it makes the sport scene so much more </connor>
<connor> hype </connor>
<connor> because i can't remember the exact </connor>
<connor> because it's been years and years um but </connor>
<connor> i remember like very vividly just </connor>
<connor> someone kicking a ball and it just like </connor>
<garnt> it it's kicked with like so much force </garnt>
<garnt> or something that it like penetrates </garnt>
<garnt> something that's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] i'm i'm speaking what was like the </garnt>
<garnt> second to last match what was like the </garnt>
<connor> last match was against the best school </connor>
<joey> yeah they were like the best school in </joey>
<joey> japan yeah because that's was probably </joey>
<garnt> the highlight of it and then afterwards </garnt>
<garnt> they fight america </garnt>
<garnt> that's right oh yeah and that was kind </garnt>
<connor> of that kind of sucked yeah but yeah </connor>
<connor> they go against like the best players </connor>
<connor> yeah the real number seven the real </connor>
<garnt> number the real 21 21 21 [ __ ] house </garnt>
<joey> the real high shots </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> sorry i don't know if that's spoilers </connor>
<connor> that might be spoiler actually </connor>
<connor> mulan spoiler warning put this before </connor>
<connor> uh yeah yeah it's brilliant yeah they </connor>
<connor> they face the the real i shield 21. all </connor>
<connor> right and as they all have interesting </connor>
<connor> powers yeah that it's literally it's </connor>
<connor> literally crocodile basket </connor>
<joey> on the field </joey>
<joey> i think uh the guy who wrote eyeshield </joey>
<connor> 21 went on to do another shonen jump </connor>
<connor> manga dr stone yeah he wrote dr stone </connor>
<connor> right yeah </connor>

<connor> um joe love room </connor>
<connor> we bought the whole collection of </connor>
<connor> television recently right yeah </connor>
<connor> accidentally </connor>
<joey> you want to explain the story </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> so i got scammed quote unquote so i </connor>
<connor> bought uh i bought </connor>
<connor> all the volumes of boba bo which was one </connor>
<garnt> that i thought about putting up here um </garnt>
<garnt> but it was only volume one and four </garnt>
<garnt> though so basically i opened up volume </garnt>
<garnt> one and it was uh i bought a second hand </garnt>
<garnt> so i was like okay i was whatever it was </garnt>
<joey> chiefs or whatever and i was like all </joey>
<joey> right cool i'm gonna relieve my </joey>
<joey> childhood open up volume one of bobo </joey>
<joey> it's volume three of 12 </joey>
<connor> they just literally replaced the cover </connor>
<garnt> they literally just put the cover </garnt>
<joey> of bobo </joey>
<joey> on the front of this but it's volume </joey>
<connor> three of the locker room did you reckon </connor>
<connor> they did it on purpose or an accident i </connor>
<connor> reckon it's by accident so i was like </connor>
<joey> wait don't tell me all of these at all </joey>
<connor> for some reason volume one and four was </connor>
<connor> so so it's probably just you know you </connor>
<connor> know when you like take a dvd out to </connor>
<garnt> watch it and you have to put the dvd in </garnt>
<garnt> the dvd player back in the box yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> think you forget that you've just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> was owned by like a teenager and it was </garnt>
<joey> like well i need to hide the </joey>
<garnt> degenerative [ __ ] from my mom i'm going </garnt>
<garnt> to put the bow before oh my god that was </garnt>
<garnt> totally it wasn't it was slowly yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like they'll never know we'll never know </garnt>
<connor> we'll never know i just think it's </connor>
<joey> barbara some kids jacked off dior </joey>
<joey> volume 1. i'm trying to throw that out </joey>
<connor> uh is this junji ito so that's uzumaki </connor>
<connor> oh yeah it's this i'd be surprised you </connor>
<joey> know it's ichigo 100 oh it's itchy i've </joey>
<connor> heard of this i have not read it or </connor>
<joey> watched it okay um so which one would </joey>
<garnt> you like to know first obviously we i </garnt>
<joey> think we can get rid of uh </joey>
<connor> again jojo because we've already talked </connor>
<garnt> about that already talked about that so </garnt>
<connor> not hunter hunter okay </connor>
<garnt> i i i'm probably going to get destroyed </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay i haven't read hontanti yet oh </garnt>
<connor> okay wait i've watched it and it's </connor>
<joey> amazing yeah the only reason why i i </joey>
<garnt> think the biggest takashi sim hasn't </garnt>
<garnt> read </garnt>
<joey> so much about hunter hunter </joey>
<connor> just from outside information but i </connor>
<connor> haven't actually read it or watched it i </connor>
<joey> i own all the volumes right now i think </joey>
<connor> it's sitting there waiting for off for a </connor>
<connor> rainy day i think it's i think it's safe </connor>
<connor> to say this it's the best show to </connor>
<connor> animate i feel like a lot of people say </connor>
<connor> that i feel like i've been lied to </connor>
<connor> because the amount of times we talk </connor>
<garnt> about hunter hunter and me and connor </garnt>
<garnt> have just like been talking about the </garnt>
<connor> dark continent </connor>
<connor> we always mean like netro getting up </connor>
<garnt> i just i just always assumed that joey </garnt>
<joey> was just like </joey>
<joey> literally all the information i know is </joey>
<joey> because people around me don't stop </joey>
<garnt> talking about that it's not okay you </garnt>
<garnt> need to go watch it what the [ __ ] or </garnt>
<connor> read it the anime is amazing i never </connor>
<joey> said i read it or watched it </joey>
<garnt> i just assumed the anime man had watched </garnt>
<joey> hunter hunter </joey>
<garnt> i feel like this has just been a game of </garnt>
<garnt> among us now </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] impossible there's an impossible </garnt>
<connor> among us </connor>
<garnt> so much about hunter like i could </garnt>
<connor> probably like give you the outline of </connor>
<garnt> how it goes but i don't know what the </garnt>
<garnt> names of the arcs i want to go back to </garnt>
<garnt> every clip now </garnt>
<garnt> i know like dark content and our camera </garnt>
<joey> and arc all of those the hunter exam arc </joey>
<garnt> and all that </garnt>
<joey> i know them again because i hear it from </joey>
<connor> everybody </connor>
<connor> what i want to know is how we've just </connor>
<connor> found out about this despite the fact </connor>
<garnt> that we've talked about it so many times </garnt>
<garnt> on the podcast is this publicly known is </garnt>
<garnt> this widely available information yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you've like been a part of the </garnt>
<garnt> conversation i swear to god i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna have to like rewind every </garnt>
<garnt> clip where we've talked about hundreds </garnt>
<joey> i've said it on i've said it on streams </joey>
<garnt> multiple times i've never read or </garnt>
<garnt> watched it i i can't be there for the </garnt>
<garnt> whole three hours </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah like again i know so much about </garnt>
<joey> hunter and i know i'm gonna like it </joey>
<joey> that's why i'm not in a rush to read it </joey>
<garnt> or watch it because i don't know okay i </garnt>
<garnt> like it yeah me and full metal outcomes </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's like it's like of course it's </joey>
<connor> like we've just found joey's full </connor>
<garnt> message it's like it's takashi </garnt>
<connor> i know and again like i know it's going </connor>
<connor> to be good because i love togashi yeah </connor>
<connor> it's [ __ ] amazing i don't know </connor>
<connor> don't read it watch the anime </connor>
<connor> the animals the anime is better do you </connor>
<connor> agree </connor>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> yeah because i've heard both sides of </joey>
<garnt> the argument listen what's the other </garnt>
<garnt> side of the argument the other side is </garnt>
<joey> that the manga is good because togashi </joey>
<garnt> is good </garnt>
<garnt> i mean that's so it's so it's basically </garnt>
<garnt> just like a preference in medium then </garnt>
<joey> right pretty much yeah i mean yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean i'm probably gonna watch and read </joey>
<joey> both to be honest it's it's just a </joey>
<garnt> matter of which one to do first yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean hanzonz is just prime mad house and </garnt>
<garnt> madhouse haven't been at the prime for </garnt>
<connor> like a long time i think yeah and the </connor>
<connor> manga also looks like napkin drawings a </connor>
<connor> lot of the time not </connor>
<garnt> in the beginning and the volumes the </garnt>
<joey> volumes are fixed oh so they fix it yeah </joey>
<joey> in the shonen jump volumes uh the </joey>
<joey> magazines it looks like [ __ ] okay but </joey>
<connor> then he redraws it for the actual i </connor>
<connor> finished the anime and then </connor>
<connor> carried on reading and i was like </connor>
<connor> am i reading like one web comic right </connor>
<garnt> now like what what is this it was about </garnt>
<joey> that uh drawing honestly it's yeah but i </joey>
<joey> yeah wow yeah but then he takes the time </joey>
<joey> to actually redraw everything properly </joey>
<joey> for the actual book so the books look </joey>
<connor> like [ __ ] amazing sense but also kind </connor>
<connor> of sad if you're a big hunter hunter fan </connor>
<connor> who waits and then you have to go back </connor>
<connor> and read it but yeah if you read it if </connor>
<joey> you read a week like you're probably </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's like a weekly </garnt>
<garnt> um so that's your favorite shonen jump </garnt>
<joey> title of course well i mean here's the </joey>
<garnt> thing uh a lot of these are shortages </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i kind of realized that what's </garnt>
<connor> black cat doing show black cat slam dunk </connor>
<joey> each other 100 jojo </joey>
<connor> oh yeah i want to let's talk let's talk </connor>
<connor> about you hack show because i've i've </connor>
<connor> ever watched i think i mentioned on the </connor>
<connor> podcast one time i tried to start it </connor>
<connor> yeah i just could i couldn't stand the </connor>
<connor> audio on the on the i don't know oh so </connor>
<joey> you watch the anime i watch five minutes </joey>
<joey> oh i can't take this so you hug show it </joey>
<connor> it does like uh what i like to call a </connor>
<connor> reborn basically it starts off as a </connor>
<connor> comedy ends up as an action right same </connor>
<connor> thing with dragon ball right like dragon </connor>
<connor> ball started off as a comedy and then z </connor>
<connor> came along and it became the action that </connor>
<connor> it's known for so like right you hawks </connor>
<joey> are the first couple of arcs like when </joey>
<connor> you scared the main character dies like </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like a scene that's how it </connor>
<connor> starts right yeah </connor>
<connor> it's not literally first panel you skate </connor>
<joey> our main character gets hit by a car and </joey>
<joey> dies </joey>
<garnt> this was before isa car was the thing </garnt>
<connor> yeah he didn't go to another world he </connor>
<garnt> just he just died he just died </garnt>
<joey> i know a lot about you hack a show </joey>
<joey> without ever watching it yeah right i </joey>
<joey> know a lot of i know the bad guy i know </joey>
<joey> there's an epic fight with one guy i </joey>
<joey> don't know who it is and then yeah </joey>
<connor> cause you know the tournament arc right </connor>
<garnt> i know the tournament </garnt>
<garnt> he literally just described literally </garnt>
<garnt> every shonen anime of all time i know </garnt>
<garnt> the bad guy i know there's another </garnt>
<connor> i know what he looks like i know who </connor>
<connor> it's going to be and the giga shadow </connor>
<garnt> yeah what's his name i don't know giga </garnt>
<garnt> chad </garnt>
<garnt> giggart </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't think he he's even the best </garnt>
<connor> villain he looks like the uh you know if </connor>
<connor> you watch very odd parents </connor>
<connor> crimson chin he looks like yeah you know </connor>
<garnt> like have you watched very often the </garnt>
<garnt> buff fairy right yeah he looks like the </garnt>
<connor> buff fairy from very high </connor>
<garnt> looks like the buff fairy from from </garnt>
<garnt> fairly odd parents </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god </garnt>
<connor> he has the muscles but like the weird </connor>
<garnt> neck yeah yeah it's literally like the </garnt>
<garnt> fairy art parents </garnt>
<garnt> he looks exactly like that oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> look but </garnt>
<garnt> ruined one of the pictures of the </garnt>
<garnt> villain villains </garnt>
<joey> all right so like so have you ever seen </joey>
<garnt> the anime of yuhaka show i have </garnt>
<garnt> not not a fan not a fan not a fan is it </garnt>
<connor> it's i don't know it's bittersweet right </connor>
<connor> because it's like the same thing with </connor>
<connor> black cat where it's like i love the </connor>
<connor> manga so much that like </connor>
<connor> it wasn't like the perfect adaptation </connor>
<joey> that i wanted like it was good but it's </joey>
<joey> like i'd rather just reread them what </joey>
<garnt> was it what was missing to make it the </garnt>
<garnt> perfect adaptation </garnt>
<garnt> as someone who's like i haven't read the </garnt>
<garnt> manga of you hakusho i've only seen the </garnt>
<garnt> anime oh really yeah oh did you like the </garnt>
<joey> anime i [ __ ] love the anime well </joey>
<joey> you'd [ __ ] love the manga even more </joey>
<garnt> okay but like is there anything i can </garnt>
<connor> get from the manga that i couldn't have </connor>
<joey> already gotten from the anime or just </joey>
<joey> re-watch the animation because i thought </joey>
<connor> the anime was like a really good </connor>
<joey> adaptation especially for history like </joey>
<garnt> records of red rock </garnt>
<connor> that's better than that that's solid </connor>
<joey> animation you know </joey>
<joey> i mean i don't know like i think this </joey>
<joey> might just be like the the whole thing </joey>
<joey> with like how manga art styles i feel </joey>
<joey> age better than animation in a lot of </joey>
<connor> aspects yeah in my eyes </connor>
<connor> to differ you think so like demon slayer </connor>
<connor> in the manga it just looks terrible </connor>
<joey> compared to the animal well i mean </joey>
<joey> that's because like the animations </joey>
<connor> the character designs change differently </connor>
<connor> right but like in the anime adaptation </connor>
<connor> of you hawk show they did a pretty good </connor>
<joey> job of like </joey>
<connor> re-adapting like uh togashi's art style </connor>
<connor> i feel like i haven't read it from what </connor>
<joey> i've just seen of it it looks one-to-one </joey>
<joey> to me i don't know i'll just a glance </joey>
<connor> that's like a person who's i don't know </connor>
<joey> i feel blanched it but i i sometimes </joey>
<joey> look at clips of the anime of you haksha </joey>
<joey> and i'm like something about this hasn't </joey>
<joey> aged </joey>
<joey> chinese 90s yeah it's 90s like the 90s </joey>
<connor> animation is </connor>
<connor> some of it hasn't aged very well </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean some some of it's like very </garnt>
<joey> janky limited animation this is like a </joey>
<joey> 90s anime yeah but like they still had </joey>
<joey> like when during the big fights there </joey>
<garnt> are still like those sakuraga moments </garnt>
<joey> absolutely like those have aged </joey>
<joey> wonderfully i mean i i honestly think at </joey>
<connor> this point it's just like a personal </connor>
<connor> preference like the same thing with slam </connor>
<connor> dunk right it's like slam dunk for me </connor>
<garnt> like i watch the anime as well like a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] banger of an anime but it's like </joey>
<garnt> i just personally prefer the manga to be </garnt>
<garnt> honest i actually have like huge </garnt>
<garnt> problems with that slam dunk anime i </garnt>
<connor> think that's age horrible i've heard </connor>
<connor> that sounding amazing very good and </connor>
<joey> that's because it might be a nostalgia </joey>
<joey> factor yeah it's probably his nostalgia </joey>
<joey> factor because i watched it in </joey>
<joey> university and i was just like man this </joey>
<garnt> is a it's a really slow sports anime my </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] god they literally like take ten </garnt>
<connor> episodes it's like it's like a hundred </connor>
<connor> times </connor>
<connor> sports anime sorry sports shows uh sorry </connor>
<connor> support support properties in general </connor>
<connor> uh almost better in manga normally like </connor>
<garnt> i just just because of pacing yeah i i </garnt>
<garnt> think that that's true like 10 years ago </garnt>
<garnt> or 20 years ago now </garnt>
<connor> um because like slam dunk i shield i </connor>
<garnt> would like recommend the mango </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> that's that's why for me like both slam </connor>
<garnt> dunk and you yeah in my manga three by </garnt>
<joey> three not my anime yeah yeah yeah like i </joey>
<garnt> much prefer the mangroves yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> like i i feel like old sports anime they </garnt>
<garnt> had horrible pacing but like shows like </garnt>
<garnt> haikyuu kuroko actually your mushy pedal </garnt>
<garnt> i really am yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like they i think i think within the </garnt>
<garnt> past like new generation sports i mean </garnt>
<garnt> they've really fixed their pacing issues </garnt>
<garnt> to the point where if a match lasts more </garnt>
<garnt> than three episodes then it's like a </garnt>
<connor> super super important match like have </connor>
<connor> you seen haikyuu uh i've watched the </connor>
<joey> first two seasons okay so season three </joey>
<garnt> is like one single match it's like </garnt>
<joey> yeah and when i saw that i was like </joey>
<joey> here we [ __ ] go again another another </joey>
<joey> like dragon ball z esque fight scene in </joey>
<joey> a in like in a sports anime but like </joey>
<joey> that match was so [ __ ] intense that </joey>
<joey> it needed 10 episodes and like it was </joey>
<garnt> just what it was not stretched out at </garnt>
<garnt> all yeah at all and that was like to me </garnt>
<garnt> like the highlight of haikyuu so far of </garnt>
<connor> the anime i enjoyed crocodile basket i </connor>
<garnt> thought the i enjoyed the posting on </garnt>
<connor> that even if yeah because it was very </connor>
<garnt> quite fast really yeah i think it was </garnt>
<connor> like actually good pacing because it was </connor>
<joey> like never more than three episodes yeah </joey>
<connor> because how many times how like i can </connor>
<joey> only be invested in one match for like </joey>
<garnt> so long you know </garnt>
<garnt> there's only so much that can happen in </garnt>
<garnt> a single match well i was really good at </garnt>
<connor> building up the [ __ ] i think yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah you're like what do you mean you </garnt>
<connor> know they they weren't rushing too much </connor>
<connor> into like the powers yeah they were </connor>
<connor> pretty sparingly adding them in i felt </connor>
<garnt> and then i i didn't watch the movie but </garnt>
<connor> everything the movie was everything </connor>
<garnt> passed the main </garnt>
<garnt> run of the what is it three seasons two </garnt>
<garnt> seasons three seasons three yeah three </garnt>
<connor> after the how many is that 50 episodes </connor>
<connor> something like that i guess over 50 </connor>
<connor> episodes yeah it's where they beat the </connor>
<connor> uh the </connor>
<connor> does it end oh it doesn't matter but the </connor>
<connor> point was that i found that after like </connor>
<connor> that that was like not really invested </connor>
<joey> anymore it's such a shame for me because </joey>
<joey> like from the i didn't watch all of </joey>
<joey> kuroko like but </joey>
<joey> from what i did see </joey>
<joey> i really enjoyed it but it sucks because </joey>
<joey> for me now slam dunk is just like </joey>
<joey> forever just ruined basketball and i i </joey>
<connor> wonder if i will read slam dunk and i'll </connor>
<connor> feel like i can't enjoy this croakers </connor>
<connor> better or if i'll feel that like there's </connor>
<joey> definitely been both cases so like i've </joey>
<connor> i've recommended slam dunk to people who </connor>
<connor> first read kuroko yeah and they were </connor>
<connor> like ah it's not as good because they're </connor>
<connor> just used to the kuroko format because </connor>
<connor> like unlike kiroko slam dunk doesn't </connor>
<garnt> have any like super powers it is like </garnt>
<connor> it's just very bare bones raw it's like </connor>
<connor> an nba jam versus nba 2k yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> you're pretty much pretty much yeah like </connor>
<joey> it kind of like it kind of like takes </joey>
<garnt> the fact that it is probably one of the </garnt>
<garnt> most realistic adaptations of sports in </garnt>
<garnt> manga yeah but it still makes it just as </garnt>
<garnt> exciting but it does it in the most like </garnt>
<garnt> cinematic like [ __ ] type of way and i </garnt>
<joey> mean like you know in the case of slam </joey>
<joey> dunk like when that first came out of </joey>
<joey> japan that it created a [ __ ] cultural </joey>
<connor> phenomenon well every time i have an old </connor>
<connor> taxi man here and he asked me if i like </connor>
<connor> anime or whatever i'll be like yeah i </connor>
<connor> like anime and then he's like oh do you </connor>
<connor> like slam dunk they always ask me yeah </connor>
<garnt> they're in the like 40s plus they always </garnt>
<joey> ask me if i like yeah it was like a </joey>
<garnt> cultural phenomenon here in japan wasn't </garnt>
<joey> it when it came out i think i think the </joey>
<joey> year that it came out i think i read </joey>
<joey> something like uh of all like middle </joey>
<connor> schools and high schools in japan the </connor>
<connor> attendance of basketball clubs raised by </connor>
<connor> six hundred percent well that's not a </connor>
<connor> huge sport in japan as well yeah but it </connor>
<connor> wasn't but it got bigger </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean it was that good i mean </joey>
<joey> in my opinion </joey>
<joey> the final chapter of slam dunk is still </joey>
<joey> one of the most beautiful chapters in </joey>
<garnt> all of manga yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> he had balls to just put zero dialogue </garnt>
<joey> yeah the entire last chapter has zero </joey>
<garnt> dialogue yeah i'll get that one and it </garnt>
<connor> just stands and it is the most cinematic </connor>
<joey> final chapter of manga ever in my </joey>
<joey> opinion but i mean like yeah so i mean </joey>
<joey> obviously that's great um so black cat </joey>
<joey> all right so black cat for me </joey>
<joey> okay so you know how my character like </joey>
<garnt> my avatar on youtube </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh so that came from black guy from </garnt>
<joey> black oh my god okay so yabba ki kentar </joey>
<connor> who's the guy who made black cat he has </connor>
<connor> this thing in all of his manga so he </connor>
<joey> also illustrated to love her as well </joey>
<connor> yeah um </connor>
<joey> i mean it is [ __ ] good but um he has </joey>
<joey> this like kind of easter egg thing in </joey>
<joey> all of his manga where in every chapter </joey>
<connor> of his manga he puts this like little </connor>
<connor> white cat in at least one panel of every </connor>
<connor> chapter of his vlogger just as like a </connor>
<garnt> little hidden easter egg and it's that </garnt>
<connor> cat face that i use as my mask so like </connor>
<garnt> originally like [ __ ] back way back </garnt>
<joey> when on like new grounds and [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> that that was just my logo oh and then </joey>
<joey> and then it adapted into my current </joey>
<joey> avatar but like i don't know black cat </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<connor> it's weird it's definitely heavy </connor>
<connor> nostalgia factor but i think this was </connor>
<connor> the first time i ever read a manga and i </connor>
<connor> was like wow </connor>
<connor> like manga artists are [ __ ] talented </connor>
<joey> it was the first time where i was </joey>
<connor> actually wowed by a piece of artwork you </connor>
<connor> want to explain what happens in it i i </connor>
<joey> can try and explain but i honestly can't </joey>
<joey> remember anything it's been a while yeah </joey>
<joey> it's been a while for me as well </joey>
<joey> you want to try this </joey>
<garnt> he's not a black cat no but that's like </garnt>
<joey> his code name yeah he's an assassin </joey>
<joey> right he's an assassin yeah he's number </joey>
<connor> 13. that's it </connor>
<joey> and his name is train he has two guns </joey>
<connor> train heartness this is two guns oh is </connor>
<garnt> that it yeah train hardness train hard </garnt>
<connor> two guns two guns yeah he has two guns </connor>
<connor> two pistols yeah </connor>
<connor> sven </connor>
<connor> i remember that this was the first </connor>
<connor> because i just got into anime i'd say </connor>
<connor> anything i remember about it this is the </connor>
<joey> first show that i was like yeah you know </joey>
<joey> what not every anime is above a seven </joey>
<joey> uh this is the first show that i was </joey>
<joey> like i'm gonna teach you a lesson as an </joey>
<connor> example to the other animals right five </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean like i gave it a </connor>
<garnt> lower score than i would have just to be </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah you know what i'm saying </garnt>
<garnt> that's the proof of point i'll give out </garnt>
<garnt> first goals yeah sorry okay give it five </garnt>
<garnt> because i didn't i i think i remember </garnt>
<garnt> watching like a few episodes of black </garnt>
<connor> cat years ago and it was just me it was </connor>
<connor> just that phase where you'd watch </connor>
<connor> everything yeah yeah yeah yeah and then </connor>
<connor> i was like cool guy in the black coat he </connor>
<joey> looks kind of cool i watched a few </joey>
<garnt> episodes and it was just like wow </garnt>
<connor> so what happens extremely well so </connor>
<joey> black cat is like he kind of uh so train </joey>
<joey> obviously he starts off as this like </joey>
<joey> assassin but then he escapes from the </joey>
<joey> organization that he's part of and he </joey>
<connor> basically the entire manga he gets </connor>
<joey> chased by the organization members come </joey>
<connor> back to the organization because he has </connor>
<joey> like all the syrians or whatever yeah </joey>
<joey> and like there's a dude in the </joey>
<joey> organization or i think who also left </joey>
<joey> the organization who is like he's </joey>
<joey> basically like the quintessential male </joey>
<joey> yonder </joey>
<joey> like it's really like i remember the the </joey>
<joey> main bad guy is like i don't know i've </joey>
<joey> never really heard of like a male </joey>
<joey> yandere antagonist before in a manga </joey>
<joey> yeah especially in the show no matter i </joey>
<garnt> just realized out of context you kind of </garnt>
<joey> sound like you're describing john wick </joey>
<joey> or something it's like he left the </joey>
<garnt> organization and he isn't there he's an </garnt>
<garnt> assassin yeah this is just gold coins </garnt>
<garnt> they killed his dog </garnt>
<garnt> he killed his black cat </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> but yeah basically and then like sven is </joey>
<joey> the guy who like has like uh he's like </joey>
<joey> an explosives expert and then eve is </joey>
<joey> this uh he's like this she's like this </joey>
<joey> test tube like experimental this is when </joey>
<connor> every single manga had to have like a </connor>
<connor> rag tag band of </connor>
<connor> uh people who could yeah </connor>
<garnt> special things yeah and have comedy okay </garnt>
<garnt> so why is this in your 3x3 i'm so cute </garnt>
<joey> it's in my 3x3 because it was one of the </joey>
<joey> first manga okay so when i was growing </joey>
<joey> up reading manga i obviously started off </joey>
<joey> reading things like doraemon and like </joey>
<joey> you know the quarter quarter comic </joey>
<joey> magazine which is more aimed towards </joey>
<joey> kids under the age of 10 years old right </joey>
<joey> then when i got to around 10 11 years </joey>
<joey> old i was like oh you know what throw </joey>
<garnt> him on quarter quarter stuff </garnt>
<garnt> it's a bit too young for me i've got a </garnt>
<garnt> big pp now i'm i'm a big i'm a big boy </garnt>
<garnt> now i'm i'm about to enter middle school </garnt>
<connor> right i want to read some some of this </connor>
<connor> middle school </connor>
<connor> dance </connor>
<connor> so i was like you know i want to read </connor>
<connor> this like shonen jump thing that i keep </connor>
<connor> hearing all my japanese friends talking </connor>
<joey> about yeah so at the time i borrowed one </joey>
<connor> of my friends shonen jump magazines yeah </connor>
<joey> and i think that particular magazine </joey>
<garnt> black cat was on the cover of it oh okay </garnt>
<garnt> because black cat had like because like </garnt>
<connor> every month and every week on show and </connor>
<connor> jump that happens </connor>
<connor> yeah they change the cover you know some </connor>
<connor> chapters have like you know colored </connor>
<connor> pages and some of them are like have </connor>
<connor> like center colors and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> and i think black cat had a front color </connor>
<connor> chapter </connor>
<connor> and yeah again like you know you go from </connor>
<connor> darymon to this right like clearly this </connor>
<connor> is going to make you go whoa </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is that and so </connor>
<connor> yeah and i think like honestly </connor>
<joey> i really enjoyed it i mean yama kentaro </joey>
<joey> i think still makes some [ __ ] godly </joey>
<joey> character designs i mean you know the </joey>
<joey> reason why tolava is so [ __ ] infamous </joey>
<joey> is because like the character designs </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] cute like he knows how to draw </joey>
<joey> really just aesthetic looking characters </joey>
<joey> and like you know black cat i feel was </joey>
<joey> definitely when he was still kind of in </joey>
<joey> his like younger times where like he </joey>
<joey> hadn't quite refined his art but near </joey>
<joey> the end of black cat his art just got </joey>
<garnt> better and better and better and better </garnt>
<garnt> and like okay i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like a it's nothing like deep </garnt>
<connor> or anything or like profoundly in any </connor>
<joey> way it's just a really solid </joey>
<joey> um with like really just intricate nice </joey>
<connor> arts does it hold up today </connor>
<joey> you know what i haven't read it in quite </joey>
<connor> a while i did would you recommend it to </connor>
<connor> someone to read now </connor>
<joey> it's hard </joey>
<connor> it's really hard </connor>
<joey> because like i don't know because i'm </joey>
<joey> obviously looking at this shirt because </joey>
<joey> this show is very </joey>
<garnt> nostalgic it's very nostalgic i'm </garnt>
<connor> obviously looking at this with like </connor>
<connor> roasting glasses yeah yeah yeah so like </connor>
<connor> i don't know maybe if you're a fan of </connor>
<joey> like yellow cantor stuff like if you </joey>
<joey> liked you know what you saw in tolava </joey>
<connor> okay and one like that with action does </connor>
<connor> it is the story does it kind of wrap up </connor>
<joey> does that have a good conclusion yeah it </joey>
<joey> does actually it has a really nice </joey>
<joey> conclusion and like the the final fight </joey>
<joey> with like the the male yandere </joey>
<connor> antagonist who's a really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> interesting character and the powers in </connor>
<connor> everything like super cool yeah um yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't know it's again it's just like a </connor>
<joey> really solid shonen jump manga that's </joey>
<joey> like very inoffensive i feel like i </joey>
<connor> think this is the start of the time </connor>
<connor> where i start to realize anime </connor>
<connor> anime sometimes just don't have endings </connor>
<connor> well because i started off with death </connor>
<connor> note code yeah alchemist i'm like sick </connor>
<garnt> these are great </garnt>
<garnt> you you spoiled yourself you literally </garnt>
<garnt> spoiled all of anime for yourself oh no </garnt>
<connor> i did not had a great time </connor>
<garnt> because what i mean is that no no other </garnt>
<garnt> anime that just is a normal anime he's </garnt>
<garnt> just going to live up to those standards </garnt>
<connor> yeah exactly yeah so then i started </connor>
<garnt> watching shows i'm like wait </garnt>
<garnt> why didn't this end where's the ending </garnt>
<garnt> and this one this is when this is how </garnt>
<joey> you know everyone else had the same </joey>
<joey> desperation as me because you whenever </joey>
<joey> you type in the show the first autofill </joey>
<connor> is when is season three coming out of </connor>
<garnt> this show literally there are no plans </garnt>
<garnt> for season three of this show literally </garnt>
<garnt> when you get like when you type in no </garnt>
<garnt> game no life </garnt>
<joey> because everyone's like wait why would </joey>
<joey> that not be a season two this is a </joey>
<garnt> popular show right </garnt>
<connor> there's season two coming right right </connor>
<connor> right never happened yeah and then this </connor>
<connor> is when i started to realize i'm like oh </connor>
<connor> they're just not going to finish shows </connor>
<joey> they're just going to like release shows </joey>
<joey> they're just going to be like we </joey>
<joey> released it we're not going to finish it </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] you guys i'm sorry sometimes i wish </connor>
<connor> anime was produced by americans because </connor>
<connor> you know that it would [ __ ] end it </connor>
<garnt> might not be good but you know it's </garnt>
<garnt> coming out that's why i feel like manga </garnt>
<garnt> takes more of the same form as like </garnt>
<garnt> american tv shows because some markets </garnt>
<garnt> just go on for [ __ ] ever and like </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like you know i'm not i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if i'm even invested to see </garnt>
<connor> this end anymore right like this then </connor>
<connor> anime will make like a billion dollars </connor>
<connor> and they're like no i don't think we </connor>
<garnt> need another no there's no more </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes sometimes an anime makes like </garnt>
<garnt> a billion dollars but then it's like one </garnt>
<joey> hundredth of the entire story and you're </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> how like how they ever gonna adapt the </joey>
<joey> entire story it's gonna take like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] 10 decades to do this </joey>
<joey> and so you know there are some stories </joey>
<joey> where i'm just like i i just i know i'm </joey>
<joey> never going to see the end of the anime </joey>
<connor> and even like manga form </connor>
<connor> like i'm still waiting like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hippo like </connor>
<connor> how long is ippo going to go on for sure </connor>
<connor> right like jesus yeah obaki right like </connor>
<connor> you should go on favorites yeah </connor>
<joey> i should go on forever but speaking of </joey>
<garnt> bucky obviously bucky's the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> sense his daughter yeah b stars [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amazing that's that's like the newest </garnt>
<joey> one that's on that's probably the newest </joey>
<joey> one like i after i finished reading b </joey>
<joey> stars i was like oh that is so close to </joey>
<connor> a modern masterpiece how come uh in </connor>
<connor> terms of manga i come back here isn't on </connor>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> bucky i don't know </joey>
<joey> like for me bucky is one of those shows </joey>
<connor> where it's like </connor>
<connor> it's good don't get me wrong it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing and it's so unique yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but </connor>
<connor> i feel that it's like there are some </connor>
<joey> parts where it's just like </joey>
<connor> it's just a blur when you read it you </connor>
<joey> know what i mean or it's like it's so </joey>
<joey> long and there's so much [ __ ] that </joey>
<joey> happens in it that is just so insane and </joey>
<connor> ridiculous that you you think of one </connor>
<connor> fight scene and it blends in with about </connor>
<connor> 10 other fighters that's just true it's </connor>
<connor> true right like part two for example </connor>
<connor> right with the whole tournament yeah </connor>
<connor> like i'm just like i can only remember </connor>
<connor> maybe like one or two fights i re-write </connor>
<connor> at the other side there's like 20 fights </connor>
<joey> in the manga yeah in the enemy then you </joey>
<joey> showed like four yeah right well that's </joey>
<joey> pretty because most of them were kind of </joey>
<joey> underwhelming yeah true true a lot of </joey>
<joey> the fight even in the anime there was </joey>
<connor> only then you should like six and i was </connor>
<joey> like ah three like with bucky you </joey>
<connor> remember the most like notable like meme </connor>
<connor> were the ridiculous type of scenes right </connor>
<connor> whereas with uh b stars for example it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> just as like one cohesive story it was </connor>
<joey> just a really [ __ ] unique yeah really </joey>
<joey> done well and it's just yeah has it </joey>
<connor> concluded yep it ended when did it </connor>
<garnt> finish it could have been too long about </garnt>
<garnt> a year ago so how many seasons of the </garnt>
<garnt> anime do you think there </garnt>
<garnt> should be if we were to adapt everything </garnt>
<joey> to adapt everything yeah so </joey>
<connor> we're at season two right now which is i </connor>
<connor> should probably shouldn't say </connor>
<connor> where we're up to in season two but </connor>
<connor> that's probably about </connor>
<garnt> volume </garnt>
<garnt> seven or eight how many volumes are </garnt>
<joey> there over twenty </joey>
<connor> so what does that wasn't season three </connor>
<joey> announced already i think so yeah i'm </joey>
<connor> sure i'm sure netflix wants to keep that </connor>
<connor> that coming and yeah i am very happy </connor>
<joey> with that and it gets different and it </joey>
<joey> gets more and more interesting after </joey>
<connor> that because i'm hoping we finally get a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] anime that finishes in anime </connor>
<connor> form we never [ __ ] get it anymore </connor>
<garnt> we're getting it like the latest one i </garnt>
<garnt> can think of that we're getting is is </garnt>
<garnt> attack on titan and that's only like one </garnt>
<garnt> of the most successful animators </garnt>
<connor> that's the whole [ __ ] world watching </connor>
<garnt> it for them to be like </garnt>
<garnt> maybe we could just finish this one </garnt>
<connor> it's like it's like the streets are like </connor>
<garnt> start new anime yeah finish old one and </garnt>
<connor> then </connor>
<garnt> like this </garnt>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<connor> stop finish this one finish because it's </connor>
<garnt> just like if an anime gets over three </garnt>
<garnt> seasons like because even even if we get </garnt>
<garnt> a season two that's just like that's </garnt>
<joey> just like getting the table scraps right </joey>
<joey> you're like oh my god i can't believe </joey>
<joey> i've got a season two </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> like playing mashup </garnt>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] off [ __ ] off is this doing well </garnt>
<connor> you cannot tell me this this deserves a </connor>
<joey> second season no game no life doesn't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] right yeah </joey>
<garnt> but uh yeah so b stars so you think it's </garnt>
<garnt> like up there's one in classic now </garnt>
<connor> because i i i think so the ending wasn't </connor>
<joey> exactly like amazing amazing like it was </joey>
<connor> just a solid ending if we get the full </connor>
<joey> anime adaptation of the manga in the way </joey>
<connor> that it's going right now it would be </connor>
<joey> considered a masterpiece </joey>
<joey> man i personally would see it as like uh </joey>
<joey> easy like nine out of ten at least i </joey>
<garnt> mean i mean i i can i can see that like </garnt>
<garnt> if if the anime keeps up the quality of </garnt>
<garnt> the story because i love season one but </garnt>
<garnt> it felt like season one just felt like </garnt>
<joey> it's kind of a setup season it's like </joey>
<joey> the the ending of b stars is very much </joey>
<joey> like the ending of part six where it's </joey>
<joey> like the people who love it love it but </joey>
<joey> the people who didn't like it were like </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<connor> yeah i mean it's like a lot of people </connor>
<connor> say that it's like kind of an </connor>
<connor> anti-climactic ending but i thought it </connor>
<connor> was kind of fitting to how the entire </connor>
<connor> story went because like </connor>
<connor> the final part of beast does there's </connor>
<joey> like this big fight that happens </joey>
<connor> obviously of course but and and then </connor>
<connor> from that big fight it kind of suddenly </connor>
<connor> winds down into just like regular stuff </connor>
<connor> okay and like to a lot of people that </connor>
<connor> was seen as anticipation i like that </connor>
<joey> though i like a little breathing time to </joey>
<joey> say goodbye yeah right i mean i like to </joey>
<joey> all right guys just kind of read a few </joey>
<garnt> more chapters with you guys before you </garnt>
<garnt> guys [ __ ] off forever yeah </garnt>
<connor> what gets me sometimes is i know like </connor>
<connor> the there's always the hype around the </connor>
<connor> last chapter right because the last </connor>
<connor> chapter you saying goodbye to everything </connor>
<connor> and you know this is this is where this </connor>
<connor> is and people like try to put a </connor>
<connor> conclusion in the last chapter whereas </connor>
<connor> some of like my favorite manga is when </connor>
<connor> that last chapter is just the climax is </connor>
<connor> over it's done it's purely just an </connor>
<connor> epilogue and i feel like epilogues are </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] underrated in so many anime </connor>
<connor> and manga because most of the time it's </connor>
<connor> just like you get to the final episode </connor>
<connor> right and half of this episode is the </connor>
<connor> climax so you've got like 10 minutes to </connor>
<connor> say goodbye to all these characters </connor>
<garnt> give me a follow-up yeah give me a </garnt>
<garnt> friend i hate the epilogues that are </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> there's like like seven minutes left of </joey>
<joey> the episode it's like yeah are they </joey>
<garnt> gonna are they gonna stick the landing </garnt>
<garnt> and then you know that it's a rushed </garnt>
<garnt> epilogue when they start talking and the </garnt>
<garnt> ending song plays yeah no no no and it's </garnt>
<garnt> not even it's not even an epilogue it's </garnt>
<joey> just like a slideshow of just like here </joey>
<garnt> here are the characters now </garnt>
<garnt> oh here they go </garnt>
<connor> um and then we have ichigo 100 which </connor>
<garnt> again for me is like another i wouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> even it's weird what's this about i've </garnt>
<joey> i've i've </joey>
<connor> explained this okay so ego 100 is just </connor>
<joey> this really just super simple </joey>
<joey> rom-com okay essentially like you know </joey>
<joey> how shonen jump every time right they </joey>
<garnt> they replace harem wrong comms right </garnt>
<garnt> like once one harry roncon ends another </garnt>
<connor> one takes its place okay </connor>
<garnt> issue 100 </garnt>
<connor> 100 was the one that well first of all </connor>
<connor> like it was like right at its prime when </connor>
<connor> i started reading shawn and jump so </connor>
<connor> again big nostalgia fact i'm gonna </connor>
<joey> completely admit that but second of all </joey>
<joey> to me it is like the one manga series </joey>
<joey> where there was no one clear winner like </joey>
<joey> right up until the end it was like all </joey>
<joey> the girls are so liked through and </joey>
<joey> through like people think quintessential </joey>
<joey> quintuplets is like the ultimate like </joey>
<joey> any one of these girls could win type of </joey>
<joey> thing it's like yeah no no it's not each </joey>
<joey> girl 100 is because you start off with </joey>
<joey> liking one girl </joey>
<joey> as you do with any harem wrong comrade </joey>
<joey> of course but but but if you are saying </joey>
<joey> i don't know how the [ __ ] cost the music </joey>
<joey> you did it but she did it in a way where </joey>
<joey> by the end of it any one of them could </joey>
<connor> win </connor>
<connor> but you don't know who like right up </connor>
<garnt> until the end and it's just so simple </garnt>
<connor> but so well done and again like i like i </connor>
<garnt> really like college numbers giza style </garnt>
<joey> because again very different it almost </joey>
<joey> super 90s oh yeah i mean because it is </joey>
<joey> very well </joey>
<connor> they all look like the chobits robots </connor>
<joey> oh yeah they do they yeah they look like </joey>
<garnt> the same era it looks like the exact </garnt>
<joey> same character design as well they look </joey>
<garnt> like they're like all robots </garnt>
<joey> and it's weird </joey>
<connor> to fall in love with you boo beep beep </connor>
<connor> beep beep beep beep beep right because </connor>
<connor> it's like to me it's not even the best </connor>
<joey> rom-com manga oh okay it might be i </joey>
<garnt> think so is this a harem rom-com how </garnt>
<connor> wrong well we all know that joey loves a </connor>
<connor> good one i like that </connor>
<connor> i love a good harem roll don't get me </connor>
<joey> wrong in my opinion the best rom-com </joey>
<joey> manga ever written his eyes which is </joey>
<joey> also from shonen john which came before </joey>
<garnt> this one so like this one basically </garnt>
<garnt> replaced eyes i've heard if i got an </garnt>
<joey> anime adaptation didn't that in like </joey>
<joey> early 2000s yeah i was like it was like </joey>
<joey> a very [ __ ] adaptation </joey>
<garnt> it wasn't it wasn't very it was </garnt>
<joey> forgettable that's all i know </joey>
<joey> but um yeah it's it's done by the same </joey>
<joey> guy who made a zit man </joey>
<joey> oh okay okay i'm like all of those he's </joey>
<joey> done a lot of manga um but yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know again this was one of those shows </joey>
<joey> that i think this show is the reason why </joey>
<garnt> i love harem wrong </garnt>
<garnt> okay so do you read did you watch the </garnt>
<garnt> anime adaptation of this at all it's an </garnt>
<joey> anime yeah there is there's an anime </joey>
<connor> adaptation it's not good oh </connor>
<connor> basically everyone every like </connor>
<connor> basically most of the shows on here have </connor>
<joey> like very mediocre anime adaptations </joey>
<joey> like aside from these stories </joey>
<joey> but that's true </joey>
<joey> yeah probably you yeah </joey>
<garnt> but uh yeah um and then we have uzumaki </garnt>
<garnt> of course honestly anything from junjito </garnt>
<joey> could have been in here again he's </joey>
<garnt> probably the reason why i love horror i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i i do think uzumaki is like kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like in terms of like a long form i </garnt>
<connor> think he is his magnum opus i think so </connor>
<connor> some of my favorite works of ginger yuto </connor>
<connor> isn't using but just his one shots </connor>
<connor> actually yeah i feel like uzumaki is his </connor>
<garnt> like only long-form work that i think is </garnt>
<joey> like the best yeah and again like that's </joey>
<joey> that's why i i feel like i could have </joey>
<connor> put anything in there like i also </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] loved tomie which was his first </connor>
<connor> one that he made which is also </connor>
<connor> brilliantly horrifying like if you love </connor>
<joey> like your kind of bondi body dysmorphia </joey>
<connor> macabre horror type of thing i do really </connor>
<joey> want to read gingy too at some point </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it's part of the mo it's again </joey>
<connor> it's a trip it's on the infinite list of </connor>
<garnt> i need to get right now it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> with jinji ito you don't even need to </garnt>
<garnt> like be that invested in it because i </garnt>
<joey> like i think the best entry point for </joey>
<joey> june to you so it's just to read some of </joey>
<joey> his one shots because like i feel like </joey>
<joey> like one there's only like a few genres </joey>
<joey> that really work well with one shots and </joey>
<garnt> horror is some of them because all he </garnt>
<garnt> has to do is like he hits you with this </garnt>
<garnt> like really weird [ __ ] idea and then </garnt>
<joey> he just ends </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like he he definitely like has </joey>
<joey> taken a lot of inspiration from like </joey>
<joey> classic asian horror in the sense that </joey>
<joey> the stories don't necessarily make sense </joey>
<joey> but at the end of it you're somehow </joey>
<joey> still invested and still terrified yeah </joey>
<joey> it's purely that he purely just assaults </joey>
<joey> you yeah with all of these senses of </joey>
<joey> just super disturbing [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and then kind of just like </joey>
<joey> that's the end </joey>
<connor> how do you feel </connor>
<connor> how do you feel </connor>
<connor> how do you feel </connor>
<connor> why are you here </connor>
<connor> yeah so obviously i i think it's no </connor>
<connor> secret that i love you </connor>
<connor> yeah um and then i guess we'll just talk </connor>
<connor> about the center one </connor>
<connor> there's a reason why i put it in the </connor>
<joey> center because i still think to this day </joey>
<joey> it's one of the greatest manga series </joey>
<garnt> ever made it's the one manga series that </garnt>
<garnt> i know like i'm i'm building myself up </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's like it's like i've watched </connor>
<connor> the last season of bojack horseman it's </connor>
<connor> not because i don't want to yeah i just </connor>
<connor> i'm just kind of not in the mindset </connor>
<joey> where i want to be depressed i mean you </joey>
<joey> know with your three by three right you </joey>
<joey> were talking about like the one that you </joey>
<connor> enjoyed the most and the one you think </connor>
<connor> is the best is different yeah yeah this </connor>
<joey> is definitely that the one that you </joey>
<joey> think i did not enjoy </joey>
<connor> at all yeah like you don't enjoy it but </connor>
<garnt> you just can't stop yeah yeah but it's </garnt>
<garnt> one of those i i </garnt>
<joey> know this even though i've never read it </joey>
<joey> it's one of those </joey>
<joey> series or stories from why i understand </joey>
<joey> that it's just it hits you and it sticks </joey>
<garnt> with you and it's like you you read it </garnt>
<garnt> once and it's just a part of you i just </garnt>
<connor> got like [ __ ] to do you know like i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna be sad for like a while yeah right </connor>
<joey> yeah i gotta deal with it i remember i i </joey>
<connor> binged this manga for the first time and </connor>
<connor> i i finished reading it at like four am </connor>
<connor> yeah and i just kind of the moment i </connor>
<joey> finished it i just kind of closed it and </joey>
<connor> just sat on my couch i know exactly </connor>
<connor> let's say after every bojack episode </connor>
<connor> yeah and then they're like then they're </connor>
<joey> automatically playing the next one like </joey>
<connor> no no </connor>
<joey> give me some time </joey>
<joey> but i think i think the one thing that i </joey>
<joey> really like about oyster pumpkin is the </joey>
<connor> fact that it almost like it almost goes </connor>
<connor> beyond manga like what iniosano did an </connor>
<connor> oyster punch is so like we were talking </connor>
<connor> about metaphors before right with uh you </connor>
<joey> know i shall 21 stuff like that yeah the </joey>
<joey> metaphors in oyasumi poonpin are insane </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> literally like what kind of mangaka has </joey>
<joey> the balls to turn their main character </joey>
<joey> into a metaphor i think it's genius i </joey>
<joey> think it's absolutely genuine so to </joey>
<joey> explain oyster punch for those who don't </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> this is the main character his name is </joey>
<joey> pumping </joey>
<joey> um he's a bird character but and every </joey>
<joey> other character in the manga is a human </joey>
<connor> yeah but all the human characters see </connor>
<connor> poonpoon as a human it's okay so it's </connor>
<connor> like how he sees himself </connor>
<joey> it's how he sees himself but it's also </joey>
<joey> how you as the reader see him </joey>
<joey> as well so like throughout the manga as </joey>
<joey> he's got so basically it's this manga </joey>
<joey> where it follows this life of </joey>
<connor> growing up so he starts off as a kid and </connor>
<connor> he turns into a teenager </connor>
<connor> i don't like the sound of this yeah i </connor>
<connor> don't like it </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> i know it's gonna be [ __ ] and it kind </connor>
<connor> of very slowly yet steadily it goes </connor>
<connor> through every inch of his life </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of things that happen to </connor>
<garnt> him and around him that are very [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's how it looks yeah yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> like you know it starts off with him as </garnt>
<connor> a kid he meets this girl </connor>
<connor> you know learns what falling in love is </connor>
<connor> right learns the the the joys and the </connor>
<connor> heartbreak of puberty and then i feel </connor>
<connor> you man and then that drags on with him </connor>
<garnt> and then he has family problems he has </garnt>
<connor> problems with his friends he has </connor>
<garnt> problems with basically just a broken </garnt>
<garnt> life you know it's a broken life </garnt>
<joey> and what's so brilliant about oyster </joey>
<joey> punton is that as obviously you know </joey>
<joey> like when he like gets older he's he </joey>
<joey> gets bigger and taller but still the </joey>
<joey> bird </joey>
<joey> but then there are certain points in the </joey>
<joey> manga where his look completely changes </joey>
<joey> so there's one part in the manga where </joey>
<joey> he just turns into a floating pyramid </joey>
<joey> for about two chapters oh okay and it's </joey>
<joey> not really explained why </joey>
<joey> it happens but as you're reading </joey>
<garnt> metaphor context yeah it represents </garnt>
<connor> something in here okay and it's very and </connor>
<connor> it's very literal in that sense </connor>
<joey> how long is it how many chapters i have </joey>
<garnt> seven volumes i own it's all of </garnt>

<connor> well hundred and twenty kilometers like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] okay so i own seven of them </garnt>
<garnt> well no i believe at least the </garnt>
<joey> translated volume yeah the western </joey>
<garnt> volumes are a lot thicker yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> they're a lot thicker so i have iron </connor>
<joey> there's 13 volumes in japan is it but </joey>
<connor> it's like 120 something chapters oh so </connor>
<connor> you could probably read it in one day </connor>
<joey> you could easily written i mean i read </joey>
<garnt> it in one day like it's it's been </garnt>
<garnt> sitting on my shelf i think for years </garnt>
<garnt> it's just been staring me and i'm like i </garnt>
<garnt> stare at it and i'm just like today the </garnt>
<garnt> day it's today it's tuesday did i read </garnt>
<connor> it no just the thought about reading i'm </connor>
<garnt> unhappy </garnt>
<garnt> basically yeah </garnt>
<joey> my very first experience with hearing </joey>
<joey> about yasmine pinpoon was actually like </joey>
<joey> when i first started dating sydney and </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> so i um this was when i back when i </joey>
<joey> didn't know sydney too well and she gets </joey>
<joey> really really invested in stories right </joey>
<joey> and stories she's one of you know one of </joey>
<joey> those people that you know gets truly </joey>
<joey> gets invested and involved into a piece </joey>
<joey> of fiction </joey>
<joey> um so i'm just here sitting and sitting </joey>
<joey> in my room sitting in my office doing </joey>
<joey> like youtube videos or whatever um and </joey>
<joey> then i hear sydney just like bawling i </joey>
<joey> mean this is like this is like i'd never </joey>
<joey> seen her cry harder than this yeah like </joey>
<joey> she was like like beyond ugly crying you </joey>
<joey> know it was like i came in and like mike </joey>
<garnt> was wrong </garnt>
<garnt> my god just sang because like i've only </garnt>
<garnt> like this is the kind of reaction you </garnt>
<garnt> see when someone's family member just </garnt>
<garnt> died you know and um i'm just like i </garnt>
<joey> take a few deep breaths i'm like okay i </joey>
<joey> know i know we're gonna have to deal </joey>
<joey> with something serious something's </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] up and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> honey are you okay what happened she </joey>
<garnt> just went i just finished a manga </garnt>
<garnt> and i i know dead ass just went </garnt>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<garnt> and she's like </garnt>
<garnt> let's go like you ask me </garnt>
<joey> but yeah like i </joey>
<joey> i i mean like i didn't like ugly solve </joey>
<connor> at the end of poon poon but yeah there </connor>
<joey> were definitely moments throughout pune </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> i kind of just opened my eyes wide and i </joey>
<connor> was like holy [ __ ] like there were many </connor>
<connor> times where i actually said to myself </connor>
<connor> out loud i was like no </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> you're not like this no it's not like </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> and it's like and again it's like it's </connor>
<connor> the way that he can somehow </connor>
<joey> fit this [ __ ] bird character into a </joey>
<joey> super realistic context of like very </joey>
<joey> realistic setting with very realistic </joey>
<joey> characters yeah and give this bird this </joey>
<joey> the most human life possible is so </joey>
<connor> insane to me and the fact that he can </connor>
<connor> just do it seamlessly like you know </connor>
<connor> obviously at first if you're going into </connor>
<connor> this blind yeah first couple of pages </connor>
<garnt> you're like what the [ __ ] is this </garnt>
<garnt> what what the [ __ ] is this bird yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but you kind of like learn to grow with </garnt>
<garnt> it and again like you know it's it's one </garnt>
<connor> of those things where like a lot of </connor>
<connor> people say like oh he turned it into a </connor>
<connor> bird so that you yourself can put </connor>
<connor> yourself into pinpoint situations </connor>
<connor> yeah so that if you're not fixated on </connor>
<connor> one particular type of person you know </connor>
<connor> when concerning looks and stuff like </connor>
<connor> that like you can just imagine this is </connor>
<connor> any human </connor>
<connor> and it's just yeah and again it's like </connor>
<connor> ini osano literally just took all these </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> rudimentary concepts about manga and </connor>
<connor> just went through out the window and </connor>
<connor> just went i'm just gonna draw what i </connor>
<connor> think is cool </connor>
<joey> and it's like there's lots of like weird </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] in it as well but like </joey>
<joey> i mean i've been trying to write a video </joey>
<joey> about this manga for so long but </joey>
<joey> literally every time i reread it first </joey>
<joey> of all i get destroyed for about a week </joey>
<joey> so i try not to do it but second of all </joey>
<joey> there's just so many subtle things in it </joey>
<joey> that i keep picking up on that i didn't </joey>
<joey> before that just completely makes me </joey>
<joey> change the way i view this manga and </joey>
<joey> it's just yeah it's insane </joey>
<joey> so like again probably the manga i </joey>
<joey> enjoyed the least yeah yeah but </joey>
<joey> definitely one of the best yeah in my </joey>
<garnt> mind </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i assumed it was going to be </garnt>
<garnt> which is just like i'm not reading this </garnt>
<joey> manga to enjoy it i'm reading this manga </joey>
<joey> because i know it's probably going to be </joey>
<joey> one of the most </joey>
<joey> like powerful pieces of media i've ever </joey>
<garnt> consumed yeah and that's that's like my </garnt>
<connor> assumption going into it and the final </connor>
<connor> chapter made me cry like [ __ ] crazy i </connor>
<connor> was like [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> it's brutal but yeah um i don't know </connor>
<garnt> what else i can talk about yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> realized that you know even though i've </garnt>
<garnt> read a lot of manga you know what at the </garnt>
<garnt> end of the day </garnt>
<joey> shonen jumps just kind of the king to be </joey>
<garnt> honest i mean it's it's kind of the king </garnt>
<garnt> for i mean it's how </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean shonen jump just has a </garnt>
<garnt> formula and i don't know what that </garnt>
<garnt> formula is but they just keep it works </garnt>
<garnt> they just keep pumping out bangers not </garnt>
<garnt> just bangers like everything they pump </garnt>
<garnt> out just seems to be like a global </garnt>
<garnt> sensation and even if it's not it's </garnt>
<garnt> going to have some kind of cult </garnt>
<joey> following behind it it's just kind of </joey>
<joey> the ones that i remember the most for </joey>
<garnt> some reason like like [ __ ] now like i </garnt>
<garnt> remember when the big three ended or </garnt>
<garnt> like you know naruto not the big three </garnt>
<garnt> but the ear of the big three were naruto </garnt>
<garnt> bleach in one piece one piece is </garnt>
<garnt> obviously still going on but everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> just like what's going to replace it how </garnt>
<joey> can anything replace naruto and bleach </joey>
<joey> that's those were like global sensations </joey>
<joey> then my hero came out and was just like </joey>
<joey> hold my hold my beard and then demon </joey>
<joey> slayer came out and i was just like hold </joey>
<joey> my sword </joey>
<joey> and then like [ __ ] now jiu jitsu </joey>
<joey> kaisen and now like chainsaw man's </joey>
<joey> coming out which is going to be a </joey>
<joey> massive [ __ ] in here like </joey>
<garnt> where do they miss when that like </garnt>
<garnt> are they [ __ ] aimbotting like what's </garnt>
<joey> their secret like what the [ __ ] is going </joey>
<garnt> on </garnt>
<joey> no legit and it's like you know again </joey>
<joey> it's like you know you you kind of get </joey>
<joey> in that period of your your manga </joey>
<joey> reading life where you're just like you </joey>
<joey> know what </joey>
<joey> maybe maybe it's time to graduate from </joey>
<joey> the show now yeah you know it's it's </joey>
<joey> like it's kind of formulaic i want to </joey>
<joey> try something new so you go out read </joey>
<joey> some of the the more obscure scene in </joey>
<joey> manga or like the shoujo or the you know </joey>
<joey> the jose manga or you know some like </joey>
<joey> weird gore or edgy type of [ __ ] and it's </joey>
<joey> like there's lots of good ones don't get </joey>
<joey> me wrong but at the end of the day </joey>
<joey> you're always going to go back to sean </joey>
<joey> and jump yeah i don't know what it is </joey>
<joey> i remember i i said i said that opinion </joey>
<garnt> on twitter and i got a lot of [ __ ] for </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> and i'm like </joey>
<joey> there's a reason why it's still the </joey>
<garnt> greatest they hated him because he told </garnt>
<garnt> the truth exactly </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> so uh yeah i don't know is it normie </joey>
<connor> i don't know it's berserk normie i feel </connor>

<joey> seeing the fact okay i'm more than half </joey>
<garnt> of these are shown in john i will say </garnt>
<garnt> this now i've got berserk on my three by </garnt>
<garnt> three as well and i was just like can i </garnt>

<garnt> these like this like mental gymnastic of </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> is there any manga that i could like </garnt>
<garnt> feasibly put over berserk no no like </garnt>
<garnt> there's the it's it's the goat for a </garnt>
<connor> reason right he's one of a kind talk </connor>

<joey> okay okay </joey>
<joey> okay well let's let's go through the </joey>
<garnt> odds </garnt>
<garnt> okay so so before before we get into it </garnt>
<connor> there are some that i feel like i would </connor>
<connor> put in there if there wasn't already </connor>
<joey> like an amazing anime adaptation of it </joey>
<connor> right i really want to put vinland saga </connor>
<joey> on there for some for for example but </joey>
<joey> i'm just like well i've also really </joey>
<joey> really enjoyed the anime um so you want </joey>
<joey> to go through them okay so from </joey>
<joey> uh going down from uh oh great teacher </joey>
<joey> onizuka kingdom </joey>
<joey> the breaker </joey>
<joey> 20th century boys domestic girlfriend </joey>
<joey> love hina </joey>
<joey> berserk </joey>
<garnt> beck and siren siren really yeah i was </garnt>
<connor> not expecting cyrus what is is breaker </connor>
<connor> is it the korean one that's the man </connor>
<garnt> that's the man yeah yeah to me like </garnt>
<garnt> break it out i'll start off a breaker </garnt>
<garnt> because that's the only one on there </garnt>
<garnt> that is actually not actually a manga </garnt>
<garnt> but a manual um i feel like breaker is </garnt>
<garnt> that one it's it takes it's basically </garnt>
<garnt> everything i wanted from a shown in </garnt>
<garnt> anime that you could not get from shonen </garnt>
<garnt> jump because it's it takes the kind of </garnt>
<garnt> the shonen </garnt>
<joey> shonen jump like battle battle manga </joey>
<joey> formula and adds martial arts to it and </joey>
<joey> it's it's so rare to see something uh to </joey>
<joey> see a manga that just does martial arts </joey>
<joey> well and i've kind of realized if if i'm </joey>
<joey> looking for martial arts because you </joey>
<joey> know if if you watch the uh </joey>
<joey> film three by threes you'd know that i'm </joey>
<joey> a huge [ __ ] fan of kung fu movies and </joey>
<garnt> stuff like that right and it's just so </garnt>
<garnt> hard to find that same vibe in the </garnt>
<joey> martial arts i mean you know god of high </joey>
<garnt> school as well yeah yeah so you got like </garnt>
<connor> god of high school </connor>
<garnt> they don't really care about kung fu in </garnt>
<connor> japan </connor>
<garnt> yeah exactly in a sense yeah almost but </garnt>
<garnt> like veritas is like the perfect balance </garnt>
<garnt> between martial arts and superpowers </garnt>
<garnt> because people are like still very human </garnt>
<garnt> in here and you know you can still take </garnt>
<garnt> someone out with a gun but they have </garnt>
<connor> enough power that they're kind of also </connor>
<connor> superhuman as well right so it's it's </connor>
<connor> kind of balanced in that way and like </connor>
<connor> it's like it's it's got like a very you </connor>
<connor> know it's got a very standard story it's </connor>
<connor> it's about </connor>
<connor> this guy who has zero martial arts </connor>
<connor> powers and zero key as you know that's </connor>
<connor> which is the power system here um and he </connor>
<connor> meets he just meets this guy who you </connor>
<joey> know he's beating up some street thugs </joey>
<joey> and turns out he's just like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you know martial arts master or whatever </joey>
<joey> right and so to help teach this guy or </joey>
<joey> to help this guy basically </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> protect himself and not be bullied and </joey>
<joey> all that um he gives him like this </joey>
<joey> medicine which you know is technically </joey>
<garnt> he he gave it to him by accident </garnt>
<connor> and uh ends up this guy is just like </connor>
<connor> obviously a secret genius in martial </connor>
<connor> arts and </connor>
<connor> kind of like takes on the entire martial </connor>
<connor> arts as well enhancing drugs of course </connor>
<joey> always say yes of course </joey>
<garnt> what if we could use 100 percent </garnt>
<joey> but like it's it's like it's cooler but </joey>
<joey> like in terms of like formula yeah it's </joey>
<joey> a very very standard formula but one </joey>
<connor> okay like the art is [ __ ] fantastic </connor>
<connor> the cover looks amazing yeah it's so </connor>
<connor> it's like so much more detailed than you </connor>
<connor> see in a lot of just standard shonen </connor>
<joey> jump manga right and what blows my mind </joey>
<joey> is that this was like a weekly release </joey>
<joey> but the art quality is that of like a </joey>
<joey> monthly release manga you know what i </joey>
<joey> mean like one punch man for example is a </joey>
<joey> monthly release right so you you can see </joey>
<joey> why you know it took the time to be to </joey>
<joey> make to make it a monthly manga this was </joey>
<joey> released weekly and it's not as good as </joey>
<joey> one punch man in terms of high quality </joey>
<joey> but it's like way better than pretty </joey>
<joey> much most standard shonen jump weekly </joey>
<joey> manga damn and it's like the action </joey>
<joey> choreography and the action art is </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] insane and it's just </connor>
<connor> it's just like pure fun it's just pure </connor>
<connor> if you know what you're getting this guy </connor>
<connor> is like a weak link okay but the amount </connor>
<connor> of times that he [ __ ] he [ __ ] does </connor>
<connor> something badass unexpectedly is just </connor>
<connor> like it's just insane and it keeps like </connor>
<connor> the stakes keep rising and rising and </connor>
<connor> what i love as well is they really build </connor>
<connor> up i really love the board building of </connor>
<connor> just like the secret organization that's </connor>
<connor> of like martial artists who like kind of </connor>
<joey> rule the world you know it's it's like </joey>
<connor> in real life yeah yeah like in real life </connor>
<joey> it's got like it's got like the same </joey>
<connor> kind of like vibe as john the john wick </connor>
<connor> world if you know what i mean i'm down </connor>
<connor> for that i love john obviously obviously </connor>
<connor> the main protagonist isn't john wick </connor>
<connor> he's it's someone who grows into someone </connor>
<connor> who's going to be that skilled in that </connor>
<garnt> world </garnt>
<garnt> but it's kind of got that same vibe in </garnt>
<garnt> world building and it's just i [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> love it and not enough people talk about </garnt>
<joey> the breaker i've definitely heard of the </joey>
<joey> title because it's just one of those </joey>
<joey> shows you hear when </joey>
<garnt> some someone says oh you know [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amazing manual right like us what was </garnt>
<joey> the other solo leveling right </joey>
<garnt> that like i hear a lot of and then i </garnt>
<garnt> really need to read i mean solo leveling </garnt>
<garnt> i feel is </garnt>
<connor> it's it's it's good but it's i don't </connor>
<garnt> know why so loving works so well it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically just an easter car in </garnt>
<garnt> disguise but for some reason um it's it </garnt>
<garnt> feels i think it's mostly carried by the </garnt>
<joey> arts right the arts just [ __ ] amazing </joey>
<garnt> mama art is like next level i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how they do it so consider literally </garnt>
<joey> every manual i've read has just been </joey>
<joey> like oh my god yeah i i really don't </joey>
<connor> know how they do it so [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> consistently yeah it's insane um </joey>
<connor> and then yeah what what else do we want </connor>
<connor> to talk kingdom uh i haven't read </connor>
<connor> kingdom i've been i'd rather bring it </connor>
<joey> i've read the first five volumes of </joey>
<garnt> kingdom because i read it long right uh </garnt>
<garnt> it's 60 volumes it's it's like </garnt>
<connor> okay okay it's still going </connor>
<garnt> it's still good okay okay okay i </garnt>
<garnt> remember because i remember when i was </garnt>
<garnt> like trying to get new manga to read i </garnt>
<garnt> was just like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] you now this has 500 chapters i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like oh for [ __ ] sake right um </garnt>
<connor> and then i read the first 100 chapters </connor>
<connor> in like two days and i'm like thank </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] god this has 500 chapters it was </connor>
<connor> it was like one of those manga when i'm </connor>
<connor> just like i'm so glad that there is just </connor>
<garnt> like an infinite number of chapters </garnt>
<connor> it's not that i dread it's that i dread </connor>
<connor> that i literally can't do anything else </connor>
<connor> like i can't watch anything i can't read </connor>
<garnt> anything else because i love that i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like that's that's the feeling i'm </garnt>
<garnt> constantly looking for because i love </garnt>
<garnt> the feeling of just being so absorbed </garnt>
<garnt> into this manga or anime or something </garnt>
<garnt> that i literally can't get on with my </garnt>
<garnt> life unless i </garnt>
<garnt> unless i'm finishing this thing because </garnt>
<garnt> like that that to me is like pure </garnt>
<joey> enjoyment right and kingdom gave me that </joey>
<joey> for like a good like month i i only i </joey>
<joey> only had time just a month </joey>
<garnt> i lost the month of my life i think and </garnt>
<garnt> it was like the best month ever i only </garnt>
<joey> read like the first five volumes of it </joey>
<joey> because i was like at a manga cafe just </joey>
<garnt> like chilling waiting for a friend or </garnt>
<joey> whatever and i had to leave i was like </joey>
<garnt> no i'm not leaving yeah i need i need to </garnt>
<garnt> continue reading this is [ __ ] insane </garnt>
<connor> yeah so so like so like to give the to </connor>
<connor> give a brief like sell yeah </connor>
<connor> um so it's like when china was like </connor>
<joey> fragmented into different different </joey>
<joey> kingdoms </joey>
<joey> you see </joey>
<joey> you see what they did there three </joey>
<joey> kingdoms yeah um no it was uh i think </joey>
<joey> this one has seven kingdoms right and so </joey>
<joey> it's the story of it's just it's just an </joey>
<joey> epic basically it's it's the very </joey>
<joey> definition of an epic where it's just </joey>
<joey> the story of uh so one one like there </joey>
<joey> was there's one farm boy shin who's the </joey>
<joey> main character and by complete chance he </joey>
<joey> meets um he meets one of the future </joey>
<joey> kings of the kingdom that he's living in </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> and throughout the entire history of </joey>
<joey> china no one's been able to unite all of </joey>
<joey> the kingdoms no one's been able to like </joey>
<joey> take over everything and just unite </joey>
<joey> everyone and so it's very simple it's </joey>
<joey> just the basic story of the king growing </joey>
<joey> up to be a king and uniting everyone and </joey>
<joey> it's the farmer who the farm boy who </joey>
<joey> grows up literally as a peasant and um </joey>
<garnt> it's his story of becoming the greatest </garnt>
<joey> general uh of china it's basically if </joey>
<joey> you took the golden age arc of berserk </joey>
<joey> and just made it in epic yeah </joey>
<joey> that sounds good yeah </joey>
<connor> which is awesome because golden asia was </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] awesome i love the golden age </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like imagine the golden age arc but </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest to me the biggest selling </garnt>
<connor> point of kingdom is the battles so </connor>
<connor> this man's drawing over here </connor>
<connor> he can't contain his love for kingdom he </connor>
<connor> went down he's choking up thinking about </connor>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i just want to talk about kingdom </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> so i have never seen any </garnt>
<garnt> other piece of media </garnt>
<garnt> depict warfare in as much detail as i </garnt>
<garnt> have kingdom right </garnt>
<garnt> because there's only like there's it's </garnt>
<garnt> been 500 chapters and one single battle </garnt>
<garnt> can easily take up like 50 to 100 </garnt>
<joey> chapters </joey>
<connor> yeah it's like lord of the rings </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's battle for helms deep </garnt>
<connor> here yeah yeah yeah yeah literally like </connor>
<garnt> imagine every battle imagine if that was </garnt>
<connor> just every battle right but it's [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> ins it's actually [ __ ] insane go for </garnt>
<connor> it are we close to finishing the story </connor>
<connor> no we're about halfway oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that puts me off because i i don't want </connor>
<connor> to get into something where i'm going to </connor>
<connor> be like 50 years old and i'm like hey </connor>
<connor> son uh my favorite manga is finishing </connor>
<connor> kingdom literally every one piece fan </connor>
<connor> but like but it's it's it's one of those </connor>
<connor> manga where it's it's such a simple kind </connor>
<joey> of it's it well it's it's simple and </joey>
<joey> it's not right because obviously there's </joey>
<joey> a lot of there's a lot of like politics </joey>
<joey> involved there's a lot of like </joey>
<joey> intricacies into how they basically take </joey>
<joey> try to take over their kingdom because </joey>
<joey> there's i really can't condense it down </joey>
<connor> into like whenever i'm getting it's an </connor>
<garnt> epic yeah it is an epic </garnt>
<connor> but like it's because it's broken up </connor>
<connor> into like different arcs you can just </connor>
<connor> read one arc and you just you can just </connor>
<connor> like stop it it's kind of </connor>
<connor> you can take a breather like i literally </connor>
<connor> binged one arc then binged another arc </connor>
<connor> and then binge another because i'm just </connor>
<connor> like i just want to see what happens at </connor>
<connor> the end of this battle and </connor>
<connor> it's it depicts what like i said it </connor>
<connor> depicts warfare in a better way than </connor>
<connor> i've ever seen in any other market </connor>
<connor> because like you know </connor>
<connor> you know how they like try to write </connor>
<connor> smart characters in a lot of fiction </connor>
<garnt> whereas you to to write a smart </garnt>
<garnt> character you have to make the other </garnt>
<garnt> character dumb right so there's been so </garnt>
<garnt> many like there's been so many like </garnt>
<garnt> warfare kind of scenes where it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like they they introduce this like </garnt>
<garnt> really smart general or something and </garnt>
<garnt> it's because he sees a strategy that the </garnt>
<garnt> other general doesn't see and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> to the reader it's the most obvious </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] strategy of all time we're gonna </connor>
<connor> go around the back yeah holy [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> they'll never know if they flank them to </joey>
<garnt> the right yeah exactly and and with </garnt>
<connor> kingdom the reason it takes like about </connor>
<joey> like 50 to 100 chapters per battle is </joey>
<joey> because it's they're pretty 5d chess </joey>
<joey> they are like it's it's it's so </joey>
<joey> incredible to see so many styles of </joey>
<joey> generals battling against each other </joey>
<joey> because it's it is literally like </joey>
<joey> watching two gm's play against each </joey>
<joey> other and no it i i'm absolutely serious </joey>
<joey> because like you're you're turning the </joey>
<joey> page and you're like both both sides are </joey>
<joey> making moves both sides are like taking </joey>
<joey> pieces they're taking rooks they're </joey>
<joey> taking bishops it is kind of like </joey>
<joey> watching a chess game except it's </joey>
<joey> because it's a battle it's not just it's </joey>
<joey> not just all about strategy sometimes </joey>
<garnt> you have people who [ __ ] flip the </garnt>
<garnt> board and there's and then there's </garnt>
<garnt> nothing you can do about that just </garnt>
<garnt> because they're too powerful and there </garnt>
<garnt> are some people who knows that this guy </garnt>
<garnt> is someone who is going to flip the </garnt>
<garnt> board and he takes that into account and </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> the winner of the battle isn't the </garnt>
<garnt> person </garnt>
<garnt> is isn't the person who's like </garnt>
<garnt> necessarily dumber it's just the person </garnt>
<garnt> who maybe thinks that extra half step </garnt>
<garnt> ahead and you really don't know until </garnt>
<garnt> you turn like the final few pages of an </garnt>
<garnt> arc how it's going to turn out the </garnt>
<joey> author must have like [ __ ] binge read </joey>
<connor> like the art of war like </connor>
<joey> honestly because like honestly i've only </joey>
<connor> heard like the most insane i'd like to </connor>
<garnt> let this be like the other like those </garnt>
<joey> reviews yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> five stars yeah like my work </garnt>
<garnt> without spoil without spawning it's like </garnt>
<garnt> some of the best moments of this manga </garnt>
<garnt> like i think with this </garnt>
<garnt> this uh this manga has an arc which is </garnt>
<garnt> one of my favorite arcs of like all of </garnt>
<garnt> manga and that's that's because it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's an arc without spawning the </garnt>
<garnt> exact plot points it's an arc where you </garnt>
<garnt> have like [ __ ] five six generals all </garnt>
<garnt> of them have like are making [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> playing 5d chess with each other making </garnt>
<garnt> moves against each other and you're just </garnt>
<garnt> like holy [ __ ] i can't even keep up with </garnt>
<garnt> the amount of strategies going on and </garnt>
<garnt> the different pieces like that that are </garnt>
<garnt> being pushed around it's absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] insane it's so big brain that i </garnt>
<garnt> really cannot explain </garnt>
<joey> again ever since i read those five </joey>
<joey> volumes of kingdom i've been this close </joey>
<joey> to just been saying [ __ ] and just </joey>
<connor> buying the rest of the volume is it </connor>
<connor> published weekly </connor>
<connor> okay that's good that's good it's </connor>
<garnt> published but there's no way they're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna get to five dollars i've just </garnt>
<garnt> given up the hope on manga where they're </garnt>
<garnt> like okay now we're publishing monthly </garnt>
<garnt> all right and i'm never gonna read it </garnt>
<garnt> because it's never going to finish yeah </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to see like the brain </garnt>
<garnt> expands me more of just like of just </garnt>
<garnt> reading something that is just like </garnt>
<garnt> super smart without making making it </garnt>
<garnt> like seem pretentious or something yeah </garnt>
<connor> and the artist </connor>
<connor> i think someone asked i don't know who </connor>
<connor> was when george are mine this question </connor>
<connor> is like if you're not smart how do you </connor>
<joey> write smart characters </joey>
<connor> if you're not smart yourself how do you </connor>
<joey> write a smart camera yeah yeah like </joey>
<joey> legit i just i still i remember they </joey>
<garnt> answered something but even me i was </garnt>
<garnt> thinking about i i don't know how you </garnt>
<connor> would how would you because you wouldn't </connor>
<garnt> know what smart is because yeah yeah so </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's like i think this is </joey>
<connor> this one because this is what smart </connor>
<connor> people are like yeah it's like how do </connor>
<connor> you ask your smartphone how do you write </connor>
<connor> a smart character who's like 300 iq when </connor>
<connor> you're not 300 iq yeah </connor>
<connor> what i would </connor>
<connor> what i would uh guess is that </connor>
<connor> they are uh the author of this must have </connor>
<joey> just studied so many like history </joey>
<joey> historic battles because some of like </joey>
<joey> the taxes and strategies that can they </joey>
<joey> come up with this it's just like it's </joey>
<connor> 300 iq versus 302 iq and it's just like </connor>
<joey> it's just like that extra two iq that </joey>
<joey> gives them the edge in battle it's porn </joey>
<joey> that matters yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly </joey>
<connor> it's uh it's it's such a good absolutely </connor>
<joey> if you want something that is just an </joey>
<joey> incredible epic read kingdom okay uh </joey>
<connor> great teacher only zuka classic is a </connor>
<garnt> classic and i've heard all about this </garnt>
<joey> yeah i watched it </joey>
<connor> it's weird i've never read the manga for </connor>
<connor> this i've only watched the anime i've </connor>
<joey> heard the anime is amazing yeah the </joey>
<garnt> anime is amazing but i've heard the </garnt>
<garnt> manga is even better the the i think the </garnt>
<connor> anime is i mean it's it's good because </connor>
<connor> the manga is [ __ ] amazing right </connor>
<garnt> that's that's that's that's the only </garnt>
<connor> reason the animation because like he's </connor>
<connor> so goddamn good you can't mess up this </connor>
<garnt> it's like cause like because like you </garnt>
<garnt> okay have you seen the anime i've seen </garnt>
<joey> the enemy when you think it came out </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> what the anime yeah </joey>
<garnt> it was like late 80s right </garnt>
<garnt> it came out in the year 2000. </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not joking are you serious i am </garnt>
<connor> still a trap question i felt the track </connor>
<garnt> set up when you asked that </garnt>
<joey> well it feels like late 80s it feels </joey>
<joey> like late like early 90s it feels like </joey>
<joey> late alien late 80s early 90s anime </joey>
<joey> adaptations yeah it came out in the </joey>
<joey> 2000s it came out after cowboy bebop </joey>
<garnt> but because </garnt>
<garnt> but because like because the anime are </garnt>
<joey> the same </joey>
<garnt> crisis on the gto today </garnt>
<joey> so i mean i think i've talked about gta </joey>
<joey> briefly before but to uh to give to give </joey>
<joey> a brief synopsis of gto it's about it's </joey>
<connor> about this teacher who is delinquent oh </connor>
<joey> he great oh he great oh he's a great </joey>
<joey> team he's no no no no he's not a great </joey>
<joey> teacher yet because he's just he's he's </joey>
<garnt> he's uh so his name is onizuka and he's </garnt>
<garnt> delinquent who finds himself in a </garnt>
<connor> teaching job right and let me guess let </connor>
<connor> me guess he's just </connor>
<connor> he's he's not a good teacher in the </connor>
<connor> start but he he learns to love the kids </connor>
<connor> and he wants to help the kids so he </connor>
<garnt> becomes a good teacher no actually he he </garnt>
<joey> wants to be the greatest teacher in all </joey>
<joey> of japan hence the name great teacher </joey>
<joey> but uh what he he's given like a very </joey>
<joey> problematic class right </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah he's he's not like the </joey>
<garnt> greatest teacher academically and that's </garnt>
<garnt> part of like that's like part of the </garnt>
<garnt> point of this manga is that he doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> teach academic lessons he teaches life </garnt>
<joey> lessons and i know </joey>
<garnt> i know i know i reach these kids he's </garnt>
<joey> not he ain't book smart he's streets </joey>
<connor> but like how you wear a bag kids make </connor>
<garnt> you sort it correctly yeah but like if </garnt>
<garnt> but like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's a manga that i think really </garnt>
<garnt> affected me when i read this as like a </garnt>
<joey> teenager because </joey>
<joey> you know it it sounds it it is like a </joey>
<joey> completely cheesy kind of um setup right </joey>
<joey> because you know it's just oh this it's </joey>
<joey> a teacher who reforms a problematic </joey>
<joey> classroom and teaches them life lessons </joey>
<garnt> it makes them appreciate life and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah that's that's exactly it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a it's probably </garnt>
<garnt> the best feel-good manga i've ever read </garnt>
<joey> japan loves those kinds of manga they're </joey>
<garnt> like yeah there's another manga like </garnt>
<garnt> that called rookies i don't know if you </garnt>
<joey> know that one i don't it's like if you </joey>
<joey> took gto but you made them play baseball </joey>
<joey> and but it's like it's the exact same </joey>
<garnt> like feel good vibe you have the </garnt>
<connor> delinquent teacher who like teaches a </connor>
<garnt> bunch of delinquents to like join a </garnt>
<joey> baseball team and stuff like that yeah </joey>
<garnt> exact same feel as gto is like just as </garnt>
<garnt> good it's just it's just really it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's also a comedy one and i i do like </garnt>
<garnt> the comedy but like what i really love </garnt>
<garnt> is that you know it it it's not it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't teach you so much cheesy life </garnt>
<garnt> lessons right it's so much just just </garnt>
<garnt> teaches you </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> you especially growing up in asian </garnt>
<garnt> culture it tries to teach you that you </garnt>
<garnt> know grades and </garnt>
<garnt> like this the school system isn't </garnt>
<garnt> what defines you as a person and i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of people might need to like </garnt>
<garnt> hear some of the things that this manga </garnt>
<garnt> especially </garnt>
<garnt> especially in japan and especially in </garnt>
<garnt> asian culture and kind of the cherry on </garnt>
<garnt> top is just how [ __ ] goofy and at the </garnt>
<garnt> same time badass onizuka is um i [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> seeing the antics he seeing the antics </garnt>
<garnt> they put him through is just like </garnt>
<garnt> everything is such a treat like what my </garnt>
<garnt> one of my favorite one of my favorite uh </garnt>
<garnt> scenes in the manga which never got </garnt>
<garnt> adapted to the anime was like he was </garnt>
<garnt> trying to </garnt>
<garnt> he was trying to teach just like this </garnt>
<garnt> like leader of like this uh gang to like </garnt>
<garnt> try try to attend school and take it </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] seriously and all that [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> and so </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> this guy this this student leads him to </garnt>
<garnt> like this underground like fight ring or </garnt>
<garnt> something i can't remember the exact </garnt>
<garnt> setup but he's just like look </garnt>
<garnt> if i arm wrestle a hundred of you and </garnt>
<garnt> win </garnt>
<garnt> then you gotta come to school and it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like this is this is so this is so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] stupid right because it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like how are you going to [ __ ] arrest </garnt>
<garnt> arm wrestle 100 people and then he he </garnt>
<garnt> beats one person he beats two persons he </garnt>
<garnt> he starts he starts taking on three at a </garnt>
<garnt> time and like he's three out of ten yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he starts taking on three times </garnt>
<garnt> it's the shonen mark okay yeah and it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like it's the way the way that it </garnt>
<joey> just kind of builds up and like </joey>
<joey> escalates is like </joey>
<joey> hilarious and badass at the same time </joey>
<joey> and it's it's something where it's not </joey>
<joey> 100 serious but when it hits it [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hits and some like it's a manga that can </joey>
<joey> really </joey>
<joey> i wouldn't say change a person but it </joey>
<joey> if if you're looking for something that </joey>
<joey> affects you in the opposite way of pun </joey>
<joey> pun where it's just like wow it uses </joey>
<joey> comedy to teach you not depression yeah </joey>
<garnt> it still teaches you like very important </garnt>
<garnt> life lessons but it it you feel </garnt>
<joey> wholesome i feel like i don't want that </joey>
<joey> like genre of manga is so like beloved </joey>
<joey> and known and quite you know more common </joey>
<joey> especially to a japanese audience i feel </joey>
<joey> it's slept on in the west </joey>
<garnt> probably like there are so many like </garnt>
<joey> good like feel good comedy centered like </joey>
<joey> lesson type of manga that is out there </joey>
<garnt> and they're all [ __ ] great yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i feel like to do this type of </garnt>
<joey> manga or to do this type of story it's </joey>
<joey> so hard to just not be cheesy yeah you </joey>
<joey> know like and i feel like gto is that </joey>
<garnt> one manga when i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> like you you see this done in any other </joey>
<garnt> way and it would just be cheesy but the </garnt>
<joey> way that they do in this just </joey>
<joey> it almost doesn't take itself seriously </joey>
<garnt> yeah exactly yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> um so yeah onizuka is like i think one </garnt>
<garnt> of my favorite characters in manga </garnt>
<joey> for that reason </joey>
<garnt> uh what do you want to go on next can we </garnt>
<joey> talk about siren </joey>
<connor> okay why is siren what is siren what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] is that </connor>
<garnt> it's shown i'm surprised you've heard of </garnt>
<garnt> siren i [ __ ] love cyrus you love </garnt>
<garnt> sauron oh my [ __ ] god that's why </garnt>
<connor> that's why i was like why is this here </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> it's one of those like it's one of those </connor>
<connor> who's explaining the place underground </connor>
<joey> shonen jump manga that like it didn't </joey>
<joey> have very long run time did it um it had </joey>
<garnt> like a good 100 chapters did it it got </garnt>
<joey> cancelled that's right yeah it did yeah </joey>
<joey> i will tell you the plot okay so um </joey>
<joey> there's going to be like a slight </joey>
<joey> spoiler but i feel like it's within the </joey>
<joey> first four chapters and i feel like it's </joey>
<joey> it's it's a big twist that i feel um is </joey>
<joey> what got me hooked into this manga right </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> um so it's that's the main i can't i </joey>
<joey> can't actually remember the character </joey>
<joey> names because it's been so long since </joey>
<joey> i've read it but it's this main </joey>
<joey> character and </joey>
<joey> uh he </joey>
<joey> i don't think there's anything too </joey>
<joey> special about him at the beginning he </joey>
<joey> runs a service where he solves he solves </joey>
<joey> problems right that's got nothing to do </joey>
<joey> with what happens right and so he sees </joey>
<joey> this girl </joey>
<joey> um it looks like she she uh she looks </joey>
<joey> like she's going through some issues or </joey>
<joey> something so she he tries to help her </joey>
<joey> and in that process </joey>
<joey> he </joey>
<joey> he follows her and then he gets </joey>
<joey> transported with her to just this </joey>
<joey> new place he doesn't know where he is </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<connor> yeah he basically gets isekai right goes </connor>
<connor> to another world yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> he goes to another world </connor>
<connor> he goes to another world see a theme </connor>
<connor> here yeah no he goes to another world </connor>
<connor> with this girl right </connor>
<connor> um and then they're in just in just in </connor>
<connor> this like barren wasteland and then they </connor>
<connor> get transported with a bunch of people </connor>
<connor> and it's kind of like the gans kind of </connor>
<connor> theme where where it's it's not let it's </connor>
<connor> not as brutal because it's like shonen </connor>
<connor> jump gans so it's not it's not got like </connor>
<connor> massive gore but like people just start </connor>
<connor> dying left right and center right and </connor>
<connor> for some reason she has like a special </connor>
<connor> psychic power that she uses to survive </connor>
<joey> so he kind of follows her right and so </joey>
<joey> in like fighting through this kind of </joey>
<joey> death game kind of barren wasteland kind </joey>
<joey> of thing </joey>
<joey> he </joey>
<joey> he like tries to figure out where the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] he is how he got there and what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] going on right and then it's like </joey>
<joey> the big twist at the end of episode four </joey>
<joey> is that he goes on top of this like </joey>
<joey> like uh building that's just been like </joey>
<joey> laying like it's it's like uh what's the </joey>
<joey> word i'm looking for like abandoned or </joey>
<joey> not not abandoned but it's just like </joey>
<joey> it's what what's the word where it's </joey>
<joey> just like like it's been years since </joey>
<joey> this building's been overgrown </joey>
<joey> dilapidated dilapidated yeah it's this </joey>
<joey> the lab station building right and he </joey>
<joey> and he goes on it and then he sees mount </joey>
<joey> fuji right </joey>
<connor> and it's just he realizes </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> for some reason he's in japan he's in a </connor>
<connor> city that is in complete ruins and the </connor>
<connor> apocalypse has happened and so he </connor>
<connor> doesn't know how he got there or where </connor>
<connor> he is that's right or </connor>
<connor> should i say it </connor>
<connor> okay i'm gonna say okay </connor>
<garnt> or when he is </garnt>
<connor> but i mean i guessed when you were said </connor>
<connor> that he's in japan yeah yeah time thing </connor>
<connor> yeah i said it was dilapidated </connor>
<garnt> signal the passage of time yeah yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> so that i i guess i guess that that </garnt>
<garnt> spoils it but </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah i mean so what i love about </garnt>
<connor> this is that </connor>
<connor> it's a shonen jump action manga that had </connor>
<connor> that has has a mystery core because the </connor>
<connor> core of this is him going back to his </connor>
<connor> own world or his own time and kind of </connor>
<connor> figuring out what the [ __ ] happened </connor>
<connor> how did it happen </connor>
<connor> and in that process like i'm that's </connor>
<connor> that's all i'm gonna say because in the </connor>
<connor> process there's so many twists and turns </connor>
<connor> that come from that and him trying to </connor>
<joey> figure out what's going on </joey>
<joey> um and it was just nice to see </joey>
<joey> like a shonen jump that has action in it </joey>
<joey> but also has this really mystery aspect </joey>
<joey> that keeps you coming back and just </joey>
<joey> keeps you like reading the next page </joey>
<joey> just to figure out what happens because </joey>
<joey> i feel like there's there's been shown a </joey>
<joey> jump with a mystery aspect for example </joey>
<garnt> uh what's the one where they eat kids </garnt>
<garnt> again i promise no one promised </garnt>
<garnt> nevertheless like been like promised </garnt>
<garnt> neverland and it's been like obviously </garnt>
<joey> i've never heard perhaps an airline b </joey>
<joey> described as what's the one where they </joey>
<connor> eat kids i mean what am i wrong i don't </connor>
<connor> know why i got it right away am i wrong </connor>
<connor> am i wrong i </connor>
<connor> is what it is like shenanigans it's not </connor>
<connor> what it mean it </connor>
<connor> the one about the kids trying to escape </connor>
<garnt> it's the one where the kids get eaten </garnt>
<connor> like i i like i i like the fact that it </connor>
<garnt> had a mystery aspect and also a battle </garnt>
<garnt> shonen aspect and i feel like it was so </garnt>
<garnt> underground because nobody [ __ ] read </garnt>
<joey> it i think the problem with siren is </joey>
<joey> that it kind of came out at a time where </joey>
<joey> shonen jump was just absolutely stacked </joey>
<joey> where like everything else in china </joey>
<joey> because this was like </joey>
<joey> mid-2000s shown in right so this was not </joey>
<joey> only in the midst of the big three but </joey>
<joey> also like the lesser known shonen jump </joey>
<joey> stuff that was not the big three was </joey>
<joey> still very very popular so why do they </joey>
<joey> get cancelled then um just because it </joey>
<joey> wasn't popular enough yeah i'm just like </joey>
<joey> i feel like i feel like another thing is </joey>
<garnt> that unfortunately the art style just </garnt>
<garnt> looks so generic because this came off </garnt>
<connor> the bleach it doesn't look </connor>
<connor> like the main character looks like </connor>
<garnt> ichigo yeah yeah it kind of looks so </garnt>
<joey> generic but it has so many original </joey>
<joey> ideas like i really like </joey>
<joey> without spoiling what the main </joey>
<joey> character's power is so like anyone who </joey>
<joey> goes to this world gets a special power </joey>
<joey> of their own right and i like as an </joey>
<joey> engineer </joey>
<joey> he has like a really unique power where </joey>
<joey> i'm not going to spoil exactly what he </joey>
<joey> is but he can't control this power like </joey>
<joey> he can't </joey>
<joey> consciously control this power so what </joey>
<garnt> he does </garnt>
<garnt> to kind of figure out a way different </garnt>
<garnt> ways to use his power is he makes </garnt>
<garnt> subroutines </garnt>
<garnt> for for this power so it's basically </garnt>
<garnt> like he makes programming loops for this </garnt>
<garnt> power to like follow a set algorithm to </garnt>
<garnt> do exactly what he wants </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like that's such a unique </garnt>
<joey> idea like slowly remembering this monkey </joey>
<connor> man </connor>
<connor> can type 2 000 words per minute </connor>
<garnt> but yeah like i mean i could i could put </garnt>
<connor> i could have put like hunter hunter or </connor>
<connor> other shonen jump manga on here it's </connor>
<connor> nice to see some variation but yeah like </connor>
<connor> i said every every shonen jump manga i </connor>
<connor> can think of putting on here has an </connor>
<connor> anime adaptation so that's that's the </connor>
<joey> only reason why i put siren on here </joey>
<joey> because it's my it is my favorite shonen </joey>
<joey> jump manga that does not have an anime </joey>
<joey> yeah because it got cancelled because it </joey>
<joey> wasn't popular yeah isn't it the other </joey>
<garnt> one i would put on there is uh did you </garnt>
<garnt> ever read m0 i did not read it okay </garnt>
<joey> that's another one that was like kind of </joey>
<garnt> it came out around the same time as </garnt>
<garnt> siren where shoney jump was just stacked </garnt>
<garnt> never got an anime adaptation but it's </garnt>
<garnt> so good what's that about </garnt>
<garnt> m0 is about it's this basically it's </garnt>
<connor> this kid who enters this magic school </connor>
<connor> but he himself has zero magic abilities </connor>
<connor> yeah so this is literally like think of </connor>
<joey> like [ __ ] might here academia right </joey>
<joey> but instead of quirks it's magic power </joey>
<joey> and you have like certain levels of </joey>
<joey> magic and the higher your magic level is </joey>
<garnt> the more powerful like a magic card you </garnt>
<joey> get that can like activate magic skills </joey>
<garnt> and the main character again he has zero </garnt>
<garnt> magic so he gets an m0 card oh okay and </garnt>
<garnt> it's just him basically just trying to </garnt>
<garnt> basically survive and graduate yeah </garnt>
<garnt> magic school but like the art style is </garnt>
<connor> so unique and it's so it's such a dope </connor>
<connor> solid story but again it's never got an </connor>
<connor> adam adaptation and like hardly anyone </connor>
<joey> read it because again </joey>
<joey> jump no it didn't get cancelled it had a </joey>
<joey> proper ending it got like 12 volumes or </joey>
<joey> something oh and i had a proper ending </joey>
<garnt> it just no one read it because during </garnt>
<garnt> that time shonen jump was so stacked </garnt>
<connor> right all these other insane shows it's </connor>
<joey> stacked now as well stack now but like </joey>
<connor> mid 2000's showing and jump was like so </connor>
<connor> you can you can recommend it even though </connor>
<connor> it doesn't have an ending like is it oh </connor>
<garnt> no it has an ending it's just very </garnt>
<joey> rushed uh but like everything by the way </joey>
<connor> they're like wrap it up come on i mean </connor>
<garnt> the same as well yeah but like i i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i can still recommend it because </garnt>
<garnt> the mystery aspect got solved and it got </garnt>
<garnt> solved in a decent amount of time what </garnt>
<garnt> didn't get what was like a bit </garnt>
<connor> unsatisfying was just each character's </connor>
<connor> resolution because it got wrapped up so </connor>
<connor> quickly but the mystery aspect which was </connor>
<connor> the reason i was so addicted to whis and </connor>
<garnt> reading that gets wrapped up just fine </garnt>
<connor> and that's why i can still recommend it </connor>
<joey> so uh what's love hino about </joey>
<joey> wait have you not read osha no i don't </joey>
<connor> know i don't know really i don't know </connor>
<garnt> anything about love you know wow love </garnt>

<joey> i'm i'ma say right now this is nostalgia </joey>

<garnt> explain yourself what is it about it's </garnt>
<connor> nothing you haven't heard before um it's </connor>
<joey> it's a manga where a guy loves hina oh </joey>
<garnt> for [ __ ] sake </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>

<connor> it's the first </connor>
<garnt> animation this anime the first anime i </garnt>
<garnt> watched where </garnt>
<garnt> before that i had this massive complex </garnt>
<garnt> against manga right because i was like i </garnt>
<garnt> know because like i discriminated </garnt>
<garnt> against manga honestly honestly because </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like how can you get into black and </garnt>
<garnt> white drawings i'm sorry i'm sorry this </garnt>
<garnt> is disgusting this is for peasants </garnt>
<joey> western western comics go through the </joey>
<joey> trouble of coloring in where's the </joey>
<joey> movement where's the color where's the </joey>
<garnt> color i'm just like how am i supposed to </garnt>
<garnt> get into this and like love hina was the </garnt>
<garnt> first anime i watched where i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i want to see what happens </garnt>
<joey> i'll fight through the black and white i </joey>
<garnt> want to see what happens enough that </garnt>
<connor> i'll [ __ ] read the monk she looks </connor>
<garnt> cute but she looks like a like a pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> reject </garnt>
<joey> um she's uh i think every character in </joey>
<joey> the 90s yeah yeah yeah it's true because </joey>
<garnt> i think they all had like the same kind </garnt>
<joey> of thing so out of ten </joey>
<garnt> i mean i i've </garnt>
<connor> just give me give me a [ __ ] score </connor>
<connor> gone what is it how [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that that stutter was a five that's it i </connor>
<garnt> i think loving it to this day is like a </garnt>
<joey> solid six or seven </joey>
<garnt> i think it's just a fun six or seven </garnt>
<joey> it's a [ __ ] if if you like harry </joey>
<joey> manga </joey>
<connor> which you don't so okay if you like </connor>
<garnt> harry monk i still think lafina is such </garnt>
<joey> is a very very sword it still stands up </joey>
<joey> to us why did you love harem anime i </joey>
<connor> have manga so much like what about the </connor>
<joey> harem speaks to you god oh that's like </joey>
<connor> girls eh </connor>
<connor> i want all the girls okay </connor>
<garnt> i'll i'll break it down okay because </garnt>
<connor> this is gonna be a really weird analogy </connor>
<connor> um if i'm like if there's a harem manga </connor>
<connor> that i'm invested in it's not it's not </connor>
<joey> specifically about oh there's a bunch of </joey>
<joey> girls what i equate reading a harry </joey>
<joey> manga to it's kind of like watching us </joey>
<connor> watching a sports match right because </connor>
<connor> like no you're gonna [ __ ] say that </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah because okay because pick your </connor>
<connor> team when you root for them you pick </connor>
<connor> your team and you get emotionally </connor>
<connor> invested right </connor>
<connor> you pick your best girl and you [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> root for them and you stick through it </joey>
<garnt> through thick and thin yeah and then </garnt>
<joey> even if they don't win </joey>
<garnt> they've won in your heart yeah if even </garnt>
<garnt> if they don't win but if they do win </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's it's such an emotion </garnt>
<garnt> yes </garnt>
<garnt> yes </garnt>
<connor> yes you literally become a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> sports fan i bet god's never as happy as </connor>
<garnt> when his [ __ ] harem </garnt>
<garnt> part of the best part of harrens right </garnt>
<garnt> is being he's watching it with the </garnt>
<joey> community because like half the fun is </joey>
<joey> seeing your girl win but also half the </joey>
<joey> fun is [ __ ] on the fans of the </joey>
<garnt> losing girl as well that's like that's </garnt>
<joey> like equally as [ __ ] that's what i loved </joey>
<joey> about it 100 because i read it with a </joey>
<connor> bunch of my japanese friends who were </connor>
<connor> all just as invested and they all had </connor>
<connor> their own winners and when i when my </connor>
<garnt> girl won i was like [ __ ] you </garnt>
<connor> i told you joey had the biggest dick </connor>
<garnt> that week i did </garnt>
<garnt> i felt good </garnt>
<connor> okay so like i mean it's i still think </connor>
<connor> it's a solid harem i think one of the </connor>
<connor> biggest differences to a lot of harems i </connor>
<connor> met is that i do like the character </connor>
<connor> development of the main guy he starts </connor>
<connor> off as obviously a [ __ ] loser with no </connor>
<connor> personality but as the series goes on he </connor>
<connor> actually develops why don't we ever get </connor>
<connor> chad's </connor>
<garnt> where's the space for growth if they're </garnt>
<connor> already achieved they become more modest </connor>
<joey> maybe they love modesty no one wants to </joey>
<connor> see </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> is uh 20th century to say domestic </garnt>
<garnt> violence </garnt>
<joey> i was about to like give you the </joey>
<joey> background yeah while we're on [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> let's keep talking about domestic </connor>
<connor> girlfriend if we talk about love here </connor>
<garnt> okay he's not going to stop talking </garnt>
<connor> we've seen it on your channel yeah we </connor>
<connor> can go we've seen your videos we can </connor>
<connor> literally go and get the fountain of </connor>
<connor> like non-existent youth from you on this </connor>
<connor> this thing where you just never age and </connor>
<connor> you talk about this for ten years i can </connor>
<connor> i can continually talk about it i don't </connor>
<joey> wanna give me a five minute you get five </joey>
<joey> minutes gone sell this to me because i </joey>
<joey> watched i watched three episodes and i </joey>
<garnt> immediately dropped domestic girlfriend </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] awoke something in me man </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> you this this this </garnt>
<joey> single show basically dictated my hentai </joey>
<garnt> taste from like so there's me before </garnt>
<joey> domestic girlfriend and there's me after </joey>
<garnt> domestic </garnt>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> if i'm correct is it there there's a guy </connor>
<joey> and there's a teacher yeah and there's a </joey>
<joey> sector okay okay so that's correct okay </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> let me break it down for you okay so </joey>
<joey> there's this guy who has who's in love </joey>
<joey> with his teacher right and </joey>
<joey> one day he just randomly goes up to a </joey>
<joey> meet-up and uh he meets another girl at </joey>
<joey> a karaoke uh what's it called in a car </joey>
<joey> like uh </joey>
<connor> what's what's what's what's the event </connor>
<joey> where </joey>
<garnt> i make sure thank you sydney you know </garnt>
<joey> she goes to a mixer and he meets this </joey>
<garnt> girl and this girl for some reason wants </garnt>
<garnt> to lose her virginity because she just </garnt>
<garnt> at the age where she's just like [ __ ] it </garnt>
<joey> i got nothing better to do doesn't the </joey>
<joey> anime literally open with them like yeah </joey>
<garnt> after the anime literally opens the with </garnt>
<joey> them just off </joey>
<joey> right and so he sleeps with this girl </joey>
<joey> and then he's who he's just met and then </joey>
<joey> they say goodbye </joey>
<joey> um and then he goes home and then he </joey>
<joey> finds out that his dad's getting </joey>
<joey> remarried and then he meets the </joey>
<garnt> family that he's getting like his dad's </garnt>
<garnt> getting married to and it turns out that </garnt>
<garnt> the mother of or his future </garnt>
<garnt> mother-in-law </garnt>
<garnt> uh or his future stepmother </garnt>
<garnt> uh she has two daughters </garnt>
<garnt> one is the girl he slept with and the </garnt>
<garnt> other is the teacher he's in love with </garnt>
<garnt> and that is the premise of this </garnt>
<connor> girlfriend </connor>
<connor> literally this is this is incest and </connor>
<connor> this is just like this is like what if </connor>
<connor> we made all pawn categories into one </connor>
<connor> this is what it sounds like basically </connor>
<garnt> this is like basically combine every </garnt>
<garnt> port where are the laundry machines okay </garnt>
<garnt> four of them in this house </garnt>
<garnt> okay so like i will fully admit that the </garnt>
<garnt> the concept i mean yeah this is this is </garnt>
<joey> a hentai block okay this is this is your </joey>
<joey> this is this is your kisses this </joey>
<garnt> like when we did the anime three by </garnt>
<garnt> three people were like why why is the </garnt>
<garnt> domestic girlfriend anime not on there </garnt>
<connor> it's because i actually read the manga i </connor>
<connor> think it's a good [ __ ] manga and i </connor>
<connor> would defend it till the day i [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> died would you say it's a masterpiece i </connor>
<joey> would say i mean </joey>
<joey> it's a masterpiece in my heart okay okay </joey>
<joey> no because like i understand because </joey>
<joey> like what happens is like this </joey>
<joey> masterpiece is short for masturbating </joey>
<garnt> yes but like okay what i love about this </garnt>
<garnt> manga is that it takes the most like </garnt>
<garnt> it's the situation is a complete car </garnt>
<garnt> wreck and it just turns to a car wreck </garnt>
<garnt> to a train wreck to a [ __ ] nuclear </garnt>
<garnt> holocaust like </garnt>
<joey> the like the layers of how </joey>
<joey> complicated the situation get just let's </joey>
<joey> just get stacked on top of each other </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> what what offsets this is that it's </joey>
<joey> actually a really well written manga </joey>
<joey> it's like a a lot of following you're </joey>
<joey> being very oxymoronic right now okay </joey>
<joey> okay okay because a lot of thought was </joey>
<joey> really put into the characters so the </joey>
<joey> characters actually seem really </joey>
<joey> realistic and you can kind of like </joey>
<joey> empathize with them right </joey>
<joey> what's </joey>
<joey> what you can't relate to is the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> situation that they're in so you put </joey>
<joey> really </joey>
<joey> you put like you put actual like </joey>
<joey> realistic characters or well written </joey>
<garnt> characters into this really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> trashy wacky situation and it's such </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a juxtaposition </garnt>
<garnt> of just you're actually invested in </garnt>
<garnt> these characters but also the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that's happening is so wild that you </garnt>
<garnt> just want to keep reading just to see </garnt>
<garnt> what happens next it's like a soap opera </garnt>
<garnt> but the characters are actually really </garnt>
<garnt> like you're really really invested in </garnt>
<garnt> these characters </garnt>
<joey> i i just couldn't get to that point with </joey>
<joey> the anime honestly </joey>
<connor> what's more of a battle this or kingdom </connor>
<joey> what's more of an epic battle </joey>
<garnt> it's two different battles isn't it </garnt>
<garnt> which is the bigger battleground oh oh </garnt>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know which one's more five head </garnt>
<garnt> man one of them is like you're </garnt>
<joey> physically getting hurt because the </joey>
<garnt> other is like chipping away your brain </garnt>
<garnt> yeah okay because because like the anime </garnt>
<garnt> is a really okay what the anime did is </garnt>
<garnt> that it just took all the trashy moments </garnt>
<garnt> in the manga without any of the </garnt>
<garnt> character moments and just put them and </garnt>
<connor> just speed ran it so it made a bit of a </connor>
<connor> bad pawner huh they made it bad yeah but </connor>
<garnt> he made a bad porno okay </garnt>
<garnt> it's uh i mean what what porno doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> have character development well well how </garnt>
<connor> can i implement most of them a good one </connor>
<garnt> we don't need it </garnt>
<garnt> and uh yeah i i will i will keep talking </garnt>
<connor> about the dimensions i'm sure if you </connor>
<garnt> want to talk about it just ask him in </garnt>
<joey> public ask him anywhere </joey>
<joey> watch the 17 videos he made on it i </joey>
<garnt> realized i realized that uh i've made </garnt>
<garnt> like a manga three by three uh hentai </garnt>
<joey> three by three i'd say a dojin three by </joey>
<joey> three this is all and uh an anime three </joey>
<joey> by three and all of them have incest in </joey>
<joey> there i just i just want to say where is </joey>
<joey> this saying i just want to say for the </joey>
<garnt> record i i do not like incest you are </garnt>
<joey> very lucky you're an only child </joey>
<garnt> that's all i'm saying otherwise the </garnt>
<joey> internet would have destroyed yeah </joey>

<connor> for mother's no mother knows breasts </connor>
<connor> let's get into that </connor>
<joey> all right let's let's talk about 20th </joey>
<garnt> century boys okay because that is a that </garnt>
<garnt> is actually a good manga okay this is </garnt>
<connor> my favorite manga it's brilliant i've </connor>
<connor> never read this i've been wanting to </connor>
<connor> read this i've actually got it </connor>
<joey> downloaded ready to read everything but </joey>
<connor> i can i can give you the manga volumes </connor>
<garnt> instead oh you have them with you yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's in english yeah in english that's </garnt>
<joey> that's the model </joey>
<connor> well the cover looks badass yeah so it's </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing so 20th century boys is </joey>
<joey> my favorite manga of all time and i've i </joey>
<connor> only read this just before moving to </connor>
<joey> japan and it's it's it's kind of like </joey>
<connor> the oh yes me punishment where i knew i </connor>
<connor> would love this for ages and i held off </connor>
<connor> reading it until i had just the right </connor>
<connor> amount of time and the right mindset and </connor>
<connor> that just so happens when i had the few </connor>
<connor> week break before i moved to japan and i </connor>
<connor> was like okay i am now ready to </connor>
<connor> experience i'm now ready for emotion and </connor>
<connor> it lived up to everything and more i </connor>
<connor> like i knew it was like a magnum opus of </connor>
<joey> a piece of work yeah and i still like </joey>
<joey> it's it's amazing but also it like every </joey>
<joey> every lesson and every message you try </joey>
<joey> to say like spoke to me personally as </joey>
<joey> well so it was kind of like a mixture of </joey>
<garnt> personally this was my kind of story and </garnt>
<joey> also it's an amazing story this is this </joey>
<joey> was the manga that made me go wow </joey>
<joey> he's a [ __ ] genius can you give me a </joey>
<connor> very quick rundown of the show sure </connor>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> so oh oh it's pretty convoluted applause </joey>
<connor> it's it's a very give me the most </connor>
<garnt> bare-bones explanation okay so i'll try </garnt>
<garnt> to sell you this as quickly as possible </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> um so imagine like when you're growing </garnt>
<garnt> up as a kid right you play hero and </garnt>
<garnt> villains right </garnt>
<garnt> and so </garnt>
<garnt> like you you play a hero and someone </garnt>
<garnt> plays the hero and someone plays the </garnt>
<joey> villain and normally a super villain </joey>
<joey> they try to take over the world right </joey>
<joey> it's a cartoony plot they take of the </joey>
<joey> world and the hero stops them now what </joey>
<joey> if you could make this very childish </joey>
<joey> plot believable </joey>
<garnt> that is basically what 20th century boys </garnt>
<joey> is right sounds cool it's someone who </joey>
<garnt> basically </garnt>
<garnt> tries to take over the world and naoki </garnt>
<joey> naoki hiroshima went how can we actually </joey>
<joey> make this actually seem realistic and </joey>
<joey> terrifying and terrifying as well that's </joey>
<joey> that's like the bare bones basic premise </joey>
<joey> of this what i love about this is that </joey>
<joey> it's kind of like a mystery so it </joey>
<joey> doesn't open up with that that premise </joey>
<joey> what it opens up with is this guy who's </joey>
<connor> just a normal guy who stumbles upon </connor>
<connor> a conspiracy right </connor>
<connor> and so </connor>
<connor> of course you stumble upon a conspiracy </connor>
<connor> and you see how deep this how deep this </connor>
<connor> conspiracy goes </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah exactly exactly </connor>
<connor> and it the way the story unravels is </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> like you are given pieces just to how </connor>
<connor> how deep this conspiracy </connor>
<connor> this conspiracy goes and how far it runs </connor>
<connor> and the more chapters you read normally </connor>
<connor> like you see a mystery and like you can </connor>
<connor> you're able to like kind of get a feel </connor>
<connor> for like how big this mystery is right </connor>
<connor> what i find [ __ ] amazing about 20th </connor>
<connor> century boys is that i was like 5 to 10 </connor>
<connor> volumes in or something like that and it </connor>
<connor> felt like i was staring into an abyss in </connor>
<garnt> terms of this mystery like this this </garnt>
<garnt> this feeling where you just don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how deep this rabbit hole goes like you </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like there's no way this can </garnt>
<garnt> go deeper then something gets revealed </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like </garnt>
<garnt> where does this end </garnt>
<garnt> how the [ __ ] how far this does this go </garnt>
<garnt> and like the way that and that's what i </garnt>
<garnt> find i find that incredible there's no </garnt>
<garnt> but no other mystery that's just giving </garnt>
<garnt> me this feeling of just like it was kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like almost existential dread because </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't know how far this sank or how </garnt>
<garnt> deep this went </garnt>
<garnt> um and it's probably like it's my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite manga of all time i think it's </garnt>
<joey> my favorite mystery of all time </joey>
<joey> i'm so so amazing at writing these just </joey>
<joey> mysteries where it's just like you don't </joey>
<joey> know where it's going and also </joey>
<joey> i don't know about you but urasanaki i </joey>
<joey> feel is a genius at writing </joey>
<joey> some of the most perfect antagonists </joey>
<joey> yeah in manga i mean he also did monster </joey>
<connor> yeah right yeah okay you should have </connor>
<connor> said that yeah oh yeah yeah it's the </connor>
<connor> same guy </connor>
<connor> same guy </connor>
<connor> but like monster is like way more </connor>
<connor> character driven and i think it's like </connor>
<connor> much more small scale this one is like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] massive scale it sucks so much </connor>
<connor> to read now </connor>
<joey> and like this is this is never going to </joey>
<joey> get an anime adaptation because </joey>
<garnt> i mean compared to monster this this </garnt>
<garnt> would be like hundreds of episodes maybe </garnt>
<garnt> because that's just that's just how like </garnt>
<joey> monster was like 70 something episodes </joey>
<connor> yeah this would easily be like 150 200 </connor>
<connor> episodes yeah yeah make it happen honey </connor>
<connor> got over 148 true yeah and yeah i i feel </connor>
<joey> like it's the greatest manga i've ever </joey>
<garnt> read and it's definitely up there yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> is there anything more than that can you </connor>
<garnt> give it a higher praise than that that's </garnt>
<connor> that it's it's mine i guess i have to </connor>
<garnt> read it [ __ ] me yeah it's brilliant it's </garnt>
<garnt> my uh it's it's it's i i like i can't </garnt>
<garnt> even pick a favorite anime of all time </garnt>
<joey> but the fact that i can pick a favorite </joey>
<joey> manga of all time it's telling that's </joey>
<joey> telling ladies and gentlemen we got him </joey>
<joey> we got him and it's not domestic </joey>
<connor> girlfriend </connor>
<connor> surprisingly he walked in the middle </connor>
<connor> don't [ __ ] for that </connor>
<connor> i i didn't put anything significant in </connor>
<joey> my middle one i just clicked </joey>
<garnt> i mean i should have should have it was </garnt>
<garnt> the oromo square that's why i put it in </garnt>
<joey> the middle yeah </joey>
<connor> and you have well two more i guess one </connor>
<connor> more we'll talk about berserk after uh </connor>
<connor> beck </connor>
<joey> the manga for background i've only </joey>
<joey> watched the anime </joey>
<joey> you've only watched the anime joey joey </joey>
<joey> i'm showing my character </joey>
<joey> i actually love that </joey>
<joey> i mean dude i [ __ ] love the anime and </joey>
<joey> again </joey>
<garnt> same thing everyone's saying the manga </garnt>
<garnt> is even better the manga is even yeah </garnt>
<connor> before you get your dicks out and start </connor>
<connor> comparing them what with you the plot of </connor>
<garnt> back i know nothing i mean it's it's </garnt>
<connor> like uh it's it's a musical right [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> off it's not a musical it is </connor>
<connor> just music yeah he just plays music he </connor>
<garnt> just joins a band and tries to get big </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so come on come on [ __ ] off i'm not </garnt>
<joey> even joking i'm not sick i'm not joking </joey>
<joey> that's really the part of what's good </joey>
<joey> about it then </joey>
<garnt> it's just this it's just the journey </garnt>
<joey> it's it's completely character-driven </joey>
<garnt> you looked at me dead in the eyes and </garnt>
<garnt> you said it's the journey well it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> it's uh what i love about beck i mean </joey>
<joey> it's a very simple story in that sense </joey>
<joey> it's a completely character-driven story </joey>
<joey> where </joey>
<connor> it's about a boy who joins a band and </connor>
<connor> they're very underground they're trying </connor>
<connor> to make it big um and it's literally </connor>
<connor> just their journey of making it big </connor>
<connor> right and you know i mean you've seen </connor>
<connor> movies and [ __ ] you know </connor>
<connor> star is born huh a star is born yeah and </connor>
<connor> obviously there's i mean this is sabrina </connor>
<garnt> miley cyrus hannah montana </garnt>
<garnt> the best of both worlds sorry think </garnt>
<joey> about that but just like better </joey>
<joey> how </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> it's very heavily reliant on the </joey>
<joey> characters but like the way the </joey>
<joey> characters are written and just the how </joey>
<joey> they like play off each other and like </joey>
<joey> all of the i mean a it's very realistic </joey>
<joey> which is already like a big plus for me </joey>
<joey> especially with like a character-driven </joey>
<joey> story like that but also it's just like </joey>
<connor> yeah i don't know it's just a really </connor>
<connor> good journey do you think i'd enjoy it </connor>
<garnt> uh do you like rock music i enjoy rock </garnt>
<garnt> music i mean it's it's if if you are </garnt>
<garnt> like to me </garnt>
<garnt> mark zuckerberg answering that </garnt>
<garnt> do you like human things yes i like </garnt>
<garnt> human things </garnt>
<garnt> i kind of realized i asked the person i </garnt>
<connor> enjoyed </connor>
<connor> do you like rock music i i do enjoy rock </connor>
<connor> music i felt like the pressure was on </connor>
<garnt> for some reason sorry go ahead </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's what i love about beck </garnt>
<garnt> is that it's just all </garnt>
<garnt> it just captures </garnt>
<garnt> the you know the love for rock and you </garnt>
<garnt> know good old you know old classic rock </garnt>
<garnt> and roll and just like how rockets </garnt>
<joey> evolve through time so so do they </joey>
<joey> mention like all of like like did they </joey>
<joey> mention the fact like they play like a </joey>
<joey> cover of the beatles and [ __ ] yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> how does </connor>
<connor> is it </connor>
<connor> you know because i i just thought about </connor>
<joey> a second i'm like oh wait surely you'd </joey>
<joey> want to listen to the music right yeah </joey>
<connor> so that's why i watched the anime yeah </connor>
<joey> that's what i think yeah </joey>
<joey> i thought that as well right because i </joey>
<joey> was just like [ __ ] i kind of really want </joey>
<joey> to know what happens but i don't know if </joey>
<joey> i can get invested in a um in a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> manga about music where </connor>
<connor> i don't i don't know if you know </connor>
<connor> anything about manga but uh you can't </connor>
<connor> really hear anything that's going on in </connor>
<connor> the market don't have audio yeah and </connor>
<connor> then i realized and then i realized the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i i kind of realized a super </connor>
<connor> life hack uh when reading beck right </connor>
<connor> because what because you know i i also </connor>
<connor> watch the anime that's what got me into </connor>
<joey> reading the manga </joey>
<joey> um and i realized that when they're </joey>
<joey> playing </joey>
<joey> in their concerts and it's like you can </joey>
<joey> literally just play whatever song you </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] love and you feel the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> emotion [ __ ] brain </connor>
<connor> know i gotta go through expansion </connor>
<connor> playlist brain expansion i mean like you </connor>
<connor> can do it if you if you kind of like </connor>
<connor> want if you want to like really get </connor>
<connor> invested and really like put yourself </connor>
<connor> into this rock concert but what what's </connor>
<garnt> amazing about the manga is that it </garnt>
<garnt> somehow captures the energy of a concert </garnt>
<garnt> so [ __ ] well and like if you've ever </garnt>
<garnt> been to a gig and if you've ever if </garnt>
<garnt> you've ever like seen sorry sorry thanks </garnt>
<garnt> thank you connor thank you now i'm so </garnt>
<joey> bored </joey>
<joey> i sneeze when i'm born </joey>
<garnt> conor when he listens to someone talking </garnt>
<connor> about music </connor>
<connor> reaction </connor>
<connor> music yeah so someone like read musical </connor>
<garnt> sheets near me </garnt>
<connor> no if you've ever been to a gig and </connor>
<connor> especially like a rock concert there's a </connor>
<connor> certain like energy to seeing your </connor>
<connor> favorite bands live and i don't know how </connor>
<connor> the manga the manga which is a medium </connor>
<connor> where you can't hear anything it </connor>
<joey> captures the energy so well </joey>
<joey> that you can play the music of whatever </joey>
<joey> your favorite band is and you're just </joey>
<joey> like holy [ __ ] i'm feeling hyped and the </joey>
<joey> reason this is saying the feelings yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah exactly and the the music is </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like complimentary to that as </garnt>
<garnt> well </garnt>
<garnt> um and like if you like if you like the </garnt>
<garnt> anime joey then you're gonna [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> love the manga because the manga takes </garnt>
<garnt> the best parts of like the best scenes </garnt>
<joey> of what happens in the anime and there </joey>
<joey> are there are scenes in the manga that </joey>
<joey> are like five times as hype as anything </joey>
<connor> that happens in grateful sounds i know </connor>
<connor> what i'm buying next </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and like it's it's hard to </connor>
<connor> sell back uh if you haven't seen the </connor>
<connor> anime because if if you haven't seen the </connor>
<connor> anime i think that's the best way to get </connor>
<connor> into the manga because it's like i said </connor>
<connor> it's a musical manga um and it might be </connor>
<connor> a hard sell if you don't know if if you </connor>
<connor> don't know what you're getting into but </connor>
<connor> if you like </connor>
<garnt> but if you like rock if you feel like </garnt>
<joey> good old rock and roll i still remember </joey>
<joey> that scene in beck that made me be like </joey>
<connor> hell yeah it was like the the scene </connor>
<connor> where he does the cover of i got a </connor>
<joey> feeling by the way yeah yeah that scene </joey>
<joey> is like the most [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> hell yes moment it is so good i don't </joey>
<garnt> know what you're talking about it's such </garnt>
<connor> a great it's such a good thing it's just </connor>
<garnt> so steeped in rock culture yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> uh if if you're if you like that </garnt>
<connor> there's a lot there's a lot of people in </connor>
<connor> japan who just love [ __ ] rock and </connor>
<connor> roll yeah yeah yeah people was like you </connor>
<garnt> know you see a british like oh sex </garnt>
<connor> pistols yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah that's that's a british </garnt>
<garnt> foreign </garnt>
<connor> honestly like they make so many </connor>
<connor> references to like real life bands </connor>
<joey> something i also love as well yeah like </joey>
<connor> like they say like oh with this person's </connor>
<garnt> inspired by hendrix or sex pistols </garnt>
<garnt> there's another manga that does that um </garnt>
<garnt> exactly right </garnt>
<garnt> that was the joke i was gonna go for </garnt>
<garnt> and uh of course the uh only square </garnt>
<garnt> that's been taken up by all three of our </garnt>
<garnt> three by threes </garnt>
<garnt> um rightfully </garnt>
<garnt> i think last time we spoke about it i </garnt>
<connor> don't think i'd finished it on the </connor>
<connor> podcast had i no </connor>
<joey> yeah caught up but i mean hey you could </joey>
<connor> tell it was nearly about nearly done </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it kind of had like its own somewhat </joey>
<connor> conclusion </connor>
<connor> around that point i mean </connor>
<connor> when i was reading it and i saw the </connor>
<connor> dreaded i saw how many chapters i had </connor>
<connor> left yeah a little sinking feeling was </connor>
<connor> coming from my heart but </connor>
<connor> you know i i still i i'm i'm very thanks </connor>
<connor> i felt like he was so close to the end </connor>
<connor> like we were there like he was he was </connor>
<joey> literally prepping yeah he was prep </joey>
<joey> i still think he had a lot </joey>
<joey> i don't know because he he you know you </joey>
<joey> know how before a big raid you know you </joey>
<joey> get some new armor you get some new </joey>
<joey> stuff right that's what was going on it </joey>
<joey> was definitely a prominent fight coming </joey>
<joey> we were gonna and it was gearing up that </joey>
<joey> it was like all right we're getting a </joey>
<garnt> big boy fight yeah yeah yeah we might </garnt>
<connor> have been like 10 years away but </connor>
<connor> it was coming it was coming it was on a </connor>
<connor> plane </connor>
<garnt> it was like oh she's coming i'm like </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean </connor>
<connor> do we need to explain the plot of </connor>
<garnt> berserk do we </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's just i guess we should a </garnt>
<garnt> little bit right if you haven't read </garnt>
<garnt> this there's probably people watching </garnt>
<garnt> this who have not read berserk yes i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i was one of those people would you </garnt>
<garnt> like to explain the plot um </garnt>
<garnt> there was a boy who was orphaned uh he </garnt>
<connor> was thrown to the wayside in a pile of </connor>
<connor> horrible fluids on the ground and uh </connor>
<connor> there was a woman who was like no we </connor>
<connor> must pick this up and the mercenary band </connor>
<connor> that was traveling with this one was </connor>
<connor> like no let him let him die and die but </connor>
<connor> then somehow the woman convinces the man </connor>
<connor> to let her pick the baby up and raise </connor>
<connor> this child who is going to be guts our </connor>
<connor> main character and as you can tell this </connor>
<connor> upbringing is not the best and hor many </connor>
<connor> more horrible things happen to this </connor>
<joey> child through his upbringing but </joey>
<joey> so many gross things but the band of </joey>
<joey> mercenaries also train him to be a </joey>
<joey> warrior </joey>
<joey> and then you know because he said so </joey>
<joey> many bad things happen to him during </joey>
<joey> during his childhood he becomes kind of </joey>
<joey> the the lone gamer warrior that we all </joey>
<connor> think is the coolest thing ever uh but </connor>
<joey> you know the black swords yeah the black </joey>
<connor> swordsman right the guy who can carry </connor>
<connor> the big ass swords </connor>
<joey> the one who can just beat everyone alone </joey>
<joey> right and and you know </joey>
<joey> slowly realize that that's a bit of an </joey>
<joey> empty life and uh wants to make friends </joey>
<joey> and then uh bad things happen very bad </joey>
<connor> things happen um </connor>
<connor> and bad things continue to happen and </connor>
<connor> it's about </connor>
<connor> getting over those bad things and trying </connor>
<connor> to learn to accept people and love again </connor>
<joey> i suppose in certain ways um it poses </joey>
<joey> itself as this like </joey>
<joey> big bad guy with a sword fights monsters </joey>
<connor> and bad dudes and tries to survive the </connor>
<connor> wall but at the end of it you realize oh </connor>
<connor> it's not about that no it's about his </connor>
<connor> journey yeah it's about it's always </connor>
<connor> always about that it's it's always it's </connor>
<connor> always about this it's about it's about </connor>
<connor> him </connor>
<joey> it's it's literally just like a monger </joey>
<connor> about his life yeah and the cherry on </connor>
<connor> top is just god tierra </connor>
<joey> the art is just insane like it's it's </joey>
<joey> just no one can draw like nero yeah um </joey>
<connor> and like if you haven't read it you know </connor>

<connor> is it is just right it is it is not over </connor>
<garnt> hyped </garnt>
<garnt> i thought of every possible reason i </garnt>
<garnt> could to not put this on my three by </garnt>
<garnt> three because it's just like it's just </garnt>
<garnt> the one that i think we all know that we </garnt>
<garnt> were all gonna everyone it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> the manga that goes on everyone's three </garnt>
<garnt> by three and i'm just like can i be that </garnt>
<connor> person yes you're deserving i have had </connor>
<joey> many manga uh that i one of many most </joey>
<joey> that i've had one two one or two </joey>
<joey> chapters that i have like you know what </joey>
<connor> let's just kind of speed run this part </connor>
<connor> let's get through it first yeah i've </connor>
<connor> never ever ever felt like that during </connor>
<connor> berserk even though i'd i'd seen the </connor>
<connor> first arc yeah i still was like [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> this is good taking my time exactly like </garnt>
<garnt> what i find incredible is that you know </garnt>
<garnt> people will look at berserk or people </garnt>
<joey> who have never read berserk they look at </joey>
<joey> it and they see oh musty man with big </joey>
<joey> sword go bro you know that's that's </joey>
<joey> that's that's kind of like what it looks </joey>
<joey> like on the cover but like what everyone </joey>
<joey> who's read berserk and the moments that </joey>
<joey> stand out in berserk and the parts that </joey>
<joey> people remember are always like the </joey>
<joey> quiet instruments yeah it's the </joey>
<joey> beautiful moments and that's and that's </joey>
<garnt> because there's the juxtaposition </garnt>
<garnt> between like the [ __ ] up [ __ ] that </garnt>
<garnt> happens and the bloody and gory and </garnt>
<garnt> amazing action that is in the manga like </garnt>
<garnt> it's juxtaposed with some of like </garnt>
<garnt> the most beautiful moments you can find </garnt>
<joey> in fiction just the scene of god </joey>
<joey> standing in the field of flowers yeah </joey>
<connor> just that that whole like mini arc if </connor>
<joey> you will yeah it's like one of my </joey>
<connor> favorite moments really yeah i was just </connor>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] they just took like they </connor>
<joey> were like hold up yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah because i feel like i feel like the </joey>
<joey> story of berserk speaks to just a call </joey>
<joey> that so many people can relate to like </joey>
<joey> hey </joey>
<joey> you know to get [ __ ] real for a </joey>
<joey> second like if you've ever felt lost in </joey>
<joey> life or you don't know what your purpose </joey>
<joey> is or you don't know </joey>
<joey> if it's worth it if you don't know if </joey>
<joey> it's worth it or why you're [ __ ] here </joey>
<joey> like if you're just ever having a bad </joey>
<joey> day </joey>
<joey> like that's exactly what guts goes </joey>
<garnt> through in berserk you may look like a </garnt>
<garnt> big muscly man but he like the journey </garnt>
<garnt> that he goes through is exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> realization that a lot of us </garnt>
<joey> have gone through in our lives you know </joey>
<joey> under that hunk of muscle there is a </joey>
<connor> heart you can't you can't chop your way </connor>
<joey> through every problem yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> that's what you know he tries and he </connor>
<connor> realizes no he can't see as much as we'd </connor>
<connor> all love to be the overpowered mc like </connor>
<connor> at the end of the day that that's not </connor>
<connor> going to help you solve every problem </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah that's what uh you know just </connor>
<connor> it shows you i guess in some ways not to </connor>
<connor> get too lost in the things that are </connor>
<connor> right in front of you right which is a </connor>
<garnt> lot about what berserk is about yeah i i </garnt>
<garnt> think i think the scene that sold me on </garnt>
<joey> berserk if like if i can get to like </joey>
<connor> small spoilers of the golden age arc </connor>
<connor> um it's it's like the scene after he </connor>
<connor> beats like the hundred men because like </connor>
<connor> you you think in warfare you [ __ ] one </connor>
<connor> man takes on a hundred men that's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] badass in any other anime that </connor>
<connor> would like that's framed as like holy </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] this is an incredible feat which it </garnt>
<garnt> is yeah and like i like i remember like </garnt>
<garnt> it was just gutz's reaction it was just </garnt>
<garnt> realizing it doesn't [ __ ] mean </garnt>
<connor> anything yeah like also the aftermath of </connor>
<connor> everyone coming in the forest yeah </connor>
<connor> seeing him just murdered a hundred yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah just like disgusted they're </joey>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] how is this man alive </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] but yeah that is it's it's </joey>
<joey> afterwards that he just realizes i'm i'm </joey>
<joey> doing this for no reason i'm literally </joey>
<joey> just killing 100 men and it just means </joey>
<connor> nothing to me </connor>
<connor> yeah like even right away like even </connor>
<connor> though um i you know i think i said this </connor>
<connor> in uh the last episode uh the last time </connor>
<garnt> we spoke about berserk i do think that i </garnt>
<garnt> would have preferred um the first part </garnt>
<garnt> which they because they they have like a </garnt>
<garnt> time skip i would have preferred they've </garnt>
<connor> just put that in the right time right </connor>
<joey> because i feel like it kind of oh and </joey>
<joey> just start from like golden age yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah i think it would have been perfect </connor>
<connor> to start from there um even though i'm </connor>
<connor> sure people disagree with me um because </connor>
<connor> i feel like you get so many </connor>
<connor> really cool experiences if you didn't </connor>
<connor> know what was going to happen yeah um </connor>
<connor> and also just getting to see </connor>
<connor> his childhood from the start yeah would </connor>
<connor> tell you all about the how [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> this thing's going to be yeah i guess i </joey>
<joey> guess they needed a hook right to you i </joey>
<joey> think so i think that's why but like you </joey>
<joey> know i wonder </joey>
<joey> if it was done again </joey>
<joey> you know would it would it be ordered </joey>
<connor> differently looking back </connor>
<connor> i don't know um that's obviously just </connor>
<connor> pure speculation yeah and i'm sure </connor>
<connor> people would uh completely disagree with </connor>
<garnt> me and that's fine that's opinions right </garnt>
<garnt> that's what yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think especially is especially what </garnt>
<garnt> happened recently berserk's really </garnt>
<connor> changed my perspective on how i view </connor>
<connor> media as well because i'm just like </connor>
<connor> before i'm just like something that's </connor>
<connor> not finished can't be a masterpiece and </connor>
<connor> then i think about it and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> berserk is a pure example of something </connor>
<garnt> that has done more than [ __ ] enough </garnt>
<connor> to be a master yeah like an unfinished </connor>
<garnt> masterpiece is still a masterpiece you </garnt>
<joey> know and i i feel like i that's really </joey>
<joey> changed my perspective on other shows </joey>
<joey> which may maybe not ended it may never </joey>
<joey> end and i'm just like well i think it's </joey>
<joey> still done enough to be called like a </joey>
<connor> masterpiece yeah and i think berserk has </connor>
<joey> really showed me that as well i agree </joey>
<garnt> yeah real berserk read berserk please </garnt>
<joey> and listen to guts's theory even if </joey>
<garnt> you're not into dark fantasy i think </garnt>
<joey> it's still i'm not into darth vader i </joey>
<joey> still think it's it can be very much </joey>
<connor> enjoyed </connor>
