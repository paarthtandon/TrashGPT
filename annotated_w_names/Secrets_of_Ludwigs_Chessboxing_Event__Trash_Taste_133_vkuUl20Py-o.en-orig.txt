<joey> 122. </joey>
<connor> New Year </connor>
<connor> welcome to trash taste 2023 that feels </connor>
<connor> really weird to say yep I know right I </connor>
<connor> still in my head you know every time </connor>
<connor> when you would the new year would happen </connor>
<connor> in the school you'd write the new thing </connor>
<connor> I'm still in like 2017 in my head </connor>
<joey> no no it's 23. I'm gonna fix that I'm </joey>
<joey> still in 2013 dude what I haven't </joey>
<garnt> changed since then honestly I'm kind of </garnt>
<garnt> the same you know you know what's like </garnt>
<garnt> what do they say about like after you </garnt>
<garnt> reach like 23 or something then you </garnt>
<connor> never feel like you've like aged up </connor>
<garnt> anymore yeah after that point it's like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you're probably just like 23 24 I </garnt>
<connor> feel in my head </connor>
<connor> it's until your body starts like giving </connor>
<garnt> up this is just 30s copium I'm like I'm </garnt>
<connor> still 23 right I'm still young please </connor>
<garnt> say that right they say you're still 20 </garnt>
<connor> right 30 right am I right fellow kids </connor>
<garnt> um I I guess I I should start the year </garnt>
<garnt> off with a take all right what's your </garnt>
<garnt> take Connor all right so my take </garnt>
<garnt> um so I was at I was at status and </garnt>
<garnt> Emily's house and he asked if I wanted </garnt>
<garnt> some anything to drink I was like yeah </garnt>
<connor> sure I'll just I'll have some water so I </connor>
<connor> pull myself some water he's like what </connor>
<connor> are you no ice really I said yeah I like </connor>
<connor> it I like it less when it's cold so on </connor>
<connor> my tickets that I don't like cold water </connor>
<connor> I think that I think the room </connor>
<connor> temperature water is tastier is that </connor>
<connor> it's easier to drink that's my take for </connor>
<joey> the year well I've got no trash days 20 </joey>
<connor> 20. when we're starting off with a bag </connor>
<connor> I've been holding this back because we </connor>
<connor> switched to the two days ago and I </connor>
<connor> really wanted to be like is this weird </connor>
<garnt> I'm like this is not weird right we're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna be like in trash today's 2024 and </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna be like you know what </garnt>
<garnt> smiling overrated kind of I kind of like </garnt>
<connor> I just I just had this conversation and </connor>
<garnt> he made me feel like I was weird for </garnt>
<garnt> liking water that was from straight from </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] tap just just room Ash </garnt>
<connor> temperature I just want to be able to </connor>
<connor> drink it right then like if it's too </connor>
<connor> cold my mouth gets too cold and then my </connor>
<connor> my esophagus feels like it's freezing I </connor>
<connor> just I just want to have the drink right </connor>
<joey> away sounds like a skill issue to me </joey>
<garnt> maybe it is easier is there a reason you </garnt>
<garnt> just okay yeah since since we're </garnt>
<connor> declaring war against cold Wars </connor>
<connor> cold water do I hate it when I'm in </connor>
<connor> America and they give me a cup of water </connor>
<connor> and it is 99 ice and one drop of water </connor>
<joey> yeah I hate that okay so like are you </joey>
<connor> just like a no-wise person no matter </connor>
<connor> what I'm like a one two Cube guy Max </connor>
<connor> like I wanted to like lightly cool the </connor>
<connor> water like I don't want to I don't want </connor>
<joey> that [ __ ] to be ice cold like lightly </joey>
<connor> cool I just wanna I want the illusion </connor>
<garnt> that I'm calling it without cooling it </garnt>
<garnt> is it possible that I just have a take </garnt>
<garnt> that's the same as you because I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> no give me all the [ __ ] nice just if </garnt>
<garnt> if you're good if you're gonna put this </garnt>
<connor> feels like an AI generated conversation </connor>
<garnt> like a trash taste if you're gonna put </garnt>
<joey> ice cube in it just [ __ ] fill that </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] up I don't want one or two I want </connor>
<joey> like a high glass or nothing man and on </joey>
<joey> brand I'm just in a position where I'm </joey>
<connor> kind of just like listen listen give me </connor>
<connor> both bro this is not that I don't both </connor>
<garnt> is fine I'm not like I'm dying on this </garnt>
<garnt> hill it's like I just did it and I got I </garnt>
<connor> felt attacked the Titus was like how </connor>
<garnt> dare you yeah I have ice three fat I </garnt>
<garnt> don't care that much it's just my </garnt>
<garnt> Southeast Asian blood like it's when </garnt>
<garnt> when I when I because when we have eyes </garnt>
<garnt> is that we need to fill that [ __ ] up to </garnt>
<garnt> the brim because the ice melts so </garnt>
<garnt> quickly so I I've just got on your </garnt>
<garnt> customers </garnt>
<garnt> basically right basically okay here's </garnt>
<garnt> here's something even more outrageous </garnt>
<garnt> that Thailand does not Regis </garnt>
<connor> egregious sorry I I [ __ ] up the words </connor>
<garnt> all the time we have like 900 clubs okay </garnt>
<garnt> you talk about putting ice cubes in </garnt>
<connor> water right so here's what they do in </connor>
<connor> time I know you're gonna tell me now I </connor>
<joey> know I already hate it they uh serve you </joey>
<connor> the big I know I know and then they go </connor>
<joey> with ice with ice in it and they give </joey>
<joey> you ice and some place and some places </joey>
<garnt> have the ice already in the cup where </garnt>
<garnt> you pour the beer and it's why it's </garnt>
<garnt> because because of the weather okay </garnt>
<joey> because of the weather yeah because I </joey>
<joey> want to get to the bottom of this yeah </joey>
<connor> it's Thai beer made or I guess like </connor>
<connor> brewed in a way where it's better cold </connor>
<connor> or is it just like any other beer where </connor>
<connor> if you put it with some [ __ ] ice </connor>
<garnt> cubes and it's like what the [ __ ] it's </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like any other pair honestly </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna have to be like no that's not </connor>
<joey> allowed I was gonna give it the benefit </joey>
<joey> of the doubt if it was like brewed </joey>
<joey> differently where it's like oh it's </joey>
<joey> actually better surf chilled but like no </joey>
<garnt> okay but here's the real question would </garnt>
<garnt> you what what which of the two evils </garnt>
<garnt> would you prefer a warm bear or a beer </garnt>
<garnt> with ice in it because you you ain't </garnt>
<garnt> getting you ain't getting a cold beer in </garnt>
<garnt> Thailand that like maintains itself okay </garnt>
<garnt> so you have two options you have two </garnt>
<garnt> options either you drink a warm beer or </garnt>
<garnt> you drink a beer with ice in it and and </garnt>
<garnt> I shoot I like you and I'm gonna be </garnt>
<connor> honest I choose the Ice Cube man I that </connor>
<garnt> to me having a refreshing feeling with a </garnt>
<connor> beer is the Lesser or two evil hold up </connor>
<connor> would you put ice cubes in a glass of </connor>
<connor> wine </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> because this is the same kind of </connor>
<connor> question right you're you're </connor>
<connor> compromising the drink obviously with </connor>
<connor> stuff like you know whiskey there's </connor>
<connor> there's arguments there and some people </connor>
<connor> say the water helps the flavor but with </connor>
<connor> beer that's flat out just no no no no </connor>
<joey> you do not the you don't put water to be </joey>
<joey> fair I've never had warm beard nor beer </joey>
<connor> with ice probably yeah </connor>
<connor> but when you're at college or something </connor>
<connor> right like you just forgot to put in the </connor>
<connor> fridge you're like all right well I'll </connor>
<connor> just take a warm beer I mean is that </connor>
<connor> wall it's like room temp yeah okay room </connor>
<connor> temp is a bit different to warm well I </connor>
<connor> mean how warm can it be I mean yeah room </connor>
<garnt> temperature in Thailand it's very </garnt>
<garnt> different from room temperature </garnt>
<connor> you have a barbecue in the summer and it </connor>
<connor> gets you know the beer gets really warm </connor>
<connor> because you ran out of ice in the cooler </connor>
<joey> and it's like all right well you know </joey>
<joey> it's whatever warm beer is fine but </joey>
<joey> putting water in beer and Ice having </joey>
<joey> like dilute all of the beer that's water </joey>
<joey> down beer is a little bit nasty yeah as </joey>
<joey> if like Coors Light wasn't drinkable </joey>
<connor> like it wasn't like a [ __ ] what's the </connor>
<connor> word </connor>
<connor> um it's hard enough to drink some beers </connor>
<garnt> why the [ __ ] would you want to put water </garnt>
<garnt> in it it's it's okay yeah I like I'm not </garnt>
<garnt> gonna defend this obviously because I </garnt>
<garnt> both are like awful in my mind but like </garnt>
<garnt> my Stratton Thailand is like if you if </garnt>
<garnt> you have let's say a glass full of ice </garnt>
<garnt> for example cools it down very quickly </garnt>
<connor> so it doesn't get like too watered down </connor>
<connor> so you and since there's like less </connor>
<connor> volume you can drink it more quickly as </connor>
<connor> opposed to like letting it get watered </connor>
<connor> down I choose that evil over having warm </connor>
<connor> beer because there's just something </connor>
<connor> about I'm not like a fan of like warm </connor>
<garnt> water in general unless it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm Ill or something I love warm </garnt>
<connor> water it's like because it reminds me of </connor>
<joey> tea </joey>
<joey> a lot more water is like water down tea </joey>
<connor> I have occasionally just drank in warm </connor>
<joey> water yeah just like [ __ ] it I just </joey>
<connor> wanna I want the feeling of tea without </connor>
<garnt> having to make a tea I don't know why </garnt>
<connor> I'm not too sure </connor>
<garnt> it's close enough it's close enough I'm </garnt>
<joey> not sure about that one </joey>
<joey> I have dog [ __ ] takes all right this is </joey>
<joey> my dog should take of the Year why don't </joey>
<joey> they just okay what I don't understand </joey>
<joey> right is that okay obviously it's hot </joey>
<joey> outside right yeah and you want to keep </joey>
<joey> the beer as cold as you possibly can </joey>
<connor> yeah so why don't they just do that </connor>
<connor> thing where they do in Japan where they </connor>
<connor> just shove the the beer like glass yeah </connor>
<connor> in like a freezer or something so that </connor>
<connor> it's like chilled out yeah I thought </connor>
<connor> about it then immediately pull the beer </connor>
<connor> and then if it starts to get warm just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] naked </connor>
<connor> in Australia we don't have to [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> worry about it's hot as [ __ ] in </connor>
<connor> Australia by the glass shredders in the </connor>
<joey> go-to yeah just use the glass stripe </joey>
<garnt> that's just like a lot of like fridge </garnt>
<joey> space though you know that that's always </joey>
<joey> storing all those ice cubes I'm </joey>
<garnt> wondering how the like Japan is like so </garnt>
<garnt> optimized with space because in most </garnt>
<garnt> places like having like a fridge full of </garnt>
<garnt> glasses that's just like that's just a </garnt>
<garnt> fridge that you're basically like not </garnt>
<connor> using for food or well I guess all right </connor>
<connor> let's just let's break down the </connor>
<connor> logistics here okay okay you you let's </connor>
<connor> say you're cooling the drinks obviously </connor>
<connor> they stay cooler for longer that's the </connor>
<connor> benefit yeah uh you probably can't store </connor>
<connor> all of your drinks in a cooler though </connor>
<connor> right like you probably don't have a big </connor>
<connor> enough thing to put all the drinks if </connor>
<connor> you're a business selling drinks all </connor>
<connor> over maybe the glass is cool quick </connor>
<connor> enough where you could just shove them </connor>
<connor> in because it's you know they fill up </connor>
<connor> with ice yeah they don't take up that </connor>
<connor> much room so this maybe you can it can </connor>
<connor> work I don't know you can stack drinks </connor>
<connor> right outside like ages I feel like I </connor>
<connor> don't know this this is like a weird </connor>
<connor> complex maybe I feel like the bigger </connor>
<connor> problem is is that if you if you're </connor>
<connor> giving glasses out to everyone right </connor>
<connor> like if you give a bottle you sell it </connor>
<connor> it's done yeah you don't have to worry </connor>
<connor> about getting it back right if you said </connor>
<connor> if you give a drink with a glass you </connor>
<connor> have to get rid of the the glass that </connor>
<connor> you you know poured the beer out of and </connor>
<connor> then now you have to try and get the </connor>
<connor> beer glass back yeah and and also every </connor>
<connor> that also means everything's so </connor>
<connor> complicated my head every time you order </connor>
<garnt> a bit every time you order a new beer </garnt>
<garnt> you need a new cool glass with it right </garnt>
<connor> I imagine most of it's cans as well </connor>
<garnt> where's those bottles actually no </garnt>
<garnt> bottles or glass bottles so there's it's </garnt>
<connor> uh especially if you go to like the </connor>
<connor> local kind of you know bars and </connor>
<connor> restaurants they don't really have like </connor>
<connor> beer on top like single beer isn't good </connor>
<joey> enough that it like deserves to be on </joey>
<garnt> top I'm gonna say that how loud okay </garnt>
<garnt> um it's kind of like it's it's mostly </garnt>
<garnt> just in like glass bottles so I mean if </garnt>
<joey> they were why don't they just shove the </joey>
<garnt> glass bottles in the freezer and then </garnt>
<connor> you can just drink straight out of that </connor>
<garnt> the freezer well you know in in a cool </garnt>
<connor> environment so that it's frozen down so </connor>
<joey> that you can just drink directly rather </joey>
<connor> than pouring it into a glass just drink </connor>
<connor> it straight out of the bottle I think </connor>
<connor> the problem is is that ice cubes are </connor>
<joey> really [ __ ] easy to make uh yeah but </joey>
<joey> they also take up space yeah but I think </joey>
<joey> you can you can make them pretty quickly </joey>
<joey> and I think maybe keeping glasses in a </joey>
<garnt> fridge will take a while I think that </garnt>
<garnt> you can this solution is that making a a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] ton of ice cubes is easy yeah and </connor>
<garnt> that keeping glasses cooled and stuff is </garnt>
<joey> complicated it just doesn't seem like </joey>
<joey> intuitive in any way yeah I agree I mean </joey>
<connor> I feel like it's probably something </connor>
<connor> that's just that was that started and </connor>
<connor> then they just kept doing yeah yeah they </connor>
<connor> haven't thought I don't know I also I </connor>
<garnt> don't know [ __ ] fridges are expensive </garnt>
<garnt> yep come on man what the [ __ ] come on </garnt>
<joey> to me this is just like the equivalent </joey>
<joey> of being like Oh I'm gonna make some ice </joey>
<connor> cubes so I'm gonna take some cold water </connor>
<connor> and then boil it wait till it cools down </connor>
<connor> and then turn it into ice cubes it's </connor>
<joey> like kind of it's like two steps in one </joey>
<connor> when you can just go straight to the one </connor>
<joey> step </joey>
<connor> yeah I guess [ __ ] together either way </connor>
<connor> man I'm not excited for beer in Thailand </connor>
<connor> that's for sure </connor>
<garnt> I'm gonna be like no Heist please </garnt>
<connor> how do I say no ice sorry how do I say </connor>
<connor> no ice most places in uh Thailand speak </connor>
<connor> English so oh okay all right especially </connor>
<connor> if like you're in Bangkok just be just </connor>
<connor> yeah just ask for no ice it's pretty </connor>
<garnt> well they give you a weird look if you </garnt>
<garnt> say no eyes no I think most tour like </garnt>
<garnt> most tourists go through this like </garnt>
<garnt> conundrum when I go to Thailand they </garnt>
<garnt> like why are they so stupid bro German </garnt>
<garnt> would [ __ ] drop dead dude </garnt>
<connor> it'd be like that you know the GIF of </connor>
<connor> Walter White falling to the ground yeah </connor>
<connor> when he's like with his mouth open it'd </connor>
<connor> be there Germans when they go to </connor>
<connor> Thailand and get offered a beer with ice </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<garnt> need ice with every glass of water I </garnt>
<connor> think so yeah I think he refuses to </connor>
<garnt> drink like water or is very picky at </garnt>
<joey> least we're gonna get him on we'll get </joey>
<garnt> them on yeah I can grill out more about </garnt>
<connor> this because I I felt like I felt </connor>
<joey> attacked you know is that an American </joey>
<joey> thing you think dude yeah they [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> love it because they love it remember </joey>
<joey> every single like uh restaurant or Diner </joey>
<joey> anything you go to you always get the </joey>
<connor> giant [ __ ] like two liter cup like </connor>
<connor> plastic cup with a straw </connor>
<joey> it's not the ice it's not the big ice </joey>
<connor> cubes either it's like cheese sliced ice </connor>
<connor> yeah that's that's that I sucks I kind </connor>
<connor> of like it no no one like the saddest </connor>
<connor> looking like the saddest looking thing </connor>
<connor> is with the shaved ice I'm I'm a I'm an </connor>
<connor> advocate of if it's like the shave like </connor>
<garnt> really small cubes it needs to be up to </garnt>
<garnt> like the brim otherwise like when when </garnt>
<garnt> you when you have like the uh when you </garnt>
<garnt> have a glass and it's just like a little </garnt>
<garnt> like one small layer of shaved ice yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that just it just looks so sad for me </garnt>
<connor> because I'm like that ice is doing </connor>
<garnt> nothing </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't use that ice because I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just if I like you know when you because </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the time you go to the soda </garnt>
<garnt> machine you do it and it's always that </garnt>
<garnt> shitty ice and you're like oh </garnt>
<garnt> you know I kind of wanted to like not </garnt>
<connor> have my drink be immediately watered </connor>
<connor> down so I'm just not gonna put it but I </connor>
<garnt> like crunching on it when you're </garnt>
<garnt> finished with them </garnt>
<garnt> that's nice </garnt>
<connor> you guys are the monkey brains on this </connor>
<garnt> one I I feel like I'm Giga brain like </garnt>
<connor> I'm like third eyeing this [ __ ] like no </connor>
<garnt> eyes to me please I don't know man how </garnt>
<connor> about tea how do you feel about you the </connor>
<garnt> tea bag like </garnt>
<connor> okay there's like there's like icy and </connor>
<garnt> there's hot tea how do you feel about </garnt>
<garnt> lukewarmty just look just like room </garnt>
<connor> temperature tea and you know I mean </connor>
<garnt> obviously it's a lukewarm tea is a tea </garnt>
<garnt> that has been left out yeah same with </garnt>
<garnt> coffee you know yeah you know it depends </garnt>
<garnt> on my mood I'd say 80 of the time I'll </garnt>
<garnt> just down it sorry said the time I'll </garnt>
<garnt> just count it because I'm like I'm not </garnt>
<garnt> excited about it because it's not even </garnt>
<connor> warm anymore like it's kind of room temp </connor>
<garnt> I'm like ah all right all right make </garnt>
<joey> another one that's that's someone who's </joey>
<connor> addicted to call it's like it's like I </connor>
<joey> will swallow my pride because I need </joey>
<connor> this in my voice tea that's right you </connor>
<connor> know that's what the British people </connor>
<connor> conquer the world about that's what they </connor>
<joey> struggle for her identity that's like I </joey>
<connor> can't throw away what they worked so </connor>
<garnt> hard for and ruined the world for do you </garnt>
<garnt> ever like reheat coffee or reheat tea if </garnt>
<connor> it's like going down no no you can't do </connor>
<garnt> that you don't have to do that I'm not </garnt>
<connor> allowed to do that I sometimes do it </connor>
<garnt> sometimes </garnt>
<connor> sometimes just like just like just like </connor>
<connor> 20 seconds in the microwave </connor>
<connor> that hurts to hear that hurts to hear </connor>
<connor> it's weird because sometimes I'm okay </connor>
<connor> with doing that with coffee but I just </connor>
<garnt> refused to with my tea I don't know why </garnt>
<garnt> weird mental thing yeah coffee it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't work </garnt>
<garnt> coffee doesn't work no tea it works </garnt>
<connor> coffee doesn't I don't like doing it </connor>
<connor> with tears at the Forbidden technology I </connor>
<joey> I think it works with coffee fine </joey>
<connor> I mean I don't let it get to that point </connor>
<connor> Italians are like Mamma Mia a microwave </connor>
<joey> and my coffee over here </joey>
<joey> it's like I don't know </joey>
<joey> I literally took me five minutes to </joey>
<connor> process I was like there's no way he </connor>
<joey> said that that's why it took me so long </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] to be fair 99 times out of </joey>
<joey> 100 I don't let it get to that point I'm </joey>
<joey> drinking that [ __ ] while it's hot right </joey>
<joey> but sometimes you get a little bit busy </joey>
<joey> you know you might you know you might </joey>
<connor> have to go out for a little bit commit </connor>
<connor> to the iced coffee you put some [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> high you put some [ __ ] ice cubes in </connor>
<connor> it you don't [ __ ] try and turn it </connor>
<connor> back </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like climate change we've </connor>
<connor> gone too far we can't we should just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] commit let's just go full </connor>
<joey> hellscape no I look I look at it I pick </joey>
<joey> it up and I feel it's lukewarming I'm </joey>
<joey> like I can fix you let's just shove you </joey>

<connor> it's like barely America it's like a </connor>
<garnt> different American yeah we can now say </garnt>
<connor> that now that we've been I I know I've </connor>
<connor> been to a lot of States guys </connor>

<connor> went for a week uh mainly went out to </connor>
<connor> watch Chris box which Chris did very </connor>
<garnt> well yeah we're gonna get him on uh </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I'm proud of my boy oh almost </garnt>
<garnt> throwing the chess part of the part of </garnt>
<connor> it no no no he he somehow threw more in </connor>
<garnt> the chest than boxing yeah I think uh </garnt>
<garnt> like like literally like the throwing of </garnt>
<connor> the punches didn't happen nearly as much </connor>
<garnt> as the throwing of the chest yeah um he </garnt>
<connor> had like was it Checkmate in two and </connor>
<connor> then he ended up just like giving away </connor>
<connor> his Queen I was like yeah </connor>
<connor> how do you do so obviously </connor>
<connor> in TV yeah </connor>
<connor> see if you don't know </connor>
<connor> um yeah uh Chris did chess boxing a lot </connor>
<connor> of check boxing event we've talked about </connor>
<connor> a bunch you all probably know but if you </connor>
<connor> didn't know it was just yeah because </connor>
<connor> it's boxing someone in between that he </connor>
<connor> had chess and he'd been training about </connor>
<garnt> this for months and we were all very </garnt>
<garnt> excited for it and I said to Ludwig and </garnt>
<garnt> Chris was like Hey if you if I get front </garnt>

<connor> was like it felt like when I said bye </connor>
<connor> the anime ending was about to play like </connor>
<connor> that's uh so that was fun </connor>
<connor> um and then uh yeah I stayed at Ludwig's </connor>
<garnt> house as well that was good uh although </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many noises his cats and dogs </garnt>
<connor> kept moving around and I'm not used to </connor>
<garnt> sleeping with them right so they would </garnt>
<connor> keep like trying to scratch on the door </connor>
<connor> or come in and it was it was really </connor>
<connor> sweet it was nice it was nice yeah I I </connor>
<joey> his cat is so goddamn cute have you seen </joey>
<joey> Coots yeah yeah the tiny white one right </joey>
<garnt> yeah like every time I see a pet I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm like that's so cute but also </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] you because I want to piss yeah so </garnt>
<connor> goddamn bad here man I I couldn't help </connor>
<connor> myself but anyway it was uh Chris came </connor>
<connor> to LA and I was really excited to see </connor>
<connor> what Chris thought about La yeah and it </connor>
<connor> was pretty much what I thought I let </connor>
<connor> Chris come and tell his thoughts about </connor>
<garnt> La I'm sure he'll go off on one what was </garnt>
<garnt> it like behind the scenes of the chess </garnt>
<connor> boxing event yeah so it was uh it was </connor>
<connor> interesting because obviously I was um I </connor>
<connor> was staying at Ludwig's house a lot of </connor>
<connor> the time I was kind of getting just I </connor>
<connor> was just tagging along to a lot of stuff </connor>
<connor> whilst I was going to do other stuff and </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> um it seemed like it was kind of all </connor>
<connor> working nicely and then Ludwig had to </connor>
<connor> just go from A to B and whatever and so </connor>
<connor> I was kind of just like hi yeah I'm here </connor>
<connor> I'll turn up </connor>
<connor> um and it didn't really start to get </connor>
<connor> crazy until the weigh-in yeah and that </connor>
<connor> was that was kind of intense because you </connor>
<connor> just turn up to this giant 5 000 person </connor>
<connor> stadium and there's just insane amounts </connor>
<connor> of stuff and you're like God damn like </connor>
<connor> this is all being coordinated by well a </connor>
<connor> streamer essentially like his team his </connor>
<connor> team's amazing </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> but it was it was just absurd seeing all </connor>
<connor> that equipment all that gear and it </connor>
<connor> really felt like oh [ __ ] like I'm I'm </connor>
<connor> like kind of watching like a like a </connor>
<connor> serious kind of broadcast almost like </connor>
<connor> this is I can't imagine it would look </connor>
<connor> that different </connor>
<connor> um and the weigh-in was fun </connor>
<connor> um and oh before that as well I had the </connor>
<garnt> interviews where they I don't know you </garnt>
<garnt> saw the videos yeah so they had two </garnt>
<connor> hotel rooms adjacent to each other and </connor>
<connor> they were both really [ __ ] tiny so </connor>
<connor> they did the interviews in the hallway </connor>
<connor> of a hotel room and I was sitting in the </connor>
<connor> room next door just talking to like </connor>
<connor> Ludwig or whoever was there just </connor>
<connor> chatting away while they were getting </connor>
<connor> interviewed and then they would </connor>
<connor> constantly go like can you guys shut up </connor>
<connor> in there we can hear you really easily </connor>
<connor> so they did the interviews I saw Chris </connor>
<connor> uh said hi to him like all right you </connor>
<connor> excited yeah the weigh-in everyone kind </connor>
<connor> of uh was you could tell that a lot of </connor>
<connor> the fighters were like not really </connor>
<connor> prepared to do like the whole I don't </connor>
<connor> know how to look serious or scary yeah </connor>
<connor> so kind of like oh </connor>
<connor> but it was really interesting uh some of </connor>
<connor> them you could tell they were like yeah </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna put on a show I'm gonna do it </connor>
<connor> but yeah dude the the ad was so kind of </connor>
<connor> like it was like kind of faux tense like </connor>
<connor> everyone was kind of like we're all </connor>
<connor> friends right we're gonna punch you the </connor>
<garnt> next time yeah yeah and uh it was just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of interesting seeing everyone kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like slowly interact with their </garnt>
<garnt> groups and kind of not talk and then </garnt>
<garnt> some people were like not talking to </garnt>
<garnt> other people because they were gonna </garnt>
<garnt> fight them and like uh I distinctly </garnt>
<connor> remember that </connor>
<connor> Chris said hi to his opponent yeah and </connor>
<connor> uh Chris's coach is insane uh if you </connor>
<connor> haven't seen any Clips he's like is </connor>
<garnt> there's a video of him basically beating </garnt>
<garnt> up a seven foot Korean man and he's like </garnt>
<garnt> five ten right and he beats him in </garnt>
<connor> kickboxing like a giant seven foot man </connor>
<garnt> right um it's an insane clip I'm Sean </garnt>
<garnt> can play a clip right now it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] insane this man's a machine yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like full-on like proper </garnt>
<garnt> fighter kind of mindset and Chris is </garnt>
<garnt> Chris right so uh Chris is talking to </garnt>
<garnt> his opponent and then </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just standing there watching this </garnt>
<garnt> and Nick goes up to Chris he's like all </garnt>
<garnt> right Chris now that was the fight no </garnt>
<garnt> talking to him now you've got to focus </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna punch that guy don't be </garnt>
<garnt> friendly with him </garnt>
<connor> you can see Christian like oh it was </connor>
<connor> just weird seeing him like go like he's </connor>
<garnt> like you're gonna kill him you can't </garnt>
<connor> talk to him </connor>
<connor> um but that was the first time we got to </connor>
<garnt> see like Chris's uh opponent really show </garnt>
<garnt> up yeah because the point was scary oh </garnt>
<garnt> he was pretty </garnt>
<garnt> he's a big guy so he wasn't he isn't </garnt>
<garnt> like very well trained in boxing he's </garnt>
<garnt> done a lot of other martial arts and you </garnt>
<connor> can tell the guy's just been generally </connor>
<connor> fit yeah his whole life because you look </connor>
<connor> at a guy like that's the man that's </connor>
<connor> that's the body of a man who has been </connor>
<garnt> exercising for a long time </garnt>
<connor> it's the same you can see like the </connor>
<connor> twitch chat as a I wish I could have </connor>
<connor> seen the twitch chat I was like I was </connor>
<connor> like dying laughing so he's not seeing </connor>
<garnt> like a switcher because like you know </garnt>
<garnt> Chris has Chris has a lot of fans </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's cheering for Chris yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> his opponent comes on and everything </garnt>
<garnt> right it was just like it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> a collectively your rip </garnt>
<connor> oh [ __ ] well can you see this man's </connor>
<connor> packs and this man's back muscles you're </connor>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] and then you realize you're </connor>
<connor> like oh okay like when you when you see </connor>
<joey> them both we saw them both like stand up </joey>
<joey> you're like oh so Chris had been </joey>
<joey> training six months just to get like </joey>
<joey> halfway to where this guy was before he </joey>
<joey> even started yeah it's like that's that </joey>
<joey> we're about to witness some murder right </joey>
<joey> so that's where it was like kind of it's </joey>
<connor> having a lot of natural Fitness helps so </connor>
<connor> much Chris was and Chris was just trying </connor>
<connor> to get rid of his like excess weight </connor>
<connor> yeah and the way it was like oh this guy </connor>
<garnt> beats Christian length uh an arm arm uh </garnt>
<garnt> wingspan uh in height in weight uh Chris </garnt>
<garnt> only beats him in age </garnt>
<garnt> so maybe that has something I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> um and so obviously uh you know Chris </garnt>
<garnt> Chris didn't really seem that nervous </garnt>
<garnt> though Chris seemed pretty confident </garnt>
<garnt> about it I think Chris felt like he had </garnt>
<garnt> maybe because uh he'd seen the clip of </garnt>
<garnt> his opponent getting knocked out like a </garnt>
<connor> week earlier right right his opponent </connor>
<connor> got knocked out in one punch a week </connor>
<connor> earlier right </connor>
<connor> um and I'm sure Madonna could play a bit </connor>
<connor> of that </connor>
<connor> um so you know I think it was like a bit </connor>
<connor> worried but also everyone's kind of like </connor>
<connor> well you know maybe maybe Chris can do </connor>
<connor> well yeah how is he in the dressing room </connor>
<connor> beforehand </connor>
<connor> just kind of Chris just sitting there I </connor>
<connor> think he was trying to just focus he </connor>
<connor> wasn't really like talking much he was </connor>
<connor> just kind of like doing it and then I I </connor>
<connor> went off to go and go to my seat and </connor>
<joey> watch what were you doing the thing that </joey>
<joey> Chris does when he's concentrating where </joey>
<joey> he does the mouth thing </joey>
<connor> you said that </connor>
<garnt> I said in a video so so um yeah the day </garnt>
<connor> of </connor>
<connor> um so I I knew obviously all the stuff </connor>
<connor> that was going to happen I knew that the </connor>
<connor> table was going to come from the sky and </connor>
<connor> I knew that uh Ludwig was gonna slap uh </connor>
<connor> have a slap match with xqc at the end </connor>
<connor> right so the day off it's like 10 A.M </connor>
<garnt> and um like months months prior to this </garnt>
<garnt> I told Ludwig I was like hey if you ever </garnt>
<garnt> need anything you want me to get slapped </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever I'll do it back up so that </garnt>
<garnt> morning of the Box saying it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like 9am we're going over to go and pick </garnt>
<garnt> up xqc and uh yeah he's just not there </garnt>
<garnt> just straight up not into this house </garnt>
<garnt> geez all right fine I'll just I'll just </garnt>
<joey> call doesn't pick up his phone and I'm </joey>
<joey> like is that normal he's like yeah </joey>
<joey> that's normal that's normal I'm like wow </joey>
<joey> okay so so then we just drive to the </joey>
<joey> venue and just kind of he's like yeah </joey>
<joey> I'm sure I'm sure he'll uh I'm sure </joey>
<joey> he'll respond because you know he's </joey>
<garnt> going on at like 7 P.M yeah so he's got </garnt>
<joey> from like 10 till 7 P.M to like all day </joey>
<garnt> yeah all day uh and so we get to the </garnt>
<garnt> venue </garnt>
<garnt> I get there very early just kind of </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm there from like 11 the event </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't start till four so I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> looking around just doing stuff getting </garnt>
<garnt> lunch talking to people </garnt>
<connor> um and then yeah around 3 P.M is when it </connor>
<connor> kind of starts to get like all right </connor>
<connor> okay a bit nervous yeah everyone starts </connor>
<connor> to get a little bit more tense because </connor>
<connor> everyone realize all right they're gonna </connor>
<connor> have to actually like go on and put on a </connor>
<connor> fight and you know Chris was just </connor>
<connor> getting ready Nick was doing up his like </connor>
<connor> uh the things that go on your arm yeah </connor>
<connor> what are they called and then I'm like </connor>
<connor> all right Chris I'm gonna go get to my </connor>
<connor> seat good luck and I'll I'll come meet </connor>
<connor> you before we uh do the walk-in </connor>
<connor> and uh so I'm sitting I got like front </connor>
<garnt> row tickets it's [ __ ] awesome the </garnt>
<garnt> boxing's great you can see everything I </garnt>
<garnt> can't see any of the chests though I </garnt>
<garnt> can't see it from where I'm sitting and </garnt>
<garnt> the screen is like up here right </garnt>
<garnt> directly up and every time uh they went </garnt>
<connor> to play chess initially it was broken </connor>
<connor> like the board was yeah yeah right as </connor>
<connor> you saw on the live stream so it was </connor>
<connor> kind of like oh all right so I guess </connor>
<connor> we'll just kind of we're kind of like </connor>
<connor> just quiet for like two minutes in the </connor>
<connor> boxing side we're like yeah it's so good </connor>
<connor> front row tickets are amazing for boxing </connor>
<connor> because you you see and hear all the </connor>
<garnt> punches really clearly and dude you can </garnt>
<garnt> see their face when they're like </garnt>
<garnt> struggling as well it's it's it's a </garnt>
<connor> pretty [ __ ] fun experience as I say </connor>
<garnt> for my sadistic standpoint </garnt>
<garnt> so fun look at these look at these </garnt>
<connor> peasants yeah I know exactly exactly and </connor>
<connor> like the smashboxing was pretty fun I </connor>
<connor> think it all went pretty well yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> um and then yeah uh I went to go and do </connor>
<connor> the walking thing for Chris uh I I </connor>
<connor> basically uh I told Chris before I was </connor>
<connor> like yeah you should um you should do </connor>
<connor> something when you go out you should do </connor>
<connor> like some funny a funny bit or something </connor>
<connor> he was like what why I was like well </connor>
<connor> because you know it's like a show like </connor>
<connor> put on a show why not you know because </connor>
<connor> uh it'll be clipped everywhere there'll </connor>
<connor> be a lot of people watching and he's </connor>
<connor> like oh okay so he comes back a day </connor>
<connor> later he's like I've got an idea we're </connor>
<connor> gonna throw candy into the crowd and I </connor>
<garnt> was like why </garnt>
<garnt> what reason are we doing this so he was </garnt>
<garnt> like oh it's Christmas in it I was like </garnt>
<garnt> all right fine it's your walk out let's </garnt>
<garnt> do it so we go out we have these candy </garnt>
<garnt> buckets and I'm just trying to Hype him </garnt>
<garnt> up and hype the crowd up right and </garnt>
<garnt> whatever we walk out and that was really </garnt>
<garnt> fun and I just immediately go to my seat </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm watching him and man it was </garnt>
<garnt> intense it was it was intense watching </garnt>
<garnt> Chris I'm sure you you guys watching </garnt>
<garnt> from Amazon oh yeah I was watching from </garnt>
<garnt> home yeah yeah it was um the boxing </garnt>
<garnt> started and it looked like Chris was not </garnt>
<garnt> doing great so I think it was like oh oh </garnt>
<garnt> no oh no and then the chess happened </garnt>
<connor> then Chris started winning and we're </connor>
<connor> like oh my God yes Chris is crushing it </connor>
<connor> which is literally about to win and then </connor>
<connor> the boxing happened again we're like all </connor>
<connor> right just Chris just survive and Chris </connor>
<connor> wasn't really getting in many punches </connor>
<connor> right because she's kind of like dodging </connor>
<garnt> and just I I it felt like watching like </garnt>
<connor> you know some take on a Dark Souls boss </connor>
<connor> yeah he was just like dodging like he </connor>
<garnt> was just like frames </garnt>
<garnt> literally he was just like how many </garnt>
<garnt> iframes can I get out of this I'm </garnt>
<garnt> I'm seeing him like trying to win at the </garnt>
<connor> chest yeah and there's definitely like </connor>
<garnt> it seemed like a he's way more </garnt>
<garnt> experienced at least in some form of </garnt>
<garnt> Combat Sports right yeah you can tell </garnt>
<garnt> because he's constantly going in he </garnt>
<garnt> knows his reach and he's playing with it </garnt>
<garnt> whereas Chris is a bit more defensive </garnt>
<garnt> you're kind of just trying to survive </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he's spamming the roll buttons uh </garnt>
<garnt> and then yeah he threw massively yeah in </garnt>
<garnt> chess yeah and it was like oh okay well </garnt>
<garnt> I guess he's lost cause he's not going </garnt>
<garnt> to beat him in boxing yeah and he's not </garnt>
<garnt> going to beat him in chess now but </garnt>
<connor> somehow his opponent was even [ __ ] at </connor>
<connor> chess so it all worked out and Chris won </connor>
<connor> in the end but it was intense it was </connor>
<connor> like 40 minutes long I was like on the </connor>
<connor> edge of my seat the entire time oh no so </connor>
<garnt> same here like watching that [ __ ] live I </garnt>
<connor> was just like seeing like Chris kind of </connor>
<garnt> like clutch at the end with the chair so </garnt>
<connor> he's almost [ __ ] screaming yeah it </connor>
<connor> was hype it was hype I think Chris was a </connor>
<connor> bit disappointed that he didn't do </connor>
<connor> better in boxing I'm sure again he'll </connor>
<joey> he'll talk about all this stuff when he </joey>

<garnt> please don't try and slap me too hard uh </garnt>
<garnt> I I have a blood thing so just don't try </garnt>
<garnt> and kill me yeah and so he was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> okay uh just slap me as hard as you want </garnt>
<garnt> uh and I'll reciprocate and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> okay cool cool that works that works </garnt>
<garnt> nicely </garnt>
<garnt> um and then I'm sitting there and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> realizing I'm like wait how the [ __ ] am </garnt>
<garnt> I going up like how is any of this </garnt>
<garnt> working like I don't understand how any </garnt>
<garnt> of this is gonna happen like I'm sitting </garnt>
<garnt> here like the tech guys don't know I'm </garnt>
<garnt> going up so like there's no way like </garnt>
<garnt> there's no Graphics or anything like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I'm just sitting there thinking </garnt>
<garnt> like what the [ __ ] how does this gonna </garnt>
<garnt> work like what do I do what do I like </garnt>
<garnt> what do I even like do I do a bit do I </garnt>
<garnt> what do I do again it's two hours and </garnt>
<garnt> I've been drinking a bunch of beers </garnt>
<garnt> before this was free yeah and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah I wanna I wanna drink beer and </garnt>
<garnt> watch Boxing and so I was like oh [ __ ] I </garnt>
<garnt> guess I should stop drinking beer so I </garnt>
<garnt> stopped drinking the beer but then I </garnt>
<garnt> found that later on after the fight the </garnt>
<garnt> Ludwig started drinking shots before </garnt>
<garnt> because he wanted to get ready for it I </garnt>
<garnt> was like [ __ ] I should have kept </garnt>
<garnt> drinking so like 30 minutes before I'm </garnt>
<garnt> about to go up because because the </garnt>
<garnt> fights could either be five minutes or </garnt>
<garnt> 30 right yeah so I was like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> myself I'm like [ __ ] I don't know like </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm going up because the toast </garnt>
<garnt> versus Point grow match started and it </garnt>
<garnt> looked like Tosh was about to lose </garnt>
<garnt> immediately and so I was like [ __ ] I'm </garnt>
<garnt> about to go out so I still get really </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] nervous and uh one of logic's </garnt>
<garnt> Team comes to me and I'm like I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> uh yeah so like what how is this working </garnt>
<garnt> like what the [ __ ] do I do and they were </garnt>
<connor> like uh well we'll figure it out in a </connor>
<connor> sec so the fight ends </connor>
<connor> before the fight ends Lotto comes over </connor>
<connor> and he's like okay this is what we're </connor>
<connor> gonna do we're gonna we're gonna throw </connor>
<connor> it to you and you're gonna come in and </connor>
<connor> do whatever you want do whatever I want </connor>
<connor> what do you mean like I'm like give me a </connor>
<connor> roll do I beat am I the bad guy the good </connor>
<connor> guy </connor>
<garnt> oh and he was like oh just whatever </garnt>
<connor> feels right I'm like oh my God okay fine </connor>
<garnt> so then yeah I'm sitting there and then </garnt>
<garnt> watching it and I didn't know when they </garnt>
<connor> were gonna queue right so I'm just kind </connor>
<connor> of like all right waiting waiting and </connor>
<connor> they go is there anyone in the audience </connor>
<connor> who wants to slap Ludwig and I'm like oh </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] I guess I'll put my hand up there's </garnt>
<garnt> this great shot yeah I'll just you just </garnt>
<garnt> like casually like yeah yes my time </garnt>
<garnt> finally my time has come so yeah I </garnt>
<connor> thought to myself I was like I want to </connor>
<connor> make it look as like Suave and Casual as </connor>
<connor> possible so that when I go up it looks </connor>
<connor> really like [ __ ] extra and over the </connor>
<connor> top so I'm just sat there like yeah okay </connor>
<connor> I guess I was laughing because I can and </connor>
<connor> then yeah it really surreal Herring </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] German girl was that Sea Dog Jim </garnt>
<garnt> is so [ __ ] cool man Jim is such a </garnt>
<garnt> nice guy seems like such a cool dude and </garnt>
<garnt> uh yeah then going up and I was like all </garnt>
<garnt> right whatever it's just all autopilot </garnt>
<connor> I'll just figure it out we'll just do it </connor>
<connor> and uh I hope I did a good job I don't </connor>
<connor> know maybe the audience uh I saw a lot </connor>
<connor> of nice comments so I'm hoping that I </connor>
<connor> did it went really well yeah and it was </connor>
<connor> a good match uh we slapped each other </connor>
<connor> everyone everyone kept saying that we </connor>
<garnt> were faking our slaps we were too Fair </garnt>
<garnt> the last two slabs were pretty hard the </garnt>
<garnt> first two were like yeah they were they </garnt>
<garnt> were holding back yeah so we also didn't </garnt>
<connor> I was at the mindset of like I'm not </connor>
<connor> actually trying to injure him I don't </connor>
<connor> actually want to hurt him like I just </connor>
<connor> want to make it look hard yeah without </connor>
<connor> actually injuring him yeah I did give </connor>
<connor> him a little bit of a bruise on the last </connor>
<connor> lap that I've gotten pretty good with uh </connor>
<connor> he did ask me to go a lot harder so I </connor>
<connor> did but I still didn't do like fully 100 </connor>
<connor> but also I don't know I feel like that </connor>
<joey> you don't need that that's a bit </joey>
<joey> excessive feeling is that really gonna </joey>
<connor> add to anything if I give him a </connor>
<garnt> concussion </garnt>
<joey> I don't think it needed to happen but I </joey>
<joey> think it all worked out and I I got my </joey>
<connor> belt I didn't choke uh I think uh it was </connor>
<garnt> it was uh you know he definitely wanted </garnt>
<garnt> to get the time the clock closer yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> at some point so you wanted to get it </garnt>
<garnt> like I think very close he's a master at </garnt>
<garnt> stalling for Content yeah um but I think </garnt>
<garnt> he accidentally </garnt>
<garnt> I think he actually tried to win yeah he </garnt>
<connor> might he might say he threw for Conte I </connor>
<connor> think he actually tried to win because </connor>
<connor> if you watch back you can see him trying </connor>
<connor> to press the clock again uh he just </connor>
<connor> didn't press it in time but then also we </connor>
<connor> also broke so many rules like I didn't I </connor>
<connor> totally forgot you're not allowed to </connor>
<garnt> move a chess piece and then press the </garnt>
<garnt> clock with the other hand </garnt>
<garnt> oh but then also half of these matches </garnt>
<connor> no one [ __ ] played the chess </connor>
<garnt> correctly anyway so some people just </garnt>
<garnt> like move to peace and didn't didn't </garnt>
<garnt> even yes the clock yeah Chris's opponent </garnt>
<connor> did it a few times yeah </connor>
<connor> um so I was like yeah got it got my dub </connor>
<connor> got the uh got the belt oh now I was a </connor>
<connor> happy boy dude man I I don't know if you </connor>
<connor> you've had this before but whenever you </connor>
<connor> have like a massive serotonin rush like </connor>
<connor> the next day you're like [ __ ] this is </connor>
<connor> I'm so sad yeah just I was just sad the </connor>
<connor> next day I was like [ __ ] even though I </connor>
<connor> was having like a fun time we were just </connor>
<connor> I was just hanging out with my friends I </connor>
<connor> was just like damn I'm just sad I think </connor>
<connor> the serotonin come down was like really </connor>
<connor> high yeah I get that uh and that was I </connor>
<garnt> was like oh man this sucks and then the </garnt>
<garnt> next day we uh flew to San Francisco uh </garnt>
<garnt> we did a sushi stream where we did uh </garnt>
<garnt> learn sushi with a sushi Master yeah </garnt>
<connor> Chef right a Michelin star Sushi yeah </connor>
<garnt> and uh he was very funny he was great it </garnt>
<garnt> was a really fun stream check it out if </garnt>
<connor> you haven't uh we basically just tried </connor>
<garnt> to prepare Sushi and I was not good </garnt>
<garnt> I mean we knew you weren't good at </garnt>
<garnt> cooking anyway yeah she's hard man I </garnt>
<garnt> know it looks easy they're just kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like fish there you go dude that's just </garnt>
<garnt> hard yeah this man this man was cutting </garnt>
<connor> up cucumbers like it was like like arts </connor>
<connor> and crafts insane insane yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> almost it's almost like sushi chefs have </garnt>
<garnt> to go through years okay to get really </garnt>
<connor> really good at Sushi yeah yeah that's </connor>
<connor> crazy that's crazy dude this man turned </connor>
<connor> a cucumber into a Christmas tree </connor>
<connor> isn't that insane yeah I'm trying to </connor>
<joey> imagine how yeah yeah I know right </joey>
<connor> exactly I I didn't know that too until </connor>
<joey> they showed me did he do it in like the </joey>
<joey> one Fell Swoop you probably hit him you </joey>
<joey> probably killed him he was like and then </joey>
<joey> he did like an accordion with the </joey>
<connor> Cucumber </connor>
<connor> I tried I copied exactly what he did and </connor>
<connor> it just didn't work it just fell apart </connor>
<connor> he just didn't even do anything and I </connor>
<connor> was like what the [ __ ] how did he do </connor>
<garnt> that so I copied him yeah it's there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's like some magic especially like </garnt>
<garnt> with some of the cutting techniques I've </garnt>
<garnt> seen where you just see like Chef's Lich </garnt>
<garnt> it's literally literally like real life </garnt>
<connor> choker gecko where she's like yeah it's </connor>
<connor> what he did that's what he did I copied </connor>
<connor> that it didn't work </connor>
<connor> so I realized I'm just not meant to be a </connor>
<joey> chef but then copied that now I have </joey>
<connor> three listings copy that I just have </connor>
<connor> half a cucumber and then yeah uh I flew </connor>
<connor> back we flew to San Francisco flew back </connor>
<garnt> the same day and the next day I flew </garnt>
<garnt> back to Japan and uh man yeah it was </garnt>
<garnt> literally like one week of just </garnt>
<garnt> back-to-back stuff and it was it was </garnt>
<connor> pretty fun I mean I got so much work </connor>
<connor> done it was great I I like it when I can </connor>
<connor> do a trip like that where I just go away </connor>
<connor> for a week it's so much work done come </connor>
<connor> back and done like I did the stream as </connor>
<connor> well where I reviewed cereal with Chris </connor>
<connor> and Ludwig yeah yeah and that was a lot </connor>
<connor> of fun </connor>
<connor> um but yeah it was it was just great I </connor>
<connor> mean getting it's really satisfying </connor>
<connor> planning out a trip like that and just </connor>
<connor> again back and then you're like oh nice </connor>
<connor> all right that was like productive did </connor>
<garnt> you help Chris uh like practice that </garnt>
<garnt> Chess at all yeah I'm wondering like how </garnt>
<connor> much he did practice that chess I helped </connor>
<connor> him practice a tiny bit mainly because </connor>
<joey> we never really ended up just we just </joey>
<joey> didn't do it um he knew how to play </joey>
<connor> beforehand though right yeah he knew how </connor>
<connor> to play he was okay </connor>
<connor> um I think </connor>
<connor> yeah he said he was 800 I don't I think </connor>
<connor> that's cap </connor>
<garnt> um he wouldn't tell me he's rating </garnt>
<garnt> um I I I think he said he was 800 </garnt>
<joey> because that's like the default rating I </joey>
<joey> think so it's like yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> guys I'm 800. </garnt>
<garnt> 650 600 maybe </garnt>
<garnt> um because he was like I'm gonna do the </garnt>
<connor> queen scan bit </connor>
<connor> he wanted to do the Queen's Campbell </connor>
<connor> okay like which is a chess opening uh </connor>
<connor> and before I was kind of like I was like </connor>
<connor> well I mean I mean I guess it's fine </connor>
<connor> like I I told him I was like I would </connor>
<connor> have just done the classic the E4 yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah just a [ __ ] moving like it's </connor>
<connor> easy you're white he was playing white </connor>
<connor> as well right so I was like you could </connor>
<connor> just play that but I was like honestly </connor>
<connor> you've been playing this entire time </connor>
<connor> with Queen's Gambit me telling you to </connor>
<connor> swap it now is not going to do you any </connor>
<garnt> favors just do it just don't blunder </garnt>
<garnt> your queen and he's like and then he </garnt>
<garnt> kept saying it he kept saying the days </garnt>
<garnt> leading before as long as I just jump </garnt>
<garnt> under the queen I'm happy </garnt>
<connor> that's what he kept saying I kept saying </connor>
<garnt> as long as I don't blunder the queen I </garnt>
<garnt> could literally see how tilted he was </garnt>
<connor> after he blundered that for you yeah </connor>
<garnt> there's a there was a thing that wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> picked up on the cameras but after he </garnt>
<garnt> did that the round like when the thing </garnt>
<connor> ding went and it was next to boxing he </connor>
<connor> stood up looked at me and did this </connor>
<connor> and I was I was like this </connor>
<garnt> yeah it was yeah I mean made a more </garnt>
<garnt> dramatic run yeah did a full content </garnt>
<connor> you know I I knew that his opponent was </connor>
<connor> terrible at chess so I was like honestly </connor>
<connor> don't worry about it just play yeah how </connor>
<connor> bad could it go and then it nearly went </connor>
<connor> extremely badly and then he literally </connor>
<connor> let his opponent promote to a queen but </connor>
<garnt> apparently he didn't even know that was </garnt>
<garnt> a thing </garnt>
<connor> so he was one one move away so in chess </connor>
<connor> if you move the pawn all the way to the </connor>
<connor> end of the board you can get a queen </connor>
<garnt> yeah and somehow Chris had thrown his </garnt>
<garnt> Queen and then allowed him to get his </garnt>
<garnt> Pawn One move away from promoting with </garnt>
<garnt> nothing defending it and again I think </garnt>
<garnt> they both missed that and they both </garnt>
<connor> missed it yeah and he he was one move </connor>
<connor> away at any point he could just got </connor>
<connor> another queen and it probably would have </connor>
<connor> just ended the game </connor>
<connor> um he just didn't do it yeah and then </connor>
<connor> later someone had said that apparently </connor>
<connor> he just didn't know that was a thing oh </connor>
<connor> my God so Chris Chris is fighting a man </connor>
<connor> who is like a pro in boxing and a </connor>
<garnt> toddler in chess so luckily it worked </garnt>
<garnt> out for him geez yeah it was like a </garnt>
<connor> really really impressive the event was </connor>
<connor> insane the event was insane yeah it was </connor>
<connor> it's like considering how many moving </connor>
<connor> Parts like I have to like go down for </connor>
<garnt> that kind of event to happen and he was </garnt>
<garnt> like talking about it for like ages as </garnt>
<connor> well dude just seeing all the staff </connor>
<connor> there I was like my God this is so </connor>
<connor> stressful but he has like a he has like </connor>
<connor> a team of I think 50 employees so you've </connor>
<connor> got a really good amount of people </connor>
<connor> working on the stuff and you know he's </connor>
<connor> not always there like on the floor be </connor>
<connor> like you do this it's like it's just </connor>
<connor> like you know he works with his team and </connor>
<connor> yeah his team's great yeah and they're </connor>
<garnt> so [ __ ] cool all of them are so nice </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just like going to seeing like Live </garnt>
<connor> Events like that going to [ __ ] like Moga </connor>
<connor> money live and also you know tourism I'm </connor>
<garnt> like [ __ ] live live things a lot of </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] fun you know yeah yeah that's </connor>
<connor> why I really want to start doing some as </connor>
<connor> well and do some more fun live stuff </connor>
<garnt> maybe this year hopefully things first </garnt>
<garnt> there's just something about having that </garnt>
<connor> audience energy in front of you that </connor>
<garnt> especially after the pandemic I've just </garnt>
<garnt> like sorely sorely missed as well yeah I </garnt>
<connor> think after the tour as well it made me </connor>
<garnt> think like damn I really want to figure </garnt>
<garnt> out a way to do some live audience stuff </garnt>
<connor> even if that means me going to America </connor>
<garnt> for like a week to do something well </garnt>
<garnt> that's serotonin Rush man it's so good </garnt>
<connor> there's something different man it's </connor>
<connor> just like it's like you know I love </connor>
<connor> streaming a lot but I love I love the </connor>
<connor> idea of having these big things you that </connor>
<connor> you work towards yeah um and um yeah I'm </connor>
<connor> really excited I really want to do some </connor>
<connor> stuff uh keep press peeled might be some </connor>
<connor> stuff coming who knows next year yeah </connor>
<connor> we'll see we'll see </connor>
<connor> and it's just great like every time I go </connor>
<connor> out to LA </connor>
<joey> um you know I think La is a is an </joey>
<joey> interesting City this is the nicest way </joey>
<joey> I could say it it's terrible it's a </joey>
<joey> terrible it's a terrible City but every </joey>
<garnt> time I go there I always get so inspired </garnt>
<joey> seeing wow like the Creator scene is </joey>
<garnt> over there how like how hard and crazy </garnt>
<joey> people are working out there </joey>
<joey> um you know obviously there's some </joey>
<garnt> there's some characters that's that you </garnt>
<garnt> know it sucks and a lot of people are </garnt>
<garnt> not nice did you ever find out where xqc </garnt>
<garnt> was uh no I have no idea okay we just </garnt>
<garnt> didn't show up okay I think he I think </garnt>
<garnt> he replied actually to Ludwig at like </garnt>
<garnt> eight or nine PM being like sorry I just </garnt>
<garnt> woke up </garnt>
<garnt> I think I think I don't know something </garnt>
<connor> like that so that was that man is on his </connor>
<connor> own time zone yeah yeah it's what it is </connor>
<connor> man when you're the biggest you can you </connor>
<connor> can just not turn up to stuff I guess </connor>
<connor> yeah no one cares </connor>
<connor> um uh yeah I I just every time I go </connor>
<connor> there I get so inspired and like seeing </connor>
<connor> like seeing a lottery just do his thing </connor>
<connor> man he's such a sober professional and </connor>
<connor> the stuff that they're doing and pushing </connor>
<garnt> live streaming forward is like oh my God </garnt>
<garnt> that's just badass yeah and they're like </garnt>
<garnt> how can you see that stuff and not be </garnt>
<connor> like inspired to want to better your own </connor>
<garnt> stuff and push it further yeah it's kind </garnt>
<connor> of like every time I do go to La for </connor>
<connor> Anime Expo or whatever and like you get </connor>
<connor> to talk to a lot of these other creators </connor>
<connor> it does like light a fire on you oh for </connor>
<connor> sure for sure yeah and then you come </connor>
<garnt> back to Japan you're like like what can </garnt>
<connor> I do here so yeah we can't do anything </connor>
<connor> yeah which is why I'm like man we should </connor>
<garnt> just make our own we should do it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because like just seeing some of like </garnt>
<garnt> the ideas and some of the [ __ ] they can </garnt>
<connor> get away with over there just kind of </connor>
<connor> like oh I wish I could do this in Japan </connor>
<connor> as well right yeah yeah because it's </connor>
<connor> just like the infrastructure is then </connor>
<connor> it's just a lot </connor>
<garnt> easier just to you know get a be able to </garnt>
<garnt> get a camera and just be able to like do </garnt>
<garnt> exciting things it's uh you know I have </garnt>
<connor> a lot of problems with um La as as we've </connor>
<connor> all like mentioned yeah of course uh </connor>
<connor> we've all had our qualms with it but </connor>
<garnt> it's they they have like all of the </garnt>
<garnt> instructor there just to make [ __ ] down </garnt>
<connor> and get you yeah I mean like you know if </connor>
<connor> you want to hire out three guys and </connor>
<connor> someone who knows how to live a live </connor>
<connor> broadcast an audio guy who knows how to </connor>
<connor> get it all done it's like boom in L.A </connor>
<connor> that's easy but in Japan it's like </connor>
<garnt> impossible yeah yeah you know there are </garnt>
<connor> Japanese people who do who do it but </connor>
<connor> it's like they won't be nearly as </connor>
<connor> flexible enough </connor>
<connor> to do what we would need them to do and </connor>
<connor> also they would charge so goddamn much </connor>
<connor> money where if you know it's it's just </connor>
<connor> makes more sense at that point just if </connor>
<connor> you're going to be doing it consistently </connor>
<connor> just make your own team yeah yeah get </connor>
<connor> all this stuff like when we did that </connor>
<connor> Sushi stream that was three RED cameras </connor>
<connor> they were using to stream three Cinema </connor>
<joey> cameras to stream that insane for those </joey>
<connor> of you don't know each one is like 20 </connor>
<connor> grand no no no there's more more than </connor>
<connor> that more </connor>
<garnt> they're like they're like 30 to 40 I </garnt>
<garnt> think but just just the the camera yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then you need to buy all the other </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] which adds up a lot it's a lot yeah </garnt>
<connor> the SSD is also red yeah you can't use </connor>
<connor> others they have their own proprietary </connor>
<connor> stuff which is kind of a that's a whole </connor>
<garnt> link so patrons we know what we want for </garnt>
<connor> Christmas </connor>
<garnt> I did that uh I did a poker stream </garnt>
<garnt> recently as well where I got invited to </garnt>
<garnt> play poker with a bunch of jazz people </garnt>
<garnt> who I just only kind of briefly spoke to </garnt>
<garnt> once and I kind of thought yeah this </garnt>
<connor> sounds intimidating just turning up to a </connor>
<connor> it was a shogi building that they rented </connor>
<connor> out to play poker cool um uh and it was </connor>
<garnt> just they kind of brokenly messaged me </garnt>
<garnt> in English being like poker yes alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> yes uh and then as I'm like going over </garnt>
<garnt> there yeah they mentioned me being like </garnt>

<garnt> oh man I wish you just I was like man I </garnt>
<garnt> should just buy a poker table just cut </garnt>
<connor> out some holes for the cards some put </connor>
<connor> some plexiglass and then hook up cameras </connor>
<connor> underneath and then have like three </connor>
<connor> cameras going around I'm like man we </connor>
<connor> could we could do this it'd be expensive </connor>
<connor> but I'm wondering like I'm like damn I </connor>
<garnt> should I should I should do this yeah if </garnt>
<garnt> you do hit me up because I [ __ ] I </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] love it </connor>

<garnt> do some [ __ ] like that where I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> all right we can get a space that is </garnt>
<garnt> built for like live stream content where </garnt>
<garnt> you can like remake it into some stuff </garnt>
<garnt> we'll see we'll see I don't know maybe </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be ambitious I don't know I mean </garnt>
<garnt> poke is just a lot of fun in general and </garnt>
<connor> then yeah it's easy focus is fun it's </connor>
<garnt> great poker's the fun part you know have </garnt>
<joey> you ever played poker Cherry yeah I play </joey>
<garnt> poker times I played it in uh Hokkaido </garnt>
<connor> actually like uh earlier this year yeah </connor>
<connor> when I was up there with a few of my </connor>
<connor> friends </connor>
<connor> um yeah like there's a yeah as as Conor </connor>
<connor> was saying there's a ton of places </connor>
<connor> especially in like the biggest cities as </connor>
<connor> well like yeah and support there's so </connor>
<connor> many </connor>
<connor> um and super fun and again it's like a </connor>
<connor> whole buy-in thing and then when you </connor>
<connor> finish with it you get like kind of I </connor>
<connor> guess like a credit type of thing </connor>
<garnt> um the way you can use it again to buy </garnt>
<connor> yourself back in right if you go back to </connor>
<garnt> that store for example </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah it's like you just play with </garnt>
<joey> a bunch of like random Japanese people </joey>
<joey> who are just like having drinks and just </joey>
<joey> like hanging out it's a good </joey>
<connor> conversation game yeah it is it's a lot </connor>
<garnt> of time to talk perfect perfect like </garnt>
<garnt> boys night just because it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's the perfect mix between okay we're </garnt>
<garnt> playing a game but also enough time to </garnt>
<garnt> just like chill out with the boys and </garnt>
<garnt> just have a conversation for sure yeah </garnt>
<garnt> anything like that I remember like when </garnt>
<garnt> we went to Vegas we tried going to like </garnt>
<garnt> the poker tables in Vegas and then yeah </garnt>
<garnt> we saw the buy-ins there and we're like </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a minimum 100 bucks a hand </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and so that's a minimum right so </garnt>
<garnt> you need least a few thousand even sit </garnt>
<garnt> down and then I when we walked past it </garnt>
<joey> we just saw like dude people looked </joey>
<joey> intense yeah and like people were like </joey>
<joey> shouting and stuff like that situations </joey>
<joey> I think it's a lot of those people are </joey>
<connor> gambling with like their entire life </connor>
<connor> like War yeah uh and so I was like man I </connor>
<connor> don't think this is the vibe yeah I </connor>
<connor> don't think this should be fine yeah I </connor>
<connor> think I I wanted to have a little fun </connor>
<connor> poker game with some friends maybe but </connor>
<joey> no not not uh so we just ended up at the </joey>
<connor> roulette table right yeah we went to </connor>
<connor> Vegas on the tour and I we me and God </connor>
<connor> had never been so we were like wow we </connor>
<connor> want to see the casinos because like </connor>
<connor> that's that's all you do in Vegas have a </connor>
<connor> look so that was it was crazy it was </connor>
<connor> overwhelming yeah yeah it was insane </connor>
<connor> Vegas was so much fun though it's a </connor>
<garnt> crazy City it's it it is I mean you've </garnt>
<garnt> been plenty of times obviously you're uh </garnt>
<connor> yeah you're definitely I I've never seen </connor>
<connor> an American city that made it so </connor>
<connor> apparent that if you want to spend money </connor>
<garnt> you can just like get way better </garnt>
<garnt> treatment yeah like we because we were </garnt>
<garnt> we were lining up for a cab right </garnt>
<garnt> um to go back to our uh hotel and as as </garnt>
<garnt> we were lining up this line is long it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like maybe like a 20 30 minute </garnt>
<garnt> wait and uh this guy just shouts like if </garnt>
<garnt> you want a private vehicle it's fifty </garnt>
<garnt> dollars and I was like oh so we can just </garnt>
<garnt> skip the whole line if we pay 50 bucks </garnt>
<connor> like yeah it's been gone like oh [ __ ] it </connor>
<connor> yeah let's do that </connor>
<connor> so we just did that we just skipped the </connor>
<connor> whole line through 50 bucks it's like in </connor>
<connor> my head I'm like why would everyone here </connor>
<connor> was like probably wasting so much money </connor>
<connor> on these tables just say 50 bucks so you </connor>
<garnt> could skip the line there are some </garnt>
<garnt> people have like lost a lot of money oh </garnt>
<connor> I know I know I know any more money on </connor>
<connor> taxis man yeah I'd rather lose money on </connor>
<garnt> a cab ride and tip the guy than give a </garnt>
<garnt> casino more money I am I am sad that me </garnt>
<garnt> and Connor weren't able to go to like </garnt>
<garnt> the Caesar's Palace buffet though that </garnt>
<connor> was that was that was a wonderful you </connor>
<joey> went to the buffet right yeah yeah we </joey>
<joey> took them um we did my friend did this </joey>
<garnt> uh who lives in Vegas is also a YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> um we've got digital next uh he uh he </garnt>
<connor> did this I've never seen this ball or </connor>
<connor> move before but um it was a huge line of </connor>
<connor> The Season's Palace buffet right it's </connor>
<connor> like one it's in my opinion one of the </connor>
<connor> best buffets like ever okay especially </connor>
<garnt> in Vegas so we were like all right we </garnt>
<garnt> got a lot of Staff here who have never </garnt>
<garnt> been to you know house Buffet we got to </garnt>
<garnt> take the Caesar Palace buffet and he was </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah the line might be really long </garnt>
<garnt> especially since we haven't reserved it </garnt>
<garnt> and we show up and sure enough there's </garnt>
<garnt> no like you know 50 to 100 people </garnt>
<garnt> waiting in Minecraft it's like a two </garnt>
<garnt> hour wait I'm just like and we're just </garnt>
<garnt> standing around being like all right </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] what are we gonna do and then my </garnt>
<garnt> friend digital was just like all right I </garnt>
<garnt> I got this and he walks into the queue </garnt>
<garnt> and like calls over just like a stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and he goes yeah so uh I've got a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> of famous people here with me right now </garnt>
<connor> um and they really want to sit down and </connor>
<connor> they want to grab a seat where they </connor>
<connor> can't really be seen because they might </connor>
<garnt> be bombarded by fans and that might be a </garnt>
<garnt> problem with that no way did this and </garnt>
<connor> the guy was like </connor>
<connor> all right give me a second because he </connor>
<connor> goes back and he like gets on a phone </connor>
<connor> call for like 10 minutes yeah and he </connor>
<connor> goes okay so we got a C for you right </connor>
<connor> now come on through and we just skipped </connor>
<connor> the whole [ __ ] line and went to the </connor>
<joey> biggest nicest seat in the back of the </joey>
<joey> restaurant I was like how the [ __ ] did </joey>
<connor> you do that even if I was [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> Leonardo DiCaprio I wouldn't have the </connor>
<garnt> balls today </garnt>
<connor> absolute confidence in this place like </connor>
<connor> there's some famous people are just like </connor>
<connor> that's such a that's such an alpha move </connor>
<connor> that's like speech 100. </connor>
<connor> American is a different bro what does </connor>
<joey> that work I can't let that worked either </joey>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] that must happen quite </garnt>
<garnt> often I mean this is Vegas we're talking </garnt>
<connor> about right so there's probably just </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] celebrities walking around all </garnt>
<garnt> the time yeah I mean but it's just like </garnt>
<connor> the fact that it was just like me and </connor>
<garnt> like a bunch of the tour stuff we're </garnt>
<garnt> just standing around me like </garnt>
<joey> and the guy looking at us like what's </joey>
<garnt> the face those are the famous people </garnt>
<garnt> actually that's the anime man I don't </garnt>
<joey> know if you know yeah I saw a uh claw </joey>
<connor> machine in one of the casinos really it </connor>
<joey> was like a gambling claw machine </joey>
<connor> money oh just like so you you could bet </connor>
<garnt> however much you wanted to and then it </garnt>
<garnt> would be like hey if you've got one of </garnt>
<garnt> the balls you'd get this much back uh so </garnt>
<garnt> I tried it and I was like nah this [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> ain't gonna now this [ __ ] ain't working </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] this [ __ ] is not happening </garnt>
<garnt> at most I might get it once but because </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a computer that decides how </garnt>
<joey> much money you get obviously the </joey>
<joey> computer will probably decide that you </joey>
<connor> get to to win when it's a very tiny </connor>
<connor> amount right so it's like it's like this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] this is so dumb it's not happening </connor>
<garnt> going on tour has made me realize like </garnt>
<garnt> just Conor has an unhealthy addiction to </garnt>
<connor> claw machines now I don't know if I if I </connor>
<garnt> see one I kind of have to play it I kind </garnt>
<connor> of I don't know why it's kind of you </connor>
<connor> think I'd be sick of them but I kind of </connor>
<garnt> just always want to play them the </garnt>
<garnt> system's going on man yeah I know right </garnt>
<garnt> he's it's like the jumping effect or </garnt>
<joey> like all over again you've like you've </joey>
<joey> done it so much </joey>
<joey> you've tortured yourself with claw </joey>
<garnt> machines so much like you've convinced </garnt>
<connor> yourself that you like it yeah I've </connor>
<connor> spent like God </connor>
<garnt> close to 10 grand yeah I never told you </garnt>
<garnt> the story but like the the point I </garnt>
<garnt> realized that Connor oh Conor's like </garnt>
<garnt> actually addicted addicted was I so we </garnt>
<garnt> uh went to one of the uh League world's </garnt>
<garnt> like quarterfinals or it was like kind </garnt>
<garnt> of the group no it was the group stages </garnt>
<garnt> in New York yeah and uh we're going and </garnt>
<garnt> of course we're going in to watch League </garnt>
<garnt> that's why we're going there </garnt>
<connor> um and so we go to take our seats and </connor>
<connor> there's just like one single like claw </connor>
<connor> machine in this entire building right </connor>
<connor> it's just like one thing that they've </connor>
<connor> put there and no one's like playing in </connor>
<connor> it and I just no no no [ __ ] off people </connor>
<connor> are playing no no one we were walking in </connor>
<connor> yeah it's free it's free to play it was </connor>
<connor> free to play and Connor just glances at </connor>
<garnt> it and just goes oh there's a claw </garnt>
<garnt> machine and then I was like yeah there's </garnt>
<garnt> a global machine I don't know what you </garnt>
<garnt> can when did did you did you know what </garnt>
<connor> you could win yeah so it was like it was </connor>
<connor> like a stress ball I guess of like </connor>
<connor> League things there was like the like </connor>
<garnt> gragas barrel and a minion oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so it was just something for like fans </garnt>
<garnt> and viewers to do like in between right </garnt>
<connor> so we watched like the first two games </connor>
<connor> at this uh this event that we're in </connor>
<connor> um and then Conor's like I'm gonna go to </connor>
<connor> the toilet I'm like okay sure thing I </connor>
<connor> did go to the toilet and he did go to </connor>
<connor> the toilet and so what proceeds to </connor>
<connor> happen is I </connor>
<connor> um so I so before the next game starts I </connor>
<garnt> go out as well I had to go to the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> before next game starts and I see Connor </garnt>
<garnt> on this claw machine with like five </garnt>
<garnt> people around him right and I just </garnt>
<garnt> thought I just thought oh it's uh </garnt>
<garnt> because actually at that League event we </garnt>
<garnt> got recognized so much because of course </garnt>
<garnt> yeah League fans and weaves we we go </garnt>
<garnt> hand in hand so I thought you know </garnt>
<garnt> Connor's just like Connor's playing up </garnt>
<garnt> you know we had we have a few fans there </garnt>
<garnt> he's playing a few cool machines with </garnt>
<garnt> some fans go to the toilet come back </garnt>
<garnt> watch the match the entire match is like </garnt>
<garnt> I watched the entire match by myself </garnt>
<garnt> thinking what the [ __ ] did Connor go </garnt>
<garnt> where did he go he missed an entire </garnt>
<garnt> match of League </garnt>
<connor> it was a [ __ ] game so I </connor>
<garnt> is a group of like 30 people making a </garnt>
<garnt> semi-circle around Connor playing this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] claw machine he had been playing </garnt>
<garnt> this claw machine for 40 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like God have you been here </garnt>
<garnt> this entire time and he's like yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> haven't won yet I'm not leaving until </garnt>
<connor> I've won like one of these [ __ ] boys </connor>
<connor> yeah so so I went to the toilet and then </connor>
<connor> there was no line for it so and I'd seen </connor>
<connor> a line earlier so I was like oh I'll </connor>
<connor> just have a go and then I started </connor>
<connor> getting recognized a lot by people there </connor>
<connor> and so people started lining up to like </connor>
<connor> um some people were just waiting to take </connor>
<connor> photos some people just wanted to watch </connor>
<connor> me play and then some people the people </connor>
<connor> would just gather and say like oh I've </connor>
<connor> heard this guy's good at this people </connor>
<connor> would just watch and so yeah like gaunt </connor>
<connor> said by the end of it I had like a group </connor>
<connor> of 30 people and it it was kind of like </connor>
<connor> but they were all interacting and we </connor>
<garnt> were like everyone was like talking [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> everyone was like bantering yeah I kind </garnt>
<connor> of felt like a like Spartacus with my </connor>
<connor> like audience is like are you not </connor>
<connor> entertained let's get it and I kept </connor>
<connor> getting like perfect grips perfect claws </connor>
<connor> perfect like but every single time I </connor>
<connor> nailed the grip I was there I had the </connor>
<connor> perfect Tech every single time and for </connor>
<connor> 40 minutes I didn't win and then just </connor>
<connor> wasn't meant to be I was asking everyone </connor>
<connor> like has anybody seen anybody win this </connor>
<connor> and they were like no no there's like </connor>
<connor> three machines around the whole menu and </connor>
<connor> they're like obviously anyone win I'm </connor>
<connor> like this is [ __ ] we should Riot we </connor>
<connor> should we should rob it we should just </connor>
<connor> tip this thing over and take its </connor>
<connor> contents and so the woman came to fill </connor>
<connor> over one of the other machines and we </connor>
<connor> were like why what and then some of the </connor>
<connor> guys started asking like why can't we </connor>
<connor> win this this guy's been playing for </connor>
<connor> like 50 minutes and we can't win they're </connor>
<connor> like that's easy it's free to play a </connor>
<connor> bunch of kids have won them we're like </connor>
<garnt> no no one's want anything what are you </garnt>
<garnt> talking about the government is lying to </garnt>
<garnt> us begin the crew name they literally </garnt>
<connor> watched me for 50 minutes nail it nail </connor>
<connor> it nail it and I didn't win a single </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] time a two dollar stress toy uh </joey>
<joey> so yeah I was just kind of sad about </joey>
<joey> that and I stand up winning no I didn't </joey>
<joey> I didn't I gave up just eventually it </joey>
<joey> was like I gotta actually like because </joey>
<joey> I'd asked uh somebody I uh a good friend </joey>
<connor> not a good friend I know somebody I knew </connor>
<connor> hey can I have tickets please because </connor>
<connor> the tickets are all sold out so I was </connor>
<connor> like I should go watch the game so after </connor>
<connor> after 40 minutes like that's enough </connor>
<garnt> that's enough Jesus I like how you was a </garnt>
<garnt> free claw machine I was like and you're </garnt>
<garnt> like I want a refund give me a refund </garnt>
<garnt> I want to refund on my time that was </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up League of Legends uh if you </garnt>
<garnt> ever watch this clip please consider </garnt>
<garnt> sending me a free uh stress toy uh </garnt>
<garnt> because I needed it afterwards that was </garnt>
<joey> unfair </joey>
<joey> I bought so many white claws at that </joey>
<joey> venue and they were they were like 15 </joey>
<joey> white clothes oh my God I needed to get </joey>
<garnt> through that claw man I was like I was </garnt>
<garnt> so sad I also had a very first Geeks </garnt>
<garnt> plus office Christmas party the other </garnt>
<garnt> day which was a lot of fun you missed </garnt>
<garnt> the beginning of that I did I did yeah I </garnt>
<connor> was so I think I think the highlight of </connor>
<connor> that like of that night because I've </connor>
<joey> been thinking about it ever since that </joey>
<joey> night was uh we had like a secret Santa </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> so we had we had a Secret Santa you know </joey>
<joey> everyone exactly everyone got some nice </joey>
<joey> gifts and everyone but I I forgot there </joey>
<garnt> was someone who bought uh what was it </garnt>
<joey> what was that like [ __ ] sorry Kendama </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah like a kendama like </garnt>
<joey> Japanese toy and </joey>
<joey> there was a revolution that that like </joey>
<garnt> that like opened my mind to be like I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't realize something so simple could </garnt>
<garnt> be so much [ __ ] fun holy [ __ ] it was </garnt>
<joey> like I forgot who actually got it for </joey>
<joey> the for the yeah that's yeah that's </joey>
<connor> right diet has got it for a present who </connor>
<connor> gave it to Dougie ah I think Anna did </connor>
<connor> right oh Anna did yeah Anna gave it to </connor>
<connor> Davis for it for the present and it was </connor>
<connor> you know it's just like a small little </connor>
<connor> Kendama and and Titus was like what is </connor>
<connor> this and you know someone had to show </connor>
<garnt> him how to do it by the end of the night </garnt>
<garnt> there was like at all times at least </garnt>
<garnt> seven people just in a semi-circle </garnt>
<garnt> surrounding them being like me next give </garnt>
<garnt> me next come on I got that I got it I </garnt>
<garnt> can nail it don't give it to me [ __ ] I </garnt>
<garnt> can do it it got so competitive it's </garnt>
<garnt> just it just made me realize damn kids </garnt>
<garnt> in the 1950s had it [ __ ] good man </garnt>
<garnt> holy [ __ ] who needs a [ __ ] iPad who </garnt>
<garnt> needs [ __ ] fortnite when we have like </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] Ken though when you get </connor>
<connor> cracked in it then it's no longer fun </connor>
<connor> because you can do it every time no </connor>
<joey> because then you start to learn like the </joey>
<connor> special tricks and those take like years </connor>
<garnt> to perfect good I'm good honestly I've </garnt>
<connor> been thinking about getting one myself </connor>
<connor> I'm just a literal children's toy it's </connor>
<connor> actually so fun you know because like </connor>
<connor> initially you look you don't know you </connor>
<connor> haven't tried it I know what it is I've </connor>
<garnt> used it yeah initially you look at it </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like this is this is [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> stupid I mean you try once you're like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to go </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna try it again I'm gonna try it </garnt>
<garnt> again and and it's it's got like that </garnt>
<garnt> perfect I'm gonna call it like a </garnt>
<garnt> gameplay Loop of just like just one more </garnt>
<garnt> time one more time I'll get at this </garnt>
<garnt> level I'll get this slime Joey is </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] cracked today because he he Joey </joey>
<joey> showed us the Strat and I think that's </joey>
<joey> what made it like so much fun because we </joey>
<joey> could see what we needed to do so the </joey>
<joey> stride is just like you have to pull up </joey>
<joey> you have to pull the string up at like </joey>
<joey> the perfect amount like strength like </joey>
<joey> directly vertical like directly vertical </joey>
<joey> and you need to [ __ ] just like </joey>
<connor> perfectly land it on the Kendama and so </connor>
<connor> there are like four stages of difficulty </connor>
<connor> so they're like there's like uh if you </connor>
<connor> know his here's what it looks like on </connor>
<connor> screen right so you got like three </connor>
<connor> appendages uh and each appendage has </connor>
<connor> like a uh cup that is a different kind </connor>
<connor> of size </connor>
<connor> um and Joey did it like so the smaller </connor>
<connor> the smaller the size the harder it is to </connor>
<connor> land it on that cup and Joey like Joey </connor>
<connor> tried to do it Joey showed us to do it </connor>
<connor> on like the hardest difficulty setting </connor>
<connor> and everyone's like that looks easy I'm </connor>
<connor> just gonna go for the hardest difficulty </connor>
<connor> setting right off the bat a quality </connor>
<connor> setting of your kids toy yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> uh yeah and then we like I think a group </connor>
<garnt> of like [ __ ] seven of us wasted two </garnt>
<garnt> hours just watching this ball go [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> up and down </garnt>
<joey> it was it was the hypest thing to happen </joey>
<joey> when anyone got it the first time </joey>
<connor> everyone was just like oh oh literally </connor>
<connor> you showed me how to like spin it and oh </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> I told people how to do it on like the </joey>
<joey> spike like to get the hole on the spike </joey>
<joey> which is the hardest one and I did it </joey>
<joey> and I did a first go and even I was </joey>
<joey> surprised I was like oh [ __ ] and then </joey>
<joey> everyone was like yo let me try that and </joey>
<connor> for like the next two hours everyone's </connor>
<connor> just trying to do it what gifted uh you </connor>
<joey> guys supposed to both give and receive </joey>
<joey> uh so I didn't find out that we were </joey>
<connor> doing a secret santa until literally </connor>
<connor> like two hours before I was supposed to </connor>
<joey> show up right mailing was like by the </joey>
<connor> way we're doing a secret sound I wasn't </connor>
<connor> here for this because I was on a plane </connor>
<joey> yeah but Conor was on his way back from </joey>
<joey> the US right so so mailing texted me </joey>
<joey> like two hours before I was supposed to </joey>
<joey> show up being like by the way we're </joey>
<joey> doing a secret santa no pressure though </joey>
<joey> I was like why are you telling me </joey>
<connor> because you'll you'll end the loop if </connor>
<joey> you don't yeah exactly so I was just </joey>
<joey> like well [ __ ] I don't have time to go </joey>
<garnt> out to shop for something let alone wrap </garnt>
<garnt> it up so I just gotta like grab </garnt>
<garnt> something from home and so I just was </garnt>
<connor> like all right I guess if any if </connor>
<connor> everyone's kind of doing like joke gifts </connor>
<connor> or whatever and like not serious gifts </connor>
<connor> then I'll just I'll just give a joke </connor>
<connor> gift so I just grabbed my copy of uh </connor>
<joey> tf's tsf monogatari by Shin Noel and </joey>
<joey> just wrap that [ __ ] up yeah and placed </joey>
<joey> it and then of course out of all of the </joey>
<garnt> people who had to grab my gift there are </garnt>
<garnt> about 40 40. yeah those are like 30 or </garnt>
<garnt> 40 people there yeah I had a one in 30 </garnt>
<joey> to 40 chance that Sydney would grab my </joey>
<joey> gift and she grabbed my gift oh well and </joey>
<connor> I was like this was it all just like a </connor>
<connor> free-for-all you just grabbed a gift you </connor>
<garnt> didn't have a person </garnt>
<garnt> we had a system I don't know mailings </garnt>
<joey> did it in the most arbitrary system I've </joey>
<garnt> ever seen in my life yeah like we were </garnt>
<garnt> we were we had like we used up like 20 </garnt>
<garnt> to 30 minutes figuring out system don't </garnt>
<connor> you just normally just go online and </connor>
<connor> type everyone's names in then it tells </connor>
<connor> you if you're buying a gift for </connor>
<garnt> no no no because it was like it was it </garnt>
<garnt> was all around it was all like </garnt>
<connor> randomized yeah that's random though </connor>
<connor> like you put everyone's name into a </connor>
<connor> website and it'll be like God is your </connor>
<connor> Secret Santa oh and they'll get the same </connor>
<joey> thing </joey>
<connor> for me it was always just like okay </connor>
<garnt> there's you know all the presents are at </garnt>
<garnt> the bottom of the tree right yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> and then you it's just a free you just </connor>
<connor> go up and ground no it's more fun to </connor>
<joey> know who you're buying for and then but </joey>
<joey> then if it doesn't pick up a secret </joey>
<connor> santa no it's secret because you don't </connor>
<garnt> know who's buying for you you never know </garnt>
<garnt> who's buying for you so this uh well I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if it's different because </garnt>
<connor> this was called like white elephant so I </connor>
<garnt> don't know if the rules are different I </garnt>
<garnt> mean the other thing I know is secret </garnt>
<connor> santa white elephant why elephant it's </connor>
<garnt> basically the same thing but you just </garnt>
<joey> it's kind of like more of like you buy a </joey>
<joey> random gift that you put into the pool </joey>
<joey> and then yeah like all the gifts are </joey>
<joey> randomized and you kind of like pick </joey>
<joey> from you don't know who you're buying </joey>
<joey> for you don't know and um so we came up </joey>
<joey> like mailing uh being the mom came up </joey>
<joey> with this like [ __ ] overly </joey>
<joey> complicated system where she was like </joey>
<joey> how many people bought gifts everyone </joey>
<joey> and put your hands up right now okay </joey>
<garnt> we're all gonna start we're all going to </garnt>
<garnt> assign you a random number and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that and so we spend </garnt>
<garnt> like 20 minutes trying to figure out the </garnt>
<garnt> system and Joey just goes wouldn't it be </garnt>
<garnt> what's stopping us from just everyone </garnt>
<garnt> taking a random gift and then it's like </garnt>
<garnt> no no no we cannot do that we need the </garnt>
<garnt> numbers we need the numbers and so I had </garnt>
<joey> so we all had to wait for meleen to like </joey>
<joey> write like on each individual note </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] pad just be like write a number </garnt>
<garnt> and then like put it in a bag and then </garnt>
<garnt> everyone pick it out and then calling </garnt>
<garnt> the number like I was like I was at the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] Ward office I was just like </garnt>
<garnt> waiting for my number </garnt>
<joey> 21 I'm just like she's from Japan this </joey>
<garnt> is trying to japanify it I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God it's like welcome to the DIA </garnt>
<joey> Japan DMV this is exactly so Sydney got </joey>
<garnt> your gift Sydney got my gift and oh and </garnt>
<garnt> I was like no all right come on Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> replace it with someone because like </garnt>
<garnt> that's just that's a lame present for </garnt>
<garnt> you right like you probably already have </garnt>
<garnt> a copy of that so she gave it to master </garnt>
<garnt> instead yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um you know he enjoyed it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and then I got uh I forgot too bored </garnt>
<garnt> for me I got sekihang which is like the </garnt>
<garnt> the red rice oh you know that so in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan there's this thing which is called </garnt>
<joey> sticky hands red rice and traditionally </joey>
<joey> you cook it like parents cook it for </joey>
<joey> their daughters when they hit puberty </joey>
<joey> oh that's nice yeah wait wait wait what </joey>
<joey> think about that wait why </joey>
<joey> because they've got their period for the </joey>
<joey> first time </joey>
<connor> they eat them red rice they give them </connor>
<connor> red rice because they hit that period </connor>
<joey> I'm not joking that is a tradition </joey>

<garnt> it'll last until you get a daughter </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> I'll just hold on to it being like I got </joey>
<connor> this 30 years ago from a Christmas but </connor>
<connor> holding on to this is there any other </connor>
<connor> like Japanese Traditions like that </connor>

<connor> three five or seven oh yeah I've heard </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<joey> um and uh and I don't know exactly what </joey>
<connor> happens in it because I I never did it </connor>
<connor> um but both Childs are boys </connor>
<connor> they're crazy no I think it could be </connor>
<joey> either gender right yeah there's a boy's </joey>
<connor> boy thing right as well there's like a </connor>
<connor> boy celebration something I can't </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] remember what it is the penis </joey>
<connor> fist not the penis vessel what's the </connor>
<connor> thing when you put the you put the </connor>
<connor> little fish out the fish uh oh </connor>
<connor> nobody that's there that's uh children's </connor>
<connor> day oh maybe children yeah that's May </connor>
<connor> the fifth and we we for some reason we </connor>
<connor> we we we put up these like huge uh koi </connor>
<connor> like the koi fish yeah decorations and </connor>
<connor> we put them on like a top of a flagpole </connor>
<connor> and it's just kind of as like a mock-up </connor>
<connor> flag I don't know what this resemblance </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of things in Japan there's </connor>
<connor> a lot of weird holidays like that in </connor>
<connor> Japan there's also hinamatsudi which is </connor>
<connor> like the little dolls as well children </connor>
<connor> as well </connor>
<joey> um yeah I don't know lots of lots of </joey>
<garnt> celebrations for children </garnt>
<connor> has a child because they had a </connor>
<garnt> population they have none so they're </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah it's just like uh we don't </garnt>
<garnt> know what to celebrate uh children it's </garnt>
<joey> a momentous occasion when someone's like </joey>
<connor> oh you desire to have kids in Japan I </connor>
<connor> experienced something truly Japanese the </connor>
<joey> other day gone right gotcha </joey>
<joey> what gotcha like you must experience in </joey>
<garnt> the weirdest way ever okay so I I rented </garnt>
<joey> a car and there's an option on the </joey>
<joey> website that was called gacha rent a car </joey>
<connor> where you just rent a car and you have </connor>
<connor> no [ __ ] clue what car it is and you </connor>
<joey> only find out when you turn up that </joey>
<joey> sounds epic yeah so I I always rent the </joey>
<connor> smallest car anyway because I I never </connor>
<connor> have much luggage and when I'm doing </connor>
<connor> video shoots I just need something that </connor>
<connor> can get three people to a weird place </connor>
<connor> that a trainer doesn't go to so I always </connor>
<connor> just rent like a small car like a Toyota </connor>
<connor> Yaris or something right like a tiny car </connor>
<connor> fits for people yeah it has room for </connor>
<connor> bags and stuff and that's normally like </connor>
<connor> 6 000 Yen just for the car for the day </connor>
<connor> so it's like it's like 45 bucks so </connor>
<garnt> pretty cheap not bad um and then on the </garnt>
<garnt> website I saw it was like oh but for 4 </garnt>
<garnt> 000 Yen so for 30 bucks basically like </garnt>
<garnt> not even less than that I think now you </garnt>
<garnt> can get a random car for the day and I </garnt>
<garnt> thought well it can't be worse than the </garnt>
<garnt> yaros like it can't be worse than the </garnt>
<garnt> smallest car yeah and so I was like all </garnt>
<garnt> right [ __ ] it yeah I'll do it I'm down </garnt>
<garnt> so I turned out and I won the gacha dude </garnt>
<garnt> do you get the SSR no I don't get SSR I </garnt>
<garnt> got a pretty decent I got a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> Toyota Prius when I turned up okay and I </connor>
<garnt> was like I'll take a break I'll take a </garnt>
<garnt> Prius that's kind of like a win-win </garnt>
<garnt> right because if you're always going if </garnt>
<garnt> you're if you're always going for the </garnt>
<garnt> three star anyway then it's only going </garnt>
<connor> to go up from there right yeah literally </connor>
<connor> I'm literally pulling for the most dog </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] thing normally so I'm like hey if I </connor>
<joey> get what's to say the three stars the </joey>
<joey> lowest right what if you show up and </joey>
<connor> it's like here's your bicycle </connor>
<joey> yeah I think the way it works is </joey>
<connor> whatever because obviously people </connor>
<connor> bringing cars back I think it's whatever </connor>
<connor> car is just kind of like awkwardly kind </connor>
<connor> of at that rent a car where someone else </connor>
<connor> doesn't need it yet so don't transfer it </connor>
<connor> you just kind of get it so I'm going to </connor>
<joey> turn a Prius and I was like oh that's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] awesome yeah less price as well </joey>
<joey> yeah the Prius is normally 100 bucks a </joey>
<joey> day oh hello so I was like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> that's [ __ ] dude you got it but I did </connor>
<connor> have to Google how to uh I was in the </connor>
<connor> car the Prius I'd never driven a Prius </connor>
<connor> before and I couldn't [ __ ] find the </connor>
<connor> handbrake I was like how the [ __ ] do I </connor>
<connor> get this the handbrake right so I'm </connor>
<connor> sitting in the thing and the guy's </connor>
<connor> asking me like oh you know how to drive </connor>
<connor> this right yeah </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] car I don't have to drive it </connor>
<connor> it's a [ __ ] Prius puts it in a drive </connor>
<joey> it's not moving what the [ __ ] is it not </joey>
<connor> is it the foot pedal one is it yeah I've </connor>
<connor> never seen them on these before Oh </connor>
<connor> really I've literally never been in the </connor>
<connor> car where it's a foot pedal uh handbrake </connor>
<garnt> yeah and and so I I'm in the car and the </garnt>
<garnt> guy the the car hose with me and my </garnt>
<garnt> cameraman he's like do you know do you </garnt>
<garnt> know how to get it out of the handbrake </garnt>
<garnt> I was like I have no [ __ ] clue so I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like hey Google how do I get the Prius </garnt>
<garnt> out of hand handbrake on and off and </garnt>
<garnt> then a YouTube video guys this is really </garnt>
<garnt> easy oh there's just a pedal at the </garnt>
<garnt> bottom there's a tiny little pedal yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you just push it in and then it's a </garnt>
<joey> handbrake and I was like holy [ __ ] I've </joey>
<joey> never seen that before yeah my mom had a </joey>
<joey> Prius sign </joey>
<joey> have you have you ever seen that before </joey>
<joey> I've never seen it I've never seen it's </joey>
<joey> this tiny little hidden thing next to </joey>
<joey> like where the break is yeah right and </joey>
<joey> it's just this yeah tiny tiny like like </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] size of this [ __ ] and you </joey>
<joey> just push it in and that's a handbrake </joey>
<joey> and I was like oh okay but I was great I </joey>
<garnt> mean it was so cheap like with all the </garnt>
<garnt> gas and stuff I think the gas was only </garnt>
<garnt> like because it's a Prius </garnt>
<garnt> it was only like 20 bucks for gas oh </garnt>
<garnt> so the whole day the rental car was like </garnt>
<garnt> I just paid for </garnt>
<garnt> foreign </garnt>
<garnt> 's great in Japan but there are a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> occasions where a car makes way more </garnt>
<garnt> sense yeah and so I you know we were </garnt>
<connor> going to Fuji queue which you can get a </connor>
<connor> train robust you pretty easily but I </connor>
<joey> just want to be able to go there I wish </joey>
<joey> they would do that with all public </joey>
<connor> transport you know it's like it's like </connor>
<connor> okay so you want to get front to this </connor>
<joey> station take the train gotcha honestly </joey>
<joey> you won't know which train you're going </joey>
<garnt> on I feel like we need more gotcha every </garnt>
<joey> aspect let's see if it sounds like if </joey>
<connor> there was like let's say like on a plane </connor>
<connor> right there's 30 economy seats two </connor>
<joey> premium one business yeah and you can </joey>
<garnt> just be like [ __ ] it oh my gosh but it's </garnt>
<connor> a slightly more than economy like it's </connor>
<garnt> slightly more you're like ah [ __ ] it </garnt>
<connor> there's a chance I can itself play the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] restaurant hey they should do it </garnt>
<garnt> go go to the restaurant and they give </garnt>
<garnt> you the menu and be like you can pay for </garnt>
<garnt> less but it's good </garnt>
<joey> wine you could get the Dom Perignon well </joey>
<joey> you could get it or you could get a </joey>
<garnt> Capri Sun </garnt>
<connor> yeah because one of my one of my </connor>
<connor> favorite restaurants do actually have </connor>
<connor> like a gacha machine wait you took me to </connor>
<connor> it yeah yeah weird it's a catcher when </connor>
<connor> you leave oh really there's this Italian </connor>
<connor> restaurant uh and if you spend you know </connor>
<garnt> a certain amount of money you get free </garnt>
<garnt> pools on the sketch machine and you can </garnt>
<garnt> buy you can win either like a free drink </garnt>
<garnt> or like a free meal or a lot of other </garnt>
<joey> stuff so I don't know there's a lot of </joey>
<connor> uh izakayas that I've been to in Japan </connor>
<connor> uh where it's like it's kind of it's </connor>
<connor> kind of gotcha but it's like they use </connor>
<connor> like the dice rolling game I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> love that game that's the Yakuza game </connor>
<garnt> right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like two dice in in a in a </garnt>
<garnt> bowl yeah and uh like the one that's </garnt>
<garnt> near kind of my house is like you if you </garnt>
<connor> buy a beer you can do chinchiro for it </connor>
<connor> which is where like depending on what's </connor>
<connor> thrown you can either get like a bigger </connor>
<connor> price for the same price or you can get </connor>
<connor> a bigger price for free or if you get </connor>
<connor> like two ones then you have to like do </connor>
<joey> five shots or it's like you know it's </joey>
<joey> like it's just this kind of like cool </joey>
<connor> fun little method to be like all right </connor>
<connor> let's see is that the game they because </connor>
<connor> I I learned how to play this game after </connor>
<connor> I watched </connor>
<connor> um kaiji yeah is it the same game </connor>
<connor> they're playing kaiji season two that's </connor>
<connor> just digital oh okay okay I love [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's a good game yeah it's really really </connor>
<connor> good game yeah I played it I played in </connor>
<garnt> the bar Pete taught me how to play yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I went to a bar in Japan and the owner </garnt>
<garnt> would play chinchiro with you yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> and yeah if you lose I I I I lost some </connor>
<connor> time so if you lose you had to do the </connor>
<connor> shot of Jaeger yeah and then and so like </connor>
<connor> the bar owner lost like three times it </connor>
<connor> was like three shots of Jaeger it's </connor>
<connor> pretty fun it's a good game you should </connor>
<connor> Google how to play it I could explain </connor>
<connor> but it's it takes like a few minutes </connor>
<joey> there's lots of local rules as well </joey>
<connor> which is yeah basically basically roll </connor>
<connor> High yeah that's basically it like get </connor>
<garnt> doubles yeah I went to I went to like a </garnt>
<connor> craft beer place the other day that I </connor>
<connor> had a had a pretty cool system as well </connor>
<connor> so they you know you can obviously buy </connor>
<connor> just buy like normal like uh glasses and </connor>
<garnt> normal pints and everything like that </garnt>
<garnt> but they also have the system the </garnt>
<garnt> special system where </garnt>
<garnt> um it's like one price for us like for </garnt>
<garnt> like a certain amount of drink right and </garnt>
<garnt> then it's kind of like a tier system so </garnt>
<garnt> this this drink will always be this one </garnt>
<connor> price but if you can finish your string </connor>
<connor> you can order more of the same beer but </connor>
<connor> then the next the next beer you get is </connor>
<connor> going to be a bigger size in volume </connor>
<connor> and it gets to a point where he gets </connor>
<garnt> like a comically big size of volume like </garnt>
<garnt> a [ __ ] bucket by the end that's like </garnt>
<garnt> the final tier </garnt>
<garnt> um I just I remember me and Cindy went </garnt>
<garnt> there and we were just like let's try </garnt>
<garnt> and do it let's let's try and complete </garnt>
<garnt> the game and it's it's I I want to take </garnt>
<garnt> someone makes that sometime just to see </garnt>
<garnt> like I just see like what what if we </garnt>
<garnt> take a breath there now what if we take </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] take a trip like like a German </connor>
<connor> there see how far we get because we we </connor>
<connor> got to like the second to last tier and </connor>
<connor> we were like [ __ ] what was the vessel </connor>
<connor> what was the vessel yeah what was the </connor>
<connor> vessel it was like um are we talking </connor>
<connor> like a boot or yeah what was it it was </connor>
<connor> you know you know when you see like some </connor>
<connor> of that like you know that comically big </connor>
<garnt> wine glass that's just like oh I'm only </garnt>
<garnt> gonna have one glass of wine </garnt>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<garnt> that was that was like the second to </garnt>
<garnt> last stage holy [ __ ] and then the final </garnt>
<garnt> stage was just a straight it was just </garnt>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] glass bucket almost it </garnt>
<garnt> like it was like kind of like a yard </garnt>
<connor> basically I think there's a few of </connor>
<connor> places that do that gimmick in Japan </connor>
<connor> yeah because it's like I've been to one </connor>
<connor> like that in rapongi as well yeah </connor>
<joey> um that was we should we should do it to </joey>
<joey> see out of the three of us who can </joey>
<connor> complete it I I did beer last time I </connor>
<connor> went and I think that was a mistake </connor>
<connor> because like by the I think the second </connor>
<connor> one or third one I was really full yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> I can't drink this bucket I can't drink </connor>
<connor> out of this it's not even fun to drink </connor>
<connor> anything yeah it just becomes not fast </connor>
<joey> I'd rather have a bunch of small glasses </joey>
<connor> the way everyone has been doing for a </connor>
<garnt> very long time yeah it was fun for a </garnt>
<garnt> one-off yeah I mean I like going to </garnt>
<garnt> places where they're kind of like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's they kind of just gamify something </garnt>
<connor> whether it's like [ __ ] gotcha it's </connor>
<garnt> like so much gacha [ __ ] here so much to </garnt>
<garnt> get your stuff in daily life yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> even like you go to Akihabara you can </garnt>
<garnt> play the Sketcher machine for like 10 20 </garnt>
<garnt> bucks yeah and you might get something </garnt>
<connor> but normally you get something kind of </connor>
<garnt> yeah and yeah one thing one thing I've </garnt>
<garnt> never understood is uh </garnt>
<garnt> have you ever like you know gone to like </garnt>
<garnt> an anime convention right and you know </garnt>
<garnt> they have like those special mystery </garnt>
<connor> boxes yeah right yeah that's one thing </connor>
<connor> I'd like that's that's one thing I've </connor>
<garnt> never gotten and I don't understand why </garnt>
<garnt> people would get them because do you </garnt>
<garnt> think they actually put like good gifts </garnt>
<connor> in there so I think it originated it's a </connor>
<connor> New Year's thing in Japan right it's how </connor>
<connor> it started and they're normally actually </connor>
<connor> pretty generous right like it's meant to </connor>
<connor> be like a lot of the times you have to </connor>
<joey> book these and they're limited a lot of </joey>
<joey> the times as well like especially some </joey>
<garnt> of the more expensive ones like the ones </garnt>
<garnt> that you have to book like some of the </garnt>
<garnt> stuff in these uh lucky but they're </garnt>
<connor> called but like in this like there's a </connor>
<connor> lot of stuff where you can only get it </connor>
<connor> in the lucky bag like it's not sold </connor>
<connor> anywhere else it's like a special like </connor>
<connor> package but like you won't know what it </connor>
<connor> is until you get it right I got one last </connor>
<connor> time from amiami it was 500 bucks and I </connor>
<connor> definitely got more than 500 worth of </connor>
<connor> figures in the Box the Pokemon one for </connor>
<joey> example the Pokemon's in every year like </joey>
<joey> you have to book that [ __ ] like four </joey>
<garnt> months Jesus I didn't realize you had to </garnt>
<joey> book this year man of course yeah it's </joey>
<connor> Japan uh yeah you have to all the good </connor>
<connor> ones you have to book but you also </connor>
<joey> generally it's more like a celebratory </joey>
<joey> thing than a let's make a lot of money </joey>
<joey> it's like all right that's that's just </joey>
<joey> like happy New Year yes happy New Year </joey>
<joey> because you know New Year's one of the </joey>
<joey> biggest things in Japan and then I think </joey>
<connor> uh you know </connor>
<connor> um when American consort they're like </connor>
<garnt> money is this a money-making and ax was </garnt>
<connor> always that one booth I can't remember </connor>
<joey> which one it was there was that one </joey>
<joey> where they would make the Walls World </joey>
<joey> the lucky boxes remember these yeah the </joey>
<joey> animation right there that just have a </joey>
<joey> like a booth that was made out of these </joey>
<joey> lucky boxes yeah I remember that and </joey>
<connor> dude you just they have never had </connor>
<joey> anything good enough never never they're </joey>
<joey> good for Content that's about it even </joey>
<connor> then like move down or edited a video of </connor>
<garnt> I think with uh hard on unboxing one of </garnt>
<garnt> them but it's just the saddest thing </garnt>
<garnt> ever and it was like 50 bucks nothing </garnt>
<garnt> nothing good in it he gave me like a </garnt>
<garnt> squid game plush that wouldn't shut up </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a tiny one yeah you press </garnt>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> whatever the [ __ ] inside yeah yeah I </connor>
<connor> was like oh my God this is so [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> it's funny oh man what's normal to do in </joey>
<garnt> Japan for like New Year's what's like </garnt>
<garnt> the tradition here the tradition is to </garnt>
<garnt> you have to go to like a temple right </garnt>
<connor> yeah Temple oh that's usually a news day </connor>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<connor> um but like for me like this year I'm </connor>
<connor> going back to my Grandma's place up </connor>
<joey> north uh because like it's very much </joey>
<joey> like it's weird like Christmas and you </joey>
<connor> mean you already went to your Grandma's </connor>
<joey> place yeah it's the New Years the New </joey>
<joey> Year fantastic I loved it </joey>
<joey> um yeah so I think it's it's interesting </joey>
<garnt> because like I thought about this it's </garnt>
<garnt> like Christmas and New Year's how it's </garnt>
<garnt> celebrated in the west is like the </garnt>
<garnt> complete opposite to how to celebrate in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan yeah because it's like in the west </garnt>
<garnt> it's like Christmas is for the family </garnt>
<garnt> and then New Year's is where you get </garnt>
<garnt> sloshed with your mates right right but </garnt>
<joey> in Japan it's the opposite Christmas is </joey>
<garnt> like a couple's thing or you get sloshed </garnt>
<joey> with your single friends </joey>
<garnt> I've been there yeah and New Year's is </garnt>
<garnt> when you go back home and you spend it </garnt>
<garnt> with your family all right right and so </garnt>
<garnt> like at least for me like the tradition </garnt>
<garnt> is like usually I go back to my </garnt>
<garnt> Grandma's place like a few days before </garnt>
<garnt> New Year's Eve and then we do like a big </garnt>
<garnt> like final cleanup of the house to kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like you know not to like physically </garnt>
<garnt> clean up the house but also just like to </garnt>
<joey> refresh ourselves like you know for the </joey>
<garnt> upcoming year that's what they say yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you come in and clean my house right </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's just an excuse for my grandma </joey>
<joey> to be my clean my house [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> um so I go there I clean the house and </joey>
<joey> then </joey>
<garnt> um we have this thing called </garnt>
<garnt> which is uh which is you have this bowl </garnt>
<joey> of soba uh as your final meal </joey>
<garnt> um and uh for the year not yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's uh and uh I don't remember </joey>
<garnt> what the exact reasoning behind why you </garnt>
<garnt> eat the strawberries but there's like </garnt>
<garnt> some kind of uh like traditional </garnt>
<garnt> reasoning behind why you would do it um </garnt>
<garnt> so then you would eat that and then the </garnt>
<garnt> New Years happens then you go to the </garnt>
<garnt> temple first thing in the morning </garnt>
<garnt> usually uh to do like you know your </garnt>
<garnt> first prayers and stuff like that and </garnt>
<joey> then you eat osichi which is like a type </joey>
<joey> of uh traditional Japanese like huge </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] platter of like I think like 50 </joey>
<joey> different things like small little </joey>
<joey> different things like imagine what you </joey>
<connor> get I think I've seen this you can I've </connor>
<connor> seen this to be able to book it yeah </connor>
<joey> I've seen it yeah you usually usually </joey>
<joey> you book it I mean people who are like </joey>
<connor> pros just like make it themselves </connor>
<connor> um but like uh think of like you know </connor>
<connor> like the breakfast at a dualcon think of </connor>
<connor> that by like four times yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> you share it among your entire </connor>
<joey> and it's really good but it's like it's </joey>
<connor> definitely something you can't have is </connor>
<connor> it is it like the chocolate boxes where </connor>
<joey> there's like Everyone likes a certain </joey>
<joey> the one chocolate and everyone's like </joey>
<joey> yeah I have yo can I have that yeah can </joey>
<joey> I have like that and then I'm good I </joey>
<connor> don't want the [ __ ] squid [ __ ] I'm </connor>
<joey> good yeah there's always like there's </joey>
<connor> always like two or three that are just </connor>
<connor> like untouched </connor>
<joey> looks nice it's just there for variation </joey>
<joey> help yourself </joey>
<joey> um I feel like there are some real items </joey>
<garnt> that people just buy just for like oh </garnt>
<garnt> it's just because everyone else bought </garnt>
<connor> it before yeah do you have um like </connor>
<joey> quality Street in Australia what's up </joey>

<garnt> like uh kind of like uh just a different </garnt>
<garnt> type of chocolates right it's a lot of </garnt>
<joey> these are the different colored ones yes </joey>
<connor> yeah there's like there's like a </connor>
<joey> triangle that's perfect yeah I've seen </joey>
<joey> it before I think yeah and and I think </joey>
<joey> there was a certain episode of Qi that </joey>
<joey> was like they everyone the favor pieces </joey>
<connor> that Everyone likes they purposely put </connor>
<connor> Less in the box of which is [ __ ] is </connor>
<connor> cruel it's cruel is that true yeah </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> yeah these swindled Bamboozled I was </connor>
<connor> like that's [ __ ] up bro that's just a </connor>
<garnt> waste of food man you could you could </garnt>
<garnt> have more chocolate if people are easy </garnt>
<connor> there if they don't want to put the good </connor>
<connor> stuff in because that's expensive damn </connor>

<connor> mean I didn't even know that I didn't </connor>
<connor> know that yeah after talking to God so </connor>
<joey> much I'm like ah I have to reframe how I </joey>
<connor> view the UK I'm like no no it's not the </connor>
<connor> UK it's the it's the white people it's </connor>
<connor> the white people </connor>
<connor> because I only have experienced the UK </connor>
<garnt> through the lens of white people because </garnt>
<garnt> I'm obviously White </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean it's it's kind of like me </garnt>
<connor> with Easter chocolates where I I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that this is overrated </connor>
<connor> this is I I like the Easter chocolates I </connor>
<connor> don't know why and you could you could </connor>
<connor> have like a like a cadre's Milk Bar uh </connor>
<garnt> milk chocolate bar and I'm like I will </garnt>
<garnt> buy the egg version eating it in egg </garnt>
<garnt> form I don't know just tastes makes it </garnt>
<garnt> taste so much better I don't know what </garnt>
<joey> did something about like slowly breaking </joey>
<connor> off it is it is right it is I don't know </connor>
<garnt> why this is a thing but this is so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] British that I'm saying out loud </connor>
<connor> often when you buy these uh these uh </connor>
<connor> Easter eggs in the UK they come in these </connor>
<connor> boxes for some reason they always come </connor>
<connor> with mugs </connor>
<connor> they would like you would get an Easter </connor>
<connor> egg that would come with a mug that was </connor>
<connor> branded like it was Cadbury's it would </connor>
<connor> be a mug a very cheap mug with the </connor>
<connor> Cadbury's logo on it right and this was </connor>
<connor> a thing like did you have this in </connor>
<connor> Australia so this was like it was you'd </connor>
<connor> always get the chocolate bar and a mug </connor>
<connor> do you remember this I remember this </connor>
<connor> yeah and then I realized like oh wait I </connor>
<joey> just remembered in University everyone </joey>
<joey> would bring mugs and stuff and I swear </joey>
<joey> half the [ __ ] mugs were just Easter </joey>
<joey> egg mugs because they're the cheapest </joey>
<joey> shittest mugs that your parents wouldn't </joey>
<joey> mind letting you take to you right do </joey>
<connor> you remember seeing these now all the </connor>
<connor> time in University now that you're </connor>
<garnt> mining now that you remind me I'm just </garnt>
<connor> having a lot [ __ ] yeah you're the wave I </connor>
<connor> remember I see the [ __ ] Cadbury and </connor>
<connor> KitKat logo on these [ __ ] mugs all </connor>
<garnt> the time dude it looks so [ __ ] let me </garnt>
<garnt> pull it up I'm gonna pull this up it </garnt>
<connor> looks so pathetic </connor>
<garnt> imagine Easter eggs mugs it's those ones </garnt>
<connor> it's those ones God </connor>
<connor> it would come like this it would come </connor>
<connor> like this right it's like it would it </connor>
<connor> would be the egg in the mug or like </connor>
<connor> adjacent to it and this was like I've </connor>
<connor> never seen that yeah it was everywhere </connor>
<connor> like every single [ __ ] chocolate bar </connor>
<connor> did this it was insane and now I think </connor>
<connor> about them like why the [ __ ] do we want </connor>
<connor> so many mugs this is too many mugs for </connor>
<garnt> the team yeah but I already have mugs </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's the thing about every like </garnt>
<garnt> British home there is oh there was there </garnt>
<garnt> is always an overabundance of mugs oh </garnt>
<connor> sorry it's and there's the nice mugs and </connor>
<connor> these are the shittiest the shits and if </connor>
<connor> you ever go to like a government </connor>
<joey> building or you ever go to a hospital </joey>
<joey> and or any kind of thing and you get a </joey>
<joey> cup of tea guaranteeing it's coming out </joey>
<garnt> in a mug the exact same quality as this </garnt>
<joey> one thank God because they're like </joey>
<garnt> they're like the replaceable marks yeah </garnt>
<connor> because like the actual good mugs no one </connor>
<joey> gets those no one's allowed so once </joey>
<joey> you're finished with that we just Chuck </joey>
<connor> it on the wall probably before you throw </connor>
<garnt> it away did you ever have like did your </garnt>
<garnt> household ever had like a soft tier list </garnt>
<garnt> of like mugs in your home you know you </garnt>

<garnt> I'm going to break something Jesus so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's uh it's </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it was it was it was slightly weird </garnt>
<garnt> growing up with that kind of environment </garnt>
<garnt> okay actually this is the this doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> remind me about a totally different </garnt>
<garnt> topic okay </garnt>
<garnt> decorating a room right </garnt>
<garnt> my room my house was always decorated </garnt>
<garnt> with as I said like teacups and places </garnt>
<garnt> something like that so I never really </garnt>
<garnt> got to like let's say I never really got </garnt>
<garnt> to a point where I knew what to do with </garnt>
<garnt> decorating my own room I never had </garnt>
<garnt> posters I never had like different </garnt>
<garnt> things in my room to like show my own </garnt>
<garnt> personality what like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm I'm guessing you put a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> music posters in your room and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that right I I don't even know how </garnt>
<connor> to get posters </connor>
<garnt> what do you mean how do I get them what </garnt>
<connor> do you mean just go you go to stores I </connor>
<joey> don't have money we're getting this </joey>
<joey> money from that there were like three </joey>
<connor> bucks no like the good push like five </connor>
<joey> pounds in the UK you don't get the good </joey>
<connor> ones you get the [ __ ] ones so I only </connor>
<joey> ever put shitty posters up when I came </joey>
<joey> like a magazine for free yeah and I I </joey>
<joey> think I also that's why you start off </joey>
<joey> yeah I think I got a free </joey>
<connor> a poster of Halo and like Halo Reach or </connor>
<garnt> something and I put that [ __ ] on did you </garnt>
<garnt> did you ever have trouble like </garnt>
<garnt> decorating your room in University </garnt>
<connor> because I didn't decorate my room you </connor>
<connor> didn't at all no it was a little like a </connor>
<connor> Serial Killer's room I I had nothing on </connor>
<connor> the walls nothing I I didn't get in my </connor>
<connor> head I was like why would I decorate </connor>
<garnt> like I'm leaving this room in a year oh </garnt>
<garnt> that's true that's true but I've seen </garnt>
<garnt> some University rooms and they are like </garnt>
<garnt> filled to the [ __ ] brim with like </garnt>
<garnt> different stuff and I was like how the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] are you affording this yeah I think </connor>
<garnt> I never decorated ever </garnt>
<garnt> had like one poster and that was it it </garnt>
<garnt> was okay I think I think I bought one </garnt>
<garnt> poster just so like if anyone came in </garnt>
<joey> here they wouldn't think they were going </joey>
<connor> into a super chemistry it was I think it </connor>
<joey> was like a [ __ ] start Scarface poster </joey>
<connor> I was just like let me buy something </connor>
<connor> from like the university fair and I was </connor>
<connor> like what's something I can buy that's </connor>
<garnt> cheap that would also make me feel like </garnt>
<joey> a normal person scar faces Scarface is </joey>
<joey> that poster that's on the brink of like </joey>
<joey> I'm a normal person but I'm a little bit </joey>
<joey> quirky </joey>
<connor> he was just waiting for the Wolf of Wall </connor>
<garnt> Street to come out yeah </garnt>
<joey> because I was like well </joey>
<garnt> I can't put anime on my wall that's </garnt>
<joey> that's that's that's </joey>
<joey> out of the question that just means uh </joey>
<garnt> that just means I'm just going to be </garnt>
<garnt> shunned from every social group in </garnt>
<garnt> Universe back when anime wasn't accepted </garnt>
<garnt> so I was like how do I let me pretend to </garnt>
<garnt> be a normal human let me scientifically </garnt>
<garnt> work this out what is something I can </garnt>
<garnt> put on my wall that's like oh I got a </garnt>
<garnt> little bit of Personality </garnt>
<garnt> quirky it's either Scarface or Pulp </garnt>
<garnt> Fiction </garnt>
<garnt> choices like either Scarface or Pulp </garnt>
<connor> Fiction and that was it I just always </connor>
<connor> wanted to spend my money on food so I </connor>
<garnt> thought I'm not gonna decorate my room </garnt>
<connor> it's dumb I'm also like if I'm moving </connor>
<garnt> like every year yeah what's the point in </garnt>
<connor> decorating I just put a PC in my room </connor>
<garnt> did you move every year uh yeah every </garnt>
<garnt> single year of University I moved oh </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] oh wow okay so the first year I was </connor>
<connor> in student dorms I'm in the UK I don't </connor>
<connor> know if I was in your University in mine </connor>
<connor> uh you're only allowed to be in student </connor>
<connor> dorms for one year and then you had to </connor>
<connor> find your own accommodation ah and then </connor>
<connor> obviously because like you know some </connor>
<connor> roommates dropped out and some roommates </connor>
<connor> yeah you know whatever like people </connor>
<joey> changed so I just always moved every </joey>
<connor> year yeah when I was only in University </connor>
<joey> for three years yeah so you know I was I </joey>
<joey> was living at home so I was just like </joey>
<garnt> decorating my own room like I had this </garnt>
<garnt> like weird conversation with Sydney the </garnt>
<garnt> other day </garnt>
<garnt> um because like Sydney was like Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> Cindy found this like [ __ ] up movie </garnt>
<garnt> icebergs here this kind of thing and I </garnt>
<garnt> think I've watched that we've watched </garnt>
<joey> that I think yeah it's not like the two </joey>
<garnt> and a half hour one on YouTube no she </garnt>
<garnt> just found like the image of it right oh </garnt>
<garnt> and I come home and she was like I'm I'm </garnt>
<garnt> thinking about like going through this </garnt>
<garnt> Iceberg I was like Sydney don't don't do </garnt>
<garnt> not [ __ ] do that </garnt>
<joey> um because I I I I I don't really like </joey>
<joey> horror movies and I'm not really like I </joey>
<joey> don't really have like I have morbid </joey>
<joey> curiosity but I've never I've been but </joey>
<joey> you also have a sense of reason I also </joey>
<joey> have a sense of reason as well but I </joey>
<joey> ended up I I looked at the iceberg tier </joey>
<joey> list and I ended up realizing that I've </joey>
<joey> seen a lot of this a lot of these movies </joey>
<joey> and the reason because of that uh is </joey>
<joey> because uh when I went to University </joey>
<joey> there was a phase where people like like </joey>
<joey> your roommates you always knew that I'm </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] one guy that would try to like </joey>
<joey> show you the most [ __ ] up thing that </joey>
<joey> they could find whether it be something </joey>
<joey> like a Serbian film or other like things </joey>
<joey> they found on something on like Reddit </joey>
<joey> 50 50 or something yeah and Sydney had </joey>
<garnt> just like never experienced that so I </garnt>
<connor> was like I was like realizing is this is </connor>
<garnt> this a me thing that no happened in my </garnt>
<connor> face yeah it's either in high school or </connor>
<connor> in college like you had that one yeah it </connor>
<connor> was in high school for me it was like </connor>
<connor> that one kid that was just like </connor>
<garnt> it made me wonder if it's still a phase </garnt>
<garnt> because I think it became a phase </garnt>
<garnt> because of [ __ ] like you know two girls </garnt>
<garnt> one cup and everything like that so I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like do the good old days it's it's like </garnt>
<garnt> anyone in University you know anyone in </garnt>
<garnt> college or high school is there is this </garnt>
<garnt> still a thing for sure where are you </garnt>
<joey> guys still showing each other two girls </joey>
<connor> as long as long as there's the internet </connor>
<joey> if someone wants to be a little age Lord </joey>
<connor> of course involved right that's that's </connor>
<joey> how life is God I saw some of the most </joey>
<joey> traumatic [ __ ] in high school just </joey>
<joey> because of that one [ __ ] friend yeah </joey>
<garnt> to that one friend who is not a friend </garnt>
<joey> anymore [ __ ] you like you've literally </joey>
<connor> scarred me for life of some of the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> that you've shown me yeah I do not want </joey>
<connor> to like I don't know oh no it's horrible </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> foreign </garnt>
<connor> myself up for Christmas yeah I'm gonna </connor>
<connor> gain a lot of weight on purpose I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna do it I'm gonna gain so much </connor>
<connor> weight I just eat and drink like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] on the holidays just don't </connor>
<connor> stop I I've become like no face in that </connor>
<connor> one </connor>
<connor> I've even seen that movie so I don't </connor>
<joey> even know what to happen in there well </joey>
<joey> you've never seen Spirited Away no what </joey>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> what what </connor>
<joey> are you actually serious yeah I like how </joey>
<connor> you talked about that with such </connor>
<connor> confidence and familiarity I'm like I've </connor>
<connor> seen that [ __ ] my [ __ ] no face </connor>
<connor> I've seen that gift like a billion </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] times have you actually never </joey>
<joey> seen it never seen it that's shocking </joey>
<connor> yeah for a long time I just lied and </connor>
<garnt> said I did because I I because I think I </garnt>
<garnt> remember you saying you have told me </garnt>
<connor> yeah probably probably because I was </connor>
<connor> just kind of like uh you know it's like </connor>
<connor> saying you haven't watched Death Note </connor>
<connor> right what the [ __ ] have you watch Death </connor>
<connor> Note you know it's like what I just </connor>
<connor> don't care too I've watched last night </connor>
<garnt> yeah I remember you saying you have </garnt>
<connor> watched death yeah I just lied uh I </connor>
<connor> think one time we had a conversation </connor>

<joey> why is that the one because that's </joey>
<connor> purely like driven off Nostalgia the </connor>
<connor> only Ghibli film I've watched and this </connor>
<connor> is within the past five years I only </connor>
<joey> watched as well before that I hadn't </joey>
<connor> even watched any it was like uh Howl's </connor>

<garnt> Christian Bale [ __ ] off that's </garnt>
<connor> Christians Christians what the [ __ ] you </connor>
<garnt> used to go man what can't he do what </garnt>
<connor> what can't Christian Bale do I swear to </connor>
<joey> God man he does everything I love those </joey>
<joey> moments where you're just like talking </joey>
<connor> about a movie that you love and then </connor>
<joey> someone says like yeah did you know his </joey>
<connor> voice by that guy and it's just like </connor>
<connor> I had no idea that was Christian Bale </connor>
<garnt> well it's a bit to be fair it's really </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] hard to tell he's so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> good at disappearing into the character </connor>
<garnt> yeah like I don't like he's a Welshman </garnt>
<garnt> right and I you can never tell that he's </garnt>
<garnt> a Welshman I swear he has like a </garnt>
<connor> different accent everything I think he </connor>
<connor> was born in Wales then immediately moved </connor>
<connor> to uh London I think or America he's got </connor>
<connor> a I remember he spoke about it once </connor>
<joey> right yeah I think he was born it's </joey>
<joey> funny though how so many people just </joey>
<joey> like yeah he's American right well I </joey>
<connor> mean he's so [ __ ] good at up here </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah have you watched any uh have you </garnt>
<connor> watched chainsaw man uh yeah I'm I'm uh </connor>
<joey> Nine episodes in oh my God I like you so </joey>
<connor> far it's it's a it's something man it's </connor>
<joey> I'm kind of glad that we finally got a </joey>
<connor> show that was hyped and so far has been </connor>
<connor> following through like I every episode </connor>
<joey> is a delight it's [ __ ] weird it's </joey>
<joey> just insane every episode is like a </joey>
<connor> movie budget it's it's a lot crazy the </connor>
<connor> fact that there's a different ending </connor>
<connor> every time as well like I it's kind of </connor>
<joey> insane I'm I am blown away it's [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> sweaty yeah yeah oh [ __ ] we gotta live </connor>
<joey> up to that it's kind of crazy even as </joey>
<joey> like I even if I wasn't a fan of the </joey>
<connor> show it's like you're watching it you're </connor>
<connor> like there's you just can't not be </connor>
<garnt> amazed by it like oh yeah you don't </garnt>
<garnt> enjoy it it's [ __ ] insane yeah oh the </garnt>
<connor> story is crude sometimes but let's just </connor>
<garnt> I like it I think it's fun I mean I I </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's obviously a bit edgier </garnt>
<connor> than like a lot for sure for sure it </connor>
<connor> feels like edgy yeah but I don't feel </connor>
<connor> like it's like edgy for the sake of </connor>
<connor> being like edgy like we've seen with </connor>
<connor> like some other shows you know where </connor>
<connor> just like oh this is the show that's </connor>
<garnt> aimed towards 15 year olds that you know </garnt>
<garnt> want to think they're watching something </garnt>
<joey> adult no it's clearly just like Fujimoto </joey>
<joey> just being like I don't give a [ __ ] if </joey>
<joey> people like this or not like this is </joey>
<joey> just how I'm gonna make my story and how </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna make my characters yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> the I was kind of amazed at one point </connor>
<connor> episode nine the episode before ends </connor>
<connor> with the scene and then they reused the </connor>
<connor> scene in The Next Episode but they </connor>
<connor> reanimate it very slightly entirely all </connor>
<connor> over again and I'm like okay now this is </connor>
<connor> that's too much that's just a waste like </connor>
<connor> this is insane but this is like what and </connor>
<connor> it's all insane animation like yeah it's </connor>
<connor> it's like I don't understand how how </connor>
<connor> much money or time power costing money </connor>
<connor> again I go and travel </connor>
<garnt> like I mean the amount of time money and </garnt>
<connor> effort put into this is must be another </connor>
<garnt> level like the amount talent that must </garnt>
<garnt> have gone into this is insane what blows </garnt>
<garnt> my mind is when you know when people </garnt>
<garnt> like look at something and think good </garnt>
<connor> animation they think oh the fight scene </connor>
<connor> was like good or they they think of the </connor>
<connor> fight scene like chainsaw man just looks </connor>
<connor> good in like everything the talking </connor>
<connor> scenes oh my God it's so [ __ ] every </connor>
<connor> shot is so like Dynamic right it's it's </connor>
<connor> like you know sometimes you watch an </connor>
<garnt> anime it's just like always like oh </garnt>
<garnt> basic shot for shot for sure there's </garnt>
<garnt> always that always feels like there's </garnt>
<garnt> some thought and to put some thought put </garnt>
<garnt> into how this like how this looks on </garnt>
<joey> films like what angle have we not put a </joey>
<garnt> camera at yet wait let's do it let's do </garnt>
<joey> it from there like I know you've read </joey>
<joey> the Manga but you you need to watch the </joey>
<joey> anime I am watching it oh you are </joey>
<garnt> watching it of course I I can't </garnt>
<joey> I kind of have to I don't I think I </joey>
<connor> would actually be hung in quartered </connor>
<joey> anime is so good that I'm like I really </joey>
<joey> don't want to touch the manga I'm like </joey>
<joey> this this is what I'm saying I know I </joey>
<connor> bet it is but like watching the anime </connor>
<joey> I'm like there's no first season's only </joey>
<connor> gonna end halfway so probably probably </connor>
<garnt> yeah I think the manga is as good as the </garnt>
<garnt> anime I agree I've been doing something </garnt>
<garnt> like a little quirky I've been watching </garnt>
<garnt> uh watching the anime then read in the </garnt>
<connor> manga oh okay shut the [ __ ] up guys </connor>
<connor> don't [ __ ] say that [ __ ] [ __ ] what </connor>
<connor> are you [ __ ] why the [ __ ] could you </connor>
<garnt> do that why would you do that why </garnt>
<garnt> um because why why did that because </garnt>
<garnt> anime is my medium of choice if I have a </garnt>
<joey> choice um and the anime is doing an </joey>
<joey> amazing production but I think uh </joey>
<joey> tatsuki Fujimoto the mangaka is an </joey>
<joey> absolute [ __ ] genius I agree uh he </joey>
<joey> uses manga in a way that no other manga </joey>
<joey> artists I think has done he has such a </joey>
<garnt> unique way of conveying like his ideas </garnt>
<garnt> and emotions and it's a way that is </garnt>
<garnt> impossible to replicate in any other </garnt>
<garnt> medium because he's able to draw it in a </garnt>
<garnt> way that looks and feels cinematic yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which I think is really hard to do in </garnt>
<garnt> the medium of manga like because you </garnt>
<garnt> know again it's like a lot like with a </garnt>
<connor> lot of anime it's like you have your bog </connor>
<garnt> standard like you know flow of panels </garnt>
<connor> and like you know maybe every now and </connor>
<connor> then there'll be an artist they'll be </connor>
<connor> like Oh I'm gonna draw outside of the </connor>
<connor> panel like literally outside of the </connor>
<connor> panel to kind of add like Dynamic to it </connor>
<connor> but like fujimota just kind of draws it </connor>
<joey> in a way where it's just like </joey>
<joey> this flows in a really smooth way but </joey>
<joey> it's also a really strange feeling yeah </joey>
<garnt> at the same time like now that I've like </garnt>
<garnt> read like what's been adapted so far and </garnt>
<garnt> uh in in the manga I'm like how the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> does tatsuki Fujimoto have better </garnt>
<garnt> comedic timing in the manga which has no </garnt>
<garnt> comedic timing than in the anime right </garnt>
<garnt> it's he he's the job he's done with is </garnt>
<garnt> like the way he's like paneled and laid </garnt>
<garnt> out his page it like this the scenes in </garnt>
<garnt> among there are like some funny scenes </garnt>
<garnt> that are like way funnier I think in the </garnt>
<garnt> manga than in the anime </garnt>
<garnt> um and it's just because of the way that </garnt>
<connor> he's kind of like timed it really well </connor>
<connor> with how like you turn the page and </connor>
<connor> stuff like you have any examples that </connor>
<connor> you might be able to think of um I can't </connor>
<connor> think of off the top of my head if you </connor>
<garnt> did yeah I think there's there's a few </garnt>
<garnt> things that I think have like are </garnt>
<garnt> impossible to translate to the anime </garnt>
<garnt> like one of one thing I can think of is </garnt>
<garnt> um how can I say this without spoiling </garnt>
<garnt> anything that happens </garnt>
<garnt> so there is there is a weapon that </garnt>
<garnt> involves a nail right uh if if you've </garnt>
<connor> what if you're like you you've nine I'm </connor>
<garnt> on episode nine episode you should have </garnt>
<garnt> seen it then there's a there's a weapon </garnt>
<garnt> that involves a nail </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's it's like it's like a demon </garnt>
<connor> kind of thing right a nail as in this </connor>
<garnt> nail </garnt>
<connor> okay all right </connor>
<connor> no I haven't I don't know I don't oh </connor>
<connor> this nail oh I'm doing something that </connor>
<connor> involves this obviously something that </connor>
<connor> involves this </connor>
<garnt> yeah you definitely have </garnt>
<garnt> have I yeah maybe did you think it was a </garnt>
<connor> sword </connor>
<connor> maybe it was a sword </connor>
<connor> maybe you should I [ __ ] I don't know </connor>
<garnt> all right okay we'll carry on yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but uh there's a scene where he uses </garnt>
<garnt> this weapon </garnt>
<garnt> um and obviously it's a weapon that's </garnt>
<garnt> like infused with a demon right yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> there's this there's this like really </garnt>
<garnt> cool panel where </garnt>
<garnt> um like to use this weapon you have to </garnt>
<garnt> have a contract with a devil that's what </garnt>
<garnt> every that's what every weapon is right </garnt>
<garnt> and so how he portrays that this weapon </garnt>
<garnt> is controlled by this devil is that you </garnt>
<garnt> have you have like the normal panels and </garnt>
<garnt> that's how it is throughout the entire </garnt>
<garnt> manga every comic book and then when he </garnt>
<connor> uses this uh when he uses weapon the a </connor>
<connor> finger just appears from that goes from </connor>
<connor> like outside of like the Box panels </connor>
<connor> right and so it kind of like flicks from </connor>
<connor> out of frame into frame and you're like </connor>
<connor> it's cool oh that's really [ __ ] cool </connor>
<connor> to be like oh there's something that's </connor>
<connor> being like called out from like outside </connor>
<connor> this world and [ __ ] like that and I'm </connor>
<connor> like you can't really do that in anime </connor>
<connor> because it's it's you know okay I don't </connor>
<connor> have boxes and [ __ ] like that but it's </connor>
<connor> like small things like that where he </connor>
<connor> really thinks about how do I like how do </connor>
<connor> I how do I do something that it's really </connor>
<connor> cool that only manga can do and he does </connor>
<connor> this in not just like me not just </connor>
<connor> chainsaw man but pretty much everything </connor>
<connor> I've read from him he does something </connor>
<connor> unique to manga that I've not seen </connor>
<joey> anywhere else </joey>
<joey> um and that's true especially if you've </joey>
<joey> not read like I would highly recommend </joey>
<joey> goodbye Arie which is like one shot you </joey>
<joey> can read that okay within like that is </joey>
<joey> so genius yeah and I was like I've never </joey>
<garnt> I've never read something that is just </garnt>
<garnt> like so it's it's a masterpiece in my </garnt>
<connor> mind so [ __ ] genius yeah I mean yeah </connor>
<garnt> gentleman I've loved it so far I think </garnt>
<garnt> it yeah it's it's crazy to see uh </garnt>
<garnt> because again we've had hyped up shows </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't think we've had a show </garnt>
<garnt> that's been this hyped up in so long I </garnt>
<garnt> don't think ever yeah and um yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> insane to see it kind of meeting it and </connor>
<garnt> kind of crushing it because it goes I </garnt>
<garnt> was a bit worried because I remember </garnt>
<connor> watching like the first six episodes I'm </connor>
<connor> like this is cool but it's kind of like </connor>
<garnt> your standard yeah standard affair right </garnt>
<connor> now yeah from episode like five six </connor>
<garnt> onwards it definitely got way more </garnt>
<connor> excited yeah </connor>
<connor> um and it's been like so fun watching it </connor>
<garnt> yeah but also I'm sad that I have to </garnt>
<garnt> wait every week uh I'm I'm sad that </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna have to wait for a season </garnt>
<joey> two yeah hopefully hopefully </joey>
<connor> is the manga finished uh part one of the </connor>
<connor> manga is finished so he's currently </connor>
<connor> writing so he went on a little bit of a </connor>
<joey> break after part one and now he's </joey>
<connor> starting up part two again oh okay yeah </connor>
<connor> I did get a chuckle out of I guess it's </connor>
<connor> not really spoiler but like at one point </connor>
<connor> that like the name of a demon is is </connor>
<connor> means it's strength or something and </connor>
<connor> they're like what's what's the scariest </connor>
<garnt> thing a chainsaw in a garden I was like </garnt>
<garnt> what I was like what </garnt>
<garnt> you have this like really intensely like </garnt>
<garnt> really edgy built up world they're like </garnt>
<garnt> gun strong </garnt>
<garnt> I was like all right that stuff doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> really spoil anything it's just yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's just funny even like I was like </connor>
<garnt> what yeah I don't think it's not wrong </garnt>
<connor> but things just get more and more </connor>
<connor> intense in the morning </connor>
<joey> I've never watched the show and actually </joey>
<connor> said what the [ __ ] out loud so many </connor>
<joey> times like this [ __ ] happens you're like </joey>
<connor> God and the second half of the manga is </connor>
<connor> just like I believe it I believe it's </connor>
<joey> like the last two or three volumes are </joey>
<connor> just insane I'm just like I don't what </connor>
<connor> I'm I'm very happy I'm very excited uh </connor>
<garnt> wait is it 12 episodes they're doing or </garnt>
<joey> 12 episodes [ __ ] I know I know in fact </joey>
<joey> the 24th I know bring back the two core </joey>
<joey> okay I'll take the same ending let's </joey>
<joey> just get a few more episodes in come on </joey>
<connor> that's like a whole episode of Animation </connor>
<connor> we can do come on let's get more </connor>
<connor> episodes I don't need the ending every </connor>
<garnt> time the time yeah yeah I really hope we </garnt>
<connor> don't have to wait too long for another </connor>
<connor> season because it's I think we are this </connor>
<garnt> is I think we are if there was it's been </garnt>
<garnt> a while since I've watched a show and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like 12 up that's that's it that's </garnt>
<connor> it 12 episodes I've never been breaked </connor>
<connor> up through the entire show like that </connor>
<connor> before yeah like from start to finish </connor>
<connor> like the food I'm like I'm Rock Solid </connor>
<joey> when they show food in the show the food </joey>
<joey> looks so good that's perfect I've never </joey>
<garnt> been more [ __ ] bricked up watching a </garnt>
<joey> hand-holding scene oh right right holy </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] man like talk about like Awakening </garnt>
<garnt> something I'm like I thought this was a </garnt>
<garnt> meme I thought hand holding hands I was </garnt>
<garnt> a meme man they actually [ __ ] made it </garnt>
<joey> a thing dude every character has awoke </joey>
<connor> with something you never wants yeah it's </connor>
<connor> I've never I'm impressed that they've </connor>
<connor> managed to make a character who is that </connor>
<connor> horny likable I I figured anyone that </connor>
<connor> horny in real life would would uh sorry </connor>
<connor> in any show normally if a character is </connor>
<connor> just super horny it's like like meliodas </connor>
<joey> yeah I [ __ ] hate them yeah they </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] suck but that's the thing that </joey>
<joey> that's what another thing with Fujimoto </joey>
<joey> that I think is genius is that like not </joey>
<joey> just chainsaw man but everything he's </joey>
<joey> written every character is an absolute </joey>
<joey> piece of [ __ ] yeah but he's somehow able </joey>
<joey> to turn these absolute [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> detestable piece of [ __ ] characters </joey>
<connor> likable well it's like in real in real </connor>
<connor> life right most people agree like most </connor>
<connor> people do bad things so they do good </connor>
<connor> things right so it's like if you can </connor>
<connor> kind of channel that and I feel like </connor>
<connor> that's where it's it's doing that great </connor>
<connor> like it so far changed some man all the </connor>
<connor> characters don't feel like they good bad </connor>
<joey> it's like all right you know they're </joey>
<joey> again maybe they've got a lot of </joey>
<connor> problems maybe maybe they're a bad </connor>
<joey> person but they do some good things but </joey>
<joey> I've seen I've also seen a lot of anime </joey>
<connor> where they just like they try and make </connor>
<connor> like a like a purposeful like shitty </connor>
<connor> character right yeah like oh okay you </connor>
<connor> know all the all the edgy people are </connor>
<joey> gonna enjoy this one and then it just </joey>
<connor> ends up being extremely annoying yeah I </connor>
<connor> mean this could easily be like a Mirai </connor>
<joey> Nikki situation exactly it's like haha </joey>
<joey> Edge </joey>
<connor> everyone is shitty everyone 20 and we're </connor>
<connor> all gonna stab each other and it's like </connor>
<garnt> all right well it's it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> it's I I think he strikes that perfect </garnt>
<joey> balance where he pretty much every </joey>
<connor> character and change the mind it's kind </connor>
<joey> of like an [ __ ] yeah absolutely but </joey>
<connor> yeah it's like it's like an entertaining </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] because they're all trying to </garnt>
<garnt> survive right yeah so it's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> how would you act if you had to survive </garnt>
<garnt> yeah in this in this world that is very </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up yeah like like just like I </garnt>
<connor> remember the scene where they were all </connor>
<connor> like trapped in the building together oh </connor>
<connor> yeah just [ __ ] chaos and I was just </connor>
<garnt> like I was just like it feels like </garnt>
<garnt> watching a scene from Always Sunny in </garnt>
<garnt> Philadelphia </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> because it was just like why am I having </connor>
<joey> such a good time just seeing these guys </joey>
<joey> try to survive it's it's been </joey>
<joey> complaining yeah they're in like a life </joey>
<garnt> and death situation and they're just </garnt>
<connor> like it's just [ __ ] bands man just </connor>
<joey> when Danger's like I'm going to sleep </joey>
<connor> I [ __ ] love that scene it's like bro </connor>
<garnt> who's that scene where uh one of the </garnt>
<garnt> girls like freaking out I would just </garnt>
<garnt> like like burst like full-on burst out </garnt>
<garnt> laughing and I was just like what it's </garnt>
<garnt> just it's just [ __ ] it's a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> riot man so good oh it's yeah it's been </connor>
<garnt> a long time since I've been this excited </garnt>
<connor> for an anime I just hope they don't give </connor>
<connor> me a reason to ever dislike the show so </connor>
<garnt> far I'm pretty happy yeah to be honest </garnt>
<garnt> nah I mean even the second half as </garnt>
<garnt> chaotic as it gets like it's just so </garnt>
<joey> intense and insane where it's just like </joey>
<garnt> of course this is how it is and I think </garnt>
<garnt> like the like complaints about CG that </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen on Twitter </garnt>
<connor> oh no dude there's like barely any CG </connor>
<connor> and then when it is it's like it's good </connor>
<connor> I think the most awkward looking shots </connor>
<connor> were like in episode one yeah and then </connor>
<connor> like they still use CG in like other </connor>
<connor> flies and it just they've managed to </connor>
<connor> blend it a lot better but even in </connor>
<garnt> episode one it was like it looked a bit </garnt>
<garnt> dodgy here and there like a few shorts </garnt>
<garnt> but didn't look bad you know I've seen </garnt>
<garnt> bad CG I've seen Exxon </garnt>
<joey> I've seen extra </joey>
<connor> she's watching it I was like this should </connor>
<connor> be such a different show from set in </connor>
<connor> America </connor>
<connor> wait what do you mean okay okay very </connor>
<connor> very quick kind of I guess life spoiler </connor>
<connor> not really yeah there's like a whole </connor>
<connor> scene where there's a bunch of guns </connor>
<garnt> involved I was like they were like the </garnt>
<garnt> superpower is gone I was like I was like </garnt>
<garnt> well yeah I guess that makes sense that </garnt>
<garnt> makes sense and I was like this this is </garnt>
<connor> an America this would be really </connor>
<connor> different by now this would be a really </connor>
<joey> different show </joey>
<joey> my superpower is gone there's literally </joey>
<garnt> like a scene in the video he's like </garnt>
<garnt> everything gun beats everything and I </garnt>
<garnt> was like yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> miniguns are legal in Texas </connor>
<connor> this finna will be 12 episodes in </connor>
<connor> America dude oh my God no this is fun it </connor>
<connor> was just a good time it's just fun it </connor>
<garnt> was fun oh my God so many shows in anime </garnt>
<garnt> are </garnt>
<garnt> very much saved by the fact they're set </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan because there are no guns yeah </garnt>
<garnt> if they were in America could you </garnt>
<garnt> imagine if my hero Academia was set in </garnt>
<garnt> America it's like go save him Deku oh </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] he's got an AK </garnt>
<garnt> a porn might be like oh no back again </garnt>
<connor> was shot by a Barrett 50 caliber he </connor>
<connor> can't recover yeah Fortnight yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah I just I just I just it just made </connor>
<garnt> me realize how many shows are more </garnt>
<garnt> believable in terms of realistic </garnt>
<joey> somewhat because they're not because </joey>
<connor> they're set in Japan yeah yeah you get </connor>
<joey> away with this because you're in Japan </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah you wouldn't need a superhero </joey>
<connor> organization was an American death note </connor>
<connor> if there was just guns as well like if </connor>
<connor> there was more guns like Al just had a </connor>
<connor> gun the entire time which I feel would </connor>
<connor> have been way shorter like no </connor>
<joey> it's like oh you're Kira </joey>
<garnt> are you like so many it just made me </garnt>
<garnt> realize how many shows could have been </garnt>
<garnt> quicker if there was Guns yeah </garnt>
<connor> basically you've just like erased every </connor>
<garnt> Shonen from existence </garnt>
<connor> Kuroko no basket you know but he hasn't </connor>
<connor> gone </connor>
<connor> I I watched um I obviously I've read all </connor>
<connor> uh all of the parts of Jojo except for </connor>
<connor> the last part </connor>
<connor> um and I I was re-watching uh Stone </connor>
<connor> ocean and I remember I was like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> there is a whole part about lynching in </connor>
<connor> it yeah and I was like that's I and I </connor>
<connor> was watching I was like this is weird </connor>
<connor> watching this in Japanese </connor>
<connor> with like an over-the-top narrated </connor>
<connor> narrating about how somebody you know </connor>
<connor> how about like racial tensions in </connor>
<garnt> Florida I was like this is really weird </garnt>
<connor> and I was like I don't remember that </connor>
<connor> yeah right there's a whole there's a </connor>
<connor> character's whole backstory where a </connor>
<connor> character you know uh was Lynch and it </connor>
<connor> was talking about how racist and it was </connor>
<connor> really odd because the narrator narrates </connor>
<garnt> about racism in Florida and it was very </garnt>
<garnt> weird seeing them how they handled </garnt>
<garnt> narrating it in Japanese yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because it was um I can't remember how </garnt>
<garnt> they did it but I remember it was a bit </garnt>
<connor> odd yeah and I was like yeah I guess </connor>
<connor> there's one way of mentioning how it all </connor>
<joey> works that is yeah that does that is </joey>
<joey> that is what happened yeah that is what </joey>
<joey> happened it was just kind of like a </joey>
<joey> normal anime thing and then it goes but </joey>
<connor> did you forget that this is 19th 1980s </connor>
<connor> Florida and this racial Prejudice is </connor>
<connor> like whoa Iraqi where is this coming </connor>
<joey> from what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Rocky watched 12 years of slave </joey>
<connor> we just it was just like funny Plankton </connor>
<joey> go he he punching and then it goes and </joey>
<joey> then it just goes straight into that and </joey>
<joey> you're like what the [ __ ] it's like a </joey>
<joey> documentary yeah it was just kind of </joey>
<joey> like whoa Iraqi like and just seeing it </joey>
<garnt> animated just reminded me like oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah yeah okay this is this is set </garnt>
<garnt> in America they really wanted to use </garnt>
<connor> that setting here that was all right </connor>
<garnt> okay all right a bit intense yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because like every time every time I've </garnt>
<connor> seen like portrayals of like say like </connor>
<connor> racism in uh anime and manga it's always </connor>
<connor> tough it's always tough right it's it's </connor>
<connor> yeah it's always tough and especially </connor>
<connor> like real like seeing like Jojo part six </connor>
<connor> you know in we've we've seen we've seen </connor>
<connor> stories portrayed </connor>
<connor> um you know in Western media and </connor>
<connor> something and I still I feel like </connor>
<connor> there's like a kind of like it's </connor>
<connor> powerful but it's also if it said in the </connor>
<connor> modern day it can be like subtle as well </connor>
<connor> you know yeah but every every time I see </connor>
<connor> it in [ __ ] anime and manga it's </connor>
<garnt> always the most in your face look at </garnt>
<garnt> racism this is racism I think because </garnt>
<connor> like if you if you go back and look at </connor>
<connor> movies of like 2000s and 90s yeah that </connor>
<garnt> was kind of how you know a lot of these </garnt>
<connor> big Hollywood Productions are kind of </connor>
<connor> portraying racism it's like look we can </connor>
<connor> solve it with a movie and a good speech </connor>
<connor> like it's it's fixed yeah and I think </connor>
<connor> that that kind of way of looking at it </connor>
<connor> was kind of because obviously the </connor>
<connor> conversation isn't nearly as prevalent </connor>
<connor> here in Japan yeah things like that kind </connor>
<connor> of way of viewing it and talking about </connor>
<connor> it was kind of taken into how anime does </connor>
<connor> it yeah or sometimes it's just flat a </connor>
<garnt> racist in anime like gants that's just </garnt>
<joey> weird yeah like that I mean you know </joey>
<joey> that happens in anime sometimes my </joey>
<joey> favorite is the Last Arc initial 21. </joey>
<joey> that one is so poorly yeah it's not good </joey>
<connor> it's very nice and it's very nice it's </connor>
<joey> ashamed it's like damn it like it's such </joey>
<connor> a good artist obviously like this stuff </connor>
<joey> was was written at a time when this was </joey>
<joey> barely a conversation in in the west </joey>
<joey> yeah like Stone ocean was written I </joey>
<joey> think early 2000s 2003 right before this </joey>
<garnt> was this this conversation was like you </garnt>
<garnt> know barely started in the western world </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then now looking at it through </garnt>
<garnt> our modern lens of how we view it and </garnt>
<garnt> how we talk about these topics it's like </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah that's a bit yeah I mean it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like the way okay but by the </garnt>
<garnt> way it's not bad in JoJo right it's I'm </garnt>
<connor> just it's just like you you're reading </connor>
<connor> it or you're watching it and you're like </connor>
<connor> it is a bit like weirdly shoved in it's </connor>
<garnt> it's been shoe horny it's yeah it feels </garnt>
<connor> like it feels very it comes out of my </connor>
<garnt> face it comes out of it he really I </garnt>
<garnt> remember watching the episode and I was </garnt>
<connor> just like Wow have you read the Manga I </connor>
<garnt> haven't read she didn't know that was </garnt>
<garnt> coming no no it was coming and I was </garnt>
<garnt> still like oh my God </garnt>
<garnt> sorry I'm watching JoJo part six </garnt>
<garnt> watching a [ __ ] span battle get </garnt>
<garnt> against women </garnt>
<garnt> racism I was like what JoJo what the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> it was narrated as well and the narrator </connor>
<garnt> talks about it in a very weird way I </garnt>
<connor> think it felt like it was very uh I </connor>
<connor> don't even know how to describe it it's </connor>
<connor> just odd it was odd yeah I was watching </connor>
<connor> it and I even know what was happening </connor>
<connor> and I was like Yep this is as weird as I </connor>
<garnt> remember it being yeah this is a bit odd </garnt>
<garnt> it's really weird that the two portrait </garnt>
<garnt> the two big portrayals of racism in </garnt>
<garnt> anime manga that I remember one is now </garnt>
<connor> like Jojo the other one is like domestic </connor>
<garnt> girlfriends what what yeah because the </garnt>
<connor> uh there's there's an arc there's an arc </connor>
<connor> where one of the girls uh goes to </connor>
<joey> America to uh to to uh I was a mommy or </joey>
<joey> whatever her name was it's rui oh no I'm </joey>
<joey> thinking of Randy girlfriend </joey>
<garnt> uh it's uh so she goes to America to go </garnt>
<garnt> learn how to be a chef and be a cook and </garnt>
<connor> she goes uh to America to a culinary </connor>
<connor> school and uh she the best way I can </connor>
<connor> describe it is she encounters racism and </connor>
<connor> it's not subtle all racism at all it's </connor>
<connor> very very in your face it's almost </connor>
<joey> pretty much the same level of what I saw </joey>
<joey> in Jojo and it was it just put things </joey>
<joey> into perspective of me as like you know </joey>
<connor> it's like it's really good that </connor>
<connor> there are these portrayals and Anime I </connor>
<connor> think it's good it's just also it's it </connor>
<connor> it's very jarring it's very jarring </connor>
<connor> considering what's you know the stories </connor>
<garnt> I've seen told in like Western Street </garnt>
<garnt> domestic girlfriend yeah a domestic </garnt>
<connor> girlfriend she's like this is not this </connor>
<connor> is like </connor>
<garnt> it'd be like watching a Thomas the Tank </garnt>
<garnt> and then suddenly it's like hardcore </garnt>
<garnt> racism it's like whoa oh it's like we </garnt>
<connor> don't we don't talk to the cars Thomas </connor>
<garnt> we don't [ __ ] with those it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> so jarring and I I just was not prepared </garnt>
<garnt> for it and I wouldn't even call it like </garnt>
<garnt> subtle yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but at least you know at least it's </garnt>
<garnt> happening you know at least it's </garnt>
<connor> happening yeah again I don't think I'm </connor>
<garnt> not trying to be like no no this </garnt>
<garnt> conversations can't have an anime it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like I think sometimes it's it </garnt>
<joey> needs to be implemented a little a </joey>
<joey> little subtle a little more in a way </joey>
<joey> where it doesn't feel like there was </joey>
<joey> because there was nothing in JoJo or </joey>
<joey> even remotely about like yeah racism at </joey>
<joey> all or any of those things and then boom </joey>
<joey> they just throw it in there it's like </joey>
<joey> whoa and it only happens once yeah it </joey>
<connor> just happened once never comes up again </connor>
<connor> it's like there was yeah there's like I </connor>
<garnt> mean for the characters it's a big thing </garnt>
<garnt> and I I like the character and I like </garnt>
<connor> how they're all worked into it it just </connor>
<connor> kind of came out of nowhere </connor>
<connor> um but it was cool I I like I again I </connor>
<garnt> like Jojo a lot </garnt>
<garnt> racism </garnt>
<connor> I I like it when anime tries to go into </connor>
<connor> this stuff and tries to be more mature </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah it wasn't I showed as well </garnt>
<joey> wasn't it well well I still did it in a </joey>
<garnt> way that was very not cool no that </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't cool I'm trying to think of like </garnt>
<connor> yeah there's just some it's just like </connor>
<garnt> okay come on let's have let's have more </garnt>
<garnt> characters like you know like I see I I </garnt>
<joey> A lot of people are like no I don't want </joey>
<joey> any diversity in my shows I'm like yeah </joey>
<joey> dude [ __ ] it yeah let's have more </joey>
<connor> diversity and sure like if it lends to </connor>
<joey> the story well let's [ __ ] do it if </joey>
<joey> it's not jarrant to the story and you </joey>
<joey> can implement it in a way that seems </joey>
<connor> natural then hell yeah I was like shield </connor>
<connor> 21 was just like dude it is a black guy </connor>
<connor> playing sports he must be amazing at </connor>
<connor> them it's like what that is not how you </connor>
<connor> introduce a character that is not that </connor>
<garnt> is not how you introduce anyone it's </garnt>
<garnt> flat out I I think it was just the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that they basically gave him a </garnt>
<garnt> superpower and his superpower was yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he was he was black and I was just </garnt>
<garnt> like what </garnt>
<garnt> I Shield what what are you doing it's </garnt>
<connor> just like that Meme of like the the guy </connor>
<garnt> with his like smiling and then his mouth </garnt>
<garnt> drops it's like yeah more diversity </garnt>
<connor> Anatomy yeah oh I found out why this </connor>
<connor> diversity oh no </connor>
<connor> you know I feel like summer it's you </connor>
<joey> could make some really [ __ ] cool </joey>
<joey> stories with it just be be like better </joey>
<joey> with it like don't just do it don't </joey>
<joey> shoot don't shove it and don't shove it </joey>
<connor> just in a racist way in a racist way </connor>
<garnt> yeah well I mean I mean it's cool you </garnt>
<garnt> know if we see these kinds of like </garnt>
<connor> portrayals because it means like there </connor>
<connor> is some kind of conversation happening </connor>
<connor> in Japan yeah it just you know it seems </connor>
<connor> pretty cool to have that yeah yeah it's </connor>
<connor> just seeing it you obviously see that </connor>
<garnt> the conversation is like not as like </garnt>
<garnt> far-flung as what we've had in the west </garnt>
<joey> no because in Japan it's not so much </joey>
<joey> about like targeting a specific race </joey>
<joey> it's about targeting all Races yeah </joey>
<joey> essentially a lot of times people </joey>
<connor> complain that there's not enough </connor>
<connor> diversity in uh on anime and stuff I see </connor>
<connor> a lot of people like well it's for </connor>
<connor> Japanese people there you know what do </connor>
<connor> you mean what do you expect for them I </connor>
<connor> mean yes Japan is very homogeneous but </connor>
<connor> it's not like there's no diversity no </connor>
<connor> it's like pretending like other other </connor>
<connor> like ethnicities don't exist here yeah </connor>
<connor> it's just flat out wrong like yeah Joey </connor>
<joey> is a hopper like you know what I mean </joey>
<connor> like straight up just not true they </connor>
<joey> always say like it doesn't exist in </joey>
<joey> Japan or is you know that's the problem </joey>
<joey> it's like it's such a small minority </joey>
<connor> even in Japan and I think in in the eyes </connor>
<connor> of like the the Manga and Anime </connor>
<connor> Industries just like oh okay yeah we </connor>
<garnt> know they exist but are they a market </garnt>
<garnt> that reads monger and watches anime yeah </garnt>
<garnt> we don't know so instead of just </garnt>
<garnt> pertaining to the one percent let's try </garnt>
<connor> and just make the 99 happy and it's like </connor>
<connor> okay yeah you can do that if you want </connor>
<joey> but again you're gonna start running </joey>
<connor> into problems like I shielded yeah I'm </connor>
<connor> not saying just start shoving it in like </connor>
<connor> crazy to meet quotas or anything like </connor>
<connor> that because that has clearly not been a </connor>
<connor> solution anyway if the story lends well </connor>
<garnt> to it let's [ __ ] do it because it </garnt>
<garnt> makes sense right like just like a </garnt>
<garnt> pattern I've seen in all of these things </garnt>
<garnt> that we just mentioned is that does the </garnt>
<garnt> anime or Manga have an America Arc you </garnt>
<garnt> don't need to put racism in it just </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like has an America you do </garnt>
<joey> yeah manga artists need to understand </joey>
<garnt> racism exists outside of America as well </garnt>
<connor> it's not exclusive to America it's an </connor>
<connor> American exclusive </connor>
<garnt> oh my God </garnt>
<connor> what a great way to end trash taste </connor>
<garnt> steps okay talking about races you gotta </garnt>
<joey> love it hey but uh look at all these </joey>
<joey> patrons right here they don't laugh at </joey>
<garnt> racism </garnt>
<connor> what is that right guys I bet you don't </connor>
