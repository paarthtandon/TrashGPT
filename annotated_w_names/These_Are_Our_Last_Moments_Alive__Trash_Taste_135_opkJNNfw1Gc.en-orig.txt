<joey> that kind of a pink one pink one what </joey>
<garnt> are you a girl what do you uh </garnt>
<joey> lady makes a great color man who are you </joey>
<joey> trying to justify this to I'm trying to </joey>
<joey> tell all the alpha males watching this </joey>
<joey> beginning part no one watches us pink is </joey>
<joey> a man it's a lie it's all dead </joey>
<garnt> hello and welcome to this episode of </garnt>
<garnt> trash taste I'm your host for today gone </garnt>
<garnt> and once again joining me are the boys </garnt>
<connor> right now </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> is pink a manly color I guess we're </garnt>
<connor> starting on that [ __ ] topic uh why </connor>
<connor> why why why is this the chance this is </connor>
<joey> the eye generated </joey>
<garnt> yes is the answer yes hello hello AI </garnt>
<joey> generation yes answer and I will tell </joey>
<connor> you exactly why that is I'm Googling </connor>
<connor> best podcast topics right now let's see </connor>
<connor> what comes up best podcast topics we </connor>
<garnt> should we should do we we should do an </garnt>
<garnt> episode where it's completely AI </garnt>
<garnt> generated actually because I was I was </garnt>
<connor> actually having a play with a chat GPT </connor>
<connor> the other day yeah uh which is like the </connor>
<connor> newest kind of like AI opens I don't </connor>
<connor> know if it's open source but it's like </connor>
<connor> available to the public right yeah um </connor>
<connor> and it's basically by open AI which is a </connor>
<joey> company that was founded by Elon Musk so </joey>
<joey> you know you know </joey>
<connor> the real-life Batman villain Elon Musk </connor>
<garnt> it is scarily good it was it is actually </garnt>
<connor> kind of terrifying and well you know </connor>
<connor> when I when you say that I think back to </connor>
<connor> it and I think about all the videos I've </connor>
<connor> watched where a Skyrim NPC Behavior I </connor>
<connor> think are we really that hard to emulate </connor>
<connor> I don't think we're that hard to emulate </connor>
<connor> we're pretty [ __ ] yourself it's a </connor>
<joey> high IQ person yeah life is I I mean </joey>
<joey> like as a record is it hard to seem </joey>
<connor> somewhat human if you you know feed it </connor>
<connor> enough books and [ __ ] well well I mean </connor>
<joey> isn't that the whole point of like the </joey>
<connor> touring test yeah yeah like well I mean </connor>
<connor> we're all like also by the way I would </connor>
<connor> like to talk about kids programming as </connor>
<joey> well I completely unrelated to my Google </joey>
<connor> search wait what that was one of the </connor>
<joey> recommended topics for a podcast kids </joey>
<connor> programming kids programs obviously the </connor>
<joey> absolute State the absolute [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> state of kids programs please indulge Us </joey>
<garnt> in what I'm sorry the state of kids I </garnt>
<garnt> don't watch YouTube kids actually thank </garnt>
<connor> you very much I get pissed off on </connor>
<connor> YouTube and it tells me as a kid so I'm </connor>
<joey> like this is clearly not for kids </joey>
<joey> myself hold on pause was that really the </joey>
<connor> top oh that was one of them yeah so </connor>
<connor> here's what they recommended talking no </connor>
<connor> I I know the top podcaster q a is </connor>
<connor> fortnite actually overrated </connor>
<joey> topic ideas uh uh q a so we should do </joey>
<joey> that questions and answers ask me a </joey>
<connor> question yeah okay I'll ask you a </connor>
<connor> question sure our entire podcast is a </connor>
<connor> question okay isn't that paranormal do </connor>
<connor> you have good questions no we've done </connor>
<joey> we've done paranormal we've done </joey>
<joey> paranormal True Crime we spoke about </joey>
<joey> that yeah personal finance I'm not good </joey>
<joey> at it </joey>
<joey> what a riveting topic </joey>
<connor> we should do this one guided meditations </connor>
<connor> I think we should do that what do you </connor>
<connor> mean like we should guide the viewers </connor>
<connor> how to meditate do you meditate [ __ ] no </connor>
<connor> I don't have to be a a singer to judge </connor>
<garnt> singing right I was probably the only </garnt>
<connor> person here that has actually meditated </connor>
<connor> yeah it's not that hard </connor>
<joey> um </joey>
<connor> kids programming time specific and </connor>
<joey> finally event planning event planning </joey>
<connor> event planning that sounds like a job </connor>
<joey> event planning guys I love I heck in </joey>
<connor> love planning events I just I just want </connor>
<connor> to plan events like birthday parties I </connor>
<joey> feel like that list was held together by </joey>
<joey> someone who's never done or watched a </joey>
<connor> podcast again so that was probably </connor>
<joey> written by a human being it was probably </joey>
<joey> written by Ai and like the AI would </joey>
<garnt> probably make more interesting AI topics </garnt>
<joey> right probably yeah so is it really that </joey>
<connor> hard to emulate human beings I don't </connor>
<garnt> know I guess we'll test it out future </garnt>
<connor> yeah I guess we'll test out on a future </connor>
<connor> episode but no like I was playing around </connor>
<connor> with chat GPT yeah um and like I think </connor>
<connor> the people I you know because our entire </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] uh lives are now run by AI </joey>
<joey> simply because I you know started </joey>
<joey> looking into chap gbt now my entire </joey>
<joey> recommended on YouTube is all cha GPT </joey>
<joey> just because that's what YouTube thinks </joey>
<joey> that our AI is </joey>
<joey> yeah and it's actually like terrifying </joey>
<joey> for </joey>
<joey> I think program is right now software </joey>
<joey> Engineers like the amount like charge </joey>
<joey> EPT as a resource not just like it's </joey>
<joey> it's kind of like an all-encompassing a </joey>
<joey> AI you can ask it like scarily uh </joey>
<joey> scarily like human questions and it will </joey>
<joey> like literally type out an entire essay </joey>
<joey> it can do your homework for you yeah if </joey>
<joey> if you are if you if you type out like </joey>
<joey> the right prompts and everything like </joey>
<joey> that I tested it out </joey>
<joey> and I I typed in Tyler can you write a </joey>
<joey> gig Up Style review of Full Metal </joey>
<garnt> Alchemist right and uh that that is that </garnt>
<garnt> is around 10 minutes long right right </garnt>
<garnt> and at first the first iteration it </garnt>
<garnt> types it out and it's like a kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like generic review and then I was like </garnt>
<garnt> oh try adding like a few jokes here and </garnt>
<garnt> there try referring to this try </garnt>
<garnt> referring to that it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> actually [ __ ] freaked me out right </garnt>
<garnt> because it started adding jokes you know </garnt>
<connor> like if you're familiar with my content </connor>
<connor> sometimes I do like little skits where </connor>
<joey> like some guy shouts in the background </joey>
<connor> and stuff like that chargpt added that </connor>
<joey> to the script I was like what the actual </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] this is my my job is done my job is </connor>
<connor> actually done like it's this if if an AI </connor>
<garnt> can like take my style of videos and </garnt>
<garnt> emulate it in the most basic sense now </garnt>
<garnt> What's it gonna be like [ __ ] five ten </garnt>
<joey> years in the future I uh yeah because I </joey>
<joey> I also I also did the same thing I think </joey>
<joey> the video should be out by it now but </joey>
<connor> like I decided to do a [ __ ] post video </connor>
<connor> on my second Channel where I did a </connor>
<connor> chainsaw man anime review but the entire </connor>
<connor> script is written by AI yeah but like I </connor>
<garnt> didn't use the one you used I used a </garnt>
<garnt> couple of the other like kind of free to </garnt>
<garnt> use um opens I guess they're open source </garnt>
<connor> the amount of stuff I've seen online I </connor>
<connor> was like this this gotta be free yeah a </connor>
<joey> lot of them though you have to pay like </joey>
<connor> a monthly subscription to use like a </connor>
<connor> limit what the [ __ ] using AI that much I </connor>
<joey> don't know but like the ones that I </joey>
<connor> chose uh to use while like kind of made </connor>
<connor> like the first like you know a couple of </connor>
<connor> thousand words were like yeah uses like </connor>
<connor> a test kind of thing and then if you </connor>
<connor> wanted to use like unlimited words for </connor>
<connor> however long it's like five dollars a </connor>
<connor> month or something like that and I'm </connor>
<connor> like first of all I'm not paying for a </connor>
<connor> subscription service for an AI like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that so I just like use the limit for </connor>
<connor> the free to use to just be like uh just </connor>
<joey> yeah all I did was just like chainsaw </joey>
<joey> man anime review yeah and then put in a </joey>
<joey> couple of like character things and like </joey>
<joey> yeah they clearly didn't know what </joey>
<connor> chainsaw man was I thought it was a man </connor>
<joey> who was a change yeah because because he </joey>
<joey> tried to write like a like a synopsis </joey>
<connor> for it and it was like uh Jeff is a man </connor>
<connor> who owns a chainsaw shop uh and he comes </connor>
<connor> home one day to kill his wife and he </connor>
<garnt> becomes the chainsaw man but I just </garnt>
<joey> become okay but I just but I was like I </joey>
<garnt> thought that was really funny so I just </garnt>
<connor> completely left it as in and then I just </connor>
<joey> read the script verbatim yeah in like my </joey>
<connor> style </connor>
<connor> um I don't know how it's turned out </connor>
<connor> because it hasn't come out as this video </connor>
<connor> comes out but it was really funny </connor>
<connor> because like man I thought I was like </connor>
<connor> contrarian and on anime yeah this AI had </connor>
<connor> no chill it was just like it was just </connor>
<connor> like yes uh the animation was a kind of </connor>
<joey> subpar but the fighting scenes were kind </joey>
<joey> of good but overall the story was very </joey>
<joey> forgettable when Bland I was like damn </joey>
<garnt> hey I chill oh my God you should give </garnt>
<garnt> Chad GPT a try because it's it's got it </garnt>
<garnt> it like writes things to a point where </garnt>
<connor> you could literally take this </connor>
<connor> um like if we had Chad gbt when I was in </connor>
<connor> high school I was never doing any </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] hurt I would not be doing any </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] homework it's yeah it literally </connor>
<joey> gets to a point where you could ask it </joey>
<joey> to write you know you could literally </joey>
<joey> say write a python script that does this </joey>
<joey> and this and like it understands what </joey>
<joey> your request is </joey>
<joey> entire codes that's scary of like you </joey>
<joey> know like C plus plus programming python </joey>
<joey> whatever the [ __ ] you want or you can </joey>
<joey> ask it to write you a video script about </joey>
<joey> X or Y yeah yeah you can like ask it to </joey>
<connor> iterate upon itself to be like okay take </connor>
<connor> this script and add a little bit of </connor>
<connor> humor add a little bit of this maybe </connor>
<garnt> expand on this section and it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it's it's an amazing amazing </garnt>
<garnt> resources a resource but at the same </garnt>
<joey> time it's [ __ ] terrifying teachers </joey>
<joey> and professors must be [ __ ] sweating </joey>
<garnt> now because you remember like I'm </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] sweating because because like </garnt>
<joey> remember like when we were in college </joey>
<joey> and like high school and stuff like yeah </joey>
<joey> a lot like the biggest thing we had to </joey>
<joey> worry about was like don't take </joey>
<joey> citations from Wikipedia yeah like but </joey>
<joey> now it's just like don't get a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> super you know like hard-working AI to </connor>
<connor> basically do your workflow because like </connor>
<garnt> how do you there must be measures </garnt>
<connor> nowadays right because like this thing </connor>
<connor> is so openly available to like students </connor>
<connor> now and it's like a lot more well known </connor>
<connor> it's probably only going to be all well </connor>
<connor> known from here on out it's like how are </connor>
<joey> they going to figure out a way to like </joey>
<joey> make sure you're not just using this AI </joey>
<garnt> right like they they probably have to I </garnt>
<garnt> got it I got it right you build an AI to </garnt>
<joey> detect the AI </joey>
<connor> That's the only way I can like imagine </connor>
<connor> currently how they do it yeah </connor>
<joey> folks that's how they distinguished </joey>
<joey> we use the AI to kill the AI </joey>
<connor> it's just it's just modern day weapons </connor>
<joey> yeah when you make a when you make a </joey>
<connor> tank that can withstand bullets then you </connor>
<joey> add Rockets </joey>
<joey> we're gonna make us stronger it's just </joey>
<joey> always going to be this cat of mouse </joey>
<joey> game holy [ __ ] which one is funny yeah </joey>
<garnt> but but like what's what's incredible to </garnt>
<garnt> me is like you know when in school we </garnt>
<garnt> learn about like you know history and </garnt>
<joey> like you know the Industrial Revolution </joey>
<joey> and how all like the workers kind of </joey>
<joey> like revolted and like protested when </joey>
<joey> you know they were getting replaced by </joey>
<joey> machines yeah and you know you you sit </joey>
<joey> there as a kid being like ah dumb </joey>
<connor> history that'll never happen and we're </connor>
<garnt> literally like seeing it happen right </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] now yeah it's actually insane </connor>
<connor> well the more that we become like NPCs </connor>
<connor> the more the NPCs become like humans </connor>
<connor> right have you not noticed the explosion </connor>
<joey> of MPC humor online have you noticed I </joey>
<garnt> have noticed that yes </garnt>
<garnt> I've not noticed an explosion of NPC </garnt>
<garnt> humor it's something that's just existed </garnt>
<garnt> since it's show big history online </garnt>
<connor> Skyrim right yeah surely but it's like </connor>
<connor> more so like people behaving like NPCs </connor>
<connor> and like Tick Tock just made it like </connor>
<connor> explode because it's so much so easy to </connor>
<connor> get like it's just America right well </connor>
<connor> yeah pretty much all of America right </connor>
<connor> like that's just clearly right we're </connor>
<connor> generalizing the entire America right </connor>
<joey> that's how it is yeah we can go back to </joey>
<connor> that it's interesting it's interesting </connor>
<joey> yeah it's that whole thing of like the </joey>
<joey> we live in a simulation meme just kind </joey>
<connor> of coming back right yeah I've seen the </connor>
<connor> simulation is failing right now yeah </connor>
<connor> I've seen I've seen so many memes like </connor>
<connor> that just like on Meme pages and like </connor>
<connor> Tick Tock and stuff like that of like oh </connor>
<joey> we I was like no we don't live in a </joey>
<joey> simulation and it's like oh really have </joey>
<joey> you ever seen your neighbor bring in the </joey>
<joey> groceries and it's like </joey>
<joey> and they're just like coming back from </joey>
<joey> like these like meme channels it's just </joey>
<joey> pretty good it's pretty good it's a </joey>
<garnt> really good </garnt>
<joey> that's just the next level of hits blunt </joey>
<joey> meme </joey>
<garnt> you've seen my neighbors bring in the </garnt>
<garnt> groceries right you know I don't think </garnt>
<connor> like when do they do it maybe I'm I'm </connor>
<joey> the neighbor okay yeah it just spawns in </joey>
<garnt> their fridge obviously well to be fair I </garnt>
<joey> don't bring the [ __ ] groceries back </joey>
<joey> because I just ubereats all the time </joey>
<joey> that might be another big reason as well </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I just love it it's so funny yeah but </garnt>
<joey> like it's weird because I think a lot of </joey>
<joey> people thought that the last job that </joey>
<joey> would be taken over is kind of like the </joey>
<joey> creative job right we all thought we We </joey>
<joey> All Fall there you know there'd be a </joey>
<connor> point where computers can get smart to </connor>
<connor> do a lot of like the specialist jobs </connor>
<connor> that we have to study for and stuff like </connor>
<connor> that but creative jobs art music that </connor>
<connor> can never be replicated and it's it's </connor>
<joey> weird seeing the kind of like the AI art </joey>
<joey> kind of like well we're going are we </joey>
<joey> going down that rabbit hole like </joey>
<garnt> controversy yeah it happened within the </garnt>
<garnt> last last few months if anything I mean </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of things are automated now </garnt>
<garnt> physically but obviously I mean think </garnt>
<connor> about it like still you have to build a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] robot yeah you have to build </connor>
<connor> something and test it but when you can </connor>
<connor> just run code over and over again and </connor>
<connor> keep tweaking it and keep running it on </connor>
<connor> these super computers it doesn't require </connor>
<connor> you to build anything it's like okay </connor>
<connor> well yeah it makes way more sense that </connor>
<connor> this stuff could be replicated and </connor>
<connor> something especially like music is </connor>
<connor> anyone really surprised that AI was able </connor>
<connor> to replicate music like when you think </connor>
<connor> about it it's it's not that complicated </connor>
<joey> this is coming from the guy who doesn't </joey>
<connor> make music by the way on the beeps and </connor>
<connor> boops to me to me it's not that </connor>
<joey> complicated oh my gosh now I know now I </joey>
<joey> know how the like artists feel when the </joey>
<connor> AI odd came out I am yeah I'm offended </connor>
<connor> what am I saying okay listen listen that </connor>
<connor> is okay that is a general sweeping </connor>
<connor> segment am I saying that AI music is </connor>
<connor> sounds indistinguishable no no make </connor>
<connor> something that sounds pretty much like </connor>
<connor> normal music or very passable music yeah </connor>
<connor> of course nothing like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> Symphony that sounds amazing no of </connor>
<joey> course yeah you might I don't know and </joey>
<joey> like you know what I mean like is anyone </joey>
<joey> really surprised that given the tools </joey>
<joey> that we had to make music digitally </joey>
<joey> anyway that right would be able to </joey>
<connor> figure out oh hey if we just feed it a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ton of information this is what </connor>
<connor> music looks like to a robot this is what </connor>
<connor> it sounds like hey give it a shot of </connor>
<joey> course it's gonna be like this yeah but </joey>
<joey> that's the thing right and I feel that's </joey>
<joey> like a a can of worms that like a lot of </joey>
<joey> people try and you know Skip around the </joey>
<connor> conversation with of like that you know </connor>
<connor> because like when that whole uh AI art </connor>
<connor> like uh programming came out you know </connor>
<connor> and it's been coming out for a while but </connor>
<connor> like about a month or so ago like you </connor>
<connor> know there was that one AI art program </connor>
<joey> that like everyone on Twitter was using </joey>
<connor> because it was like oh this is really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] cool to pay money for as well to </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] scam right but it's like you </joey>
<joey> know I you know I I did it because I I </joey>
<connor> did it for a video because I thought you </connor>
<connor> know oh what kind of [ __ ] up Creations </connor>
<connor> can this AI make of me right and you </connor>
<connor> know it was funny and you know for </connor>
<connor> entertaining purposes but then obviously </connor>
<connor> I got a lot of like backlash from like </connor>
<connor> you know the art community Unity of </connor>
<connor> being like oh so you're not going to </connor>
<connor> commission real artists but then you're </connor>
<connor> going to get art from Air that steals </connor>
<connor> other artists work and I'm just like I </connor>
<connor> hate that argument because it's like </connor>
<joey> other like human artists steal from </joey>
<connor> other human artists as well </connor>
<connor> and it's a tough conversation to have </connor>
<joey> right because it's that's a fact that </joey>
<joey> people don't want to admit no I I it's </joey>
<garnt> it's it's it's it's a tough conversation </garnt>
<joey> we're going into like </joey>
<joey> Uncharted Territory </joey>
<joey> AI has literally it's it's a tool so </joey>
<joey> powerful that we've had to think rethink </joey>
<connor> what is morally right right so you know </connor>
<connor> the AI training itself you know that's </connor>
<connor> building a tool that can train itself </connor>
<connor> that's that's incredible right the fact </connor>
<connor> that there's an AI can train yourself </connor>
<connor> two emulate a lot of human art and art </connor>
<connor> made by real people to the point where a </connor>
<connor> lot of it can almost seem </connor>
<connor> indistinguishable to a normal person </connor>
<connor> that doesn't understand art of course </connor>
<connor> now morally being able to train that AI </connor>
<connor> using artwork pre-existing artwork which </connor>
<connor> people have </connor>
<connor> have uh you know spent years and years </connor>
<connor> perfecting and honing their skills </connor>
<joey> um only to be added to a database to </joey>
<joey> help train this AI in order to </joey>
<joey> basically make a lot of their work </joey>
<joey> obsolete is that morally correct you </joey>
<joey> know that's that's that's something that </joey>
<joey> we've not really had to think about yet </joey>
<joey> because I don't know what kind of </joey>
<joey> press I don't know when in history we've </joey>
<joey> had I'm sure there is something similar </joey>
<joey> in history that's not going through my </joey>
<joey> head right now but it's it's a </joey>
<joey> complicated question yeah where we've </joey>
<joey> just it's it's something we've morally </joey>
<joey> not had to think about but we've now we </joey>
<garnt> we now have to think about it just </garnt>
<garnt> because this one tool is so powerful </garnt>
<joey> yeah you know and I feel it's a </joey>
<joey> difficult conversation to have as well </joey>
<joey> because it's like it's very much morally </joey>
<connor> speaking in my opinion it's very much in </connor>
<connor> a gray zone right it's like you know </connor>
<connor> there are there are benefits to this </connor>
<connor> kind of Technology you know expanding </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that in the art wall but </connor>
<connor> as well like you don't have to be an </connor>
<joey> artist to know that there are also some </joey>
<connor> demerits to it right what a out of </connor>
<connor> curiosity what benefits do you think </connor>
<joey> there is from having a IRS as opposed to </joey>
<joey> so a lot of so a lot of the kind of </joey>
<joey> backlash I guess opinions that I saw </joey>
<connor> about the whole air program coming out </connor>
<connor> from like actual artists yeah is that in </connor>
<connor> the in the odd world it's it's very much </connor>
<connor> like a lopsided kind of uh argument men </connor>
<connor> of like a lot of people look at it and </connor>
<connor> go this is a program that is stealing </connor>
<connor> you know other people's art and you know </connor>
<connor> like passing it off as like you know art </connor>
<connor> but then there are also a lot of artists </connor>
<connor> who look at programs like this and go </connor>
<garnt> well okay but at this point in time it </garnt>
<garnt> there is still very much a a limit like </garnt>
<garnt> a machine limit of just how it can be </garnt>
<joey> when it when it comes to creativity </joey>
<garnt> right now though so right now let the </garnt>
<joey> problem is that you're kind of </joey>
<garnt> essentially yeah a lot of people are </garnt>
<joey> like yeah it's not good enough now but </joey>
<connor> it's like okay you're You're Building </connor>
<connor> you know you're assembling the rope to </connor>
<joey> hang yourself with yeah in a sense right </joey>
<joey> because yeah and even to begin with it's </joey>
<garnt> not even like they're they're being paid </garnt>
<garnt> they're being compensated for this </garnt>
<garnt> artwork being used it's that I think the </garnt>
<garnt> main issue is that people just haven't </garnt>
<connor> consented their artwork being used to </connor>
<joey> essentially yes okay and I'm and I'm </joey>
<connor> against that personally as well of </connor>
<connor> course yeah so like the audience got </connor>
<joey> pissed off because by buying it or using </joey>
<joey> it even though you're not using it for </joey>
<joey> maybe nefarious purposes yes by using </joey>
<connor> their services you're sort of kind of </connor>
<connor> condoning it what yeah and I think </connor>
<garnt> that's the problem it's probably because </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's </garnt>
<joey> there's been such a shift within this </joey>
<joey> just these past few months right because </joey>
<joey> at the beginning of this at the </joey>
<joey> beginning I was gonna say beginning of </joey>
<joey> this year at the beginning of last year </joey>
<connor> yeah hey I was just like haha look at </connor>
<connor> all these funny things that computers </connor>
<connor> and AIS can do oh look I search my name </connor>
<connor> and it does this and now it's getting to </connor>
<connor> the point where oh this is this can </connor>
<connor> possibly take people's like livelihoods </connor>
<connor> and jobs and now now we have to think </connor>
<connor> what is morally acceptable in terms of </connor>
<connor> how this AI has been made and how this </connor>
<connor> tool has come about okay it's like I'll </connor>
<connor> pose you a question okay so let's let's </connor>
<joey> say there's an AI that has been trained </joey>
<joey> to make YouTube videos to make anime Man </joey>
<joey> videos or something like that and it </joey>
<joey> gets to a point where your videos have </joey>
<joey> been user trained or like your videos </joey>
<joey> have been used to training I was gonna </joey>
<joey> say to make videos about anime but you </joey>
<joey> know you know </joey>
<joey> it's been trained to make videos about </joey>
<garnt> Japan yes in the style of your style </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but it can pump it out way more </garnt>
<garnt> faster and way more consistently than </garnt>
<connor> you could ever and if it looks and it </connor>
<joey> feels like a jury video that's a big </joey>
<joey> problem right because yeah they've </joey>
<connor> essentially used you to replace you and </connor>
<connor> then you don't get a car so I think I </connor>
<connor> think the problem is that the laws right </connor>
<connor> now and the way that it all works is </connor>
<connor> that this was never ever accounted for </connor>
<connor> yes you know that that someone could </connor>
<connor> just use your stuff and use it as </connor>
<connor> training information because normally if </connor>
<connor> you wanted to say uh learn how to play </connor>
<connor> piano like Mozart and let's say there's </connor>
<connor> video footage of it for some reason </connor>
<connor> obviously there isn't but you could just </connor>
<connor> watch it and it'll be up to you to try </connor>
<joey> and figure out how to do it yourself and </joey>
<joey> no one would bet an eye out there yes </joey>
<connor> yeah but so if you give that to a </connor>
<connor> machine and the Machine can just </connor>
<joey> replicate it one for one and spit it out </joey>
<joey> it's like okay well hold on I didn't </joey>
<joey> agree to that yeah when I publish this </joey>
<joey> video I want people to watch it I didn't </joey>
<connor> want people to [ __ ] just replace me </connor>
<joey> with it but but I think at the same time </joey>
<joey> it's it's going to like say looking at </joey>
<joey> it from the musical standpoint right </joey>
<joey> like as someone who has been writing </joey>
<connor> music my whole life it's like I find </connor>
<connor> that as like uh you know maybe not the </connor>
<connor> best way but it is a way to kind of push </connor>
<connor> the medium further in terms of its in </connor>
<connor> terms of its current limits right it's </connor>
<connor> like okay Carly AI has gotten to the </connor>
<connor> point where it has gotten pretty close </connor>
<connor> or even similar to what humans are </connor>
<joey> capable of doing right yeah but at the </joey>
<joey> end of the day the AI at least as of </joey>
<joey> right now right there is still very much </joey>
<connor> a limit that human creativity </connor>
<connor> Cancer pass yeah so right so I think in </connor>
<joey> the sense of advancing the art medium </joey>
<joey> forward </joey>
<connor> you can look at it in a positive in that </connor>
<connor> way but at the same time as someone who </connor>
<connor> has seen AI being made also or music </connor>
<connor> being made by AI yeah it is also kind of </connor>
<connor> terrifying but at the same time at the </connor>
<connor> end of the day with any kind of like art </connor>
<joey> and stuff like that humans I think are </joey>
<joey> just naturally more attracted to </joey>
<joey> something that is made by a human even </joey>
<garnt> if it might be indistinguishable of </garnt>
<connor> course of course I would like to think </connor>
<garnt> that yeah people like to think they're </garnt>
<garnt> smarter than they are and that they </garnt>
<connor> would never fall for stuff like that but </connor>
<joey> yeah we do right like it's just yes I </joey>
<garnt> mean it depends on the person obviously </garnt>
<garnt> yeah part of the real like like I said </garnt>
<connor> we never thought AI would like create a </connor>
<connor> field to be one of the fields that AI </connor>
<connor> would take over first but yeah uh like </connor>
<connor> it I think it's just going it's just </connor>
<connor> kind of blowing up the fact that you </connor>
<connor> know even if you think human creativity </connor>
<connor> is beautiful and amazing which you know </connor>
<joey> I think it is it's still art is still </joey>
<joey> defined and based on rules yes and </joey>
<joey> structure you know we talk about you </joey>
<joey> know we clown on the corner for for like </joey>
<connor> how music is easy replicatable he like </connor>
<connor> at the same word </connor>
<connor> the fact that you can study music means </connor>
<connor> there is a baseline structure </connor>
<joey> um that can be learned and obviously can </joey>
<joey> be replicated and part of the beauty </joey>
<joey> sometimes comes from breaking that </joey>
<connor> structure and going going your own </connor>
<joey> Direction going against the convention </joey>
<connor> but at the same time that is also based </connor>
<connor> on the previously defined structure you </connor>
<connor> know so it's it's kind of </connor>
<joey> uh it's it it kind of is like taking all </joey>
<garnt> of the gloss off and being like okay </garnt>
<garnt> this is what this is this this is what </garnt>
<garnt> your creativity actually is this is this </garnt>
<joey> is all of the things but I think that's </joey>
<joey> why this conversation that's why I feel </joey>
<joey> though this conversation is so </joey>
<joey> fascinating right because it makes us </joey>
<connor> kind of question okay </connor>
<connor> what is art to begin with now like you </connor>
<connor> know it it does it's like it makes you </connor>
<joey> kind of rethink like okay what makes </joey>
<joey> this one thing artistic and this other </joey>
<connor> thing not as artistic right I think with </connor>
<connor> this specific uh controversy that </connor>
<connor> happened where a lot of people got </connor>
<garnt> really upset about the air Arts because </garnt>
<garnt> you know I think typically online anyway </garnt>
<garnt> well like in the online climate right </garnt>
<garnt> now artists who are normally undervalued </garnt>
<connor> anyway yes and don't get paid maybe as </connor>
<garnt> much as they should so it was kind of </garnt>
<connor> like the the cigarette butt being put </connor>
<joey> out on you and you're already down right </joey>
<joey> yeah okay so I'm already struggling to </joey>
<joey> get a fair price for my art and now I </joey>
<joey> have to compete with this [ __ ] that's </joey>
<joey> trained off on my [ __ ] like yeah what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] like for example right uh </joey>
<joey> another AI situation um remember like I </joey>
<joey> got even like 10 years ago that Eve bot </joey>
<joey> that one where you could talk to it oh </joey>
<joey> yeah it would like flirt back to you no </joey>
<joey> there were a lot of yeah it's like the </joey>
<joey> AI chatbots you'll be like oh how you </joey>
<joey> doing today I'm fine and then you'll be </joey>
<joey> like oh you're so beautiful on it which </joey>
<joey> it was like it was like a dumb little </joey>
<joey> thing yeah yeah yeah yeah it was kind of </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] but you're like okay well </joey>
<joey> you know you think in the time it was </joey>
<joey> like a slightly upgraded clippy </joey>
<joey> basically of course you're like this is </joey>
<joey> cool I'd love to help improve this yeah </joey>
<joey> I think the we as humans are so curious </joey>
<connor> and so fascinated by stuff that we're </connor>
<connor> like this is awesome like nobody nobody </connor>
<connor> at that time questioned yeah whether we </connor>
<connor> should get this AI better or not </connor>
<connor> everyone's like [ __ ] yeah this is cool </connor>
<connor> yeah this is awesome this is a little </connor>
<connor> fun thing I do online with my friends </connor>
<connor> and we all laugh about it yeah and then </connor>
<connor> you think oh wait what if it gets good </connor>
<connor> enough where it can just actually scam </connor>
<connor> people online where I could just it </connor>
<joey> could DM you on Instagram yeah and it </joey>
<joey> can sound human and it can ask for your </joey>
<joey> credit card or some pointers like what </joey>
<joey> if it could have an extended </joey>
<joey> conversation with you for weeks and then </joey>
<joey> you could be scammed out of something </joey>
<joey> and it's like okay now it's like if it </joey>
<joey> gets too good because we become </joey>
<joey> normalized I mean I'd argue that's it's </joey>
<joey> already happening well I don't know if </joey>
<joey> that happens but like I mean it could </joey>
<connor> happen it could yeah the point being is </connor>
<connor> that like I think it it's concerning </connor>
<connor> when it's already too late yeah it's </connor>
<connor> already gotten to the point where it's </connor>
<connor> too good then you're like oh oh we </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> this whole thing like five ten years ago </joey>
<connor> we thought that's cute that's nowhere </connor>
<connor> near as good as the stuff we're making </connor>
<connor> yeah and this was the the sentiment we </connor>
<connor> had and obviously now that it's catching </connor>
<connor> up everyone's kind of scared because </connor>
<connor> they're like where does this go yeah </connor>
<garnt> where is it going to be in 10 more years </garnt>
<connor> yeah I I think it was just like basic </connor>
<connor> human naivety to be like to be like oh </connor>
<connor> this thing exists oh that's that's cute </connor>
<connor> that's not a problem I'm gonna have to </connor>
<garnt> worry about in my lifetime let's just </garnt>
<garnt> watch Sci-Fi movies about it isn't that </garnt>
<joey> so funny right now and now we are in </joey>
<connor> that sci-fi so yeah there was this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that was a I don't know who is </connor>
<connor> Adobe or something there's one </connor>
<connor> presentation like I don't know like two </connor>
<joey> three four years ago where it's </joey>
<joey> basically like off of X amount of </joey>
<joey> samples of your voice they could pretty </joey>
<joey> much perfectly replicate yourself yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah and that was </joey>
<joey> terrifying too because like now it's </joey>
<garnt> like all right well deep fakes at least </garnt>
<garnt> those are still uh yeah they're not </garnt>
<garnt> great still like yeah yeah I mean you </garnt>
<garnt> can do some really convincing ones but </garnt>
<connor> to have your voice taken feels really </connor>
<connor> weird yeah imagine that I mean yeah you </connor>
<connor> know yours is on there on one shrimp </connor>
<connor> shitty one doesn't sound yeah I mean it </connor>
<garnt> doesn't get that but it can get there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and yeah it just raises a lot of </garnt>
<connor> like new morality questions that you </connor>
<connor> realize oh we are definitely we are </connor>
<joey> definitely not prepared </joey>
<joey> apocalypse is coming so they're able to </joey>
<connor> make a deep fake so they can make a </connor>
<connor> facial uh reconstruction if you can't </connor>
<garnt> they could take your voice and then now </garnt>
<garnt> they have your video ideas right </garnt>
<garnt> um this is obviously only applies to ask </garnt>
<garnt> and this is dude [ __ ] cares if our </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers get [ __ ] copied yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but it's just you know yeah I think </garnt>
<joey> it's no surprise that the creative </joey>
<joey> aspects are the first to be uh kind of a </joey>
<joey> mimicked or uh yeah absolutely because </joey>
<joey> it's also the average everyday person </joey>
<connor> doesn't care to interact with a robot </connor>
<connor> that could maybe fix a phone yeah right </connor>
<connor> maybe it's cool for someone else but I'm </connor>
<joey> gonna be like I'll go in the art I I'll </joey>
<connor> give it I'll talk to the funny robot </connor>
<garnt> yeah why not why are we talking to </garnt>
<connor> robots </connor>
<connor> why why are we humoring them </connor>
<connor> this is where the robot would be like </connor>
<joey> you're a peasant Comics </joey>
<garnt> the robots feels more real than talking </garnt>
<joey> to humans okay </joey>
<connor> we would go online and we would just </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] chat to a wall right like I saw </garnt>
<garnt> the other day um someone had made </garnt>
<garnt> um an AI V tuber yeah I saw that and I </garnt>
<connor> was just like it's literally just like </connor>
<joey> the whole Tay thing but just with a </joey>
<joey> voice thing there was there was a clip </joey>
<joey> that was going around where they they </joey>
<joey> played to me by name huh they mentioned </joey>
<joey> me by name and I had this clip like sent </joey>
<connor> to me everywhere and it's like this aiv </connor>
<connor> YouTuber mentioned you by name and I was </connor>
<connor> like how the [ __ ] doesn't Joey messenger </connor>
<joey> yeah it said Joey the anime man and I </joey>
<joey> was like who who are you how do you know </joey>
<garnt> me but like it's just just seeing it </garnt>
<garnt> that that also [ __ ] okay so everyone </garnt>
<connor> right now is at the same stage where </connor>
<connor> it's just like haha wow how cute an aiv </connor>
<connor> tube isn't this such a nice cute little </connor>
<connor> idea fine I I swear to God in like five </connor>
<connor> ten years maybe even sooner no yeah as </connor>
<connor> soon as AIS can get to a point where </connor>
<garnt> they have an endearing personality it's </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] over man being able to stay here </connor>
<joey> nice Japan will be definitely be the </joey>
<joey> first country we are we are literally we </joey>
<garnt> are literally in the epicenter of </garnt>
<garnt> humanity getting wiped out by vtubers </garnt>
<connor> manager think about Japan 100 accepted </connor>
<connor> YouTuber AI Overlord you know why </connor>
<connor> because you can't get a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> boyfriend </joey>
<joey> I am waiting for the niji Sanji like aiv </joey>
<garnt> super division to come out and just be </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm sorry but Idol that will never </garnt>
<garnt> have a boyfriend never have any </garnt>
<garnt> controversy you know hopefully he won't </garnt>
<joey> say anything racist I say hopefully </joey>
<joey> because God knows what the AI is going </joey>
<joey> to be trained on you know </joey>
<joey> here's the thing how do you cancel an AI </joey>
<joey> an AI is uncountable right because it </joey>
<joey> can only be trained by humans so who are </joey>
<garnt> the real evil not the P or AI it's the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] humans that trained it man I </joey>
<joey> can't believe you hurt my feelings </joey>
<joey> my real feelings </joey>
<connor> oh my God that is very poggers yeah </connor>
<joey> bottom line everyone in the creative </joey>
<joey> field is [ __ ] it's on 24 7. but the </joey>
<joey> bottom line everything every every </joey>
<joey> artist musician's a [ __ ] YouTubers are </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] everyone's [ __ ] if you work in </connor>
<connor> uh you know some engineering or some </connor>
<connor> stuff you're pretty good when you're </connor>
<connor> using your hands yeah </connor>
<joey> I thought programmers were safe but now </joey>
<joey> there's AI that can do programming maybe </joey>
<garnt> maybe we go maybe we've got to go back </garnt>
<joey> to the Stone Age maybe the only jobs </joey>
<joey> that will be left is like manual labor </joey>
<garnt> you know tedious manual labor you know I </garnt>
<joey> can't dig a hole in the shovel can't </joey>
<joey> they </joey>
<garnt> we'll just be building huts and filming </garnt>
<joey> that and be like ha [ __ ] you AI yeah </joey>
<joey> let's see you're trying to build this </joey>
<joey> primitive technology YouTubers are just </joey>
<connor> like my time has gone more except </connor>
<joey> they've they've surpassed us when they </joey>
<joey> can beat us at speed running video games </joey>
<joey> that's what I like said what do you mean </joey>
<joey> when an AI I can just speed run a video </joey>
<joey> game on its own and do like the Cheeto </joey>
<joey> Skip and all that in the video game it </joey>
<joey> can already like do but all you have to </joey>
<joey> do is just feed it a task well yeah we </joey>
<joey> have to feed it a test right that's like </joey>
<connor> a video basically playing though yeah we </connor>
<joey> can figure it out all on its own that's </joey>
<joey> when I'll be impressed when yeah when an </joey>
<joey> AI can figure out a brand new like skip </joey>
<garnt> then that's when I'm impressed and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like okay </garnt>
<garnt> a lot less out of everything that's like </garnt>
<joey> ai's could do I think that might be one </joey>
<garnt> of the easier things bro you got an AI </garnt>
<garnt> That's running a video game 24 7. have </garnt>
<connor> you ever watched those machine learning </connor>
<connor> compilations of video games after like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] uh two to four weeks they're </joey>
<joey> still dumb as [ __ ] really right now yeah </joey>
<joey> right now right now yeah you have to put </joey>
<joey> a lot you the AI on its own cannot learn </joey>
<joey> like you need to feed it like you need </joey>
<joey> to tell right like hey you know like if </joey>
<connor> you watch videos of it like uh racing a </connor>
<connor> car in a video game like you have to </connor>
<garnt> feed it a lot to get it even remotely </garnt>
<garnt> good um yeah but it depends how how </garnt>
<garnt> quickly you can iterate upon itself </garnt>
<connor> um because there's more computing power </connor>
<garnt> the more it can help I guess yeah the uh </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know I'm not an expert in this </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] all I know is that they are bad </connor>
<connor> Joey you should be ashamed of yourself </connor>
<joey> wow I can't believe me and about a </joey>
<joey> million other people uh joining you you </joey>
<connor> know it's like this is the problem is a </connor>
<connor> lot of other people don't have comment </connor>
<joey> sections yeah yeah but also but also a </joey>
<joey> lot of people don't read their </joey>
<garnt> conversations yeah that's true you know </garnt>
<garnt> what I'm gonna AI I'm gonna create an AI </garnt>
<garnt> bot that gives me wholesome comments </garnt>
<connor> that finds out exactly what porn I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna jack off to that day I'm tired of </connor>
<connor> scrolling quite frankly and I will </connor>
<connor> welcome that one it's like oh BBW today </connor>
<connor> I wasn't really gonna go for that one </connor>
<joey> but maybe I think that's just the I'm </joey>
<connor> feeling lucky button on Google </connor>
<connor> I wanted to watch the porn I'm watching </connor>
<joey> and then decide exactly what I'm into </joey>
<connor> and when I'm gonna be into it </connor>
<connor> of death because I I can't trust myself </connor>
<joey> maybe I'm just doing it for the sake it </joey>
<joey> pings you on your phone to be like J.O </joey>
<joey> time it vibrates like really </joey>
<joey> aggressively in your pocket yeah to turn </joey>
<joey> you on it's like your own time here's </joey>
<connor> the link off you go yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> already playing on your Chromecast </connor>
<connor> please enter the bedroom yeah I mean I </connor>
<connor> mean Jarvis play BBW Paul </connor>
<joey> as you get wheeled in yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> if you tell me is a feeding tube but not </joey>
<connor> something that's sucking my dick </connor>
<connor> you telling me how to do that manually </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that yeah </connor>
<connor> plot hole in it how are they jacking off </connor>
<joey> it doesn't look like it's possible it </joey>
<connor> would have happened if Wally was based </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] Japan's already figured that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] out before the AI did </joey>
<connor> they don't get as a get into resistance </connor>
<connor> in the [ __ ] you make sure that jacking </connor>

<garnt> back to the episode I'm taking the rest </garnt>
<garnt> of those have you have you like because </garnt>
<joey> I don't go on Tick Tock how is this far </joey>
<joey> away I'm actually going for a jacket on </joey>
<joey> today because I got okay I don't go on </joey>
<joey> Twitter but I have I've I've seen this </joey>
<joey> happen to other people where </joey>
<joey> um they've like they've had something on </joey>
<joey> their Tick Tock which has popped up that </joey>
<garnt> has been relevant to like some very </garnt>
<garnt> specific intrusive thought that they've </garnt>
<garnt> never like verbalized or anything like </garnt>
<garnt> that but Tick Tock is just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> here's a video about that one topic that </garnt>
<connor> you've thought about that's coincidence </connor>
<connor> and then when you spot it it feels so </connor>
<connor> much more real than you know just yeah </connor>
<joey> it's a mixture of coincidence and the </joey>
<joey> fact that I think there are so many tick </joey>
<joey> tocks out there now that have just </joey>
<joey> covered every possible internal like </joey>
<connor> situation that could be relevant to you </connor>
<connor> okay I want an AI that tells you want my </connor>
<connor> next dark thought is gonna be </connor>
<connor> it's like an AI that like warns you </connor>
<connor> before you have the thought it's just </connor>
<connor> like stop right now you're just chilling </connor>
<connor> and you have that one thought you're </connor>
<connor> like whoa that was dark </connor>
<connor> you know you're okay come on I cannot be </connor>
<joey> alone in this you know that's just like </joey>
<joey> every year you see that on a tick tock </joey>
<connor> that's [ __ ] up but that's cool that's </connor>
<connor> sick no because like because this has </connor>
<connor> happened to like Sydney a few times uh </connor>
<joey> where she's just like see Cindy likes to </joey>
<joey> bring up random stuff sometimes and uh </joey>
<connor> if you found out in Sydney she she says </connor>
<joey> the dog says she says every [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> intrusive and non-intrusive thought </connor>
<connor> whether they make sense or not yeah so </connor>
<connor> one time she was uh we're just like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] watching TV or something and </connor>
<connor> then she just goes to me could you </connor>
<garnt> survive a tsunami if you like are in a </garnt>
<garnt> swimming pool and you switch to the </garnt>
<garnt> bottom of the swimming pool and hold </garnt>
<joey> your breath </joey>
<connor> should I be offended </connor>
<garnt> and he was one of those statements no I </garnt>
<garnt> just swimming to the bottom bro </garnt>
<joey> and it was like one of the that he was </joey>
<joey> one of those [ __ ] and it was one of </joey>
<connor> those moments where I heard a statement </connor>
<connor> and I didn't even know where to begin </connor>
<connor> because I'm just I'm just like I don't </connor>
<garnt> think this is even worth entertaining </garnt>
<garnt> the thought I'm just like I just like </garnt>
<garnt> what and she's like no I I think like </garnt>
<garnt> has anyone ever thought about that I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> and I just left that was that you know </garnt>
<garnt> that was like I was like I did not know </garnt>
<joey> where to begin and I was just like John </joey>
<joey> left he went to his computer and he </joey>
<garnt> started programming in AI </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] you know right [ __ ] you're not yeah </joey>
<joey> and then like two days later </joey>
<joey> um I was I was like she's lying in bed </joey>
<joey> and she'd go and she goes what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> no way and I was like Sydney what's </joey>
<joey> going on </joey>
<joey> and she she runs down to me and she goes </joey>
<joey> watch this Tick Tock and a tick tock is </joey>
<garnt> here's why you wouldn't survive if you </garnt>
<garnt> swam to a bottom of a pool during a </garnt>
<garnt> tsunami and I was just like I thought </garnt>
<garnt> that that that is that is the creepiest </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] I've ever seen in my life and I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if this was like a </garnt>
<garnt> subconscious Trend that was happening </garnt>
<garnt> during Tick Tock but I have never heard </garnt>
<garnt> anyone pose this question before I just </garnt>
<joey> I just like to think just out of context </joey>
<connor> that Tick Tock was just one that Sydney </connor>
<connor> made like that night it's an AIT Target </connor>
<joey> it's just like check it out I'm not the </joey>
<connor> only one that's thinking this I'm not </connor>
<joey> weird right </joey>
<joey> please believe me yeah </joey>
<joey> I don't know because I don't know if </joey>
<joey> you've driven Mike when you do you only </joey>
<joey> drive a lot and you've driven a lot of </joey>
<joey> hours and then you sit there and you </joey>
<joey> have that moment where you're like </joey>
<connor> oh yeah if I [ __ ] this up I die </connor>
<connor> yeah I've had that you know when you're </connor>
<connor> just you just drive it like you're like </connor>
<joey> you're like oh this is super chill this </joey>
<joey> is funny and you do it every day and </joey>
<joey> then you're just like oh wait I gotta I </joey>
<joey> gotta pay attention </joey>
<connor> not that I'm not paying attention yeah </connor>
<connor> but you know when you just and no one's </connor>
<connor> ever gonna get him to call me ever again </connor>
<connor> no but you know what I mean like you're </connor>
<connor> just driving and then you forget how </connor>
<connor> dangerous driving is until you have that </connor>
<joey> moment where you're like oh if I just </joey>
<joey> turn if I accidentally wasn't paying </joey>
<joey> attention I turned a little bit that way </joey>
<joey> I it would it's over it's it's that </joey>
<joey> moment [ __ ] up why do I have those </joey>
<garnt> thoughts </garnt>
<connor> it was this woman and it was a woman </connor>
<joey> standing like lying on the edge of a </joey>
<joey> waterfall </joey>
<connor> someone drew quote retreated it and it </connor>
<connor> was something like nah the voices would </connor>
<connor> get me for sure </connor>
<connor> and they had like 300 000 likes </connor>
<connor> the voices </connor>
<garnt> that's so dark but okay but before </garnt>
<connor> before I say what I'm gonna what I'm </connor>
<connor> going to say listen everyone has dark </connor>
<connor> thoughts okay I'm I'm I I'm a safe </connor>
<connor> driver guys I'm a safe </connor>
<joey> God has driven me before </joey>
<joey> we've had we've had a road trip together </joey>
<joey> they're in one piece okay yeah so </joey>
<joey> sometimes you're on a highway right and </joey>
<joey> you see like oncoming traffic right and </joey>
<joey> you're going like 70 miles per hour and </joey>
<joey> you're and sometimes you get this </joey>
<joey> thought sometimes </joey>
<joey> all I have to do is just turn the </joey>
<garnt> steering wheel slightly and everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> dead good thing I'm not gonna do that </garnt>
<joey> but what if </joey>
<connor> you saw this place </connor>
<garnt> it's just like oh good thing I'm not </garnt>
<garnt> gonna do okay but good thing I'm a sane </garnt>
<connor> human being what if or am I or am I </connor>
<connor> everyone collectively has that thought </connor>
<connor> right everyone collectively is driving </connor>
<joey> so yes they do and everyone doesn't not </joey>
<garnt> drive safe when they do yeah exactly I </garnt>
<garnt> know it's also like when driving </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you especially in Long </garnt>
<garnt> stretches it's I think intrusive </garnt>
<garnt> thoughts is different from just being in </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like getting into like this </garnt>
<garnt> almost vegetative state where you're </garnt>
<garnt> just so focused on the road that you </garnt>
<garnt> forget that you're going at like 70 </garnt>
<connor> miles there's a phenomenon right where </connor>
<connor> you know some people if they drive back </connor>
<connor> to work all the time and it's a </connor>
<connor> relatively short distance some people </connor>
<joey> can forget that they even drove to work </joey>
<joey> that like they don't have the memory of </joey>
<joey> driving the car because they've done it </joey>
<connor> so many times and it's so automatic yeah </connor>
<joey> it all just Blends together it's like </joey>
<connor> have you ever had a autopilot moment in </connor>
<joey> your life where you just like for sure </joey>
<joey> you wake up from the Matrix and you're </joey>
<connor> like why did I do this I well you're </connor>
<connor> just walking and you suddenly forget </connor>
<connor> like you're walking you just you don't </connor>
<connor> like you don't you don't like have that </connor>
<connor> thought that you're actually controlling </connor>
<joey> your walking there's no there's the </joey>
<joey> moment that I'm sure everyone in the </joey>
<joey> world has experience at least once of </joey>
<joey> like you're just you know you're in the </joey>
<connor> living room and then you walk to your </connor>
<connor> room and then you enter your room and </connor>
<connor> then you just stop and you go why did I </connor>
<connor> just walk away of course of course </connor>
<joey> everyone's had that that is that is like </joey>
<joey> an autopilot moment my my brain just </joey>
<joey> pre-programmed to be like walk to yours </joey>
<garnt> because like I'll never forget that </garnt>
<garnt> that's like that that's like every day </garnt>
<joey> of my life </joey>
<joey> Welcome to ADHD everyone but like I </joey>
<joey> remember like the worst time it happened </joey>
<joey> and the part that still like freaks me </joey>
<connor> out is I remember </connor>
<connor> I remember this one time </connor>
<connor> um in University </connor>
<connor> um so you know you go to your lecture or </connor>
<connor> every single day of your [ __ ] life </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and then I remember leaving my house </connor>
<connor> because it was the weekend yeah and then </connor>
<connor> huh yeah ladies and gentlemen it was the </connor>
<connor> weekend and I was going to meet a few </connor>
<connor> friends in the city center </connor>
<connor> um so I start walking I put on my </connor>
<connor> earphones uh and then the next thing I </connor>
<connor> realized I look up and I'm in front of </connor>
<connor> my lecture hall and I'm like why the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] did I go here how did I walk it was </connor>
<connor> it was the autopilot walk today </connor>
<connor> autopilot walked to the ledge Hall and </connor>
<connor> it's not a short walk it was a 30-minute </connor>
<garnt> walk what I did not notice that I was </garnt>
<garnt> walking to my lecture hall which is the </garnt>
<garnt> opposite direction to where I was going </garnt>
<garnt> to meet my mates until I was in front of </garnt>
<joey> the lecture hall dude if that isn't </joey>
<garnt> solid evidence that like fast travel </garnt>
<joey> exists in real life like I don't know </joey>
<joey> what it is you just press the button and </joey>
<garnt> you just he's a fast travel to the </garnt>
<joey> lecture travel to the wrong place I'm </joey>
<garnt> like I glitched down on my way don't you </garnt>
<garnt> I don't actually need to go yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> that is It's like because I'm sure </connor>
<garnt> everyone has experienced that I'm just </garnt>
<connor> like oh I'm here now but I don't </connor>
<garnt> remember how I got here yeah I just I </garnt>
<garnt> just like oh I just my my feet just </garnt>
<garnt> started walking and I'm here now okay </garnt>
<joey> that's just the pre-programmed script </joey>
<connor> just started right it's just like all </connor>
<garnt> right here we go bro that's so funny </garnt>
<connor> that's every time I walk back after like </connor>
<connor> a night of drinking sometimes </connor>
<joey> holy [ __ ] I've had like insanely song </joey>
<joey> insanely long walks after I'm like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] pissed out of my mind yeah I </joey>
<joey> have no idea how I like get back because </joey>
<joey> I could barely like form two I could </joey>
<joey> barely form like a single step and I'm </joey>
<joey> like so I wake up next day and I </joey>
<joey> perfectly I'm always home and I always </joey>
<joey> remember getting I remember I always </joey>
<joey> remember going into my door and getting </joey>
<joey> back in but I can never remember the </joey>
<joey> journey that took me there telling you </joey>
<joey> man fast travel </joey>
<joey> it's IRL faster IRL fast travel it </joey>
<garnt> exists </garnt>
<garnt> let's uh to keep this like existential </garnt>
<connor> crisis going go on I felt it I fell into </connor>
<connor> like another weird Rabbit Hole the other </connor>
<connor> day all right what would you do if you </connor>
<connor> knew you were about to die </connor>
<joey> because okay what what span of time are </joey>
<joey> we talking are we talking like I'm gonna </joey>
<joey> die within the year or I'm gonna die </joey>
<garnt> like tomorrow uh within like an hour </garnt>
<joey> the hour yeah oh [ __ ] because because I </joey>
<connor> I </connor>
<connor> um I got into jail yeah because I got </connor>
<garnt> into this weird Jr </garnt>
<joey> it's not oh my God </joey>
<garnt> because because uh like I uh got into </garnt>
<garnt> this rabbit hole because I like this uh </garnt>
<connor> this video was recommended to me about </connor>
<connor> the Hawaiian like kind of like the </connor>
<connor> missile alert right so uh a while ago </connor>
<connor> like Hawaii had like a fake missile </connor>
<connor> alert where everyone on their phones got </connor>
<connor> it and got an alert that said ballistic </connor>
<joey> missiles are heading towards Hawaii </joey>
<joey> right please head to shelter as soon as </joey>
<joey> possible this is not a drill </joey>
<joey> and of course terrifying it's it's like </joey>
<joey> imagine like the earthquake alerts it's </joey>
<joey> like on that except </joey>
<joey> basically you're being told that a </joey>
<joey> nuclear bomb a nuclear problem nuclear </joey>
<joey> ballistic missile bomb is heading </joey>
<joey> towards Hawaii right and Ireland where </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] are you gonna run yeah where </joey>
<garnt> are you gonna run so four battles yeah </garnt>
<connor> so for about like 45 minutes </connor>
<garnt> a lot of people believed This is the End </garnt>
<connor> right this is this is going to be the </connor>
<connor> end and like I I saw that video and then </connor>
<connor> I I was just it just like so curious so </connor>
<connor> I started like reading comments and </connor>
<connor> hearing stories about people who </connor>
<connor> actually experienced that and it's just </connor>
<connor> it's interesting just to see people say </connor>
<connor> like you're you're [ __ ] brain </connor>
<connor> chemistry just had their brain chemistry </connor>
<connor> had changed after that experience just </connor>
<joey> because they had like made peace </joey>
<joey> with the fact that they were going to </joey>
<joey> die and it's I find it interesting </joey>
<joey> because you know in movies and </joey>
<joey> everything like that you you see people </joey>
<joey> portrayed as the world's coming to an </joey>
<joey> end let's all [ __ ] Panic let's all go </joey>
<joey> out kicking and screaming but the </joey>
<joey> reality is so many people were just </joey>
<garnt> um were just kind of like at peace </garnt>
<connor> without accepting yeah yeah I I think </connor>
<joey> about that video of that guy who's just </joey>
<connor> playing golf oh yeah yeah I'm gonna </connor>
<connor> finish this whole of golf yeah I'm gonna </connor>
<connor> get a PB before </connor>
<garnt> he like I saw that video as well there's </garnt>
<garnt> a guy who just starts off the video </garnt>
<garnt> being like if you're seeing this video I </garnt>
<garnt> probably didn't make it oh wow and and </garnt>
<joey> he just he just starts being like you </joey>
<joey> know what I lived a good life this is </joey>
<joey> probably the end but I'm gonna finish </joey>
<joey> playing this golf I'm gonna go out doing </joey>
<connor> what I have it's such a good video what </connor>
<joey> a chat what a [ __ ] I think I think </joey>
<connor> one of the most famous stories actually </connor>
<joey> uh Jim Carrey who was in Hawaii at the </joey>
<connor> time all right uh and he I saw a clip of </connor>
<connor> him telling his story about it as well </connor>
<connor> well what happened was he got a call </connor>
<connor> from his agent being like this is </connor>
<connor> happening </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] uh so you know the first </connor>
<connor> emotion you get is like Panic yeah is </connor>
<connor> there anything I can do I gotta find my </connor>
<connor> friends gotta find my family and </connor>
<connor> everything like that </connor>
<connor> um so he tried calling his daughter I </connor>
<connor> don't think his daughter picked up or </connor>
<connor> anything like that uh but then but then </connor>
<connor> after after that initial panic's over </connor>
<connor> kind of like the acceptance kind of </connor>
<connor> comes in so then what he did was he just </connor>
<connor> he just thought to himself everyone's </connor>
<connor> trying to get out but then he just he </connor>
<connor> just said he just realized he didn't </connor>
<connor> want to die in his car right so he </connor>
<connor> walked out to the hotel and just walked </connor>
<connor> on the beach and just sat there and just </connor>
<connor> thought about everything that he was </connor>
<connor> thankful for in life and I'm like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> man that is that must have been an </connor>
<joey> experience that you can't like I don't </joey>
<joey> know I don't know it's </joey>
<joey> more people like I'm genuinely curious </joey>
<joey> if anyone in Hawaii </joey>
<joey> went through that experience what was </joey>
<joey> your experience because I I find that </joey>
<joey> what happened in Hawaii [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> fascinating because it's it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like a case study of like so many people </joey>
<joey> believing that this one terrible thing </joey>
<joey> is going to happen there's one thing you </joey>
<joey> only see in like films and Cinema and </joey>
<garnt> stuff like that so you don't normally </garnt>
<garnt> you don't really know how people are </garnt>
<garnt> going to react or how how you're going </garnt>
<garnt> through around you you can only just </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] think maybe I'll do this </garnt>
<joey> right maybe I'll do that right and I </joey>
<connor> feel like hearing those stories as well </connor>
<connor> like you know you know first-hand </connor>
<connor> narratives is like you know they you can </connor>
<connor> you can hear and you know imagine what </connor>
<garnt> they were going through but like the </garnt>
<garnt> actual like raw emotions that they were </garnt>
<garnt> going through is like that's something </garnt>
<garnt> you can't just like listen to and </garnt>
<garnt> imagine right like that's something </garnt>
<garnt> that's just like you need to have </garnt>
<garnt> experience the amount the amount of </garnt>
<garnt> comments I saw that was uh when I knew I </garnt>
<garnt> was going out I just started smoking a </garnt>
<garnt> fat blunt man I was I was going out high </garnt>
<joey> as a guy baby </joey>
<joey> and I'm like and I am doing everything </joey>
<joey> strong imaginable before I go I will not </joey>
<joey> die sober </joey>
<connor> no no that's a good question like what </connor>
<connor> would you do </connor>
<joey> I don't know what I do try and break </joey>
<garnt> every law imaginable in an hour try and </garnt>
<joey> break every law environmentally be like </joey>
<connor> you know like like every dark thought </connor>
<connor> you have right it's like you know I'm </connor>
<connor> sure there are people who are like well </connor>
<joey> if we're gonna go in an hour yeah I </joey>
<joey> might as well try and fulfill that more </joey>
<connor> curiosity I've always the [ __ ] giant </connor>
<joey> tortoise </joey>
<connor> I don't know if that's possible okay </connor>
<garnt> okay I'm eating one I don't care if it's </garnt>
<garnt> raw okay I I I want to go out eating </garnt>
<garnt> good food now I've been thinking about </garnt>
<garnt> okay I have 45 minutes to find my </garnt>
<garnt> perfect Last Meal which is available in </garnt>
<garnt> the vicinity I'm in what the [ __ ] what </garnt>
<garnt> would I go with hits honestly McDonald's </garnt>
<connor> assuming that the workers are happy to </connor>
<connor> keep working when the world is ending in </connor>
<joey> 45. you got to clock out no yeah do you </joey>
<joey> know how many people want Big Macs right </joey>
<joey> now I gotta give it to him </joey>
<garnt> it's it's probably they're probably just </garnt>
<garnt> giving it away yeah exactly but I wanna </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna I wanna know if there's anyone </garnt>
<garnt> who's like anyone who [ __ ] confessed </garnt>
<garnt> enough enough </garnt>
<connor> there's probably someone out there but </connor>
<connor> also if if you're if you're dying and </connor>
<connor> then if the other person's dying does </connor>
<connor> confessing help at all like I don't know </connor>
<garnt> because we've never been in that </garnt>
<connor> situation but what what's kind of funny </connor>
<connor> to think about is like they confess </connor>
<joey> right yeah and then they didn't they </joey>
<joey> didn't so they basically just [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> themselves okay can we google if there's </connor>
<connor> any stories of this happening I'm sure </connor>
<connor> there must have been people who like P.S </connor>
<connor> actually there's a [ __ ] all along yeah I </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] on your paws I wasn't a dog P.S I I </joey>
<garnt> banged your mom </garnt>
<garnt> I want to know the wholesome stories but </garnt>
<garnt> also I want to know what was the most </garnt>
<joey> wildest [ __ ] that was like that happened </joey>
<connor> during that 45 minutes [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah I'm sure yeah some people only have </joey>
<joey> like an hour left to live I mean some </joey>
<connor> people already did break laws oh I'm not </connor>
<connor> sure yeah some people probably did and </connor>
<connor> what he got in trouble for it yeah </connor>
<connor> Jesus but they barely part of the movie </connor>
<connor> you wouldn't steal and steal a college I </connor>
<connor> will </connor>
<joey> not breaking him if I had a year to live </joey>
<joey> well I'm starting a meth Empire yeah I </joey>
<joey> hope one of you boys would be you know </joey>
<joey> my my Hank to me to me Walter White I'd </joey>
<joey> like to think so </joey>
<connor> yeah exactly it's like depending on the </connor>
<joey> that's why I was asking about the time </joey>
<joey> frame right because it's like okay if </joey>
<joey> it's like an hour right there's only so </joey>
<connor> much you can do but like say for example </connor>
<connor> if you were gonna die within the next </connor>
<connor> like say a month yeah right like I think </connor>
<connor> it would be very different I decided </connor>
<connor> I've decided what I want to do well if I </connor>
<connor> had an hour left I would film every </connor>
<connor> single hot take I have left that is </connor>
<connor> unsayable out loud and then I'll post it </connor>
<connor> and then I'll die PornHub traffic </connor>
<connor> climbed during the Hawaii missile alert </connor>
<joey> of course I'm not the only one Owen </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> I'm going out I'm going out Bull's </joey>
<joey> emptied </joey>
<joey> all right </joey>
<joey> what time do you think I should lost </joey>
<connor> your time to go out I'm trying to find </connor>
<connor> some funny stories yeah that's such a </connor>
<joey> good question holy [ __ ] I mean I have an </joey>
<joey> hour right I can </joey>
<joey> I mean I could go through everything </joey>
<joey> I'm like you know there'd be a part of </joey>
<joey> me that's like I wonder if I can do it </joey>
<garnt> to some gay porn you know like I've </garnt>
<garnt> never tried so you know maybe now's the </garnt>
<joey> time to like broaden my house it's time </joey>
<joey> to broaden my horizons that's just every </joey>
<joey> tag I'm gonna give it a go go </joey>
<garnt> yeah this is like like because the </garnt>
<garnt> reason I fell into this Rabbit Hole was </garnt>
<joey> reading other people's story because </joey>
<joey> there's so many like nuances and just </joey>
<connor> little things I never thought about </connor>
<joey> until I read about people's experience </joey>
<connor> about it because like yeah if I did have </connor>
<connor> 30 minutes left how the [ __ ] would my </connor>
<connor> mind go if I die if I decided to jack </connor>
<joey> off would I would I try something your </joey>
<joey> would it would I put on [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Masterpiece one last time for like a </joey>
<joey> Victory lap yeah </joey>
<joey> it's up to you man it's one of your </joey>
<joey> brain decide </joey>
<connor> I'd probably be too shocked to think of </connor>
<connor> anything meaningful in one hour you know </connor>
<garnt> when I was a not a lot of time no you </garnt>
<joey> probably just go back to top right I </joey>
<joey> mean we've already talked for now you </joey>
<joey> can't even you can't even finish a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] trash teeth episode </joey>
<joey> like oh I have one hour to live I can't </joey>
<connor> wait to watch my favorite Treasure </connor>
<joey> episode </joey>
<joey> no you can watch it two times speed yeah </joey>
<connor> I got it Mom I can watch one YouTube </connor>
<connor> video before bed the YouTube video </connor>
<connor> oh my god oh but yeah I mean it's it's </connor>
<garnt> it's interesting just </garnt>
<connor> or we have these interesting case yeah </connor>
<garnt> exactly close to one hour marker just in </garnt>
<connor> case so right the one at all it's I </connor>
<connor> think we were about to like reach the </connor>
<connor> one hour mark so yeah hopefully you put </connor>
<joey> on this episode if uh missile will cry </joey>
<joey> if if you're getting like an alert or </joey>
<joey> something like that a false missile a </joey>
<joey> false </joey>
<joey> I wonder if it would ever come back to </joey>
<joey> bite if it ever did happen again in </joey>
<connor> Hawaii there's a missile look but it was </connor>
<garnt> actually legit if people didn't believe </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> yeah unfortunately being on an island is </joey>
<garnt> probably one of the worst places you </garnt>
<connor> could be during a missile yeah well um </connor>
<connor> well it's not even like if you had an </connor>
<connor> hour anyway even if you're on Mainland </connor>
<connor> and it was coming for you if there's any </connor>
<connor> meaningful Direction you could get to an </connor>
<connor> hour yeah yeah exactly like that's like </connor>
<connor> that's like two blocks in New York City </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean yeah you can barely </connor>
<connor> get out of New York </connor>
<garnt> you can barely get out without a uh </garnt>
<connor> crisis happening and let's say even if </connor>
<connor> you were in a metropolitan area or or in </connor>
<joey> a city or whatever if there was a </joey>
<joey> missile Alert in a city you're not </joey>
<joey> getting out of the city because </joey>
<joey> everyone's trying exactly yeah like </joey>
<joey> everyone's gonna try and leave yeah so </joey>
<garnt> obviously you know we saw that with </garnt>
<garnt> covid everyone try to leave certain </garnt>
<garnt> cities were being locked down yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like we see that even some </garnt>
<connor> things like this that the infrastructure </connor>
<garnt> just crumbles when this many people want </garnt>
<garnt> to use it yeah yeah it's like I I I </garnt>
<garnt> think would I be that guy who panic </garnt>
<connor> makes and runs or would I just be the </connor>
<connor> guy who accepts my fear I'll probably be </connor>
<connor> I think I'll be the guy who accepts my </connor>
<connor> yeah you for sure would yeah yeah I'm </connor>
<connor> like I've lived a good life guys you </connor>
<connor> would go to the wine fridge pop one open </connor>
<connor> and just and just look outside the </connor>
<connor> window dude and you were just you would </connor>
<garnt> just swivel the line and Timmy fat I </garnt>
<connor> join you all right yeah like probably go </connor>
<connor> on my rooftop or something like that I </connor>
<connor> didn't know it yeah and and just like </connor>
<connor> swelmed like my last glass of wine or </connor>
<garnt> something like that and just be like </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah it's a beautiful day not one </connor>
<connor> good bottle you've been saving for that </connor>
<garnt> occasion yeah I know especially if </garnt>
<connor> you're in [ __ ] Hawaii imagine how Zen </connor>
<joey> people must have felt oh in the climate </joey>
<connor> you know it feels I can't imagine how </connor>
<garnt> depressed we would be in [ __ ] England </garnt>
<joey> with like the rain coming down it'd be </joey>
<joey> like no that's a fitting end </joey>
<joey> that's like everyone just like </joey>
<joey> conglomerates to the Palm it's just like </joey>
<joey> the collapse it was a good one bro that </joey>
<garnt> that would happen that wouldn't happen </garnt>
<garnt> everyone would go to the nearest [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> Pub and get that last fighting yeah and </joey>
<connor> ironically way to get out yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> cracking a cold one with the boys what </garnt>
<garnt> if he had one week what if I would have </garnt>
<connor> had one week one week to live what are </connor>
<garnt> you doing oh and let's let's say that </garnt>
<garnt> not everyone has one week it's just you </garnt>
<garnt> just me so everything is is available </garnt>
<garnt> and everything is normal right </garnt>
<connor> um so like you know you could get on a </connor>
<garnt> plane you could do all this stuff but no </garnt>
<connor> fast travel obviously no fast travel </connor>
<connor> literally just within the like bounds of </connor>
<connor> what you can do now and money isn't an </connor>
<garnt> issue okay ah well first obviously </garnt>
<joey> you've got to visit your yeah I would I </joey>
<joey> would go to my family first obviously </joey>
<joey> that would take like a few days off my </joey>
<garnt> schedule boom three days gone three days </garnt>
<connor> gone off your schedule three days off my </connor>
<garnt> schedule sorry what's the run you gotta </garnt>
<garnt> optimize this am I staying in England </garnt>
<garnt> all the time </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> but I'm like hey I'm the one with the I </connor>
<joey> think what I would want is to go </joey>
<joey> somewhere that's always been like at the </joey>
<connor> top of my bucket list and then go with </connor>
<connor> my family and then just be like I did it </connor>
<connor> I I made it to the place I've always </connor>
<connor> wanted to go I'm with the people that I </connor>
<joey> care about I'm in this beautiful place </joey>
<garnt> I've always wanted to go yeah I'm good </garnt>
<garnt> you know I do I would like </garnt>
<garnt> I would record a bunch of YouTube videos </garnt>
<joey> that I would set to be public like one </joey>
<joey> five ten years off my desk yeah that's </joey>
<joey> what I would do that </joey>
<joey> I'll be like guys it's uh I would have </joey>
<joey> been like 32 years old I would have been </joey>
<joey> like 35 years old now how's it going on </joey>
<joey> YouTube is it still over Marianne this </joey>
<garnt> man is a YouTuber is this size still </garnt>
<garnt> active I don't know oh my God yeah </garnt>
<garnt> genius content as well oh [ __ ] yeah has </garnt>
<garnt> to be paid himself dividends for that </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> one year and then five years yeah that's </joey>
<garnt> genius you should do that yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah uh he uploaded the video that </connor>
<connor> would go public you know on yeah </connor>
<garnt> have you ever thought about like kind of </garnt>
<connor> documenting because there's been few </connor>
<connor> there's been these kind of people who </connor>
<connor> like take taking a picture like every </connor>
<connor> day of their life for example yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> plus we do document our lives so that's </garnt>
<connor> kind of thing </connor>
<connor> we literally that was a stupid question </connor>
<joey> we literally have thousands of hours of </joey>
<connor> us our lives are two documents against </connor>
<connor> the point where I have no memory of </connor>
<connor> filming some videos I have no memory of </connor>
<connor> a good chunk of videos I do not remember </connor>
<connor> filming them how the process was at all </connor>
<connor> no and now I completely understand why </connor>
<connor> these people who've been creating their </connor>
<connor> entire life are like I have no [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> memory of making that thing because I </connor>
<connor> get it like my video my YouTube video is </connor>
<connor> like six years ago if you told me do I </connor>
<connor> have any memory of making that no memory </connor>
<garnt> no no memory not at all I've made so </garnt>
<garnt> many but even not just like Memories </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> it's it gets harder to remember some </garnt>
<garnt> like just normal days of your life you </garnt>
<joey> know even if if you ask me hey what did </joey>
<joey> you do last Wednesday you'd really have </joey>
<joey> to like think back to it right I don't </joey>
<joey> actually know what I did last week yeah </joey>
<garnt> what did you do last Wednesday what's </garnt>
<garnt> the date </garnt>
<connor> I was on a plane yeah I was </connor>
<joey> still sick dying yeah I was dying </joey>
<joey> because and that's just like last week </joey>
<joey> you know you think you'd remember what </joey>
<joey> you did last week in good detail but </joey>
<joey> then go back like what did you do what </joey>
<joey> what did you do two birthdays ago what </joey>
<connor> was your birthday celebration and then </connor>
<connor> you go back even further and you just </connor>
<connor> realize how little of your life you </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] remember and it's one of the </connor>
<connor> reasons even though like I don't take </connor>
<connor> photo I don't take many photos I've </connor>
<connor> never been a guy who has taken photos </connor>
<connor> and it's kind of like I kind of realized </connor>
<connor> how much it's bitten me in the back now </connor>
<connor> just there is so many like there's </connor>
<connor> there's been a lot of trips that I've </connor>
<connor> not kind of let's say documented or </connor>
<connor> taken a lot of photos off except for </connor>
<connor> maybe one photo on my phone yeah and </connor>
<connor> I've just completely I have nothing </connor>
<connor> I have nothing that to remind me of that </connor>
<connor> trip you know I have nothing to remind </connor>
<connor> me of that memory because I thought </connor>
<joey> I I had this like I thought before it's </joey>
<joey> just like if the Trip's good the </joey>
<joey> memories are weird baby I got the </joey>
<joey> memories stored up in here baby that's </joey>
<garnt> what makes it special and I'm like [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> nah that that was a [ __ ] life </connor>
<connor> should be like allow me to introduce </connor>
<garnt> myself like I'm sure if this the trip is </garnt>
<garnt> special enough for the boys I'm never </garnt>
<connor> gonna forget it yeah I don't even </connor>
<garnt> remember half the [ __ ] that happened on </garnt>
<connor> tour okay </connor>
<connor> yeah half the days </connor>
<garnt> yeah I think I don't even remember every </garnt>
<garnt> venue God if we didn't so I didn't film </garnt>
<joey> it I wouldn't remember half the [ __ ] we </joey>
<garnt> did on our road trip special yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> just I remember watching that car the </garnt>
<joey> road trip special and being like Oh yeah </joey>
<joey> we oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah we did I did say that I </garnt>
<garnt> completely forgot that we spent an </garnt>
<garnt> entire day in like a Germantown racing </garnt>
<garnt> go-karts and [ __ ] like that until I saw </garnt>
<joey> it in the special oh my God yeah I had </joey>
<joey> that when I when I first saw that drop I </joey>
<connor> was like oh we did go here </connor>
<connor> I remember that because I remember like </connor>
<joey> trying to Ram you off the road oh yeah </joey>
<joey> that's right I I completely forgot about </joey>
<connor> like the swan boat though oh yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> right like it's like we were old enough </joey>
<connor> for like like 20 minutes at least 20 30 </connor>
<connor> minutes yeah the bread was good though </connor>
<joey> the bread was good it was good yeah not </joey>
<joey> like and I guess that's why you know I'm </joey>
<joey> I'm kind of glad that I've gotten more </joey>
<joey> into the habit of just like taking </joey>
<garnt> photos because it's like even if it </garnt>
<garnt> might not seem important now yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] you look back five ten years from </garnt>
<joey> now and being like Oh yeah you know that </joey>
<connor> wasn't important or anything like that </connor>
<joey> it wasn't important event or a special </joey>
<joey> place or anything but just seeing that </joey>
<connor> is like yeah that was nice because also </connor>
<connor> sometimes you get photos of maybe bad </connor>
<joey> times and you're like [ __ ] I hate that </joey>
<joey> well I mean that those times you know </joey>
<joey> you could just be like well you know it </joey>
<garnt> happened so yeah you just yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> I've I've always like never felt the </garnt>
<garnt> need to take photos because I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> everyone around me takes photos and they </garnt>
<garnt> upload it to Facebook but hey surprise </garnt>
<garnt> surprise no one uses Facebook anymore if </garnt>
<garnt> you're like our age so I'm like well </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] if other people takes photos oh my </garnt>
<garnt> God I don't post it and parents on </garnt>
<connor> Facebook now sorry I just remember maybe </connor>
<connor> we use Facebook appearance yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's not funny how that happens well </garnt>
<connor> Facebook used to be this like hip cool </connor>
<connor> thing and now it's the thing that is </connor>
<connor> just showing his age yeah yeah I think </connor>
<connor> that it's Facebook has become the </connor>
<connor> platform that your parents use and you </connor>
<connor> use to keep in touch with your older </connor>
<connor> generation of parents and stuff like </connor>
<connor> that I'm glad my parents aren't on </connor>
<garnt> social media </garnt>
<connor> so glad I I'm also glad really really </connor>
<joey> glad holy [ __ ] I'm glad I blocked my dad </joey>
<joey> on social media I thought your dad </joey>
<joey> blocked you no you blocked no I blocked </joey>
<joey> him yeah I I I I look back and I'm like </joey>
<joey> yep you know back then I was I was </joey>
<joey> annoyed that they didn't understand </joey>
<joey> social media and now I'm like thank God </joey>
<connor> my parents aren't on Facebook on on </connor>
<connor> Twitter aren't doing on posting [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah I don't want to see them but I </connor>
<connor> guess my kid will be like why is my dad </connor>
<connor> always been on social media his whole </connor>
<joey> life </joey>
<joey> it's like everyone at school knows </joey>
<connor> everything about I share a video of my </connor>
<connor> dad hitting the dab when he's 20. </connor>
<garnt> because because like you know I've have </garnt>
<garnt> you seen like pictures of your parents </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that when they were young </garnt>
<connor> yeah and stuff yeah I like that resource </connor>
<connor> video of why do you your parents even </connor>
<garnt> look old in their younger pictures yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's true I haven't seen that one </garnt>
<garnt> well think about it like when you see </garnt>
<connor> pictures of your parents when they're </connor>
<connor> young they look old still right they </connor>
<connor> look old even when they're like 20. or </connor>
<joey> when you look at pictures of like 19 </joey>
<connor> what was like high school kids in the </connor>
<joey> 70s they look old they look older for </joey>
<connor> some reason than high school kids today </connor>
<joey> and it's and yeah and it's this weird </joey>
<connor> like cycle I mean obviously there's a </connor>
<connor> resource video but like it's like weird </connor>
<connor> psychological </connor>
<connor> trick that happens of like because it's </connor>
<connor> from an older time yeah you initially </connor>
<connor> condition yourself to look at that and </connor>
<connor> be like that is an older person yeah </connor>
<connor> from before but they still look older </connor>
<joey> because your only image of that is this </joey>
<garnt> thing is old well like also what I find </garnt>
<garnt> would what I'm going to find interesting </garnt>
<garnt> going forward is that </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> the world was just never as well </garnt>
<garnt> documented as it is now don't they look </garnt>
<garnt> older </garnt>
<joey> that's high school they don't they don't </joey>
<garnt> look like high schoolers right yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> this dude I mean doesn't look like a </garnt>
<garnt> high school </garnt>
<garnt> I think I think it looks oh just because </garnt>
<joey> of the just because of the aesthetic </joey>
<connor> right because you're not sure yeah but </connor>
<connor> that's what I'm saying Okay okay then I </connor>
<connor> get it because I I look back right I </connor>
<connor> think back and I see photos like that </connor>
<connor> and it just feels old because I can't </connor>
<joey> imagine living in that time zone because </joey>
<joey> you have like the [ __ ] serpia filter </joey>
<joey> everyone looks same video you mean sorry </joey>
<joey> it looks like it's going through like a </joey>
<joey> sepia filter everyone looks different </joey>
<joey> the haircut's different and I can't </joey>
<joey> imagine it being in like 4K HD you know </joey>
<joey> what I mean right like I I can't like I </joey>
<joey> can't imagine looking around and being </joey>
<joey> like oh this is what it looks like in </joey>
<joey> normal colors in 4K HD and [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> that right right which is why when I see </connor>
<connor> like have you ever seen like old videos </connor>
<connor> that have been remastered with like </connor>
<garnt> modern colors yeah yeah it freaks me out </garnt>
<connor> so much right yeah it's like that um </connor>
<connor> there's videos that where it's like some </connor>
<connor> One filmed like Japan in like 1910 yes </connor>
<joey> I've seen that and then they just it's </joey>
<garnt> 4K yeah recolored remastered it's cool </garnt>
<garnt> and it freaks me out because I'm like </garnt>
<connor> people are freaked out like what the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] is that thing yeah there's that </joey>
<connor> camera because you look at this video of </connor>
<connor> like I think there's like one of like </connor>
<connor> Kyoto in like the 1890s or something </connor>
<connor> yeah and it's just weird to think like </connor>
<connor> oh every single person in this video is </connor>
<joey> not here anymore yeah and that's like </joey>
<garnt> terrifying it's so weird don't say that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's so weird they're characters </garnt>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> PCS history the whole NPC they're all </joey>
<garnt> NPCs everyone is a history mpz that only </garnt>
<joey> exists in the [ __ ] books okay </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's so like it's just so </joey>
<connor> fascinating I had that thought with like </connor>
<connor> World War II right like yeah growing up </connor>
<connor> oh yeah you had like uh grandparents and </connor>
<connor> stuff in here and then now it's slowly </connor>
<connor> getting the point where like in a few </connor>
<connor> years or you know in like 10 something </connor>
<connor> years whatever it's like the there's </connor>
<garnt> gonna be so little World War II um </garnt>
<connor> survivors and within like 20 30 years </connor>
<connor> there'll be no World War II yeah that's </connor>
<connor> weird to think about yeah growing up you </connor>
<joey> you'd always see them on like TV and </joey>
<joey> they would talk about it and you're like </joey>
<joey> this is like a thing yeah and then now </joey>
<joey> there's nobody who remembers it nobody </joey>
<joey> who was there yeah you can recount that </joey>
<connor> time period yeah like this extremely </connor>
<connor> important historical event when nobody </connor>
<connor> was alive for it yeah like that's so </connor>
<connor> weird going from having people alive to </connor>
<connor> it to then not having people alive like </connor>
<connor> especially in our time right because </connor>
<connor> obviously we can speculate what the </connor>
<connor> Romans were like and stuff but no one in </connor>
<connor> our time knows anyone who was ever alive </connor>
<connor> doing that you know what I mean like </connor>
<connor> weird thinking that that's it's like and </connor>
<garnt> and it's like you know that's how that's </garnt>
<connor> there's always I always find that </connor>
<connor> there's this disconnect with history </connor>
<connor> right where you know it happens you you </connor>
<garnt> know that these people existed but they </garnt>
<garnt> they also just kind of feels feel like </garnt>
<connor> characters in the book that's why it's </connor>
<connor> also cool having this much documentation </connor>
<connor> right because like I think the older the </connor>
<connor> history is the more scarce options we </connor>
<garnt> have to figure out exactly right so we </garnt>
<joey> have to like fill in the pieces </joey>
<connor> ourselves sure for sure but like what I </connor>
<joey> find interesting is that I have this </joey>
<joey> image of my parents when they were like </joey>
<joey> younger right and you have like I have </joey>
<joey> like stories that I've heard from like </joey>
<joey> uncles and aunties and some old pictures </joey>
<joey> but at the end of the day it's still </joey>
<joey> just an image of what they were like I </joey>
<joey> don't actually know what they were like </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> um our kids are gonna [ __ ] like our </joey>
<joey> kids are gonna have like every single </joey>
<joey> like they're gonna have like every </joey>
<joey> argument we've had about bone and </joey>
<joey> chicken and like if if my kid doesn't </joey>
<garnt> like chicken wings he's gonna [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> know why oh my dad how old is your how </connor>
<connor> old is your grandma </connor>
<garnt> oh my grandma on my dad's side is around </garnt>
<connor> 97. okay okay this is a weird thing </connor>
<connor> right your grandma that is 97 is like an </connor>
<connor> age-wise was is closer to like the </connor>
<connor> Victorian area than like today yeah from </connor>
<connor> the moment she was born right isn't that </connor>
<joey> weird to think that Victoria that we </joey>
<joey> think of that really quirky time like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] weird where they were doing </connor>
<joey> weird [ __ ] they were playing like </joey>
<joey> asbestos in their wallpaper yeah and </joey>
<connor> everything it's like you know it's just </connor>
<connor> weird to think there are people who are </connor>
<connor> alive today who are old who are closer </connor>
<connor> to these really far off periods in </connor>
<joey> history that we think is far off because </joey>
<connor> we're born now yeah we think 150 years </connor>
<connor> ago that's crazy you know what I mean </connor>
<connor> yeah um like also there was a great </connor>
<connor> video where it was like a like 1960s or </connor>
<connor> 50s this woman who was like 90 and she </connor>
<connor> was recounting stories of the Victorian </connor>
<joey> period because obviously at that time it </joey>
<connor> was still you know it was still around </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> right yeah weird it's just so strange </garnt>
<connor> geez that's yeah there's videos of these </connor>
<connor> people talking about those times so </connor>
<garnt> strange yeah and it's weird like you </garnt>
<garnt> know going back to like ancient history </garnt>
<garnt> is weird to think </garnt>
<joey> we can't we can't really process in in </joey>
<connor> our minds just how old like ancient </connor>
<joey> Egypt was you know yeah because you get </joey>
<connor> to a point in history and you think oh </connor>
<connor> it's all like around the same period </connor>
<connor> it's all like Roman Roman history Greek </connor>
<connor> history ancient you know ancient </connor>
<connor> Egyptian history so it's all the same </connor>
<connor> because it's all history but like it's </connor>
<connor> isn't it like the ancient Egyptians were </connor>
<connor> as all to the Romans as the Romans are </connor>
<garnt> to us yeah something along those like </garnt>
<joey> that like some great civilization make </joey>
<connor> it feel like it's all one blur yeah when </connor>
<joey> you actually look at the time between </joey>
<joey> you like whoa yeah I think yeah because </joey>
<joey> I think I saw something similar whereas </joey>
<joey> like it was a lot like that but like say </joey>
<connor> with like the dinosaurs right of like I </connor>
<connor> think it's something like in our heads </connor>
<connor> we think like Tyrannosaurus Rex and </connor>
<connor> stegosaurus are just like yeah they were </connor>
<connor> around the same time like it's it's you </connor>
<connor> know it's all during the dinosaur era </connor>
<connor> yeah but in actuality I think between </connor>
<joey> the stegosaurus and the Tyrannosaurus </joey>
<garnt> Rex there's like 400 million years oh no </garnt>
<garnt> we're uh humanity is a [ __ ] footnote </garnt>
<garnt> compared to how long the dinosaurs yeah </garnt>
<joey> the world but it's just so crazy to </joey>
<joey> think that it's like yeah they're the </joey>
<garnt> same thing they're around the same time </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just not even like we like to </garnt>
<garnt> think that we're better like huh look at </garnt>
<garnt> these dumb animals they got wiped out by </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] media bro we've like hardly </garnt>
<garnt> we've barely lived the amount of like we </garnt>
<joey> have been we live have lived a fraction </joey>
<joey> of the time they have Ruled the Earth </joey>
<joey> yeah and then all it took was like one </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] day and they're like gone you </joey>
<joey> know it's it's because they didn't get </joey>
<connor> along </connor>
<joey> we wiped out more of us than anyone else </joey>
<joey> all right </joey>
<joey> no meteor can take that away from yeah </joey>
<joey> that's we killed way more of us than </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] dumb meteor ever would have </joey>
<joey> all right there's just four flexing on </joey>
<connor> the meteorite we are the best at killing </connor>
<connor> us yeah without now no one is better </connor>
<garnt> than us that's why I was smart just to </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] kid however if the ants decided </connor>
<joey> to have an uprising we would be [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> oh absolutely absolutely if the answer </connor>
<connor> decided they have had enough of being in </connor>
<joey> the ground if the insect world decided </joey>
<garnt> to start a coup d'etat one day like they </garnt>
<joey> can overtake us in a day well that just </joey>
<joey> that just [ __ ] remind me do you know </joey>
<joey> something weird I've been doing in the </joey>
<joey> holidays are you collecting ants </joey>
<connor> um I haven't been collecting thank God I </connor>
<joey> would have been this is I do not want to </joey>
<connor> get it I'm not mailing don't worry about </connor>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> I've been I've been reading a book </joey>
<joey> like in 2023 like like a book book like </joey>
<joey> wow words like not not even like a light </joey>
<connor> novel like a heavy like no pictures like </connor>
<connor> no pictures wow it's just a heavy novel </connor>
<connor> so yeah I've been reading this uh sci-fi </connor>
<garnt> uh sci-fi novel called children children </garnt>
<connor> of time you ever heard of this book </connor>
<garnt> it's I but maybe you have maybe you </garnt>
<joey> haven't I don't know I just uh I I </joey>
<joey> um I know you haven't you don't read I </joey>
<connor> hear what people talking about oh okay </connor>
<connor> oh my God what are those funny things </connor>
<joey> yeah I mean it's I've heard of a book </joey>
<garnt> before you know those it's it's like </garnt>
<garnt> read about a book yeah it's a </garnt>
<garnt> fascinating read uh because I I heard </garnt>
<garnt> something I heard something about the </garnt>
<garnt> book that kind of like piqued my </garnt>
<garnt> curiosity uh because it explores the </garnt>
<garnt> idea of like what </garnt>
<garnt> what aliens actually are and what's </garnt>
<garnt> Evolution actually is right so uh the </garnt>
<garnt> premise the premise of this book right </garnt>
<garnt> is Humanity at the beginning of Like A </garnt>
<connor> Flat Earth a conspiracy theory yeah what </connor>
<garnt> is evolution let's break it down let's </garnt>
<garnt> pray let's break it down so it it poses </garnt>
<garnt> this question so it's the book is set in </garnt>
<garnt> like the Far Far Future where humanity </garnt>
<garnt> is like an advanced race or something </garnt>
<garnt> like that and there's this one person </garnt>
<garnt> who just goes let's let's do an epic </garnt>
<garnt> experiment </garnt>
<connor> um let's try and give monkeys these </connor>
<connor> virus this virus that speeds up </connor>
<connor> Evolution put them on a planet and see </connor>
<connor> what happens okay and then I one day and </connor>
<connor> then eventually when they become as </connor>
<connor> smart as us I will come down and be </connor>
<connor> their new Gods right okay </connor>
<connor> um but unfortunately sorry Connor the </connor>
<connor> the plan goes wrong all the monkeys dies </connor>
<connor> uh but what happens instead is that </connor>
<connor> spiders instead get infected by this </connor>
<connor> virus all right that just kind of like </connor>
<connor> just speeds up evolution and </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> and uh speeds up Evolution and knowledge </connor>
<connor> basically like that um so what happens </connor>
<connor> is it follows why spiders [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> that's like the worst people to get </connor>
<garnt> events but that's that's why spiders </garnt>
<joey> because when we think of what is alien </joey>
<connor> to us like what is more alien to us and </connor>
<joey> un understandable than spiders and it's </joey>
<joey> fascinating to think for one it may like </joey>
<connor> it cemented the realization that if </connor>
<connor> aliens exist there's no [ __ ] way we'd </connor>
<connor> be able to communicate with them or like </connor>
<connor> or like have any resemblance to us </connor>
<connor> whatsoever </connor>
<connor> um because it really like it it follows </connor>
<connor> this spider civilization that emerges </connor>
<connor> from like I guess their Stone Age to </connor>
<connor> their Modern Age right and it shows how </connor>
<connor> different basically everything in their </connor>
<connor> civilization would be </connor>
<connor> um from like human civilization </connor>
<connor> um just based on what spiders are so </connor>
<connor> like a great example is it of this is </connor>
<connor> like Midway through the book slight </connor>
<connor> spoilers but it's only like a small </connor>
<connor> scene Midway through the book uh one of </connor>
<connor> the advanced humans crash land on this </connor>
<connor> planet right </connor>
<connor> um and the spiders kind of like they </connor>
<connor> they take they they take this human in </connor>
<connor> and they start studying this human </connor>
<connor> um and they come to the conclusion that </connor>
<connor> humans must be [ __ ] dumb man because </connor>
<connor> there's no there's no way that spot that </connor>
<connor> there's no way that it can communicate </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> um because spite of the way spiders </connor>
<connor> communicate is they don't have ears they </connor>
<connor> communicate through vibrations yeah so </connor>
<connor> they form this communication system with </connor>
<connor> vibrations through their webs to </connor>
<connor> communicate complex ideas to each other </connor>
<connor> and there's humans who's this human who </connor>
<connor> is barking </connor>
<connor> voice like Sound Vibrations to them </connor>
<connor> they're like nah there's there's no way </connor>
<connor> any animal would use sound as a </connor>
<connor> vibration like medium that's that's dumb </connor>
<connor> why would people do that yeah and </connor>
<connor> there's no way that any animal would any </connor>
<connor> animal would evolve </connor>
<connor> um an orifice that they use to </connor>
<connor> communicate and also ingest food that </connor>
<connor> just seems sub-optimal why would any why </connor>
<connor> would I know any animals do that and the </connor>
<connor> spiders come to the conclusion that </connor>
<connor> humans are these uh dumb animals that </connor>
<connor> have not like reached Evolution </connor>
<connor> everything like that and it's just </connor>
<connor> there's so much about this book that </connor>
<connor> like opens your mind and like makes you </connor>
<connor> rethink what is it about like our </connor>
<connor> society and our civilization that as </connor>
<connor> that is based on us basically coming </connor>
<garnt> from [ __ ] monkeys and everything like </garnt>
<garnt> that so basically if </garnt>
<garnt> ants do like decides do an uprising it's </garnt>
<garnt> probably going to be a different kind of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] Uprising than anything that we </garnt>
<garnt> can [ __ ] imagine and everything like </garnt>
<connor> that I don't know like I think it's easy </connor>
<connor> to think that Evolution just stops </connor>
<connor> because you're like everything I get it </connor>
<connor> now I understand how every animal is and </connor>
<garnt> how we are but obviously it's kept it's </garnt>
<joey> been going on for millions of years and </joey>
<connor> it'll probably keep on going yeah people </connor>
<joey> will get like [ __ ] Tails I'll be sick </joey>
<joey> we might grow another arm who knows </joey>
<connor> who knows where humanity is going to be </connor>
<connor> in like millions and millions of years </connor>
<connor> if we live as long as if we live as long </connor>
<garnt> as the dinosaurs that would be pretty </garnt>
<connor> interesting I'd like to think the </connor>
<connor> spiders are watching me and they're like </connor>
<connor> what is he doing it's just me watching </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> Dave </connor>
<connor> this must be a complicated human ritual </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> yeah it's just like that Meme where it's </connor>
<connor> just like you know people look back on </connor>
<connor> the memes and they try to study like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] low cap images or something this </connor>
<connor> must have been some ancient religious </connor>
<connor> text or something like that do you think </connor>
<connor> that actually happened with like the </connor>
<connor> Angels yeah yeah yeah yeah we've I swear </connor>
<connor> they've been studying cases where we </connor>
<connor> thought it was something we were so </connor>
<connor> wrong multiple times because obviously </connor>
<connor> you get more information and you you </connor>
<connor> know the world's become more connected </connor>
<connor> and it's you know a lot of information </connor>
<connor> that we had in English was based off </connor>
<connor> like wrong accounts and all also </connor>
<connor> resources that weren't really great and </connor>
<connor> so now we can we can translate and stuff </connor>
<joey> so it's much better yeah not that we're </joey>
<joey> doing right now could you imagine if </joey>
<joey> like some archaeologist was just like </joey>
<joey> stunning like ancient Egyptian like </joey>
<joey> hieroglyphs it can be like oh we we </joey>
<joey> still haven't like uncovered what this </joey>
<joey> meaningful message must be because they </joey>
<joey> left it on this wall and then you you </joey>
<joey> know you go back 4 000 years and this </joey>
<joey> suggestion is just like </joey>
<joey> I said </joey>
<connor> what are these strange golden like M </connor>
<joey> Signs they've put everywhere yeah they </joey>
<joey> seem to be there must be the cult of M </joey>
<joey> they should be in every place in Mass </joey>
<garnt> it's been some ancient religion yeah a </garnt>
<connor> really crucial part to the human's </connor>
<joey> existence </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean we found sir we </joey>
<joey> found more golden M's lying around what </joey>
<connor> could it mean there's so many of them </connor>
<connor> what could it mean there's so many in </connor>
<connor> this one continent in America there </connor>
<garnt> seems to be a density of these </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god oh man it's uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it would be interesting to think </garnt>
<connor> it's like a [ __ ] sick book though </connor>
<garnt> they should make that into an anime </garnt>
<garnt> they're not okay honestly it's like if </garnt>
<garnt> you if if you like me kind of sounds </garnt>
<connor> like terraformers but less anime because </connor>
<garnt> like the terraformers if it was smart </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's terraformers if it like </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's so many interesting </garnt>
<garnt> ideas like eventually the spiders </garnt>
<garnt> um learn how to make computers but they </garnt>
<garnt> learn how to make computers via </garnt>
<garnt> programming like ad programming like </garnt>
<garnt> programming ants off this [ __ ] [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> which I'm just like I never thought </garnt>
<garnt> about it like that but if you could </garnt>
<garnt> learn to program ants via because ants </garnt>
<garnt> ants have like a real ants have a set of </garnt>
<garnt> programming right it's you think about a </garnt>
<garnt> normal Ant and the stupid as [ __ ] but </garnt>
<garnt> somehow ant colonies if you study ant </garnt>
<garnt> colonies they're able to do some [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> incredible things dumb individuals smart </connor>
<joey> together we should make ant AI </joey>
<joey> or would it be real intelligence no AI </joey>
<joey> stands for ant intelligence </joey>
<connor> dude when the ants see what we did to </connor>
<connor> them they're gonna be pissed they see </connor>
<connor> all these tick tocks people owning them </connor>
<connor> bro it's over dude it's over </connor>
<garnt> oh my God it's like I'm sorry Malin this </garnt>
<joey> uh she's the person </joey>
<joey> like all the pesticides right they </joey>
<joey> already evolve to kind of be Beyond it </joey>
<joey> and we're constantly chasing the next </joey>
<joey> one yeah we'll get to the point where </joey>
<garnt> using this pesticide is just not </garnt>
<connor> feasible because it's so dangerous to us </connor>
<garnt> yeah uh well if you think about it so </garnt>
<garnt> many like modern inventions and </garnt>
<garnt> everything are based on nature itself </garnt>
<garnt> because Nature has figured out how to do </garnt>
<connor> this yeah man yeah so they're trying to </connor>
<connor> make like this smart machines like </connor>
<joey> Engineering Systems where they're based </joey>
<connor> on like uh real life structures because </connor>
<connor> like a like where they try and make uh </connor>
<joey> these like kind of RC planes that are </joey>
<joey> based more off like Wing structure like </joey>
<joey> birds yeah yeah exactly yeah obviously </joey>
<joey> over Evolution they've evolved a way </joey>
<joey> that works best yeah because because one </joey>
<joey> day some dude looked up to this guy saw </joey>
<joey> a bird flying and went I won't do that </joey>
<garnt> no it's like how do you like that's how </garnt>
<joey> it started yeah makes you wonder like </joey>
<joey> how would you how would you would planes </joey>
<garnt> be any different today if Birds just </garnt>
<garnt> didn't exist right so we just don't have </garnt>
<joey> that framework if they just wasn't an </joey>
<connor> animal yeah it's the way that like a </connor>
<connor> plane works is very different well I </connor>
<connor> guess well they have wings right well </connor>
<connor> yeah I mean it's </connor>
<connor> like I guess what part of engineering </connor>
<connor> you care about I mean because it's like </connor>
<connor> we just stuck a [ __ ] explosion on </connor>
<connor> there because we couldn't figure out how </connor>
<connor> to do it in a way yeah it works the way </connor>
<garnt> that they do it so we had we had a strap </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] jet fuel that it burns you know </garnt>
<garnt> what I mean </garnt>
<garnt> but like the Wright brothers didn't have </garnt>
<connor> that right they they steam I think no is </connor>
<joey> it steam oh no diesel no it was diesel </joey>
<joey> sorry of course it was pretty in diesel </joey>
<joey> engine yeah Kai look it up yeah it's </joey>
<connor> probably a diesel engine right we're </connor>
<garnt> getting to the point of trash days where </garnt>
<garnt> we're just kind of like spewing [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> over the bed because it was like it was </connor>
<connor> like they had the a compact and </connor>
<connor> lightweight enough system that could </connor>
<connor> that made it so you could power that </connor>
<connor> right and all you need to do is make an </connor>
<connor> aerofoil which is basically just </connor>
<connor> something that just catches the most </connor>
<garnt> drag yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and then you just [ __ ] power It </garnt>
<garnt> Forward </garnt>
<connor> all right all right yeah you know small </connor>
<garnt> explosions all the way yeah Humanity </garnt>
<garnt> since the beginning boom that's that's </garnt>
<joey> all that's all we love everything they </joey>
<joey> saw an explosion they saw momentum and </joey>
<joey> they went what if we just attached that </joey>
<connor> to something </connor>
<connor> you that's how you want to make a </connor>
<connor> lightweight system now it is getting </connor>
<connor> closer and closer in a sense to either </connor>
<connor> either the the amount of power we can </connor>
<connor> generate or the size of electricity </connor>
<connor> needs to improve a lot or you kind of </connor>
<connor> get it closer to I suppose you can get </connor>
<garnt> it's like a bird wing and you can maybe </garnt>
<garnt> get it more perfect in the sense there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but it depends what you want to do </garnt>
<garnt> because Birds can't like uh Birds a lot </garnt>
<connor> of the time coach flap in place right </connor>
<connor> like if you want a drone yeah stop birds </connor>
<joey> don't do that I mean besides but </joey>
<garnt> hummingbirds do yeah right but then how </garnt>
<garnt> do you how do you like generate that </garnt>
<connor> yeah certain dragonflies and stuff yeah </connor>
<connor> dragonflies are the best flyers in like </connor>
<garnt> nature holy [ __ ] like I sometimes I see </garnt>
<connor> a dragonfly fly maneuver and it's insane </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> you just reminded me like I mean they </joey>
<joey> made mid-flight yeah I'm like that's </joey>
<garnt> hippie like it literally now that I </garnt>
<joey> think about I remember as a kid thinking </joey>
<joey> like dragonfly flights patterns look </joey>
<garnt> like they're pre-programmed yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah he literally like [ __ ] that's </joey>
<connor> incredible yeah I guess yeah depending </connor>
<garnt> on what kind of plane you'd want to make </garnt>
<garnt> but what it would need to do you'd pick </garnt>
<garnt> the aerofoil right on the face I guess </garnt>
<garnt> you could there's nothing saying you </garnt>
<connor> couldn't make a dragonfly-esque system I </connor>
<connor> think you just need it all to be </connor>
<connor> balanced and you need a way to power </connor>
<connor> that much force yeah </connor>
<connor> also that'd be a lot of G's I think if </connor>
<connor> you're whipping around that fast yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah don't don't dragonflies go through </joey>
<connor> like the the most IG force or something </connor>
<joey> animals going from static to room yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's a lot that's a lot yeah no </garnt>
<garnt> we're not good at that well obviously </garnt>
<garnt> because we've got [ __ ] legs and we're </garnt>
<garnt> heavy dragonflies are [ __ ] light of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah but also often a lot of times </garnt>
<connor> like birds and like like um a lot of the </connor>
<connor> times their skulls kind of evolve to do </connor>
<connor> certain things like um woodpeckers they </connor>
<garnt> just wrap their tongue around their </garnt>
<garnt> brain to absorb it you know that are you </garnt>
<joey> serious your tongue wraps around their </joey>
<joey> brain </joey>
<connor> that's right I'm trying to Google this </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] that's crazy </joey>
<connor> if you like got into a car crash and </connor>
<joey> you're just like hold on I'm Gonna Save </joey>
<joey> myself from getting an aneurysm that </joey>
<connor> legit yeah look at this look at the </connor>
<joey> diagram the the tongue wraps around the </joey>
<joey> brain oh that's epic [ __ ] like give some </joey>
<connor> kind of cushion to their brain because </connor>
<garnt> like they just like nature just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> up hentai like concept you know what I </garnt>
<garnt> mean that's </garnt>
<connor> what is that okay okay explain that </connor>
<connor> concept to me let's break it down </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> tell me that or something tell me the </connor>
<garnt> plot what's the plot oh [ __ ] awesome </garnt>
<joey> yeah that's something new man </joey>
<joey> hey I can't call for that [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<joey> we [ __ ] up Humanity we've trained an </joey>
<joey> AI to like come up with [ __ ] with brain </joey>
<garnt> with brain wrapped tonguing brain </garnt>
<garnt> wrapped oh my God yeah maybe she's </garnt>
<connor> thinking of all different types of </connor>
<garnt> planes now it makes me wonder how how </garnt>
<garnt> did how did the invention of like the </garnt>
<connor> helicopter how did that get like dude </connor>
<connor> that's actually a [ __ ] [ __ ] sick </connor>
<garnt> history uh because the guy who made it </garnt>
<garnt> is a [ __ ] psychopath he just was like </garnt>
<garnt> you have to be like I look like </garnt>
<garnt> helicopter he was like determined to die </garnt>
<garnt> like if you look at the history of like </garnt>
<garnt> the models of how I made it I swear one </garnt>
<garnt> of the dudes who was trying to make it </garnt>
<connor> was like actually insane yeah like it </connor>
<connor> crashed so many times right but he just </connor>
<connor> kept trying to make more because he was </connor>
<connor> like dead set on it there's also like a </connor>
<garnt> genius invention really yeah yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> I I mean I I don't I I fully believe </garnt>
<garnt> that because I look at a helicopter and </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like that shouldn't fly I </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't know what I'm talking about </garnt>
<connor> we're living in a simulation I always </connor>
<connor> thought helicopters were way cooler than </connor>
<joey> planes I was a helicopter gang all the </joey>
<joey> way wait how was team helicopter I do </joey>
<connor> not have this like you just you just </connor>
<connor> like when I saw like a battle helicopter </connor>
<joey> I think that's just purely based on the </joey>
<connor> fact that like you don't see you don't </connor>
<joey> see helicopters as often as planes yeah </joey>
<connor> sure and all the helicopters you see are </connor>
<joey> kind of lame they're all kind of like </joey>
<joey> you know normal ones but they're </joey>
<connor> actually the ones with guns like whoa </connor>
<connor> something in your boy brain you're like </connor>
<connor> oh that's cool </connor>
<garnt> I think it's also just the like the idea </garnt>
<joey> of the helicopter let's let's spin this </joey>
<garnt> thing so [ __ ] kind of fast that we </garnt>
<joey> could fly as a kid I'm just like yo I'll </joey>
<joey> just fly but stain yeah just just stay </joey>
<garnt> in the air yeah planes you're just like </garnt>
<connor> it's got a [ __ ] engine to like making </connor>
<connor> her pew pew pew I don't [ __ ] care </connor>
<joey> about that let's try spinning some </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] blades to get you up in the air </connor>
<connor> that's metal as [ __ ] man yeah you know </connor>
<joey> that's badass yeah which makes all the </joey>
<joey> more funny when have you seen those </joey>
<garnt> videos where you see like the helicopter </garnt>
<garnt> like taking off but like the frame rate </garnt>
<joey> of the camera shutter speed yeah so it </joey>
<joey> just looks like it's staying still </joey>
<garnt> someone just turned ground yeah it just </garnt>
<garnt> looks like it's suspended in the air and </garnt>
<joey> just like going up </joey>
<joey> the first person to discover that is a </joey>
<garnt> genius it's like a [ __ ] Looney Tunes </garnt>
<joey> walk you through the camera and they're </joey>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] well I mean uh I mean </connor>
<connor> it happens a lot natural like so when </connor>
<connor> we're filming now right like obviously </connor>
<connor> uh a lot of light flickers yeah you know </connor>
<connor> you're in Japan I don't know which side </connor>
<connor> you're on it's either flickering 50 </connor>
<connor> times a second or or 60. yeah right </connor>
<connor> obviously it's not actually like fully </connor>
<connor> going on off but it's you know and </connor>
<garnt> sometimes on camera you set the hurts </garnt>
<garnt> um if you set the shutter speed to the </garnt>
<garnt> wrong thing or yeah you have it on maybe </garnt>
<connor> a different anti-flicker mode yeah </connor>
<joey> you'll see it like the waves yeah </joey>
<joey> appearing on them so sometimes you can </joey>
<joey> even actually seeing like flickering </joey>
<connor> slips yeah you see it pretty [ __ ] bad </connor>
<connor> I've got a lot of video footage where </connor>
<connor> it's happened and you're like God damn </connor>
<garnt> it's [ __ ] unusable yeah it's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> flickering yeah well there's a there's a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of that you know the human sensors </garnt>
<garnt> can't take in there's so many like </garnt>
<garnt> spectrums of light and everything like </garnt>
<garnt> that I imagine if you could see [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> infrared and that's [ __ ] sick like I </connor>
<connor> love the um you know the mantis shrimp </connor>
<connor> yeah I [ __ ] love that that thing's </connor>
<garnt> cool it's one of my favorite things </garnt>
<garnt> that's one of my favorite animals of all </garnt>
<connor> time yeah that's the stories of it </connor>
<connor> busting glass because it's just it like </connor>
<joey> it's like boils the air yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it literally creates almost like a </joey>
<garnt> nuclear explosion from how fast it moves </garnt>
<joey> in terms of in Terms like the heat and </joey>
<joey> pressure it creates it's just like boom </joey>
<connor> it's like a sonic boom basically yeah </connor>
<connor> it's Sonic moves yeah it's kind of crazy </connor>
<connor> that like fish could evolve to that I </connor>
<connor> wish we [ __ ] evolved to that yeah </connor>
<joey> I'm just like yeah I look at the mantis </joey>
<connor> shrimp and I'm just like [ __ ] we go </connor>
<connor> wrong yeah wait wait where the [ __ ] did </connor>
<connor> we go wrong you know because like how </connor>
<garnt> One shrimp one shrimp in history saw a </garnt>
<garnt> clam and thought the only the most </garnt>
<garnt> optimal way to get inside this clam is </garnt>
<garnt> punching the [ __ ] out of it I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> that's isn't it crazy on paper if I </garnt>
<connor> asked you can't yeah do you want </connor>
<connor> intelligence or do you want an arm that </connor>
<joey> can [ __ ] boil air you'd be like I I </joey>
<connor> would like the arm that boils yeah I </connor>
<joey> would like to see every color please </joey>
<connor> there's more colors I can't see and then </connor>
<connor> then these [ __ ] little shrimp but </connor>
<connor> they'll just on the [ __ ] ocean floor </connor>
<connor> yeah and we're the ones who evolved well </connor>
<connor> isn't that [ __ ] dumb because when I'm </connor>
<connor> playing I feel about this when I'm </connor>
<connor> playing d d I'm like I'm like man </connor>
<connor> obviously I'm gonna spec into like </connor>
<connor> Wizardry or like Charisma I never put </connor>
<joey> anything in intelligence because they </joey>
<connor> always get it no they always get it </connor>
<connor> wrong in video games intelligence should </connor>
<joey> be way more op in video games yeah this </joey>
<joey> is humanity is what happens when you try </joey>
<joey> to balance out all the skill points </joey>
<garnt> we just average on everything compared </garnt>
<joey> to the Animal Kingdom we put all of our </joey>
<connor> stats into intelligence yeah we can't </connor>
<joey> even appreciate that yeah we're not </joey>
<connor> intelligent enough to appreciate that at </connor>
<connor> all right all the points in intelligence </connor>
<joey> and the ability to throw things that's </joey>
<connor> pretty much everything we did yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> we're pretty good at running </joey>
<joey> well I mean compared to like a cheetah </joey>
<garnt> well that's the thing a lot of animals </garnt>
<garnt> like opposable thumbs that's pretty </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] op yeah a lot of animals can't </connor>
<connor> run like marathons oh that's true we can </connor>
<connor> run for pretty long I mean I can't </connor>
<connor> I didn't get that some of us some of us </connor>
<joey> are pretty [ __ ] beautiful </joey>
<connor> I'll let them do it I'm I'm I expect </connor>
<connor> into the intelligence trees all right </connor>
<connor> all right sorry I don't want me </connor>
<garnt> do you know humans have a no way of </garnt>
<garnt> sensing wetness no I heard that oh I saw </garnt>
<connor> this we just know there's like we can </connor>
<connor> tell the temperature different though </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> I saw that yeah I found that really </garnt>
<connor> interesting because I'm like how many </connor>
<garnt> other things can't I sense but I can </garnt>
<connor> just sense like sense a bad take when </connor>
<joey> you have it guys that's another thing </joey>
<joey> you can't say it's a dark thought before </joey>
<garnt> we haven't built those receptors yet I I </garnt>
<joey> can sense whether a fart is gonna smell </joey>
<connor> or not very far </connor>
<joey> that's really yeah I think I'm pretty </joey>
<connor> confident </connor>
<connor> I I like you're like test it better </connor>
<joey> what's your Source I I made it the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] I feel like I just know I just </connor>
<connor> know when a father's gonna smell okay </connor>
<garnt> this is this is something in my my bow </garnt>
<connor> tells me </connor>
<connor> do you feel like you can tell if </connor>
<joey> someone's looking at you yes yes why why </joey>
<connor> why do we feel like we can tell like </connor>
<joey> I've had I've had points where I've been </joey>
<connor> like asleep or just like napping or </connor>
<joey> something and I'm like someone's looking </joey>
<garnt> at me I look up and someone is I think </garnt>
<connor> going wait who is that someone okay well </connor>
<garnt> that's okay that's [ __ ] first of all </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's just coincidence </garnt>
<garnt> I think we take a note to like again I </garnt>
<connor> think we saw some previous episodes um </connor>
<connor> we're like again with extremely socially </connor>
<connor> focused animals yeah and so I think </connor>
<connor> that's like an evolutionary trait that's </connor>
<connor> kind of been like malfunctioned a little </connor>
<garnt> bit where we don't I guess we kind of </garnt>
<garnt> still need it but we don't need to be as </garnt>
<joey> socially accepted as we once needed to </joey>
<garnt> yeah so we were very attentive to </garnt>
<joey> anything social for the most part so I </joey>
<joey> think when when people are staring at us </joey>
<joey> we're really apparent of it and we're </joey>
<joey> really bad at even like thinking Scott </joey>
<joey> just staring at me like I feel like God </joey>
<joey> was just staring at me right yeah yeah I </joey>
<joey> feel like you're just looking at my </joey>
<joey> direction I saw in the corner of my </joey>
<joey> mouth </joey>
<connor> overthink it yeah we can kind of sense </connor>
<joey> if like someone is Feeling Again a </joey>
<joey> certain way or like if a situation is </joey>
<connor> uncommon that's my [ __ ] theory that </connor>
<connor> could be totally wrong I'm pretty sure </connor>
<connor> that's where it comes from is that we're </connor>
<connor> very very in tune with being socially </connor>
<joey> yeah I mean like you want to know if you </joey>
<joey> ask any other animal it's like uh so can </joey>
<joey> you tell if that prawn is feeling then </joey>
<joey> they'll be like no I can't give a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> what does that mean why would you why </joey>
<joey> would you need to sense that God dogs </joey>
<joey> are [ __ ] cute though I wonder if a </joey>
<joey> dog knows a dog knows I'm staring at it </joey>
<joey> a dog noise </joey>
<connor> I mean it always knows it always like a </connor>
<connor> dog can always tell like when when when </connor>
<garnt> when you're like giving it some </garnt>
<joey> attention you could be on the other side </joey>
<joey> my dog used to do that when it was just </joey>
<garnt> like kind of just sitting there just </garnt>
<connor> like staring off into Blank Space </connor>
<connor> sometimes I would just you know look at </connor>
<connor> my dog because I'm like you're a good </connor>
<joey> boy you're a pretty boy and then </joey>
<connor> sometimes the dog would just kind of do </connor>
<joey> this like </joey>
<joey> walk over at me like what what do you </joey>
<connor> want every every time you know like I'm </connor>
<connor> I'm torn right in my head and whether I </connor>
<connor> think God exists because I'm like okay </connor>
<connor> God makes stuff that that kills children </connor>
<connor> and I'm like that's pretty [ __ ] out </connor>
<connor> yeah but then we also have videos like </connor>
<connor> dogs cuddling people who are sad and I'm </connor>
<connor> like well how do you explain that you </connor>
<connor> know why the dog evolved to know when </connor>
<connor> we're sad and it helps us that's pretty </connor>
<connor> I feel like somebody must have helped </connor>
<garnt> that out come on yeah we don't we don't </garnt>
<connor> deserve it you know look what we've done </connor>
<garnt> in history do we really deserve that we </garnt>
<connor> don't maybe we should not think of God </connor>
<connor> as this omnipotent meaning that knows </connor>
<connor> everything maybe if there is a God in </connor>
<connor> this world they can make mistakes </connor>
<garnt> um and I'm just saying dog like when </garnt>
<garnt> they created the dog that was like I </garnt>
<garnt> this is the biggest W of my [ __ ] life </garnt>
<connor> this is the only reason why we accept </connor>
<connor> NTR because dogs exist I think we'd all </connor>
<connor> be done I think they would have been </connor>
<joey> that would have been the final straw </joey>
<joey> there needs to be an equal evil to </joey>
<connor> create an equal Doctor Who has bought </connor>
<connor> this omnipotent power so much time yeah </connor>
<joey> frankly you know and I I I and people </joey>
<connor> who are allergic they got done dirty </connor>
<garnt> yeah but they came alive yeah and then </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] like God was listening to </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] Metallica one day and I was like </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] mantis shrimp man I'm gonna make </garnt>
<joey> one of those let's [ __ ] do it there's </joey>
<connor> some whack [ __ ] that has been like </connor>
<connor> evolutionized so you're like that that </connor>
<joey> is interesting </joey>
<joey> the Mantis trip is certainly one of them </joey>
<joey> yeah like this feels like the most over </joey>
<connor> engineered Evolution to a problem right </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> right when you think about it you're </connor>
<connor> like this feels like respect far too </connor>
<garnt> much for no reason it's it's like I look </garnt>
<garnt> at the mantrum though the reason I love </garnt>
<joey> the mantis shrimp is I don't think it's </joey>
<joey> the most optimal way to achieve what you </joey>
<joey> want to achieve which is get food yeah </joey>
<garnt> but I respect the fact that you </garnt>
<garnt> committed so hard to this one solution </garnt>
<joey> yeah like you look at you know an animal </joey>
<connor> like a highly intelligent animal like an </connor>
<connor> octopus right that is like all right you </connor>
<connor> know it can problem solve it can like </connor>
<joey> you know figure out more intelligent </joey>
<joey> ways to catch its prey like camouflage </joey>
<joey> or like tricking its prey meanwhile </joey>
<joey> mantis room is like I punch hard </joey>
<connor> I destroyed I like the fact that for </connor>
<connor> some reason obviously it makes sense </connor>
<connor> evolutionary wise but just owls could </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] turn their head mostly all </connor>
<joey> the way around yeah yeah that feels like </joey>
<joey> the owl was kind of been a little lazy </joey>
<joey> all right I'm not gonna lie I feel like </joey>
<joey> the owl could have maybe just turned </joey>
<joey> around a little bit just </joey>
<connor> all right you know it's like no I'm not </connor>
<joey> moving my body you really need to turn </joey>
<connor> up like if I could turn my head all the </connor>
<connor> way around do I really need that I feel </connor>
<joey> like it I don't know man to be honest if </joey>
<connor> someone asked me hey would you want the </connor>
<connor> ability to very much a shower thought </connor>
<connor> yeah would you want the ability to turn </connor>
<joey> your head almost 360 degrees Yeah I'd be </joey>
<joey> like I don't know when I'd use it but </joey>
<garnt> sure well why not what I want to know is </garnt>
<connor> you know we we talk about like animals </connor>
<connor> and food chain and even if you don't </connor>
<joey> like an animal or something we love </joey>
<connor> talking animals yeah we love animals </connor>
<connor> animals are sick </connor>
<connor> um having said that is there a single </connor>
<connor> redeeming quality of a mosquito or can </connor>
<connor> we remove mosquitoes and </connor>
<connor> I'm sure something will be effective </connor>
<connor> there'll be no adverse effects at all I </connor>
<joey> think I remember seeing like some videos </joey>
<joey> about that of like some like experts </joey>
<joey> argue that we can but with like a little </joey>
<joey> bit of a of a deficit to the food chain </joey>
<joey> and then there are others that say like </joey>
<connor> no it's just completely if we've learned </connor>
<connor> anything we are really [ __ ] bad at </connor>
<connor> getting involved with the [ __ ] and </connor>
<connor> trying to control nature we've been </connor>
<connor> we've historically have a terrible </connor>
<joey> tracker yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> um yeah which is pretty bad in it kind </connor>
<connor> of the sentiment </connor>
<joey> um we shouldn't do it we're just like </joey>
<joey> what if we just make this animal extinct </joey>
<joey> it won't it won't [ __ ] up the food chain </joey>
<joey> right the animal Kingdom's like what are </joey>
<joey> you doing stop </joey>
<joey> I know they're delicious </joey>
<garnt> very precisely and you're [ __ ] it up </garnt>
<joey> I just want to know if there's any </joey>
<joey> anything any animal anything that has </joey>
<joey> something positive to say about </joey>
<joey> mosquitoes well do animals hate </joey>
<joey> mosquitoes problem so I'm sure even </joey>
<joey> spiders like I mean I eat them but I can </joey>
<joey> go without it flies too flies you know I </joey>
<garnt> I can live without mosquitoes you know I </garnt>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<connor> hard to say man is there anything cooler </connor>
<garnt> than a mantis shrimp I don't think so </garnt>
<garnt> I'm I'm a Google is now coolest animals </garnt>
<joey> well there's that there's that video of </joey>
<joey> the guy who was like out fishing in a </joey>
<joey> canoe and he like fit he accidentally </joey>
<garnt> fished up a mantis shrimp and it like it </garnt>
<garnt> quickly like flicked him in the in the </garnt>
<garnt> toe like just like oh yeah he broke it </garnt>
<garnt> and it broke his top yeah I almost saw </garnt>
<garnt> that and he's like he's like and then he </garnt>
<joey> like releases it back in and like his </joey>
<joey> foot is bleeding and then later on he's </joey>
<joey> like I I'm in the hospital because uh my </joey>
<joey> toe is broken I'm like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> it's pretty [ __ ] wild yeah that's </connor>
<joey> wild </joey>
<connor> God I think I think I've evolved to just </connor>
<garnt> drink tea it's just it's just British </garnt>
<connor> isn't it I was on the plane back uh from </connor>
<garnt> my Christmas break and I swear to God it </garnt>
<connor> was embarrassing the amount of tea I </connor>
<connor> drank I just kept asking for more tea </connor>
<connor> and they were like and they came around </connor>
<connor> and they were like T I was like yes </connor>
<connor> bring it I think I drank like 15 Cups of </connor>
<connor> Tea holy [ __ ] isn't that insane why is </connor>
<connor> that because I was just I was thirsting </connor>
<connor> for some hot liquid </connor>
<connor> it's what I like all right honestly ever </connor>
<connor> since moving to Japan I drink far too </connor>
<garnt> much green tea I don't know can you </garnt>
<garnt> drink too much green tea because I'm </garnt>
<connor> definitely drinking it's got caffeine </connor>
<connor> you actually can drink too much tea </connor>
<connor> um there's some like uh there's a few </connor>
<connor> chemicals in it that are pretty bad if </connor>
<connor> you drink it like all the time all day </connor>
<joey> um but like anything that's like that </joey>
<joey> right if you ate just [ __ ] ham yeah </joey>
<joey> sure </joey>
<connor> just lettuce you'd have no nothing else </connor>
<joey> right everything in moderation generally </joey>
<garnt> yeah oh yeah I'm just like how much tea </garnt>
<connor> is like too much tea you know um I'm </connor>
<connor> definitely surpassing it I'm pretty sure </connor>
<connor> um but that's a problem for future me </connor>
<connor> yeah I feel like I'm in the now you know </connor>
<connor> I'm I'm trying to worry about that </connor>
<connor> that's that's that's the video you </connor>
<joey> should make five years from now being </joey>
<connor> like the tea didn't kill you sorry about </connor>
<joey> that you know how it is you should film </joey>
<joey> it while you're sipping a cup of tea </joey>
<garnt> it's like I bet you're mad yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's like that's like a fault in like </garnt>
<garnt> human evolution we are so we are so </garnt>
<connor> inadequate in try with like we can </connor>
<connor> process problems that will happen in our </connor>
<garnt> future but we're so inadequate and </garnt>
<connor> caring about it you know </connor>
<connor> like yep that's why global warming has </connor>
<joey> been yeah right I was just about to say </joey>
<joey> like climate change activism like first </joey>
<garnt> time yeah like hey your body is going to </garnt>
<garnt> deteriorate if you don't exercise and </garnt>
<garnt> keep healthy every day and you know eat </garnt>
<garnt> good and you're like yeah but one more </garnt>
<garnt> hamburger right one more Burger </garnt>
<joey> literally every person who smokes </joey>
<garnt> cigarettes is just like yeah I know but </garnt>
<joey> that's that's future me to decide I'm </joey>
<garnt> I'm enjoying it right that it takes so </garnt>
<garnt> much energy just to like care about it </garnt>
<garnt> and change your life for the better it </garnt>
<garnt> just it just yeah some something's wrong </garnt>
<connor> with the brain the creatures of habits </connor>
<garnt> man when we get in a habit we it's hard </garnt>
<joey> for us to kick lately we didn't put </joey>
<joey> enough points into intelligence </joey>
<joey> we've programmed our brain to work in </joey>
<joey> the best way it can and it's got a lot </joey>
<connor> of flaws yeah yeah right I mean I did </connor>
<connor> program I'm [ __ ] lazy someone else </connor>
<garnt> did that </garnt>
<connor> I don't know it's weird we're pretty </connor>
<garnt> dumb though that's one thing I do you </garnt>
<garnt> think you think you think we are I think </garnt>
<garnt> we're pretty [ __ ] dumb we're all some </garnt>
<garnt> pretty [ __ ] done dumb Apes just </garnt>
<garnt> floating through a rock through space </garnt>
<connor> Apes have a good they stopped at the </connor>
<connor> right time Evolution wise I think </connor>
<connor> they're they're chilling oh I have a </connor>
<connor> great time </connor>
<connor> well they get to have all the you know </connor>
<connor> that orangutang or to drive that golf </connor>
<connor> cart in that one video and he didn't </connor>
<connor> have to get a license </connor>
<connor> you know you didn't have to go to the </connor>
<connor> DMV I think he got the best part of </connor>
<connor> evolution which is like sit back relax </connor>
<connor> eat bananas chill out they can get to </connor>
<connor> drive a golf cart dude I'm just jealous </connor>
<joey> they get to flick their turds without </joey>
<connor> any repercussions man like I wish that's </connor>
<garnt> my doctor we should have stopped at dogs </garnt>
<joey> dogs I'm just I I don't think we evolved </joey>
<joey> we don't we didn't evolve from it </joey>
<connor> doesn't matter evolutionary world of </connor>
<joey> dogs </joey>
<garnt> at dogs man the Council of dogs is this </garnt>
<garnt> nothing more pure than just a dog I </garnt>
<connor> think a dog </connor>
<connor> if the world was only dogs would dogs be </connor>
<connor> friendly to each other I don't think </connor>
<connor> they would </connor>
<joey> yeah maybe the reason why dogs ended up </joey>
<joey> evolving is wholesome and awesome as </joey>
<connor> they did is because of the filthy human </connor>
<connor> dogs just agree we tampered and it </connor>
<connor> worked for once </connor>
<connor> that was when it was we did a massive W </connor>
<garnt> for once what about cats </garnt>
<connor> they do they they already own the world </connor>
<joey> let's pull the strings from those </joey>
<connor> Shadows </connor>
<joey> can't live in their world yeah what do </joey>
<joey> you mean it's since the beginning of the </joey>
<connor> Egyptian age we've worshiped [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> cats yeah I wonder what it is about cats </joey>
<connor> that we just we can't help but just </connor>
<joey> gravitate towards since ancient times </joey>
<joey> Humanity has not changed they're cute </joey>
<joey> cats could be like the biggest [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] in the world and humans are </joey>
<garnt> like I [ __ ] love you and I would die </garnt>
<garnt> for you and they are completely right </garnt>
<joey> cats cats are literally the same humans </joey>
<connor> do that to other humans you're a giant </connor>
<connor> piece of [ __ ] but I love you like cats </connor>
<connor> are basically the cigarettes of the </connor>
<connor> animal wall they're just like I know </connor>
<joey> this thing is absolutely horrible but </joey>
<connor> God damn I can't stop I can't stop I I </connor>
<connor> uh I was at Ludwig's house I got to </connor>
<connor> stroke uh Coots and that was a very cute </connor>
<joey> kiss </joey>
<joey> I thought that sentence </joey>
<connor> I did get to do that too I was lying </connor>
<connor> down and then Coots would just jump on </connor>
<connor> me and he would just want you know a </connor>
<connor> good cuddling I thought all right yeah </connor>
<joey> okay I'll allow it I've allowed you to </joey>
<connor> exist we uh we have this uh we have this </connor>

<garnt> being that's that's she's evil man she </garnt>
<joey> she's a manipulative evil [ __ ] being </joey>
<joey> I believe it and you know what but I </joey>
<joey> love her </joey>
<joey> I'm this close to [ __ ] abducting her </joey>
<joey> from our neighbors man who needs to she </joey>
<joey> was coming to you yes yeah exactly she </joey>
<joey> is when when she knows when when uh </joey>
<joey> when we haven't been uh when we've come </joey>
<joey> back from like a long trip from like </joey>
<joey> Japan or something like that the first </joey>
<joey> day every first day she's always like so </joey>
<joey> loving so everything we feel loved we </joey>
<joey> feel like we're back over then every </joey>
<joey> other day after that she just goes back </joey>
<joey> to normal all right you've had your time </joey>
<joey> now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna sit </joey>
<joey> here and just judge you I don't want to </joey>
<garnt> give you too much sir yeah yeah no no </garnt>
<garnt> more serotonin for you sir </garnt>
<joey> oh man what was your cat like when you </joey>
<joey> grew up because you yeah I had a few </joey>
<joey> cats </joey>
<joey> um a few yeah wow yeah we had well when </joey>
<connor> I was born we had two </connor>
<connor> um but like my my parents had three the </connor>
<connor> whole time uh Pocky and little guy </connor>
<connor> um it was it was weird because it's like </connor>
<connor> when you have two cats living in the </connor>
<connor> same house it you really see the </connor>
<connor> personality differences right right </connor>
<connor> because like when you just see a cat by </connor>
<connor> itself it's like okay you know you can </connor>
<connor> discern maybe some like personality </connor>
<connor> traits of the cat right the different </connor>
<connor> cats that you know but like when it's </connor>
<connor> two cats next to each other it really is </connor>
<connor> like night and day yeah uh so like I </connor>
<connor> think like I mean I don't remember a </connor>
<connor> whole lot because I was really young but </connor>
<connor> like I remember like little guy was </connor>
<connor> definitely the [ __ ] in the family </connor>
<connor> um he would he would do this thing where </connor>
<connor> like I don't know if you had like memory </connor>
<joey> problems or whatever but like we would </joey>
<joey> feed him right and then literally 30 </joey>
<connor> minutes later he'd come back and be like </connor>
<joey> where the [ __ ] my food </joey>
<connor> I do that meowing at my dad yeah and my </connor>
<joey> dad's like [ __ ] I've just fed you leave </joey>
<joey> me the [ __ ] alone and he just be like no </joey>
<connor> I'm still hungry give me my [ __ ] food </connor>
<connor> meanwhile Pokey is like out on The </connor>
<connor> Veranda just being like </connor>
<joey> thank you for the meal father that was </joey>
<connor> absolutely delicious I'm going to saw </connor>
<joey> some of this stuff bro let me uh you can </joey>
<joey> pet me now you can come and pay me I'm </joey>
<joey> full I'm satisfied come here though me </joey>
<joey> all little guys just being like I'm </joey>
<joey> still hungry give me my food where is it </joey>
<joey> and it's just I don't know like I I </joey>
<joey> loved both cats equally for like </joey>
<joey> different things but it's just like it </joey>
<joey> really does just show like how these </joey>
<joey> animals just have like really just </joey>
<joey> distinct personalities and it's like and </joey>
<joey> it's dope you know like you know like </joey>
<connor> even like when we had we used to have </connor>
<connor> like a lot of birds as well right like </connor>
<connor> my parents currently owned like a </connor>
<connor> cockatiel right now and like compared to </connor>
<connor> the last cockatiel we had this one is a </connor>
<connor> million times more of an [ __ ] but </connor>
<joey> it's like but it's forgivable because </joey>
<joey> it's cute and the couple of times that </joey>
<joey> it falls asleep in your hand it's like </joey>
<joey> you know what all the bite marks you </joey>
<connor> gave me over the years </connor>
<connor> I think I've always wondered about birds </connor>
<connor> why don't they just fly away </connor>
<connor> what do you mean like what stopping them </connor>
<joey> just flying away oh I mean our last </joey>
<connor> cockatiel floor yeah right yeah is there </connor>
<connor> a point where the bird goes hold on a </connor>
<connor> second you just fly and never come back </connor>
<joey> or actually our first our first </joey>
<joey> cockatiel uh z uh he actually flew away </joey>
<joey> but then he flew into because you know </joey>
<connor> we live next to the National Park yeah </connor>
<connor> he flew out but then got confused to be </connor>
<connor> like holy [ __ ] where am I because we </connor>
<connor> could actually see him circling around </connor>
<connor> like trying to find us and then what he </connor>
<connor> ended up doing was he just nosedived </connor>
<connor> into the the the the the forest and so </connor>
<connor> my dad and I went out to actually go and </connor>
<connor> find him uh you know hoping that he </connor>
<joey> didn't fly off somewhere yeah and after </joey>
<connor> like a 20 minute search we we heard him </connor>
<joey> we could hear him chirping and I looked </joey>
<connor> up at this tree and he's just like </connor>
<joey> perched on top just like looking down </joey>
<joey> being like [ __ ] help me where </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] where am I the [ __ ] have you </connor>
<connor> been if I saw the bird guy I'd be like </connor>
<joey> yeah we're not getting that yeah so the </joey>
<joey> original plan right was like my dad I </joey>
<joey> took off his jacket and was just like </joey>
<joey> all right call him down like to know </joey>
<joey> that we're here and then the moment he </joey>
<joey> like lands anywhere I'm gonna put the </joey>
<joey> jacket on top and like wrap him up so he </joey>
<joey> doesn't like freak out and fly away </joey>
<joey> somewhere right so that was the original </joey>
<connor> Appliance of like we're calling him down </connor>
<connor> he's like looking down being like is it </connor>
<connor> safe is it safe and he he flies down he </connor>
<connor> lands on the shoulder but and as soon as </connor>
<connor> my dad was about to put the jacket on </connor>
<connor> him I was like no I don't think we </connor>
<joey> should because this [ __ ] was </joey>
<connor> gripping onto my shoulders like no </connor>
<connor> tomorrow it was like it was hurting it's </connor>
<connor> just like I am not leaving your shoulder </connor>
<connor> so what ended up happening was it was </connor>
<connor> like a 20 minute walk back to the house </connor>
<connor> yeah he just [ __ ] stayed there oh </connor>
<joey> that's cool he just didn't move he was </joey>
<joey> just like take me home right now please </joey>
<connor> so like what what the normal like why do </connor>
<connor> birds not fly away sometimes like why do </connor>
<connor> they just um do they ever come back if </connor>
<connor> they like well I think it depends on </connor>
<connor> like how the bird was raised so like if </connor>
<connor> it was raised in captivity its entire </connor>
<connor> life then it doesn't know the concept of </connor>
<connor> flying away uh okay right but if if it's </connor>
<joey> say from like you know you take it from </joey>
<joey> like the wild then obviously they're </joey>
<joey> going to be more prone to be like why am </joey>
<connor> I in this [ __ ] rooms like just fly </connor>
<joey> away like it's like a dad too and then </joey>
<joey> just come back like a thing for like </joey>
<joey> some birds I have no idea how how it is </joey>
<joey> to own a bird as a pet I think I think </joey>
<connor> think for some birds yeah I mean it </connor>
<connor> depends obviously on how long you've </connor>
<connor> like kept oh it's like dogs as well </connor>
<connor> right like some dogs run away but then </connor>
<connor> there are accounts of a couple of days </connor>
<connor> later the dog just shows up in your </connor>
<connor> front porch yeah this is like what I </connor>
<connor> miss you yeah and what did I miss Karen </connor>
<connor> do this time whereas like some dogs just </connor>
<connor> run away and you never see them again </connor>
<joey> right so I think it just depends on like </joey>
<connor> the attachment factor of the animal yeah </connor>
<connor> I guess dads do that too </connor>
<joey> so I guess you know it's not that's how </joey>
<connor> you need to do the birds of dogs yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> you need an AI to stop that yeah I'm </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> I know all living creatures do that my </joey>
<joey> dad </joey>
<joey> yeah so it was like it was really </joey>
<joey> fascinating that like you know that like </joey>
<joey> even with because you know I never had </joey>
<joey> that concept of like birds having that </joey>
<joey> idea right because I was kind of the </joey>
<joey> same as you when I first started owning </joey>
<joey> a bird of like oh we have to be careful </joey>
<connor> where every time because they might just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] fly away just like Scout every </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like crevice </connor>
<joey> but then you know there are some places </joey>
<joey> where like uh you know you could like </joey>
<connor> interact with like an owl or like an </connor>
<connor> eagle or like a bigger Bird yeah and </connor>
<connor> they're not attached to anything but </connor>
<connor> they're just like chilling out and </connor>
<connor> they're just like they could fly away at </connor>
<garnt> any time but they're just like nope you </garnt>
<joey> know what um I like it here I think I'm </joey>
<garnt> gonna stay here yeah yeah so it's </garnt>
<garnt> interesting I've I've never I've never </garnt>
<connor> owned a bird before uh but I have seen </connor>
<connor> one grow up before this is this is just </connor>
<connor> a really weird story uh that this talk </connor>
<connor> has just reminded me of so when I was </connor>
<connor> living in Thailand uh my house in </connor>
<joey> Thailand is like over </joey>
<joey> is uh over like a pond and I kind of </joey>
<joey> think uh we have we have a pawn next to </joey>
<joey> our </joey>
<joey> Big Spender </joey>
<connor> I mean it's perfect </connor>
<connor> it's Thailand okay we know we live we </connor>
<connor> live on like the outskirts of Bangkok so </connor>
<joey> it's like a bit more in nature </joey>
<joey> um and near like uh near the rooftop and </joey>
<connor> everything like that or just on the </connor>
<joey> balcony Birds would like like to make </joey>
<joey> nests and everything like that uh and so </joey>
<joey> in my office uh in Thailand I sit right </joey>
<joey> next to a window that has a really </joey>
<joey> really good view of the places uh of the </joey>
<connor> place where Birds would love to make </connor>
<joey> their nests and everything like that and </joey>
<joey> so one bird made a nest that was kind of </joey>
<joey> like right right next to my window uh </joey>
<joey> almost next to my window right </joey>
<connor> um so I I saw basically that a bird had </connor>
<connor> made a nest and like I saw that you know </connor>
<connor> she had laid some eggs and some beef and </connor>
<connor> some mice uh birds like some baby birds </connor>
<connor> have had had hatched and every day I </connor>
<connor> would come down and I would see the mum </connor>
<connor> feeding them and slowly and slowly I </connor>
<connor> would see them like you know grow up and </connor>
<connor> I will never forget this point because I </connor>
<connor> I would I would see them every single </connor>
<connor> day I saw these little chicks grow up </connor>
<connor> and everything like that </connor>
<connor> um and there's a day where I saw their </connor>
<connor> first flight all right well I saw that </connor>
<connor> first flight and it was it was </connor>
<connor> interesting for me because I've never </connor>
<connor> seen how birds just learned to fly yeah </connor>
<connor> right uh initially I just thought okay </connor>
<connor> Instinct they just know how to fly </connor>
<connor> um nope they uh that that doesn't happen </connor>
<connor> actually yeah and well at least that's </connor>
<connor> not what I saw </connor>
<connor> um so actually the mother helps to teach </connor>
<connor> them how to fly right so what happens is </connor>
<connor> uh he's here's me like I'm sitting I'm </connor>
<connor> sitting on my window there's the nesters </connor>
<connor> over there and what happens is the </connor>
<connor> mother flies to like the little it flies </connor>
<connor> my window and it like chirps at the </connor>
<connor> Chiclets it's like come on come here </connor>
<connor> yeah I'm gonna teach you how to fly come </connor>
<connor> on come on come on you can do it you can </connor>
<connor> do it </connor>
<connor> um and initially uh and initially the </connor>
<connor> chick's like all right I can do this </connor>
<connor> immediately does it right </connor>
<connor> and then but then I think something just </connor>
<connor> clicked and in his brain to be like oh </connor>
<connor> that was scary actually that was I was </connor>
<connor> in the air and mind you between my </connor>
<joey> window and where the nest was was just </joey>
<joey> pawned it was just water right so if </joey>
<joey> they fall they're [ __ ] drowning yeah </joey>
<joey> right and so the mother flies back to </joey>
<connor> the nest </connor>
<garnt> and and she she continues chirping for </garnt>
<garnt> the chicklet to fly back to the nest </garnt>
<joey> doesn't do it </joey>
<garnt> one minute I'm not doing that one minute </garnt>
<joey> passes doesn't do it Mom flies back </joey>
<joey> flies through the nest again </joey>
<joey> chirps again </joey>
<joey> three minute passes doesn't do it the </joey>
<garnt> chicklet looks at his mum and </garnt>
<garnt> and then after the mum chirped really </garnt>
<garnt> loudly this one time chicklet just </garnt>
<garnt> stands on the edge looks at his looks at </garnt>
<garnt> his mum </garnt>
<garnt> shits himself </garnt>
<joey> I'm not joking get it confident I'm not </joey>
<garnt> joking I'm looking at this bird his </garnt>
<garnt> mum's like chirping he shoots himself </garnt>
<garnt> and then he takes off and it's a low </garnt>
<connor> takeoff and at this point I'm I'm </connor>
<connor> invested in this book because I'm </connor>
<connor> thinking to myself if this bird falls in </connor>
<connor> yeah I'm running out of my office and </connor>
<joey> I'm diving into this Pawn to save this </joey>
<connor> bird yeah I see this bird growing up </connor>
<joey> this bird ain't dying on his first </joey>
<joey> flight and what happens is he takes off </joey>
<joey> but he's too low he's like flapping his </joey>
<connor> wings yeah and he </connor>
<connor> what happens is the nest is purged up </connor>
<connor> there he hits uh he hits the little </connor>
<connor> balcony before the nest yeah he like </connor>
<connor> panicly like like tries to grab on tries </connor>
<joey> to grab on flaps his wing I was like </joey>
<joey> halfway through running out but luckily </joey>
<garnt> he just got enough elevation to get his </garnt>
<joey> foot on the nest and I was like oh my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] God I'm so [ __ ] proud of you </joey>
<connor> man that's it </connor>
<joey> I'm so proud of him that's cute that's a </joey>
