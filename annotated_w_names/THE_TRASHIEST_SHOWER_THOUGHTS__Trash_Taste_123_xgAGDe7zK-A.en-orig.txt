<connor> and you slang no this isn't an actual </connor>
<joey> word this is like is this like shouty </joey>

<connor> haughty means </connor>
<connor> yes I love this world so dieters </connor>
<connor> he's literally the opposite of haughty </connor>
<joey> it's like kind of pretentious sounding </joey>
<joey> it's like oh God what does aloof mean </joey>
<garnt> yeah I was gonna ask yeah I was stuck up </garnt>
<joey> it's a pretentious Oh I thought a Loof </joey>
<connor> was like like not thinking about </connor>
<connor> anything like this is the best thing </connor>
<connor> about English there's an exact way of </connor>
<connor> describing the exact way of an [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> someone is there's like any shade of </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] the English language has a way </connor>
<connor> of being able to describe the perfect </connor>
<joey> level of like snobbery or dickishness of </joey>
<joey> someone what's what's the two words on </joey>
<connor> the two ends of the spectrum I don't </connor>
<connor> know it's just every kind of word you </connor>
<connor> want to it's like we have like 10 20 </connor>
<connor> different ways of describing that </connor>
<joey> someone is a posh [ __ ] right it go it </joey>
<joey> goes from the Spectrum for me is </joey>
<joey> anywhere between oh he's a little rude </joey>
<joey> to oh he's a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that's the Australian one that's the </joey>
<connor> Australian Spectrum so it's always a </connor>
<joey> little bruising like that the reason </joey>
<connor> why I found this out is because I </connor>
<connor> um I got an audition yeah I guess I </connor>
<connor> guess we have no don't start with me </connor>
<garnt> seeing the Sea World Cup </garnt>
<connor> just put that blur that move down the </connor>
<connor> reason why I bring this out yeah and to </connor>
<connor> start the episode with this because I </connor>
<joey> didn't audition not too long ago </joey>
<connor> um it's the first time ever happened to </connor>
<joey> me actually is that uh that you became </joey>
<joey> pretentious no no I've always been there </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<connor> sure so </connor>
<connor> um I I was they sent me this agency a </connor>
<connor> production whatever sent me a audition </connor>
<connor> sheet yeah I get this a lot and it's </connor>
<connor> it's whatever they like hey can you </connor>
<connor> register for a thing and this one looked </connor>
<connor> really good so they were like hey we </connor>
<connor> want you to read for this character and </connor>
<connor> I open it up and I had this thing that </connor>
<connor> happened that it's funny enough because </connor>
<connor> when we met with uh Jay Michael Tatum in </connor>
<connor> LA and Brandon yeah Michael was telling </connor>
<connor> us about a time where he had to read and </connor>
<connor> the reference was himself yeah they </connor>
<connor> wanted to sound like him yeah I thought </connor>
<connor> that's so [ __ ] cool that's never </connor>
<connor> gonna happen to me anything happened to </connor>
<connor> me and I was the reference </connor>
<connor> did they ask did you get the part so </connor>
<connor> hold on so but the thing was is that I </connor>
<connor> didn't never seen this word and they </connor>
<connor> were like sound like Sea Dog this this </connor>
<connor> clip it was me yeah I'm like cool cool </connor>
<connor> and that said it sound like this but </connor>
<connor> less haughty and I was like what does </connor>
<joey> that mean so so what's so what is the so </joey>
<connor> what is the definition of haughty you </connor>
<connor> know yeah is it h-a-u-t-y or is it </connor>
<joey> h-a-w-t-y uh </joey>
<joey> I thought it was like h-a-w-t-y okay </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] English right English language </connor>
<connor> I'll play the pronunciation for you yes </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> so it means arrogantly Superior or </connor>
<connor> disdainful which honestly honestly </connor>
<joey> that's uh very very accurate are you </joey>
<joey> gonna add that to your Twitter bio yeah </joey>
<connor> haughty haughty YouTubers </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> he's Mr haughty I'm waiting for the next </garnt>
<garnt> wacky weekend so yeah next to horty </garnt>
<connor> Connor right here I had this exact same </connor>
<garnt> thing as you guys where I I you know I </garnt>
<connor> opened up the clip and I recognize what </connor>
<connor> it's from yeah but I don't say too much </connor>
<connor> because I I didn't sign an idea anything </connor>
<connor> but I was trying to you know good </connor>
<connor> practice </connor>
<connor> um yeah uh is it this but hot but less </connor>
<connor> haughty and I thought what the [ __ ] does </connor>
<connor> haughty mean so I Google it and I'm like </connor>
<joey> am I am I to be offended or </joey>
<joey> no I think they described you in the </joey>
<joey> perfect world </joey>
<joey> at least they at least at least they </joey>
<garnt> kind of you know so served it up nicely </garnt>
<garnt> in a box so basically they said sound </garnt>
<garnt> like Sea Dog VA but take but take the </garnt>
<garnt> corner out of it yeah </garnt>
<joey> just be less haughty you don't get a </joey>
<connor> voice like this and not sound like that </connor>
<joey> that's what happens like you don't like </joey>
<garnt> I'm sorry so I I you got the whole </garnt>
<garnt> personality behind it right at least you </garnt>
<joey> know at least you got to give them </joey>
<joey> credit that they at least you know open </joey>
<connor> up a thesaurus for this they weren't </connor>
<joey> direct about it they weren't like oh </joey>
<connor> yeah it would sound like this but less </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] pretentious and arrogant you </joey>
<connor> know like I don't know what I mean about </connor>
<connor> it that would be the most intricate way </connor>
<connor> of insulting me start your own like uh </connor>
<connor> project cast a thing and then send out </connor>
<connor> auditions to everyone you [ __ ] hate </connor>
<connor> and then just link them as the reference </connor>
<connor> you sound like Joe but less of a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> they were really nice I auditioned for </connor>
<connor> the thing and I did I guess what you got </connor>
<connor> the park </connor>
<joey> wait wait wait wait they wanted me to </joey>
<connor> sound like Sea Dog VA you must be less </connor>
<garnt> haughty but less less 40 and uh can you </garnt>
<joey> just like change your voice to that yeah </joey>
<joey> can you can you do it can you do it </joey>
<joey> right now </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna I'm gonna hear your voice in </joey>
<joey> this thing that you're just for and I'd </joey>
<joey> be like we could have had that I'm like </joey>
<garnt> where's that called where's that guy I </garnt>
<connor> want that guy oh my God this sounds like </connor>
<connor> an amazing corner I would say it's it's </connor>
<joey> it's the voice that I would do uh if I </joey>
<joey> was an [ __ ] but 20 nicer 20 night </joey>
<connor> twenty percent nice there's still that </connor>
<connor> level of like snobberiness yeah </connor>
<connor> uh that's so definitely that's the last </connor>
<joey> 40 I suppose yeah so I did get the role </joey>
<connor> I've read for for the part I I've done </connor>
<connor> all my recording for it's a lot of fun </connor>
<connor> um so hopefully that'll come soon I'll </connor>
<garnt> tell you guys when it is so you've got </garnt>
<connor> to play yourself but nicer more I guess </connor>
<connor> I wonder because I I got a few things </connor>
<joey> that are coming out in the future I </joey>
<connor> wonder if people will be able to figure </connor>
<joey> out which one it is which one is the </joey>
<joey> nicest I mean when I when I had to voice </joey>
<connor> my own character in no straight roads I </connor>
<joey> think I had the opposite I was like play </joey>
<joey> as yourself but more haughty is that </joey>
<joey> possible for you yeah </joey>
<joey> I've literally called musical.ly just </joey>
<joey> like you can't get anything I'm in real </joey>
<garnt> life </garnt>
<garnt> I mean Joey in real life I'm a music </garnt>
<garnt> hipster I would like to comment on your </garnt>
<joey> new lovely glasses that you seem to have </joey>
<joey> procured thank you </joey>
<joey> I was going to say are you going through </joey>
<garnt> your uh like art director phase like </garnt>
<joey> what's the glasses also with glasses Joy </joey>
<joey> I don't know I just now that now that </joey>
<joey> I'm uh an owner of a brand I figured I </joey>
<joey> should probably start looking the part </joey>
<joey> just to have just funny LinkedIn </joey>
<joey> conversations people oh yeah we've seen </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] they they do on LinkedIn you </joey>
<connor> see that one more clip where the guy </connor>
<connor> fired like a thousand people on zoom and </connor>
<garnt> then yeah I saw that one oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> like crying like he gave a [ __ ] yeah and </connor>
<garnt> it was like a one-way Zoom call as well </garnt>
<connor> nobody could take part like it wasn't </connor>
<garnt> even a zoom call it was a live stream </garnt>
<connor> yeah we've done it on Twitch you know </connor>
<connor> what I mean the man literally pulled up </connor>
<connor> that that you know that that the meme </connor>
<connor> video everyone uses in in meme edits of </connor>
<connor> the guy crying yeah yeah that one he's </connor>
<connor> like the guy watched that video before </connor>
<connor> we went in and try to emulate that it </connor>
<garnt> was so bad wait was this the one where </garnt>
<garnt> he phoned up half of like he opened up </garnt>
<connor> with a speech about how he has to let go </connor>
<connor> of half the company yeah I was [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hot that was so [ __ ] was that </connor>
<connor> something was that a different live </connor>
<connor> stream or was uh </connor>
<connor> yeah there's there's so many there's </connor>
<connor> been way too many Zoom firing for me to </connor>
<connor> keep up with nowadays holy [ __ ] I think </connor>
<connor> the one I'm thinking of was there was a </connor>
<garnt> clip </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> and uh yeah and he said he's taking time </connor>
<connor> off because apparently it got to him oh </connor>
<joey> oh he's got to him this is after the </joey>
<joey> whole controversy happened right with </joey>
<garnt> like the company or whatever no no no no </garnt>
<connor> no oh this before that no this is way </connor>
<garnt> after but I was doing pretty good now oh </garnt>
<garnt> really he should consider signing up to </garnt>
<connor> better help that's what the meme was so </connor>
<connor> I wonder if he gave free subscriptions </connor>
<connor> to his uh himself I should find 900 </connor>
<connor> people and be like guys I need time for </connor>
<joey> myself yeah it's like what you know </joey>
<joey> because like I always thought you know I </joey>
<joey> think and I think everyone can relate </joey>
<joey> but like when you hear the title CEO </joey>
<garnt> you're just like oh oh that sounds </garnt>
<garnt> really fancy but then when you actually </garnt>
<garnt> become a CEO you're just like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> like that title I mean I thought every </garnt>
<garnt> CEO says you're fitting into your Roblox </garnt>
<garnt> guys I'm not like other CEOs no but </garnt>
<joey> that's exactly what happened when I </joey>
<joey> became a CEO I was like I kind of had </joey>
<joey> hate this word now I don't like it guys </joey>
<garnt> I don't want to be I don't want to be </garnt>
<joey> someone of you guys okay I'm one of you </joey>
<connor> guys it just sounds gross all of a </connor>
<garnt> sudden </garnt>
<joey> meanwhile puts on the glasses and by the </joey>

<garnt> glasses though fake glasses yeah I've </garnt>
<garnt> worn them sometimes yeah </garnt>
<connor> Harry Potter </connor>
<garnt> so this is a fashion statement of course </garnt>
<joey> it's for making a fascist statement my </joey>
<joey> my eye says 2020. excuse me it's </joey>
<garnt> literally a fashion statement my </garnt>
<joey> eyesight is not your fashion Joey </joey>
<joey> I'm preparing myself for when my </joey>
<garnt> eyesight I wasn't born with short </garnt>
<joey> sightedness just so you can wear it I I </joey>
<connor> have some fake glasses at home that I've </connor>
<connor> won many times yeah that's good on you </connor>
<garnt> bad bad eyesight isn't just something </garnt>
<garnt> that you can take on and off Joey you </garnt>
<connor> have to live with it okay I can't </connor>
<connor> believe you do me like this Joey </connor>
<connor> you can't see anyways </connor>
<garnt> no I've just I've just gotten used to </garnt>
<garnt> wearing like a lifestyle of contactless </garnt>
<joey> because I'm I'm preparing myself because </joey>
<garnt> I know for a fact when my eyesight turns </garnt>
<garnt> to [ __ ] at old age I'll be too much of a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] to try and put contacts yeah </joey>
<garnt> because I can't my eyes are too </garnt>
<garnt> sensitive I can't do it do you know do </garnt>
<joey> you know one weird life hack I found I </joey>
<joey> find out like be rich </joey>
<joey> aside from Bee Ridge Lasik so I saw the </joey>
<joey> scene in an anime where when one </joey>
<joey> character has like short-sightedness and </joey>
<joey> like if you make like oh [ __ ] they fixed </joey>
<joey> it with the pinhole thing right and I'm </joey>
<joey> like what [ __ ] [ __ ] is this and I </joey>
<joey> actually memeed it in one of my videos </joey>
<joey> yeah and then then the comments are just </joey>
<joey> like no it actually works it actually </joey>
<joey> works trust me trust me and I'm like </joey>
<garnt> okay what is it so what what you do </garnt>
<garnt> right is you just make a pinhole with uh </garnt>
<garnt> you make a pinhole basically a pinhole </garnt>
<garnt> with like your hand or something and you </garnt>
<garnt> look through it and then you're meant to </garnt>
<garnt> be able to focus even if you have like </garnt>
<garnt> short-sightedness I was like this is </garnt>
<garnt> absolute [ __ ] and then I tried it </garnt>
<connor> and then it worked I was like what Oh I </connor>
<connor> thought you brought that up and it was </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] no I I want I thought it was I </garnt>
<garnt> thought it was [ __ ] so what you're </garnt>
<garnt> suggesting is that people have bad </garnt>
<joey> eyesight should wear glasses where the </joey>
<joey> glasses like this big </joey>
<joey> tiny ones </joey>
<joey> the H uh 30 H3 the what's that band </joey>
<connor> called uh 303 or three they should wear </connor>
<joey> those glasses </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the [ __ ] science is </joey>
<joey> it's like insane but I'm like why like </joey>
<joey> something about my eyes is broken if all </joey>
<joey> I need to do is do this and granted I </joey>
<joey> can only read like because how I tested </joey>
<joey> it out was I was like normally I cannot </joey>
<joey> read subtitles at all if I'm watching on </joey>
<joey> TV that's absolutely impossible for me </joey>
<joey> but like do this look at it through a </joey>
<joey> pinhole and suddenly I can see like one </joey>
<joey> word at a time I can only see one word </joey>
<garnt> at a time but for some reason it works I </garnt>
<joey> I have no idea I have no idea what it's </joey>
<joey> basically the thing you know in school </joey>
<joey> when you were learning how to read and </joey>
<joey> you use the rule yeah </joey>
<connor> it's just that but now it's like one </connor>
<garnt> word it's just one word at a time yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> I have no idea why this life hack Works </garnt>
<connor> found out about it somehow it's not </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] science explains science please </joey>
<connor> it's like wait yeah which anime did you </connor>
<garnt> see it in uh it was like an isakai </garnt>
<connor> Pharmacy I mean of course of course it </connor>
<connor> was it was the east side pharmacy anime </connor>
<garnt> I wasn't mentioning Dr Stone as well </garnt>
<garnt> okay yeah I don't know I don't know why </garnt>
<garnt> that works like body stupid or something </garnt>
<joey> like that </joey>
<joey> brain dumb yeah wait so how bad is your </joey>
<garnt> eyesight my eyesight's pretty bad it's </garnt>
<joey> not like awful awful bad but when did it </joey>
<connor> start getting bad </connor>
<garnt> I don't think you told the story I I </garnt>
<connor> don't know if I've told the story uh </connor>
<connor> maybe I have but I've I've started </connor>
<connor> getting bad when I was like a teenager </connor>
<connor> not a teenager like a kid oh [ __ ] like a </connor>
<connor> kid so like right when I was like </connor>
<connor> Primary School yeah Primary School </connor>
<connor> um and I'm gonna call out my mum for a </connor>
<connor> second here because she's gonna stick </connor>
<connor> this too yeah she's gonna see this but </connor>
<connor> she can confirm that this happened </connor>
<connor> because back in the day </connor>
<connor> um I was like sitting really close to </connor>
<connor> the TV and my mum was just like don't </connor>
<connor> sit close to the TV your eyesight is </connor>
<connor> going to get worse </connor>
<connor> and so I was like I was like but mum I </connor>
<connor> can't really see the TV right now she's </connor>
<joey> just like it's because you're playing </joey>
<connor> too many video games yeah just just try </connor>
<joey> harder just look harder okay but just </joey>
<joey> keep your eyesight just keep your </joey>
<joey> eyesight and check okay and then I do </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> basically it was like the most Asian </joey>
<joey> like it was like the most Asian advice </joey>
<garnt> you could ever think of it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> just just look harder </garnt>
<garnt> she was like son just uh just get good </garnt>
<garnt> just get a good eyesight and it was only </garnt>
<garnt> like until like I was like it was like </garnt>
<garnt> three years down the line when we just </garnt>
<garnt> had this [ __ ] realization of oh maybe </garnt>
<joey> I'm just short-sighted so wait was it </joey>
<joey> because I've always been interested so </joey>
<joey> was it like when you when your eyesight </joey>
<joey> goes bad when you're a child right yeah </joey>
<joey> is it like a gradual thing over like </joey>
<joey> many years to the point where Suddenly </joey>
<joey> It's like the the change is so slow that </joey>
<joey> you don't notice the change happening </joey>
<joey> until it's too late or is it literally </joey>
<joey> like you wake up one more and you're </joey>
<garnt> like I can't [ __ ] see </garnt>
<garnt> um honestly I my eyesight was bad to the </garnt>
<connor> point where look it's it's always been </connor>
<connor> bad to the point where I don't remember </connor>
<connor> ever having good eyesight I don't think </connor>
<connor> I've ever had a perfect eyesight I've </connor>
<connor> just like my some of my earliest </connor>
<connor> memories are having something on TV and </connor>
<connor> just me going ah I need to sit this I </connor>
<connor> need to sit like this close to the TV in </connor>
<connor> order to see the TV like I've never I've </connor>
<connor> never sat on the couch and be like okay </connor>
<connor> I can see the TV TV I've always had to </connor>
<connor> sound like near the TV </connor>
<joey> um obviously that was you know what made </joey>
<joey> my back my eyes like that </joey>
<joey> in the first place uh according to Asian </joey>
<joey> parents but uh no like I've I've always </joey>
<joey> had bad eyesight and it was only when I </joey>
<joey> was like seven ish that I did I got my </joey>
<joey> first glasses and I remember the first </joey>
<joey> time putting on glasses and I was like </joey>
<garnt> holy [ __ ] this is a life hack </garnt>
<joey> what is this people's people's is </joey>
<joey> normally yeah what well I think I saw </joey>
<joey> that it was a long time ago there was </joey>
<connor> this like our artist this digital artist </connor>
<connor> that like Drew watercolor paintings of </connor>
<connor> what it would what the world looks like </connor>
<connor> to people who have bad eyesight and I </connor>
<connor> and like what looking at that painting </connor>
<connor> as someone with normal eyesight I was </connor>
<joey> just like this is giving me a headache </joey>
<connor> yeah I'm like I'm like damn y'all live </connor>
<connor> like this </connor>
<joey> it's like holy [ __ ] so that's I think </joey>
<joey> it's after that that I saw that that </joey>
<joey> made me go like okay I need to like </joey>
<joey> really take care of my eyesight so like </joey>
<joey> now whenever I'm like sitting in front </joey>
<joey> of a computer or a TV or whatever or if </joey>
<joey> even if I'm like staring at my phone for </joey>
<joey> a long time I always wear my blue light </joey>
<joey> glasses because I've always had really </joey>
<joey> really sensitive eyes I don't know why </joey>
<joey> because like can you guys open your eyes </joey>
<connor> in a pool yes I can't do it because like </connor>
<connor> the moment I open my eyes I can </connor>
<connor> physically feel my eyes burning oh yeah </connor>
<connor> no I can yeah everyone's does yeah </connor>
<joey> but mine Burns </joey>

<joey> friend who has a pool in their house </joey>

<joey> pool and then you know there's that </joey>
<joey> moment usually in like early like middle </joey>

<connor> I'm not a child anymore I'll just I'll </connor>
<connor> just jump in like the adults do and just </connor>
<connor> open my eyes underwater so there was </connor>
<connor> there was that you know that happened I </connor>
<connor> was just like yeah yeah I'm I'm also an </connor>
<connor> adult now I will try it as well so I </connor>
<connor> jump in I'm just like but instinctively </connor>
<connor> you're like I don't want to open my eyes </connor>
<connor> right it's gonna hurt I'm like [ __ ] it </connor>
<connor> I'm an adult did it once and then my </connor>
<joey> place you jump with your eyes open no no </joey>
<joey> no no I jump in with my eyes closed slam </joey>
<garnt> the clothes directly in your eyes </garnt>
<connor> I think that's just gonna hurt anyway no </connor>
<garnt> I didn't even do I I remember I didn't </garnt>
<connor> even jump in the pool I was on the edge </connor>
<connor> of the pool and I just stuck my face in </connor>
<connor> the water all right I'm gonna open my </connor>
<connor> eyes and I did it for like </connor>
<connor> one second and I was like it feels like </connor>
<connor> someone's stabbing my eyebrow I think </connor>
<connor> that's normal though but I pulled my </connor>
<connor> eyes out and all the whites in my eyes </connor>
<connor> were just bloodshot red yeah and my </connor>
<connor> parents were like oh that's that's not </connor>
<garnt> normal that's like that's more red than </garnt>
<joey> usual I think I think that's normal is </joey>
<joey> it yeah why would </joey>
<connor> um normally it's like you you're doing </connor>
<connor> it for like 10 minutes tops like you're </connor>
<joey> not doing enough 10 minutes I could </joey>
<joey> barely do it for two seconds I I've done </joey>
<connor> like whole swimming sessions like an </connor>
<connor> hour doing it and it [ __ ] hurts </connor>
<connor> afterwards but it's like I've got to see </connor>
<garnt> where I'm going just buy some goggles </garnt>
<joey> one session </joey>
<garnt> yo Sailors like Sailors in the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> heavy or something like yeah oh no I'm </joey>
<joey> drowning but I can't open I can't see </joey>
<joey> anything I don't have my gold </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] that's true that's true I mean I </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not I'm not like I mean if I need I </garnt>
<garnt> don't like it but if I need to see </garnt>
<connor> underwater </connor>
<connor> I've never brought goggles to the beach </connor>
<joey> oh yeah no I'm not in the beach either </joey>
<connor> but I'm also not opening my eyes on the </connor>
<connor> water when I'm at the beach no I try not </connor>
<connor> because most times yeah water in your </connor>
<garnt> eyes yeah no I get like a little you </garnt>
<garnt> know Splash so so is so it is blind </garnt>
<connor> you're like my I have chlorine ten </connor>

<garnt> below back to the episode do you need </garnt>
<garnt> yeah do you need to use dark mode for </garnt>
<connor> everything yes are you dark mode because </connor>
<connor> I'm not an [ __ ] I just think light </connor>
<joey> mode looks like [ __ ] yeah it's like and </joey>
<connor> also I don't want to be that guy while </connor>
<joey> I'm lying in bed and my partner is next </joey>
<joey> to me </joey>
<connor> the only way the light mode is good is </connor>
<garnt> like because the windows UI looks like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] let me see let me say you dark mode </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] play [ __ ] up too much okay </garnt>
<garnt> hi I'm I'm a light mode user yes I'm I'm </garnt>
<joey> out of myself right now okay that's </joey>
<joey> probably why your eyes like [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah that's why because you're blinding </joey>
<joey> yourself every night I've been blind my </joey>
<garnt> entire life What's it gonna do make me </garnt>
<joey> more you're literally like make me more </joey>
<joey> blind every time you've opened up </joey>
<joey> Twitter it's just like a Cod flashbacks </joey>
<joey> come on it's white so don't let the view </joey>
<joey> it is it is the people who use light </joey>
<connor> mode are people Psychopaths can't can't </connor>
<connor> get over the five second difference of </connor>
<connor> the changing the dark mode and be like </connor>
<connor> it's different people like oh I don't </connor>
<connor> like it it's different take it back no </connor>
<connor> like the moment you it for one day </connor>
<garnt> you'll be like I'm a [ __ ] idiot yeah </garnt>
<connor> I never went back I I I have used dark </connor>
<connor> mode on like some apps and I'm like I </connor>
<connor> like 10 seconds 10 seconds Discord </connor>
<garnt> that's it my discord's still dark mode </garnt>
<connor> and I'm like yeah I don't I don't </connor>
<joey> Discord in light mode is unforgivable I </joey>
<joey> don't even know what this is </joey>
<joey> okay this mod live mode just looks ugly </joey>
<connor> that just looks like let's see it's </connor>
<connor> horrific but like everything else I've </connor>
<connor> switched to dark mode I'm like I kind of </connor>
<connor> I like the brightness I like the </connor>
<connor> brightness I do not use Twitter in I </connor>
<joey> looked up Discord light mode </joey>
<garnt> like white mode mean do you want you </garnt>
<joey> want to check my Twitter </joey>
<joey> oh my God </joey>
<garnt> who uses Discord like this yeah okay </garnt>
<joey> Discord Twitter I I like it in like mode </joey>
<connor> okay I can't remember if there was a few </connor>
<connor> studies or something a while back that </connor>
<connor> was like I it was measuring the impact </connor>
<connor> on which ones but a few darker light </connor>
<connor> mode I couldn't remember if there's a </connor>
<connor> conclusion I remember that there was </connor>
<connor> something along the lines of </connor>
<connor> um what light mode is could be better </connor>
<connor> because it's more reminiscent of say </connor>
<garnt> books or paper yeah because I was gonna </garnt>
<garnt> say like Joey like you you like I'm in </garnt>
<connor> bed okay I want to read manga yeah what </connor>
<garnt> am I gonna do switch the manga to dark </garnt>
<joey> mode manga doesn't have a dark mode you </joey>
<joey> know I Read Manga in my [ __ ] phone </joey>
<joey> um oh that's one of them yeah okay okay </joey>
<joey> one of the big reasons I can't I think </joey>
<connor> it's too bright and I would I would </connor>
<connor> argue that a lot of manga is more dark </connor>
<connor> than light a lot of the drawing is black </connor>
<joey> it's literally on white paint what are </joey>
<connor> you talking about yeah </connor>
<connor> there's more ink on the paper than white </connor>
<joey> what are you doing </joey>
<joey> what are you doing it's arguably more </joey>
<connor> dark than it is like okay maybe it's </connor>
<connor> something like berserk but like tell me </connor>
<garnt> berserk is like berserk is a dark </garnt>
<connor> fantasy of course he's gonna have so </connor>
<joey> many [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> but if I'm reading like pump team epic </joey>
<joey> then that's like mostly why I'm just </joey>
<connor> saying it's a live dog a lot of Doc in </connor>
<joey> them you know a lot of them have a lot </joey>
<joey> of words </joey>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure even the </garnt>
<joey> most hardcore light mode person is </joey>
<garnt> watching this bite now being like no </garnt>
<connor> Connor I'm trying my best </connor>
<connor> I I think there's saying the manga </connor>
<joey> argument is very negligible in terms of </joey>
<joey> is that light mode or not because </joey>
<joey> there's gonna be some we're not saying </joey>
<connor> dark we're not [ __ ] knocked over yeah </connor>
<connor> who the [ __ ] it's not all dark </connor>
<connor> what we're trying to say is that </connor>
<connor> generally like the background and a lot </connor>
<connor> of that stuff is dark which is nice and </connor>
<connor> it's better because the phone is backlit </connor>
<connor> you know well the thing is because like </connor>
<garnt> it's not traditional the reason I </garnt>
<connor> genuinely like light mode is because </connor>
<connor> you've never tried dark mode I have </connor>
<connor> tried dark mode no I I I okay the best </connor>
<connor> actually the best mode is the one where </connor>
<connor> it switches for you automatically </connor>
<connor> depending on the time of day because the </connor>
<connor> thing is I wake up screen dimmer yeah </connor>
<connor> the screen no not the screen dimmer </connor>
<garnt> there's a little there's a literal mode </garnt>
<garnt> that will switch on on some apps that </garnt>
<joey> will switch from light mode to dark mode </joey>
<joey> like an in-car GPS yeah yeah yeah kind </joey>
<garnt> of that's like the best mode but like I </garnt>
<joey> like when I wake up and I just have like </joey>
<garnt> the brightness of the screens okay one </garnt>
<joey> thing I genuinely generally welcome to </joey>
<garnt> your future robot slaves look genuinely </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm someone who needs a lot of </garnt>
<joey> sunshine you know I I like my sunshine I </joey>
<connor> like I like my brightness the way my </connor>
<joey> body are we gonna go do you touch grass </joey>
<joey> I also enjoy sunlight but you know what </joey>
<joey> I do when I want to enjoy sunlight I </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] go outside and look at something </joey>
<joey> okay open my curtain okay </joey>
<garnt> obviously you guys have obviously you've </garnt>
<connor> never lived in England when sometimes </connor>
<joey> it's just like a [ __ ] cloudy day and </joey>
<connor> it's just the most </connor>
<connor> I would not live in like the northern </connor>
<connor> hemisphere of like Finland in the middle </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] nowhere </garnt>
<garnt> I will take any brightness Source I can </garnt>
<garnt> get the brighter the room is the happier </garnt>
<joey> I am the more awake I am the more that's </joey>
<joey> probably why you're blind because you </joey>
<connor> just flash banging your eyes every day </connor>
<connor> okay phone's lightness is not even </connor>
<connor> remotely comparable to a light in say </connor>
<connor> like a room like a ceiling light or </connor>
<connor> anything it's not even remotely they </connor>
<joey> also take every selfie </joey>
<connor> they also take every selfie with the </connor>
<garnt> flash on no no </garnt>
<connor> to just be a bunch of [ __ ] phone </connor>
<joey> screens just lighting up the room like </joey>
<joey> what these lights are totally different </joey>
<joey> type of like I I do not want the </joey>
<joey> artificial it's like I want white walls </joey>
<joey> in my room I feel so much nicer </joey>
<garnt> sunlight does feel so much nicer but </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you're in a room where you </garnt>
<connor> can't get enough sunlight sometimes </connor>
<connor> you're in a place where you know there </connor>
<garnt> isn't enough natural light and there's </garnt>
<connor> just the lighting on the ceiling or the </connor>
<connor> lamps the last Light I think about </connor>
<garnt> getting to fix that problem is my phone </garnt>
<garnt> okay yeah I will say having having like </garnt>
<garnt> having a bright mode on your PC is much </garnt>
<connor> better to me like it it feels for the </connor>
<connor> argument's sake I do use Windows Live </connor>
<connor> mode yeah because the dark mode I don't </connor>
<connor> know what they did to it it looks </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] horrendous really yeah do you </joey>
<joey> use it and I use I didn't even know </joey>
<joey> there was a dog it just doesn't look </joey>
<connor> good I'm not sure why oh like it's all </connor>
<garnt> it's it try it we'll do it later okay I </garnt>
<garnt> mean what looks bad about light mode </garnt>
<garnt> what what actually I don't get what are </garnt>
<joey> you why everyone and says it looks bad </joey>
<connor> okay it's just really it's like having </connor>
<joey> like bread from a store and then you </joey>
<connor> know and like you don't know a bakery </connor>
<connor> exists out there fresh bread right right </connor>
<connor> you're really clutch it does white light </connor>
<connor> mode does everything it's it's a very </connor>
<connor> viable option but it's just because you </connor>
<connor> don't know about the joyous ability you </connor>
<joey> can't just say it it hurts my eyes no no </joey>
<connor> it doesn't no because it does it hurts </connor>
<joey> my eyes I just think dark mode </joey>
<joey> that's exactly what I'm saying dark mode </joey>
<connor> it looks better that's what we have </connor>
<connor> after dark because it's a better version </connor>
<connor> of trash </connor>
<garnt> just a dark version of trash test this </garnt>
<garnt> disgusting this is uh this is light mode </garnt>
<connor> sorry if you a lot of the apps just like </connor>
<connor> I Twitter to me is is I I can't unsee it </connor>
<connor> as a dark Mode app it just it when I see </connor>
<connor> it on light mode I'm like this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like when you watch those </connor>
<connor> documentaries and that you know they </connor>
<connor> play all like the millions of tweets </connor>
<connor> pop-up and they have the white </connor>
<joey> background I'm like it's [ __ ] [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> bro we sold more after dark merch than </joey>
<joey> we did Regular trash days motion </joey>
<joey> coincidence I think not people like dark </joey>
<joey> mode people like the vibe but there's a </joey>
<joey> shirt there is people not light I know </joey>
<joey> it's not reflected well you're wearing </joey>
<garnt> the light mode one man you got white </garnt>
<joey> there Connor what are you doing does </joey>
<joey> that hurt your eyes </joey>
<connor> what is is that apps are better in dark </connor>
<connor> mode </connor>
<connor> yeah you're on I rest my case </connor>
<garnt> there I think there is a sect of us </garnt>
<garnt> light mode users we have been oppressed </garnt>
<joey> by the dark mode </joey>
<joey> at least tell me okay okay of course </joey>
<connor> dark Mode's gonna yeah at least how do </connor>
<joey> you know that how do you know because </joey>
<joey> we're a [ __ ] weird </joey>
<joey> no no they first stay in their [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> man caves right yeah let's listen at </joey>
<joey> least tell me all right if you're if </joey>
<connor> you're you know you're in bed right </connor>
<connor> you're just before you go to bed </connor>
<connor> you're gonna be you know you're gonna be </connor>
<connor> uh you know on your phone going through </connor>
<connor> Twitter and stuff like that before you </connor>
<garnt> go to bed right you do that yes okay how </garnt>
<garnt> bright do you have your phone how bright </garnt>
<garnt> do I have like when it comes to the </garnt>
<garnt> brightness meter on your phone right </garnt>
<joey> right is it all the way to the top or is </joey>
<joey> it all the way to the bottom or </joey>
<garnt> somewhere in between well I try not to </garnt>
<garnt> go on my phone if if the room is dark </garnt>
<joey> yeah if you're in a pitch black room and </joey>
<joey> you and you want to go on Twitter before </joey>
<garnt> you go to bed how right is your phone </garnt>
<garnt> usually don't because okay like to me </garnt>
<garnt> like that's that's one way to just not </garnt>
<garnt> get asleep right right </garnt>
<garnt> I sleep great yeah great sleep yeah look </garnt>
<connor> I'm saying it's it's a good habit just </connor>
<connor> because like it gets your mind in the </connor>
<joey> process of getting to sleep healthy </joey>
<joey> habits healthy habits </joey>
<garnt> from a guy who uses light I am going to </garnt>
<connor> preach this okay I'm preaching this </connor>
<connor> right now Joey listen if I have any </connor>
<joey> healthy habits I'd stop drinking God </joey>
<joey> that's I don't care about that all right </joey>
<garnt> so you'd rather you you'd rather you'd </garnt>
<connor> rather use I think that's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> though what you're saying is the </connor>
<connor> healthiest way is to not look at your </connor>
<connor> phone what we're arguing is uh well I'm </connor>
<garnt> not really he's arguing around here I'm </garnt>
<garnt> I'm you should look at the dark mode if </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna look I'm arguing that the </garnt>
<garnt> best mode is the mode that switches </garnt>
<garnt> automatically automatically for you but </garnt>
<garnt> if I had a choice between dark mode and </garnt>
<garnt> light mode I choose light mode because I </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to switch manually to light </garnt>
<garnt> mode every time when I wake up in the </garnt>
<garnt> morning and see all the boys that you </garnt>
<garnt> don't like about dark mode what is it </garnt>
<garnt> that I don't like about dark mode it's </garnt>
<garnt> not that I don't like dark mode is that </garnt>
<garnt> I prefer light mode or why do you prefer </garnt>
<garnt> light mode I just I literally just said </garnt>
<garnt> because I I said because I like the </garnt>
<garnt> brightness in my life Joey I like this I </garnt>
<garnt> like the light okay I go towards the </garnt>
<garnt> light I'm a [ __ ] moth okay </garnt>
<garnt> I like the brightness why is that a bad </garnt>
<connor> thing I like the brightness even darker </connor>
<connor> light mode light mode </connor>
<joey> everything everything you know </joey>
<connor> everything I think everything aside from </connor>
<connor> Discord because I see I think Discord </connor>
<connor> Discord is actually War crime I think we </connor>
<connor> can all agree on YouTube light mode uh </connor>
<connor> everything's so bad in life </connor>
<joey> there's what is wrong with YouTube live </joey>
<garnt> mode literally do what the [ __ ] logo </garnt>
<joey> has white in it you know what a logo has </joey>
<joey> white in it it's like three pixels it </joey>
<connor> doesn't matter okay you know what I hate </connor>
<joey> about YouTube is that you open it right </joey>
<joey> so you open YouTube yeah and it does </joey>
<connor> okay I did win this up sometimes right </connor>
<connor> it'll just open white and then turn to </connor>
<connor> dark oh yeah </connor>
<connor> I want to see a single I think they </connor>
<joey> fixed that recently though but a lot of </joey>
<joey> people you know uh it's something going </joey>
<connor> to consider yourself if you're making </connor>
<connor> thumbnails yeah I gotta make it for dark </connor>
<garnt> and light mode to make sure let's get on </garnt>
<joey> both I've never thought about it I don't </joey>
<garnt> I don't I don't consider like so do you </garnt>
<garnt> so yeah when you make your thumbnails do </garnt>
<garnt> you actually consider that no white </garnt>
<connor> background no nothing I try not to make </connor>
<connor> it yeah I look at both because I had it </connor>
<connor> in dark mode so I gotta be because </connor>
<joey> people leave on the default right oh I </joey>
<joey> just assumed no one watches YouTube in </joey>
<garnt> line mode </garnt>
<connor> no it's default unfortunately yeah it </connor>
<garnt> just means that our calls will never be </garnt>
<garnt> the best yeah sad that's just I just </garnt>
<garnt> don't I I okay people are lazy and they </garnt>
<connor> just don't change the defaults because </connor>
<connor> they get used to something and then </connor>
<connor> they're too scared to change it like </connor>
<connor> this guy have you changed it I guarantee </connor>
<garnt> he wouldn't turn I have changed it I'm </garnt>
<garnt> saying this is not do not love me with </garnt>
<garnt> the same people who are still using </garnt>
<connor> Internet Explorer because they don't </connor>
<connor> have to change </connor>
<connor> like a little little science experiment </connor>
<connor> what if you change the dark mode for a </connor>
<connor> week I'll change the light mode for a </connor>
<joey> week and then we can decide and see who </joey>
<joey> has the better eyesight at the end </joey>
<joey> do you think there is a chance you're </joey>
<joey> going to convert to light mode </joey>
<connor> I I started in light mode and then I I </connor>
<connor> ironically I saw the light and I I </connor>
<connor> didn't like it so I went to the dark and </connor>
<connor> that's what I'm in narrative so I I've </connor>
<connor> had the light mode because where I </connor>
<joey> started yeah I mean I had the life and </joey>
<connor> then I learned about dark mode </connor>
<connor> afterwards and so I was like oh I'll try </connor>
<joey> this new dark mode thing out and I'll </joey>
<joey> say oh I much prefer because it doesn't </joey>
<garnt> blind me every morning look I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> saying like [ __ ] light mode is the </garnt>
<garnt> pizza crust of the app world okay like </garnt>
<garnt> it feels exactly the same where you </garnt>
<garnt> where if you choose to use [ __ ] light </garnt>
<garnt> mode people act like you've just </garnt>
<garnt> committed a [ __ ] War crime or </garnt>
<garnt> something you know a war crime against </garnt>
<garnt> their eyes or something okay that's </garnt>
<connor> that's what it feels like okay </connor>
<connor> all right what do you think uh is </connor>
<connor> winning right now in the poll I know </connor>
<garnt> it's dark mode why do you think my stock </garnt>
<joey> mode because because you you dark mode </joey>
<joey> guides are so [ __ ] vocal about it </joey>
<connor> you you dark mode users because I'm sick </connor>
<joey> of being on the [ __ ] train look </joey>
<connor> across and the person next to me and </connor>
<garnt> they have [ __ ] light mode beaming in </garnt>
<garnt> my eyes you uncivilized [ __ ] you stuck </garnt>
<joey> what is look it doesn't matter what the </joey>
<garnt> polls says I want to guess 90 10. what </garnt>
<garnt> do you think </garnt>
<garnt> probably United yeah do you think it's </garnt>
<joey> that much maybe okay that's what I feel </joey>
<garnt> like I could have gone to my head I'd </garnt>
<joey> have been like that's what I feel like </joey>
<joey> 40. really really what is it now </joey>
<connor> um well let me um how long has the </connor>
<connor> Philippines wait wait how how many 3 000 </connor>
<connor> votes yeah 95 Darkness </connor>
<connor> so so I said okay which one of the boys </connor>
<joey> uses light mode confess your sin someone </joey>
<joey> replied it's gone Connor is going to </joey>
<joey> defend dog mode like his life depends </joey>
<connor> Joey is gonna say I can see both sides </connor>
<joey> but prefers documents I feel so cool </joey>
<connor> down anyone who says light mode is a </connor>
<connor> sociopath look if there are 500 light </connor>
<connor> mode users in the world I am one of them </connor>
<joey> I am one of them if there are 10 live </joey>
<joey> mode users in the world I am one of them </joey>
<joey> I will defend light mode until till my </joey>
<joey> dying breath okay I don't care how many </joey>
<joey> of you guys are there because there's </joey>
<garnt> one or more of me of you if there's one </garnt>
<garnt> more of me I found a brother okay like </garnt>
<joey> an AAA meeting but for light mode </joey>
<joey> why didn't we convert any time to like </joey>
<joey> flickers or anything </joey>
<joey> we're gonna start a movement it's a </joey>
<joey> revolution okay we're taking back the </joey>
<garnt> rise mode the resistance </garnt>
<connor> it's one of the things when I when I </connor>
<connor> realized that doctor was a thing I tried </connor>
<connor> it out I was like oh this is much better </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like having a wrong </connor>
<connor> fitting t-shirt for the longest time and </connor>
<connor> then you realize oh oh it can feel like </connor>
<connor> this that's what it felt like to change </connor>
<connor> right right like a pair of boxes that </connor>
<connor> didn't quite fit as nicely but you </connor>
<connor> didn't realize that so you're only pay </connor>
<joey> for everybody was the app that convinced </joey>
<garnt> you was it Discord because I swear for </garnt>
<connor> me it was Twitter Twitter I started off </connor>
<garnt> with Twitter because I think </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of apps don't even tell you that </garnt>
<connor> dark mode exists I didn't know it </connor>
<connor> existed me neither and then I think I </connor>
<connor> went on Twitter one day and they showed </connor>
<joey> the dark mode yeah they had dark like </joey>
<connor> true dark and like the dim darker Navy </connor>
<joey> dark I use that one love that one looks </joey>
<joey> amazing and then I thought hi what if </joey>
<connor> there's dark mode for other apps and one </connor>
<connor> time I shared my screen on Discord and </connor>
<connor> it was light mode I didn't even realize </connor>
<connor> dark mode existed and then all my live </connor>
<connor> stream people were like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] no okay because like yeah </joey>
<joey> I was exactly the same so it was like </joey>
<joey> like I saw it on on Twitter and I was </joey>
<joey> like oh let me try this out and I was </joey>
<joey> like see how people screaming it's </joey>
<connor> amazing </connor>
<joey> and I was like oh is that like a plug-in </joey>
<connor> or something what is that have you </connor>
<connor> realized about most screenshots you see </connor>
<connor> on Twitter or dark mode yeah with like </connor>
<connor> tweet memes don't think about it yeah </connor>
<connor> think about it think about it </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter how many it does like </connor>
<connor> I said if everyone was using dark mode </connor>
<connor> do you think people what they want that </connor>
<connor> is that is why take away that is why </connor>
<joey> this is the most depressed Society we've </joey>
<joey> had in all of history I guess this is </joey>
<connor> why this is the depressed generation </connor>
<connor> okay we haven't had that yet okay this </connor>
<joey> is why mental health is such a big deal </joey>
<joey> now it's because too many people are </joey>
<joey> using dark mode </joey>
<connor> I go to my Better Health session </connor>
<connor> after I lost my job and I use my </connor>
<joey> three-month coupon uh it's remittance no </joey>
<joey> it's because it's because people are </joey>
<joey> using light mode to substitute for some </joey>
<joey> social media that's why you're trying to </joey>
<connor> grow like a planet </connor>
<joey> come on bro is that all I can feel the </joey>
<joey> cells getting energy in my body </joey>
<connor> photosynthesis please don't be like a </connor>
<joey> cannabis plant bro trying to grow from </joey>
<joey> artificial life to this house </joey>
<joey> oh my god oh how the fun are we going to </joey>
<joey> stop it I don't know welcome to trash </joey>
<joey> days I can't remember I don't know </joey>
<joey> because we're talking about haughtiness </joey>
<garnt> oh yes let's talk about Isis yeah one of </garnt>
<garnt> the most interesting videos I've ever </garnt>
<garnt> seen actually is your Dogma like artists </garnt>
<connor> um the artists who drew like as the </connor>
<connor> world would look if you didn't have </connor>
<connor> glasses yeah yeah right </connor>
<connor> um I remember seeing a video Once of </connor>
<connor> like a blind artist and he was born like </connor>
<connor> without eyes yeah and I was like one of </connor>
<connor> the most interesting videos I've ever </connor>
<connor> seen because this guy's an artist but </connor>
<connor> obviously he's never seen anything in </connor>
<connor> his life </connor>
<connor> um and he describes like what colors the </connor>
<joey> concept of colors of what he thinks </joey>
<joey> right and he's like oh I think I've seen </joey>
<joey> this yeah and he's like I don't get it </joey>
<joey> like people people have tried to </joey>
<joey> describe colors to me people have tried </joey>
<connor> to describe colors to me and it's such </connor>
<connor> an interesting concept of how do you </connor>
<connor> describe colors to someone who's never </connor>
<joey> seen colors right now you can describe </joey>
<joey> Orange </joey>
<joey> I think the general consensus because </joey>
<joey> yeah I remember seeing that video a </joey>
<joey> while back the general consensus is like </joey>
<connor> when you just uh when you talk about </connor>
<connor> things like the color red for example </connor>
<connor> right you think of like hot yeah or like </connor>
<connor> blue is like a cool color yeah but when </connor>
<joey> you think about it it's like that </joey>
<garnt> doesn't mean anything yeah he's like so </garnt>
<garnt> people describe to describe Reza's hot </garnt>
<garnt> it's like what the [ __ ] does that mean </garnt>
<garnt> yeah what does that mean why is hot a </garnt>
<garnt> color </garnt>
<garnt> plus how the [ __ ] does that make sense </garnt>
<joey> because like blue can be hot as well if </joey>
<garnt> you're talking about a blue flame yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly so it's like it doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> when you think about it it's like okay </garnt>
<joey> how do you describe say like this </joey>
<joey> particular shade of purple to someone </joey>
<garnt> it's trash days just trash dating it </garnt>
<garnt> it's like oh of course of course I've </garnt>
<joey> seen trash teeth but wait a minute wait </joey>
<joey> a minute I've heard trash days before so </joey>
<joey> is his art good or what huh was it good </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's like it's really well I </garnt>
<joey> think I think it's I don't know how does </joey>
<garnt> he know what he's drawing I I think he's </garnt>
<joey> just I might learn am I ignorant am I I </joey>
<joey> think I think it comes with that whole </joey>
<joey> concept of like uh you know if you're </joey>
<joey> born blind or you're born deaf yeah that </joey>
<connor> is that is normal to that person as it </connor>
<connor> is for the rest of everyone else who is </connor>
<connor> born with sight or born with hearing </connor>
<connor> right yeah it's only I think I remember </connor>
<connor> like a comedian talking about this it's </connor>
<connor> only when normal people make it weird </connor>
<connor> that it becomes weird for them right </connor>
<connor> because like if someone is born deaf </connor>
<connor> then it's like well to them not hearing </connor>
<connor> anything is normal but it's not until </connor>
<joey> someone's like oh you're deaf oh you </joey>
<joey> can't can you can't hear music and it's </joey>
<joey> like don't make it [ __ ] weird for </joey>
<connor> them they're living fine I mean it's </connor>
<connor> like if I didn't know like document </connor>
<joey> existed it wouldn't bother me I didn't </joey>
<joey> know it existed right another when </joey>
<connor> someone points it out music existed I'd </connor>
<garnt> be like whatever dude yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] music exactly </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah like what's what what was what </garnt>
<garnt> I found so interesting is he can still </garnt>
<garnt> like he still can imagine let's say like </garnt>
<garnt> what a landscape looks like you know and </garnt>
<connor> what yeah you have your own </connor>
<garnt> interpretation of what the description </garnt>
<connor> could be or what you think it is yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah that would visual you could still </garnt>
<garnt> visualize that yeah like I think one of </garnt>
<garnt> honestly one of the coolest I'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> call it ability even though it's like </garnt>
<connor> kind of a condition because it it sounds </connor>
<connor> like a [ __ ] ability is I think it's </connor>
<connor> called like synesthesia or something </connor>
<joey> where you one sense is tied to another </joey>
<connor> yes right which is one which is one of </connor>
<joey> the coolest things I've ever heard like </joey>
<joey> I think uh we met uh Baron J John who </joey>
<joey> actually had synesthesia yeah and like </joey>
<joey> he was telling his story about how you </joey>
<joey> know you say a word or you hear a sound </joey>
<joey> and he sees like a certain color with </joey>
<joey> yourself yes and I'm like this is this </joey>
<connor> is like this is the closest we've gone </connor>
<connor> to like X-Men in real life wait wait </connor>
<joey> wait wait wait wait hold up so like </joey>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> because let's say you said coffee to me </connor>
<connor> yeah obviously I'm going to picture </connor>
<joey> Brown </joey>
<joey> that's because you're associating it </joey>
<joey> with the object that exists yeah if </joey>
<joey> you're talking about say like a very </joey>
<joey> arbitrary concept that doesn't exist in </joey>
<joey> the Physical Realm and doesn't have a </joey>
<joey> form for example </joey>
<joey> God </joey>
<joey> I have an image like what color do you </joey>
<connor> imagine that </connor>
<connor> uh you know white right but that's </connor>
<connor> because you're probably thinking about </connor>
<joey> God </joey>
<joey> when you say God do you think light mode </joey>
<connor> uh yeah I guess so yeah okay </connor>
<connor> okay here's another example here's </connor>
<connor> another example when I say the number </connor>
<joey> three what color do you think of gray </joey>
<joey> why gray I don't know just thought of </joey>
<joey> that color what about number four </joey>
<connor> probably green why green though I don't </connor>
<connor> know it's green when you say color and </connor>
<connor> four I think green </connor>
<connor> like because of 420. </connor>
<connor> I don't think here's the thing I imagine </connor>
<connor> that it's like consistent right if they </connor>
<connor> if you always ask them for it would </connor>
<connor> always be the same color right if you </connor>
<connor> ask me four knit and then a color I I </connor>
<connor> would probably say a different color </connor>
<joey> every time right I really seem like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] year okay so so I looked up on </joey>
<joey> Google for example right uh synesthesia </joey>
<joey> is when you for example you hear music </joey>
<joey> but you see shapes yeah uh or you hear a </joey>
<joey> word or a name and instantly see a color </joey>
<joey> uh for example you might hear the name </joey>
<garnt> Alex and C green </garnt>
<joey> yeah so do you have that or are you just </joey>
<garnt> like no oh I think what you were doing </garnt>
<connor> was just like hearing a number speaking </connor>
<connor> random color green yeah I'd say the </connor>
<connor> music one was a little sounds a little </connor>
<connor> familiar definitely seeing shape not </connor>
<connor> like visualizing shapes to music that </connor>
<connor> sounds familiar but not not the other </connor>
<joey> ones right right well then maybe you </joey>
<connor> might I feel that every music has like a </connor>
<joey> if you imagined do you know like if you </joey>
<joey> because it's like you know if you said </joey>
<connor> like rock in your head maybe you could </connor>
<connor> visualize what it would look like if you </connor>
<joey> were to </joey>
<joey> oh like rock music yeah well it depends </joey>
<joey> for me I think I think like yeah no </joey>
<joey> definitely like if you hear enough music </joey>
<joey> and you get into it then yeah you can </joey>
<connor> definitely start to like Envision like </connor>
<connor> I've had moments where I've listened to </connor>
<connor> a new piece of music and I can Envision </connor>
<garnt> what the music video but I don't </garnt>
<connor> actually see it right but I don't </connor>
<connor> physically see it yeah you physically </connor>
<garnt> see it yeah you physically see it well </garnt>
<connor> it's like that's that's the condition </connor>
<joey> that's synesthesia that's that's so it's </joey>
<connor> like so it's like when you hear the word </connor>
<joey> Alex yeah your vision your vision </joey>
<garnt> because that color and it's not only </garnt>
<joey> tied to Vision as well I've heard of </joey>
<connor> some people where you it's tied to like </connor>
<connor> taste or something so why would this be </connor>
<connor> a superpower it sounds like a detriment </connor>
<connor> I want [ __ ] shapes in front of my </connor>
<connor> eyes all the time well the [ __ ] I want </connor>
<joey> shapes you just [ __ ] with someone yeah </joey>
<connor> if you just see me like Alex Alex </connor>
<joey> it is a real Condition it's one of the </joey>
<garnt> strangest conditions I know I think of </garnt>
<joey> yeah it is I think it's like super cool </joey>
<garnt> because it's like it's because you see </garnt>
<garnt> like you see it clearly I'm pretty sure </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah well obviously I don't have </garnt>
<joey> something well I don't know I don't know </joey>
<connor> I've only used when you said the music </connor>
<connor> thing I said I I feel that it's like I I </connor>
<joey> didn't you imagine that yeah yeah but no </joey>
<connor> no you physically see it yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah with like what font what Graphics </connor>
<connor> like what I don't know I don't know the </connor>
<connor> condition like like how would this look </connor>
<joey> this sounds what you should probably ask </joey>
<joey> someone any any viewers watching with </joey>
<joey> synesthesia please explain in the </joey>
<garnt> comments feel free to inform us </garnt>
<connor> Enlighten us this is my ignorance of </connor>
<connor> where I'm like this sounds too fake this </connor>
<connor> I I think this is cool but like I I know </connor>
<connor> that's just because I can't because none </connor>
<connor> of you have it and none of you can sit </connor>
<connor> here </connor>
<connor> yeah it looks like you're explaining it </connor>
<connor> to me and none of you have it so I'm </connor>
<connor> like this doesn't make any [ __ ] sense </connor>
<joey> to me oh yeah of course because I'm like </joey>
<joey> I can only I can only like imagine what </joey>
<joey> it's like but you know yeah I mean you </joey>
<joey> know I definitely can imagine things </joey>
<connor> like my mind can wonder when I listen to </connor>
<connor> a piece of music for example I think </connor>
<connor> anyone can do that but like physically </connor>
<connor> seeing something is very different huh </connor>
<connor> you got to be on some like </connor>
<connor> hallucinogenics exactly if you're a </connor>
<joey> normal person that doesn't have </joey>
<joey> synesthesia but for someone like this </joey>
<joey> it's like being on hallucinogenics all </joey>
<joey> the time okay so here's WebMD only the </joey>
<joey> best sources of course one of the most </joey>
<joey> common responses to seeing lessons </joey>
<connor> numbers and also colors you might also </connor>
<connor> see or hear a word and taste food see </connor>
<joey> here so like so like say for example </joey>
<connor> what but like not not but I don't think </connor>
<joey> it it's the word that is associated with </joey>
<joey> the taste so it's not the same as like </joey>
<joey> hearing the word bacon and then tasting </joey>
<joey> bacon it's more like a completely </joey>
<connor> different thing yes </connor>
<connor> let's say someone said bacon and they </connor>
<joey> might I would hear like be realistic </joey>
<joey> like it might not like that yeah maybe </joey>
<joey> or vice versa if I said free real estate </joey>
<connor> okay </connor>
<garnt> okay my ignorance on the subject and </garnt>
<connor> might not understanding of it is not one </connor>
<connor> of like disgust or yeah I just don't get </connor>
<connor> it and I want to understand because I </connor>
<joey> think it's different to when for example </joey>
<joey> like you know if you see a picture of a </joey>
<joey> lemon then you start salivating I think </joey>
<joey> it's very different to that because that </joey>
<joey> is like an association with priests </joey>
<joey> that's that's an association with </joey>
<connor> pre-existing knowledge of what that is </connor>
<connor> but your brain is [ __ ] weird enough </connor>
<connor> where it could easily make pre-existing </connor>
<joey> bonds or ties to stuff oh of course I </joey>
<connor> mean again that explains the whole thing </connor>
<connor> of like looking at a picture of a lemon </connor>
<connor> and salad yeah yeah I suppose that's </connor>
<connor> because I remember they did that when I </connor>
<connor> went to go get a PCR test in Japan like </connor>
<connor> at the PCR Center they have pictures of </connor>
<joey> like sour plums and lemons there to help </joey>
<joey> you celebrate </joey>
<joey> it was really funny I saw this </joey>
<connor> right now the explanation makes it sound </connor>
<connor> like you like I I could believe it if </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> um you hear something and then it's a </connor>
<connor> very faint picture but like if it like </connor>
<connor> was obstructing your view like what like </connor>
<joey> I don't know I don't know like I want to </joey>
<joey> know I'm sure there's different levels </joey>
<joey> of severity to it maybe it's like a </joey>
<joey> light Hue or maybe it's just like </joey>
<joey> putting a piece of green paper in front </joey>
<garnt> of your face I don't know honestly </garnt>
<connor> anyone says thank God I'm not a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> doctor if someone came with this [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> I'd be like all right [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> he's just like no you know [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> I shave this what about you see five </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] off you stupid come on [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> office again you see colors and stuff </joey>
<connor> yeah I can see I can see as well I also </connor>
<joey> have eyesight </joey>
<connor> shout out to those doctors that just </connor>
<connor> like believe people </connor>
<joey> no I I I know I mean to me it's like I I </joey>
<joey> want to know more about it because I </joey>
<joey> don't yeah it's is that like it's like </joey>
<joey> um a lot of the times I think that are </joey>
<joey> like personally and uh our brains are </joey>
<joey> very poor at understanding things we </joey>
<connor> have no concept of being able to like </connor>
<connor> feel or experience ourselves yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> so like when I'm asking all these </connor>
<connor> questions it's not out of like it's not </connor>
<connor> real it's like it's just like I just I </connor>
<connor> just want to know exactly how it feels </connor>
<garnt> and what you're experiencing yeah well I </garnt>
<garnt> think that's why it's so hard for us to </garnt>
<joey> like say you know whenever you see any </joey>
<joey> kind of like charity movement or </joey>
<joey> something like that it's so hard to </joey>
<joey> convince people with like facts and </joey>
<joey> numbers but you hear like you hear a </joey>
<garnt> story and you're like oh okay I get it </garnt>
<connor> there is an issue there's a problem yeah </connor>
<garnt> and it's not again I want to preface </garnt>
<garnt> this is not from like because I know </garnt>
<garnt> that this could be comparable to like </garnt>
<garnt> say mental health and it's like oh well </garnt>
<garnt> you know how could you say that you </garnt>
<garnt> could argue that doesn't exist because </garnt>
<garnt> you didn't feel it or you can't </garnt>
<joey> empathize with it that's not what I'm </joey>
<joey> trying to say it's that I it's not that </joey>
<joey> I I'm asking questions because I don't </joey>
<joey> believe or I don't necessarily uh you </joey>
<joey> know uh think it's real it's just that I </joey>
<joey> just want to know you want to get </joey>
<joey> because I want to feel like I can </joey>
<connor> understand and what exactly what it </connor>
<connor> feels like to have this thing it's </connor>
<joey> really fascinating as well because I </joey>
<joey> just said I'm just reading more of the </joey>
<joey> synesthesia thing on WebMD yeah only </joey>
<connor> trusted sources uh the color uh it says </connor>
<connor> it's internal mostly the colors are just </connor>
<joey> in your mind only a few since </joey>
<joey> that uh see colors outside their body </joey>
<connor> okay see that's that's what I would </connor>
<connor> argue right because I how do you </connor>
<connor> determine that though because when I </connor>
<connor> hear music sometimes I can like assign </connor>
<connor> and feel and like if I would like I can </connor>
<connor> imagine like shapes yeah and stuff to </connor>
<connor> the music yeah yeah um because that's </connor>
<joey> just I don't know why but like </joey>
<joey> physically seeing it well outside </joey>
<connor> basically seeing it that's that's what I </connor>
<joey> thought you meant yeah apparently there </joey>
<joey> are some cases if that's super rare I </joey>
<garnt> can understand that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but like yeah I feel like this is the </garnt>
<joey> artist getting described to what like </joey>
<connor> what color is you know of course we're </connor>
<joey> never gonna be able to like visualize </joey>
<connor> that because we've never experienced </connor>
<garnt> that so we're like yeah I mean I get it </garnt>
<joey> but I don't get it well because if that </joey>
<joey> artist had that symptom for example then </joey>
<joey> it'll be a lot easier </joey>
<joey> what color is red and it would just be </joey>
<connor> like oh number four and he's like oh I </connor>
<connor> get it all right but the reason why you </connor>
<connor> ask like a billion questions when </connor>
<connor> someone says oh I have this thing is </connor>
<connor> that you're like well okay well we're </connor>
<connor> not gonna just we need to make sure sure </connor>
<connor> that we figure out what it is that you </connor>
<connor> you have yeah so we're going to be very </connor>
<connor> thorough and ask every single question </connor>
<connor> explain it all to me there's something </connor>
<garnt> not adding up there's something </garnt>
<garnt> happening and then you go and contradict </garnt>
<connor> it again later by saying this x thing </connor>
<garnt> it's like yeah I just want to know all </garnt>
<connor> this stuff because I'm like I want to </connor>
<joey> just hear how it works because sometimes </joey>
<joey> you hear stuff and you're like that </joey>
<garnt> sounds like you made it the [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<connor> what are your sources on that yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> well well you like listen iPhone 12. </connor>
<garnt> but also like the older you are the more </garnt>
<connor> you realize man you're it's a brave but </connor>
<connor> the brain is a brain is just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> weird okay that's like the one thing </connor>
<joey> that I've never been able to like </joey>
<joey> understand of like how how your brain is </joey>
<joey> just this powerful it's going into some </joey>
<joey> shower thoughts we're going to good </joey>
<joey> Shadow thoughts now okay like split </joey>
<joey> personalities yeah not like that like </joey>
<joey> how how does how is your brain [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> capable of that okay so that is that is </joey>
<garnt> insane to me it's because there's two </garnt>
<connor> brains </connor>
<connor> well I think a lot of the time stuff </connor>
<connor> like trauma can cause that right yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like a defense it's like </connor>
<connor> an internal defense for some people for </connor>
<connor> others it's not but like there's a many </connor>
<connor> reasons why you're you're brain anatomy </connor>
<joey> or whatever could have the decision that </joey>
<joey> this is how you're going to deal with it </joey>
<joey> or this is what's going to happen yeah </joey>
<joey> right yeah it's like it's a defense </joey>
<joey> mechanism the way I always try to like </joey>
<connor> explain to people if this ever </connor>
<connor> accommodation never comes up which it </connor>
<connor> really does but like for example </connor>
<connor> one thing that weep as humans believe </connor>
<connor> without a doubt is that when I've seen </connor>
<connor> something I saw it yes like I 100 saw </connor>
<connor> this you can't change my mind right and </connor>
<connor> it's like well no because we have we </connor>
<connor> have many many occasions where like </connor>
<connor> witness testimony where they swear they </connor>
<connor> saw it and they swear on their life and </connor>
<joey> it's been not not maliciously because </joey>
<connor> they had no reason to lie and it was </connor>
<joey> just wrong like it just did not happen </joey>
<connor> it did not align so like </connor>
<joey> like the brain memories perception it's </joey>
<joey> all like almost it changes at times I </joey>
<joey> mean that's like if your memories can't </joey>
<joey> be trusted as being fact and and what </joey>
<connor> you saw like who knows what else to [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> your brain is making out oh yeah and I </joey>
<joey> mean you know that's like the whole </joey>
<joey> basis on like sleight of hand magic for </joey>
<joey> example it's like your brain immediately </joey>
<joey> thinks oh that card disappeared yeah but </joey>
<joey> no it's just your brain just can't keep </joey>
<connor> up with it it's like our brain is like </connor>
<connor> an algorithm that has chosen the best </connor>
<joey> way to do things </joey>
<connor> yeah you know I actually have a theory </connor>
<joey> okay going on a slight hand I'm not a </joey>
<connor> scientist with none of us are sorry guys </connor>
<connor> this is my theory and of understanding </connor>
<garnt> of stuff I've seen yeah okay so I I have </garnt>
<garnt> a theory so you you guys have all felt </garnt>
<garnt> Deja Vu right yes of course yes you know </garnt>
<joey> everyone everyone's felt deja vu in one </joey>
<joey> sense or form even if they've never been </joey>
<garnt> to a place or been in this situation </garnt>
<joey> I've been in this place before yeah I </joey>
<joey> haven't been to this place before </joey>
<garnt> so like I have a theory that Deja Vu </garnt>
<connor> comes from like you experiencing </connor>
<connor> basically the same thing in your </connor>
<connor> imagination maybe through dreams or </connor>
<connor> something like that because like </connor>
<connor> possible yeah yeah because I when they </connor>
<connor> say that you remember all of your dreams </connor>
<connor> I'm like how that's that's [ __ ] I </connor>
<connor> remember none of my dreams but I I </connor>
<connor> believe like some people will say that </connor>
<garnt> yeah you remember all of your dreams </garnt>
<garnt> even if you can't recall them and I have </garnt>
<garnt> a theory that Deja Vu is your </garnt>
<garnt> subconscious brain being like I have </garnt>
<garnt> seen this before in my memory somewhere </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah and come back in 300 years to </connor>
<joey> find out yeah </joey>
<joey> have you ever felt jamaivu before what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] is that it's the opposite of </joey>
<garnt> deja vu </garnt>
<garnt> that sounds like a dance move </garnt>
<joey> what were you experiencing you're like </joey>
<joey> I've never experienced it I've never </joey>
<joey> experienced something before and but you </joey>
<joey> have </joey>
<joey> that's a real thing what have you had </joey>
<connor> what happened I I've never experience </connor>
<connor> we're just asking </connor>
<connor> because it's a thing I don't know I'm </connor>
<connor> pretty sure like Alzheimer's right just </connor>
<connor> describe Alzheimer's </connor>
<connor> that's just a fancy word for outside </connor>
<garnt> it's like doctor here's jummy food I </garnt>
<joey> have I haven't been to this place before </joey>
<connor> even though I have </connor>
<connor> for myself </connor>
<garnt> that's just Memento yeah I think our </garnt>
<connor> brains are computers in a way they're </connor>
<connor> very good computers and yeah computers </connor>
<joey> you know what's my favorite Channel </joey>
<joey> about the brain because the brain named </joey>
<joey> itself </joey>
<joey> think about that for a second </joey>
<joey> think about that for a second </joey>
<connor> I realized the moment I was going to say </connor>
<connor> it yeah I knew you're going to say I'm </connor>
<joey> like [ __ ] this </joey>
<joey> I love that one </joey>
<garnt> I love Connor just like processed for a </garnt>
<joey> minute and like nope it's not worth it </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> although one of the freakiest videos </joey>
<joey> I've ever seen which I still [ __ ] if </joey>
<joey> I want to go to into like an existential </joey>
<joey> crisis I watch this video it's like a </joey>
<joey> cpg gray video called like there are two </joey>
<joey> of you or something like that okay where </joey>
<connor> he explains that you know there's the </connor>
<connor> right side of your brain and then </connor>
<connor> there's the left side of your brain yeah </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and uh so that's connected Vera nerve </connor>
<connor> but there have been cases in medical </connor>
<connor> history where they've had to like </connor>
<connor> disconnect the nerve connecting the </connor>
<connor> right and left side of the brain yeah </connor>
<connor> um and you can still function as a human </connor>
<connor> being right right but </connor>
<garnt> only I think once one other side of your </garnt>
<garnt> brain is like is in charge of speech </garnt>
<joey> right yeah yeah and the other is like </joey>
<joey> part of like motor skills and stuff like </joey>
<garnt> that right yeah I mean yeah I believe </garnt>
<garnt> that one side uh if I remember this </garnt>
<garnt> correctly one side of your brain control </garnt>
<garnt> was one side of it and the other one </garnt>
<garnt> controls the other side of it yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> there have been cases where you've had </garnt>
<garnt> the split brain </garnt>
<garnt> and uh they've given like an apple to </garnt>
<garnt> let's say the rights uh they've they've </garnt>
<connor> put like the right </connor>
<garnt> I'm going to take a toilet break and I'm </garnt>
<connor> going to watch the video and then I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna explain it because that's too easy </connor>
<connor> and that's too simple guys you know it's </connor>
<connor> time this episode sponsors my box to our </connor>

<joey> gonna boxer for the sponsor back to the </joey>
<connor> episode this is for the brain right so </connor>
<connor> every explanation you have for it is is </connor>
<connor> not a who don't even [ __ ] know what's </connor>
<connor> happening we don't know what's happening </connor>
<connor> it's way way complicated more than we </connor>
<connor> could ever imagine yes it's the brain </connor>
<garnt> trying to understand the brain exactly </garnt>
<connor> the brain we don't it's too much we </connor>
<connor> don't know what the brain is so when </connor>
<connor> people are like the left side right side </connor>
<connor> made one personality one good it's like </connor>
<connor> no that's oh that's it we'll pack it in </connor>
<connor> there thank you so much thank you so </connor>
<connor> much for that </connor>
<connor> oh okay thanks so we know when to stop </connor>
<connor> the scientists stop wasting all the </connor>
<joey> money don't research anymore it's the </joey>
<joey> brain trying to convince itself on how </joey>
<connor> it works we like easy answers because </connor>
<connor> we're humans and it doesn't [ __ ] work </connor>
<joey> like that no of course not and that's </joey>
<joey> why like study is still being done but </joey>
<joey> like I think you know with modern </joey>
<joey> technology we are getting a much better </joey>
<joey> obviously yeah I mean we're gonna take </joey>
<connor> educated I reckon one like surface level </connor>
<garnt> at this point in time it's like </garnt>
<connor> understanding how the brain works all </connor>
<connor> right tell me about the [ __ ] left and </connor>
<garnt> right side and why you're wrong all </garnt>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> why I'm wrong okay wrong predisposition </joey>
<garnt> Conor's brain is like I don't believe </garnt>
<garnt> any of this this is [ __ ] brain is a </garnt>
<connor> lie he's lying he's lying come on my </connor>
<connor> brain is like don't trust that brain all </connor>
<garnt> right that brain is full of [ __ ] Connor </garnt>
<garnt> all right so </garnt>
<garnt> there have been cases where for medical </garnt>
<garnt> reasons uh they've split the left and </garnt>
<garnt> right side of the brain so they've split </garnt>
<garnt> any kind of connection between the left </garnt>
<garnt> and right and the right side of the </garnt>
<garnt> brain but your left and right side of </garnt>
<joey> the brain is in charge of different </joey>
<joey> things so there have been cases where it </joey>
<joey> feels like to a patient of one of these </joey>
<joey> conditions that the like they would make </joey>
<joey> her they would try to pick something and </joey>
<joey> then their other hand would kind of like </joey>
<joey> disagree with them they they noticed </joey>
<joey> some disagreement with disagreement with </joey>
<joey> that right and so they they have done </joey>
<joey> some tests right where they say they </joey>
<joey> give a command to let's say the left </joey>
<joey> side of the brain and it's beloved </joey>
<joey> division give a command to the left side </joey>
<joey> of the brain like pick up uh Rubik's </joey>
<joey> Cube and they show nothing to the right </joey>
<garnt> side of the brain right and they ask </garnt>
<garnt> them okay did you pick up an object and </garnt>
<garnt> the the guy answers because only one </garnt>
<garnt> side of it is in charge of speech no </garnt>
<garnt> didn't pick up anything and then so they </garnt>
<garnt> give the instruction for like the left </garnt>
<garnt> side to put the Rubik's Cube on the </garnt>
<garnt> right side and the scary thing is that </garnt>
<garnt> because one side is in charge of </garnt>
<garnt> reasoning they'll just like make up a </garnt>
<connor> reason that that a cube has just </connor>
<connor> suddenly appeared in their hand they'll </connor>
<connor> let they'll they'll reason that </connor>
<connor> something like oh I've just always </connor>
<garnt> wanted to solve a Rubik's Cube or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that and that is like </garnt>
<connor> terrifying yeah I believe that this </connor>
<connor> experiment could have taken place and </connor>
<connor> could have happened yeah I just don't </connor>
<connor> buy into the whole the right and left </connor>
<joey> side thing and I mean it seems to me I </joey>
<joey> mean that's your right side of your </joey>
<connor> brain that's your reasoning logic side </connor>
<joey> operation when we took many people </joey>
<connor> so I also Google dicks I'm pretty sure I </connor>
<connor> heard this was a myth one time yeah I </connor>
<connor> Googled it and apparently this is also </connor>
<connor> there is some very very very very slight </connor>
<joey> truths to have different areas of the </joey>
<joey> brain work but it's not that easy where </joey>
<joey> it's just left and right obviously if </joey>
<joey> you start cutting the brain up weird </joey>
<connor> shit's gonna happen yeah like the dude </connor>
<connor> who had a whole [ __ ] pipe rammed </connor>
<connor> through his brain and survived yeah who </connor>
<connor> started being way more Angry like when </connor>
<connor> you take out uh the is it the frontal or </connor>
<garnt> frontal cortex for the cortex yeah I </garnt>
<connor> think you people start acting way more </connor>
<connor> Angry yeah get way more </connor>
<joey> uh I guess what's the word like isn't </joey>
<joey> that like your reason and logic side of </joey>
<connor> your mind yeah I mean you do okay from </connor>
<joey> what I understand you can't just like </joey>
<joey> cut the same thing out of every single </joey>
<connor> brain and the same results are going to </connor>
<joey> happen like it's like if you see there </joey>
<joey> are some parts though like the amygdala </joey>
<joey> for example which is like the part of </joey>
<joey> your brain that operates emotions right </joey>
<joey> if you cut that out of any person then </joey>
<joey> maybe not all of your emotions are going </joey>
<joey> to disappear you're not going to turn </joey>
<joey> into like a [ __ ] it's whatever but </joey>
<garnt> like a lot of emotions is controlled by </garnt>
<joey> that part of your brain so if you cut it </joey>
<garnt> out then you'll definitely be less </garnt>
<garnt> emotive oh I just thought they were </garnt>
<joey> called kudaris yeah kudres are just </joey>
<joey> people </joey>
<connor> I don't know I think even remotely </connor>
<joey> pretending like we understand one tenth </joey>
<joey> of brain science </joey>
<garnt> I took psychology one in college </garnt>
<garnt> tries to attempt to be to be brain </garnt>
<connor> Science </connor>
<connor> question of like what are you you know </connor>
<connor> can you bring this topic up if none of </connor>
<joey> us know [ __ ] anything about it are we </joey>
<joey> allowed to talk well we can yeah we can </joey>
<connor> make speculations I'm betting the </connor>
<connor> brain's gonna [ __ ] end tomorrow </connor>
<joey> speculating well it's like not if if not </joey>
<joey> even [ __ ] you know professional </joey>
<connor> scientists who work on this kind of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> day in and day out fully understand </connor>
<connor> what's going on then I think that leaves </connor>
<connor> enough Liberty for people have no idea </connor>
<joey> to talk about it as well also like </joey>
<connor> because it's like talking about this </connor>
<joey> season oh is that like a bad I don't </joey>
<joey> know well I don't know like I feel like </joey>
<connor> that argument is used to discredit </connor>
<joey> scientists I hate that argument no but </joey>
<joey> of course but like what we are talking </joey>
<joey> about in this episode isn't going to </joey>
<joey> hurt someone no no like someone's not </joey>
<joey> you know no one watching this is going </joey>
<connor> to be like oh [ __ ] I already got my </connor>
<connor> frontal low back feelings I'm feeling </connor>
<joey> too many things told me to cut my </joey>
<joey> amygdala out you know no one's gonna </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] No One's Gonna Do That </joey>
<garnt> I mean it's [ __ ] insane that at one </garnt>
<garnt> point you know a lobotomies existed I </garnt>
<garnt> just I just find that insane you know </garnt>
<connor> how that was just like a tree is there </connor>
<connor> any times where it's I still used not no </connor>
<connor> no no </connor>
<joey> I hope I really hope not I think they </joey>
<connor> very quickly realized that you are just </connor>
<joey> basically killing someone inadvertently </joey>
<connor> but like I I mean I mean it's just the </connor>
<joey> equivalent of when you have an old CRT </joey>
<joey> and you just start hitting it on the </joey>
<connor> side to make it operating in take out </connor>
<connor> your brain yeah have a brain transplant </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah you know your brain is </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] for some reason yeah </connor>
<connor> keep you alive you know whatever and </connor>
<connor> they put a new brain in it I don't know </connor>
<connor> they can't do that I'm pretty sure but </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> brain transplant it's possible for some </connor>
<garnt> reason we can keep you alive we can give </garnt>
<joey> you a new brain yeah yeah are you still </joey>
<garnt> you no </garnt>
<joey> no no he just you just described the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] plot of ghost in the show </connor>
<joey> literally yeah it's like if you if your </joey>
<connor> soul is inside of an Android is that </connor>
<connor> Android really is your soul in your </connor>
<connor> brain </connor>
<connor> women </connor>
<joey> now we're getting into like the </joey>
<connor> religious terrorists [ __ ] what's the I </connor>
<connor> love that [ __ ] what's the name of </connor>
<connor> that thing go on go on say a thing about </connor>
<garnt> the new one he's gonna bring up a meme </garnt>
<joey> they're really deep thing so like Uganda </joey>
<joey> Knuckles </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> uh uh thesis oh yeah where you replace </connor>
<connor> everything right right right yeah do you </connor>
<joey> want to explain what the ship of thesis </joey>
<connor> is for people yes so obviously there's </connor>
<connor> this this question that is arised where </connor>
<connor> if you start with a ship let's say </connor>
<connor> you're getting a long Voyage from the UK </connor>
<connor> to America [ __ ] knows how long back then </connor>
<connor> yeah and every now and then while your </connor>
<connor> ship is going along this route you know </connor>
<connor> a plank of wood snaps off here maybe you </connor>
<connor> change some wood here you found after </connor>
<connor> doing this whole journey that your </connor>
<connor> entire ship has sort of changed nearly </connor>
<connor> all of its parts and the ship is kind of </connor>
<connor> a little bit different and it's not the </connor>
<connor> same ship but it's still called the ship </connor>
<connor> of thesis yeah is it is it still the </connor>
<connor> same ship even if you change every part </connor>
<joey> over time well technically speaking if </joey>
<joey> we're getting into shower thoughts </joey>
<joey> territory humans are also that way </joey>
<connor> because it's like we're constantly </connor>
<connor> reproducing cells in our body cells die </connor>
<connor> and then we make new cells to replace </connor>
<connor> those older you know you replace your </connor>
<connor> skeleton as well right yeah yeah so </connor>
<joey> here's the question do you knew that I </joey>
<garnt> didn't yeah yeah yeah so you you there </garnt>
<garnt> is a point where you literally replace </garnt>
<joey> every cell in your body yeah you replace </joey>
<joey> every cell in your body right so </joey>
<joey> basically us now there is not a single </joey>
<joey> cell in our body right now that is the </joey>
<garnt> same cells that we had when we were why </garnt>
<garnt> am I getting [ __ ] thank God beta cells </garnt>
<connor> right now they're replacing my good </connor>
<connor> shells with shittier old cells stop stop </connor>
<connor> making me old no but here's the thing </connor>
<connor> right here's another shower thought </connor>
<joey> newer cells are still making you older </joey>
<connor> how does that work because they're </connor>
<connor> copying it themselves Joey they're just </connor>
<joey> copying over and over again okay but are </joey>
<joey> you the same person that you are as a </joey>
<joey> baby if all of the cells that you had as </joey>
<joey> a baby are now non-existent in your body </joey>
<joey> because they've been replaced with newer </joey>
<connor> cells you're not the same person as </connor>
<joey> Hostess right huh it's all mitosis what </joey>
<joey> what's mitosis cells duplicate okay oh </joey>
<joey> okay yeah but they're duplicating </joey>
<joey> okay but it's my [ __ ] fault but I'm </joey>
<connor> introducing McDonald's to the mix that </connor>
<joey> would have been fine if I gave them what </joey>
<joey> they wanted but no I had to bring a Big </joey>
<joey> Mac and many milk shakes and then the </joey>
<garnt> cells started [ __ ] duplicating like </garnt>
<joey> crazy so [ __ ] dying </joey>
<garnt> do you know I'll find [ __ ] shitty and </garnt>
<connor> dumb what like you know this argument if </connor>
<connor> you tell me something dumb I'm gonna </connor>
<connor> kill you no it's just like it's just </connor>
<connor> like cool like McDonald's all this fast </connor>
<garnt> food [ __ ] pizza bad for you why is your </garnt>
<joey> body making them taste good why no no I </joey>
<connor> think that's how it is </connor>
<joey> the argument of all the healthy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> tastes gross and all the bad [ __ ] for </joey>
<joey> you tastes good yes that's that is if </joey>
<joey> that isn't the biggest troll your brain </joey>
<garnt> has played on you bro like I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what it is I thought Evolution was meant </garnt>
<garnt> to like help you you know why why have </garnt>
<joey> we not evolved to a point where at least </joey>
<garnt> healthy foods had like tasted a bit </garnt>
<joey> better because humans are privilege this </joey>
<connor> isn't even be a question right yeah if </connor>
<garnt> we were to evolve as say a species and </garnt>
<connor> you know how we're like oh yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> rats they love [ __ ] peanut butter </connor>
<garnt> they love it they love it right why do </garnt>
<joey> we not all like the same things </joey>
<garnt> what do you mean why do we not all enjoy </garnt>
<connor> the same Foods </connor>
<garnt> it's blunt </garnt>
<joey> I'm just saying I'm just I'm just saying </joey>
<connor> what you're asking is for us to be </connor>
<connor> programmed the same where we just think </connor>
<connor> that every like oh carrots are top 10 </connor>
<connor> delicious uh food everyone on Earth </connor>
<joey> agrees okay but here's the question </joey>
<joey> right why is it that humans turned out </joey>
<connor> that way but animals you know you know </connor>
<connor> God didn't like this whatever mystical </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] made the Earth didn't make pizza we </connor>
<connor> did that yeah we came up with that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> right if you were like uh this weed [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> this uh cheese stuff that we figured out </connor>
<connor> how to make we should start combining </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] we did that that's not that they </connor>
<connor> didn't well I think when Evolution </connor>
<connor> happened they didn't know that the Big </connor>
<joey> Mac super Royale was gonna exist </joey>
<joey> they weren't prepared that's on us the </joey>
<garnt> one we threw that into them one thing </garnt>
<joey> that can be Darwin a [ __ ] big mac oh </joey>
<joey> my God </joey>
<joey> also another question another [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> Evolution has led us to the Big Mac </joey>
<connor> sauce we you we keep saying this </connor>
<connor> Evolution thing like every evolution is </connor>
<joey> good not every evolution is good what's </joey>
<joey> a bad Evolution trait that we got think </joey>
<connor> of like half the [ __ ] birds that died </connor>
<connor> how do you die out as a bird you gotta </connor>
<connor> be really [ __ ] trolling to die out as </connor>
<joey> a bird that's the whole point of </joey>
<connor> evolution Connor so it's a vital of the </connor>
<connor> finish what are you talking about so the </connor>
<connor> point is you're implying that every </connor>
<connor> single evolution is a good Evolution not </connor>
<connor> true not every evolution it turns out to </connor>
<connor> be as beneficial as others that's why </connor>
<connor> only the best one keeps going right </connor>
<connor> maybe we are the humans that are not </connor>
<connor> doing good but we just feel how to </connor>
<connor> survive anyway but we're evolving into </connor>
<connor> shitty traits but we're just really good </connor>
<connor> at [ __ ] slapping a massive Band-Aid </connor>
<connor> on it think about it right yeah I mean </connor>
<garnt> that's that's a genuine argument yeah </garnt>
<connor> implying that every evolution is good </connor>
<connor> not every single level </connor>
<garnt> the way you're using the word no no no </garnt>
<garnt> evolution is the whole point of </garnt>
<joey> evolution is survival of the fittest if </joey>
<connor> if we we broke the game if we evolved </connor>
<garnt> we [ __ ] it up what I'm trying to say </garnt>
<garnt> is every evolution should be a good </garnt>
<joey> Evolution because if it isn't then we </joey>
<joey> would die off but yes I believe we have </joey>
<joey> gotten too smart and we have broken the </joey>
<joey> Evolution game okay what if for example </joey>
<connor> what if we are just we're probably just </connor>
<connor> another like Pawn in this game right </connor>
<connor> like the next evolution of humanity is </connor>
<joey> might be the newer version and this </joey>
<joey> version of us might be the ones that die </joey>
<joey> out in a couple thousand years who the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] no here's the thing right yeah if </connor>
<connor> we truly lived in a [ __ ] Evolution </connor>
<connor> let's do it right yeah people who had </connor>
<connor> like incurable diseases would would die </connor>
<connor> out yes right but we don't let that </connor>
<connor> happen because we're not [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> monsters we're trying to help people </garnt>
<connor> exactly we have evolved I guess empathy </connor>
<joey> what's the most powerful trait a heart </joey>
<connor> a soul Evolution doesn't care about </connor>
<joey> about your feelings well then we we </joey>
<joey> evolved evolution is just the epitome of </joey>
<connor> get good so [ __ ] your feelings the first </connor>
<joey> humans yeah yeah whatever the [ __ ] they </joey>
<joey> were yeah false yeah we even cared about </joey>
<joey> other weaker members of the the group in </joey>
<joey> evolution we don't know why why did we </joey>
<joey> evolve to be like this I don't [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> know it's not like and realistically </connor>
<connor> it's not a a trait that helps us to </connor>
<joey> survive in any way but but </joey>
<joey> imagine that humans don't you're </joey>
<joey> suggesting then that only humans are </joey>
<joey> creatures that are able to feel empathy </joey>
<garnt> no that's not true why do any creatures </garnt>
<joey> develop it I mean it could be beneficial </joey>
<joey> I mean because it's beneficial to the </joey>
<garnt> past if you have like a herd kind of </garnt>
<joey> like culture then if they didn't exist </joey>
<connor> in animals packs wouldn't exist but we </connor>
<connor> like we've gotten to the point where </connor>
<connor> we're like we're not concerned about the </connor>
<connor> next evolution of human beings we're </connor>
<joey> just trying to [ __ ] get everyone to </joey>
<joey> get alive well the thing is we don't </joey>
<joey> we're not concerned about it because we </joey>
<joey> haven't been around long enough to feel </joey>
<joey> that change yeah right like like birds </joey>
<connor> for example have been around for </connor>
<joey> literally millions of years so obviously </joey>
<joey> they felt that change humans have only </joey>
<connor> been around for like what a couple </connor>
<connor> thousands but we see we see uh changes </connor>
<connor> in every like generation of people you </connor>
<joey> know like of course like you know today </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] that we did yeah us today are </joey>
<connor> nothing like humans a thousand years ago </connor>
<connor> yeah no I I I I I that's Evolution </connor>
<garnt> already and that there are some right </garnt>
<connor> taller yeah we're taller yes we're more </connor>
<garnt> Alpha yeah </garnt>
<connor> John Wick to get our [ __ ] juice you </connor>
<garnt> know what I mean like we had to make </garnt>
<garnt> that [ __ ] up </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean there are like there were </garnt>
<garnt> like habits within us that you know that </garnt>
<garnt> we don't understand yeah and we still </garnt>
<garnt> have and I've you know people think it's </garnt>
<garnt> due to Evolution like I don't know why </garnt>
<garnt> people like you see someone yawning and </garnt>
<connor> you feel like the need to yawn </connor>
<connor> you're like talking Evolution like </connor>
<garnt> ayon you yawn no that's true </garnt>
<joey> tell me tell me why that happens can we </joey>
<joey> see someone yawns it sends from your </joey>
<joey> eyes it sends a signal to your brain </joey>
<joey> where your brain says you're next okay </joey>
<connor> oh this might be the most scientifically </connor>
<joey> inaccurate traffic of all time but [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it let's roll </joey>
<joey> this isn't science this is shower </joey>
<connor> thoughts yeah right so humans right </connor>
<connor> great great awesome so I like them our </connor>
<garnt> priority is to make as many of us as </garnt>
<garnt> possible yeah if you think about the </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the survival Instinct of us right </garnt>
<garnt> Japan's sweating right now yeah but why </garnt>
<connor> why why do like none of us give a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> about doing it what you </joey>
<connor> that doesn't even have to do with the </connor>
<joey> fact </joey>
<joey> it's not even about that it's like every </joey>
<joey> human I think most humans on planet </joey>
<joey> Earth can agree that I think </joey>
<joey> subconsciously we're all thinking right </joey>
<joey> now [ __ ] planet's dying we have to save </joey>
<joey> the planet you ask someone how do we do </joey>
<joey> it everyone's like </joey>
<joey> I'm [ __ ] know we know how to do it </joey>
<connor> but the people in charge on [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> doing it yeah exactly see lack of </garnt>
<garnt> empathy </garnt>
<garnt> I mean it's it's lack of like it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a bad trait of the human mind I guess if </garnt>
<garnt> we're going into this place where we </garnt>
<garnt> can't really conceptualize a problem </garnt>
<garnt> this vast right we're only able to </garnt>
<garnt> conceptualize literally either stories </garnt>
<garnt> we hear about or most of us our </garnt>
<garnt> immediate problems and the immediate </garnt>
<joey> issues that's the real shower thought </joey>
<joey> did we evolve to develop empathy or did </joey>
<joey> we evolve further where we think we have </joey>
<connor> empathy </connor>
<joey> no no that's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> do we actually have empathy did we just </joey>
<joey> build the knowledge where we think that </joey>
<joey> empathy is a healthy social construct do </joey>
<joey> you think because let's be real if like </joey>
<joey> why do you think for example every </joey>
<joey> zombie apocalypse film that happens </joey>
<joey> right immediately it's like oh the the </joey>
<joey> monsters want the zombies the monsters </joey>
<joey> were within we're the real monsters all </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<connor> because at the end of the day when it </connor>
<connor> comes to actual survival right like </connor>
<garnt> think of every apocalyptic movie you </garnt>
<garnt> don't see people being [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> empathetic they're the ones that die </garnt>
<joey> first yeah that's a zombie movie though </joey>
<garnt> okay yeah but say for example okay if </garnt>
<connor> it's like okay here's where it's all </connor>
<joey> came from right yeah right is it you </joey>
<connor> know human beings have have the natural </connor>
<connor> um want to be accepted in their like </connor>
<connor> group yeah that's what we've just </connor>
<connor> evolved to do yes empathy is just a </connor>
<joey> branch of that it just came from that </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's just a social </joey>
<joey> construct yeah but and it just boils </joey>
<connor> down to the need that we want for the </connor>
<connor> government we just want to fit in </connor>
<garnt> do you think we've gone too smart maybe </garnt>
<connor> because here's the thing you know we're </connor>
<connor> done look at what we're [ __ ] doing to </connor>
<garnt> the planet we're clearly dumb as [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> but the thing is the thing is we got </garnt>
<garnt> smart enough to [ __ ] it up but not smart </garnt>
<garnt> enough to figure out how to fix it yeah </garnt>
<joey> as a group right I think any creature </joey>
<joey> that develops the science of thinking </joey>
<joey> about science we haven't gone too far of </joey>
<joey> making stuff yeah and they're not </joey>
<connor> thinking about how it's going to work </connor>
<garnt> but also and then just implementing it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but also like for example you you </garnt>
<garnt> talked about you know the you know it </garnt>
<garnt> should be </garnt>
<garnt> um human nature to self-preserve you </garnt>
<garnt> know to make more of us to preserve the </garnt>
<garnt> human race but we've gotten so smart </garnt>
<garnt> that in some places of the human race </garnt>
<garnt> we've gone smart enough to just not make </garnt>
<garnt> that decision yeah you know which which </garnt>
<joey> completely we've gone to the idea now </joey>
<connor> that it's not a natural instinct Joe </connor>
<garnt> Rogan conversation </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't even had any DMT I I wanna I </garnt>
<joey> wanna shoot some [ __ ] horse </joey>
<connor> tranquilizer or something is that what </connor>
<joey> you do is that what you're doing you're </joey>
<joey> all holding imaginary blocks right now </joey>
<garnt> everyone will all be holding up everyone </garnt>
<connor> must think we'd be like high as [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> if I was like 90 years old and had </connor>
<connor> classes you guys would just think I'm </connor>
<garnt> the expert like I'd be honest so you </garnt>
<joey> gotta talk well that's why he's got the </joey>
<connor> glass I wouldn't even plan for this [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> I just happened to bring glasses yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] it's I don't I don't know I </connor>
<garnt> feel like these are damaged [ __ ] we are </garnt>
<joey> we are dumb no we are soda we've </joey>
<joey> developed really specific parts of our </joey>
<joey> brain to think that we're smarter but in </joey>
<garnt> reality we're still [ __ ] dumb in a </garnt>
<joey> lot of that actual like apes we're still </joey>
<garnt> Apes we're just monkeys in shoes yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> we're Apes floating on a rock like </garnt>
<joey> flying through space but we've been </joey>
<joey> we've but we're smart enough to know </joey>
<garnt> that we're smart we're smart enough to </garnt>
<garnt> develop things that I could exactly like </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] wipe us off the face of the </joey>
<joey> Earth We're smart enough we're not only </joey>
<joey> smart enough to know that but we're also </joey>
<joey> smart enough to not give a [ __ ] isn't </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] up isn't that [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> we're fully aware that we are just a </joey>
<joey> tiny think of dust in space and with but </joey>
<joey> and yet we are still smart enough to be </joey>
<joey> like yeah yeah but [ __ ] whatever you </joey>
<garnt> know I I I'm I want to go to work this </garnt>
<garnt> is one of the weirdest [ __ ] episodes </garnt>
<garnt> of trash days I think we've ever [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> filmed yo trash taste philosophists </garnt>
<garnt> Where You Are </garnt>
<joey> isn't but that's another thing right </joey>
<connor> it's like I think the the first time </connor>
<connor> that we saw like actual human evolution </connor>
<connor> was when Aristotle was just like </connor>
<connor> philosophy is a thing now yeah right </connor>
<connor> yeah because it's before because I wanna </connor>
<joey> because I always found that weird </joey>
<joey> that like I can't like has it did it </joey>
<joey> really take that long for Humanity for </joey>
<joey> someone to be like </joey>
<joey> I'm thinking about it okay so so why </joey>
<joey> okay okay okay okay </joey>
<joey> it's like one day someone was like I'm </joey>
<joey> thinking about something </joey>
<connor> no why no this is so short-sighted to </connor>
<connor> think that there's there's always been </connor>
<connor> people who have thought about [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> before that yeah we were really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bad we were like should we keep a record </connor>
<connor> of stuff no and then Who's Gonna Keep </connor>
<connor> the records </connor>
<connor> we were having too many wars we were </connor>
<connor> killing each other all the time and </connor>
<connor> Woody when you take over a place are you </connor>
<connor> gonna keep their [ __ ] thoughts on a </connor>
<connor> piece of paper [ __ ] that [ __ ] I'm </connor>
<connor> burning that [ __ ] [ __ ] down he </connor>
<connor> was dumb as [ __ ] I killed him right I </connor>
<connor> don't want to know what he thought I </connor>
<connor> wanted these people thought so we were </connor>
<connor> just too busy trying to get by no and </connor>
<connor> this is not what we're doing today </connor>
<connor> Aristotle we're just doing that's why no </connor>
<connor> one cares about climate chains because </connor>
<connor> we're like they're damn gas prices are </connor>
<connor> making my survival harder it's all a </connor>
<connor> full circle </connor>
<connor> we all keep [ __ ] ourselves and the </connor>
<connor> people in charge keep [ __ ] us that's </connor>
<garnt> what I'm saying I just love how you make </garnt>
<garnt> it sound like Aristotle invented </garnt>
<joey> thinking </joey>
<joey> I did not he invented the he invented </joey>
<connor> the science of culture no he's the only </connor>
<connor> one that we remember and that we </connor>
<connor> bothered to keep his [ __ ] books </connor>
<connor> around everyone else we wiped from do </connor>
<connor> you know how many like civilizations </connor>
<connor> that Britain probably [ __ ] raided and </connor>
<joey> just destroyed all their records well </joey>
<joey> then you're suggesting that before </joey>
<connor> Aristotle there was no writing no there </connor>
<connor> was but we just didn't keep it right we </connor>
<connor> burned it or got rid of it or let it go </connor>
<joey> to waste but then wouldn't you think </joey>
<joey> that if someone before Aristotle had </joey>
<garnt> come up with the idea of things </garnt>
<connor> okay okay so make um let's make </connor>
<garnt> something up I'm not sure let's do it </garnt>
<connor> let's do a little let's do a little </connor>
<connor> thing uh let's say you're the kingdom of </connor>
<joey> uh what's your kingdom called uh Deez </joey>
<connor> Nuts the kingdom of Deez Nuts right you </connor>
<joey> have uh what's your philosopher called </joey>
<joey> uh [ __ ] Tits McGee so Tits McGee is </joey>
<joey> made basically like these amazing books </joey>
<joey> books that the Deez Nuts Empire just </joey>
<joey> reveres yes well turns out they spent a </joey>
<joey> little too much time thinking and not </joey>
<joey> raising their army and Chad gone over </joey>
<joey> here comes and destroys the kingdom of </joey>
<joey> these nuts right and he thinks that your </joey>
<joey> race is just inferior because you </joey>
<joey> couldn't beat him in battle so let's </joey>
<joey> destroy all your word stuff because we </joey>
<joey> don't care about what you say and we'll </joey>
<joey> take the fun little Bridges you built </joey>
<joey> and the little toys you built okay then </joey>
<connor> here's the thinking we don't want that </connor>
<joey> so we destroyed that because we're gonna </joey>
<connor> our own guys are smarter because we won </connor>
<connor> if you guys were smart they would have </connor>
<joey> thought about it okay then if that's the </joey>
<joey> case then why did we keep the books from </joey>
<connor> the Greeks </connor>
<connor> well I mean it was it was closer to our </connor>
<connor> time period where preservation of </connor>
<connor> information mattered more right and </connor>
<connor> culture started mattering more right </connor>
<connor> stuff like that started to become more </connor>
<joey> yeah but it's not like it's not like </joey>
<joey> when the Greece popped off suddenly </joey>
<connor> we're all like don't burn the books </connor>
<joey> everyone no no no no but it's like it's </joey>
<connor> like it was a gradual thing I mean </connor>
<connor> there's a number of factors to why that </connor>
<connor> period and other periods like the Roman </connor>
<connor> stuff is so well documented right and </connor>
<connor> it's because a lot of the times as well </connor>
<connor> when and when these places would get </connor>
<connor> taken over other the other places taking </connor>
<connor> them over or whenever the empire fell or </connor>
<connor> whatever they might also have a respect </connor>
<connor> for what they've the stuff that they've </connor>
<joey> also shared or come up with right no I </joey>
<garnt> get that but like if I wasn't specific </garnt>
<garnt> people I feel like this is wrong oh no </garnt>
<connor> it's absolutely wrong I have no </connor>
<joey> information on this this is just like </joey>
<connor> this is what I'm imagining for like a </connor>
<connor> thousand of years we were terrible at </connor>
<garnt> keeping any documents about anything </garnt>
<garnt> right no but I believe like </garnt>
<connor> I don't believe Aristotle I don't even </connor>
<connor> know if he was technically there's no </connor>
<connor> idea he was the first I don't believe he </connor>
<connor> was the first one I believe he might </connor>
<connor> have been the first one to actually put </connor>
<connor> a name to it he was the only one smart </connor>
<joey> enough to be like I'm thinking really </joey>
<joey> hard I should probably make I should </joey>
<joey> probably put this under a word so </joey>
<garnt> everyone can know what I'm doing right </garnt>
<joey> now well they're just thinking yeah </joey>
<joey> there's other you know other sects of </joey>
<joey> life that are very closely tied he's </joey>
<joey> just those he's the world's first five </joey>
<joey> what religion is just philosophy just in </joey>
<connor> a nice package in like a DLC like think </connor>
<connor> about it like the philosophy of like </connor>
<connor> it's like a religion and that whole </connor>
<connor> thing is it's like a it's like a whole </connor>
<connor> package I mean that's a whole lot okay </connor>
<garnt> you know what I mean yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's just a way of life in a way of </garnt>
<garnt> agreeing to how you think it is like so </garnt>
<connor> saying that he's the first one is just </connor>
<joey> completely wrong but but </joey>
<joey> then right taking that taking that logic </joey>
<joey> of like you know uh say for example when </joey>
<joey> The Barbarians took over the Romans </joey>
<joey> right why was it then that the all the </joey>
<joey> Roman stuff is so much more well </joey>
<joey> preserved than say all the stuff before </joey>
<joey> it even though the barbarians probably </joey>
<connor> didn't give a [ __ ] about the one I'm not </connor>
<connor> a historian so I can't tell you that </connor>
<joey> yeah historians please let us know </joey>
<connor> because I always wondered that I'm sure </connor>
<joey> there's because you know what was the </joey>
<joey> turning point where people were like </joey>
<joey> maybe we should start respecting other </joey>
<joey> cultures to the point where we preserve </joey>
<garnt> their stuff I think I think it goes </garnt>
<garnt> beyond that it's like you you get to a </garnt>
<garnt> point in society where you realize oh </garnt>
<garnt> being smart about sorry being powerful </garnt>
<garnt> having a powerful Army that maybe there </garnt>
<garnt> may be more to life than just taking </garnt>
<garnt> over people you know maybe there may be </garnt>
<garnt> more to life otherwise half the things </garnt>
<garnt> in society wouldn't matter right exactly </garnt>
<joey> but what was the Turning Point that's </joey>
<garnt> what I want to know what was the Turning </garnt>
<garnt> Point yeah what was the turning point </garnt>
<garnt> between let's burn everything and </garnt>
<connor> everyone that they've ever loved so that </connor>
<connor> we can pretend it never existed no no no </connor>
<connor> there's always been empathy right it </connor>
<connor> just you know at different times in the </connor>
<connor> Life in history people value different </connor>
<connor> things right at one point they valued </connor>
<connor> you know they maybe they realized oh we </connor>
<connor> could also sell this stuff oh we could </connor>
<connor> do stuff with this instead of just </connor>
<connor> destroying it all and pillaging and all </connor>
<joey> that stuff yes yes yes of course of </joey>
<garnt> course </garnt>
<garnt> yes it's just yeah sure I mean like if </garnt>
<connor> like I don't think we should </connor>
<garnt> discredit not even discredit but play </garnt>
<connor> Down how important philosophy very much </connor>
<connor> philosophy has come to like shape just </connor>
<connor> how we how we live and everything like </connor>
<connor> that because you're looking like you </connor>
<connor> look at like the such different </connor>
<connor> mentalities and way of thinking between </connor>
<connor> let's say like the west and like the </connor>
<garnt> East you know and you see a lot of a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of people who are in Asia was very much </garnt>
<garnt> um their mentality is very much based </garnt>
<garnt> from that Chinese philosopher who I </garnt>
<joey> forget the name of now each one </joey>
<joey> Confucius Confucius Confucius right that </joey>
<joey> is it's just like it's gone so far back </joey>
<garnt> that it's literally steeped in society </garnt>
<connor> and like yeah the the mentality </connor>
<garnt> that's also another problem is that yeah </garnt>
<joey> Socrates yeah sorry I got that </joey>
<joey> completely wrong place or every </joey>
<connor> Aristotle </connor>
<joey> yeah sorry I'm not educated enough to </joey>
<connor> know who yes </connor>
<joey> none of us are educated by the way sorry </joey>
<joey> it's Socrates so also as well another </joey>
<connor> thing has to be taking into account is </connor>
<connor> that our history and our understanding </connor>
<connor> of it is very English Central </connor>
<connor> centralized yes we don't know </connor>
<joey> um we're not we don't educate about like </joey>
<joey> Asian history or African history as much </joey>
<joey> as we should so our view of the world </joey>
<joey> inherently as well already is already </joey>
<joey> biased as [ __ ] well we're like yeah the </joey>
<joey> Greeks man there's [ __ ] guys it's </joey>
<joey> another the dudes who they know what </joey>
<joey> they're talking that [ __ ] out oh there's </joey>
<connor> other people uh trying to [ __ ] them I </connor>
<connor> don't know what's going on you know what </connor>
<connor> I mean </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> but you know it's like a it's a very </connor>
<connor> close proximity and it's a history that </connor>
<joey> a lot of people have subscribed to for a </joey>
<joey> lot of time so we're biased as [ __ ] yes </joey>
<joey> course this is hard as [ __ ] because just </joey>
<connor> this is like too much stuff it's just </connor>
<joey> too much for any one person to keep </joey>
<connor> track of everything and have a good </connor>
<connor> globally minded view on everything so </connor>
<joey> yeah that's why we haven't evolved far </joey>
<connor> enough for that yes no we're never going </connor>
<connor> to we're not brain is already running in </connor>
<garnt> like 110 we might you never know what do </garnt>
<garnt> you mean again we might just be the </garnt>
<joey> Neanderthal in the chain of humans we </joey>
<garnt> don't know that Japan has barely figured </garnt>
<connor> out web design I'm not getting I am not </connor>
<joey> holding up any hopes for our [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> brain capacity to evolve I mean yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's gonna take millions of years </garnt>
<joey> and I think we'll we're going to invent </joey>
<connor> something that I can think better than </connor>
<joey> nothing I mean that's computers we've </joey>
<garnt> already invented something that can </garnt>
<connor> think better than that that's all right </connor>
<connor> we're gonna be owned by Jeff Bezos uh </connor>
<joey> that's the point of this </joey>
<joey> Jeff Bezos is going to be like Angeles </joey>
<joey> in the sky it's like a big face that </joey>
<connor> just overlooks the Earth yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> yeah I mean it's complicated yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> of course that's the episode it's </joey>
<joey> complicated but that's why I like these </joey>
<connor> kinds of discussions because it's just </connor>
<connor> like a never-ending like list of what </connor>
<joey> ifs that let's be real it's like no </joey>
<connor> one's ever gonna [ __ ] know the answer </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like it's like three guys </connor>
<connor> in an old person home trying to remember </connor>
<connor> what they all had for breakfast and none </connor>
<connor> of them actually no we're just </connor>
<garnt> theorizing </garnt>
<connor> four days ago so [ __ ] you it don't you </connor>
<joey> know like I feel like uh you didn't even </joey>
<connor> come into this all her focus on four </connor>
<connor> days ago what do you mean you missed out </connor>
<connor> you weren't even here four days ago </connor>
<joey> holy [ __ ] I have a lot of strong </joey>
<garnt> opinions for being wrong </garnt>
<garnt> what do you mean </garnt>
<joey> this many episodes to figure that out </joey>
<connor> I'm just saying I'm fully aware of that </connor>
<joey> I I know his brain's developed enough to </joey>
<garnt> tell us at least at least you </garnt>
<connor> acknowledge that at least if you tell me </connor>
<connor> some facts I'll believe you yeah </connor>
<connor> if you give me some information you're </connor>
<connor> like this is what some dude said online </connor>
<garnt> who's very knowledgeable I'm like all </garnt>
<garnt> right right I'll just trust the sauce </garnt>
<connor> sometimes sometimes you just like this </connor>
<connor> is the problem though is that when when </connor>
<joey> you're like do you believe Socrates </joey>
<joey> invented velocity or no he didn't invent </joey>
<connor> philosophy it literally says he invented </connor>
<joey> philosophy before Socrates there was no </joey>
<joey> concept of philosophy that we believe </joey>
<garnt> that we know of but like but like I </garnt>
<connor> don't I don't think that he invented </connor>
<connor> like documented and organized it made it </connor>
<garnt> appealing yes yes I agree I don't think </garnt>
<garnt> Socrates was the first person to let's </garnt>
<joey> say think really hard he had tried a </joey>
<connor> shape don't [ __ ] come at me and tell </connor>
<connor> me that no nobody else thought about </connor>
<garnt> some of the stuff was he like was he the </garnt>
<garnt> first person to let's say make it </garnt>
<joey> marketable </joey>
<joey> yes make it fashionable </joey>
<joey> it did he kind of did well people people </joey>
<connor> would come what a simple trick people </connor>
<connor> would come to listen to Socrates talk </connor>
<connor> yes right this is this is no different </connor>
<connor> than [ __ ] fortune tellers back in the </connor>
<connor> day this is like another branch of just </connor>
<joey> talking talking [ __ ] and trying to make </joey>
<joey> people believe it but this one just </joey>
<joey> happened to be actually saying </joey>
<connor> no no but like it's in my mind it's like </connor>
<connor> the same realm of stuff of where it </connor>
<connor> began from right it's like the business </connor>
<connor> of trying to to talk to people and </connor>
<connor> preach stuff for money and and trying to </connor>
<connor> do that yes yes well like it's like I </connor>
<connor> guess what we do I guess we're getting </connor>
<joey> into it really philosophical discussion </joey>
<garnt> of how do you even Define philosophy oh </garnt>
<joey> God we're doing it again </joey>
<joey> right now we have things how do you </joey>
<joey> define we are thinking about this is </joey>
<connor> like what we have we support so we talk </connor>
<connor> about sports this time we said that you </connor>
<connor> know who invented uh no you didn't </connor>
<connor> invent football you maybe made it like </connor>
<connor> after like an official sport with rules </connor>
<connor> and and a league and stuff like yeah you </connor>
<connor> may be that country did that but like if </connor>
<connor> you've been [ __ ] kicking a ball </connor>
<connor> around you know what I mean you're the </connor>
<connor> first person to kick something around </connor>
<joey> yeah and play a game with it no but </joey>
<joey> that's a little bit different because </joey>
<joey> that's more like instinctual right like </joey>
<connor> philosophy is inherently we are </connor>
<connor> instinctively thinking like no yes </connor>
<joey> humans are but what I'm saying is </joey>
<joey> animals aren't like a fish isn't saying </joey>
<joey> that well no but that's what I'm saying </joey>
<joey> it's like there has to be like a </joey>
<connor> beginning right wait so you're okay </connor>
<connor> hello I think this is a giantly I'm </connor>
<joey> trying to make an account and I think </joey>
<joey> he's saying this as well other people </joey>
<connor> before him probably thought about things </connor>
<joey> I'm not I'm not arguing about lizards </joey>
<connor> thought about it dude </connor>
<joey> I'm not saying that I'm not saying that </joey>
<joey> I'm saying like it's interesting how </joey>
<joey> like inherently philosophy is a human </joey>
<connor> construct because we have free time yeah </connor>
<connor> right if lizards have no we're three </connor>
<garnt> times </garnt>
<garnt> we're just two no we are we are I mean </garnt>
<connor> you look at dolphins not all of us not </connor>
<connor> all of you I've seen some of the </connor>
<connor> comments </connor>
<joey> what I'm saying is that like you know a </joey>
<joey> shark isn't swimming around in the ocean </joey>
<joey> being like oh man that fish look </joey>
<connor> delicious but why but what about </connor>
<garnt> dolphins though what about dolphins </garnt>
<connor> because dolphins are [ __ ] obsession </connor>
<connor> with dolphins why why because they're </connor>
<connor> smart as [ __ ] they're smart as [ __ ] that </connor>
<connor> they do things on that aren't </connor>
<connor> unnecessary because they are [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> awful creatures no no like I believe </connor>
<joey> that please fact check this but I </joey>
<joey> believe like dolphins are like one of </joey>
<connor> the only other creatures that kill </connor>
<garnt> purely for pleasure no I know I know for </garnt>
<connor> a fact </connor>
<connor> oons are the only creatures on the </connor>
<joey> planet who have sex purely for pleasure </joey>
<garnt> and why wouldn't they honestly right </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] evolve man that was some good </garnt>
<joey> Evolution hell yeah man </joey>
<joey> I wanna I wanna imagine the first </joey>
<connor> dolphin that was just like I Wanna [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> so not for babies though I I wanted to </connor>
<connor> see if because I'm reading about one </connor>
<connor> time the Apparently like dolphins are </connor>
<connor> like very aggressive sexually gangs of </connor>
<connor> two or three male bottlenose dolphins </connor>
<connor> isolate a single female from the Pod and </connor>
<connor> forcibly mate with her sometimes for </connor>
<connor> weeks at a time </connor>
<connor> nice </connor>
<connor> to keep her in line they make aggressive </connor>
<connor> noises threatening movements and even </connor>
<joey> smack her around with their tails wow </joey>
<joey> that sounds awful and if she tries to </joey>
<connor> swim away they chase her down </connor>
<garnt> maybe evolution is not a good thing it's </garnt>
<joey> my favorite shindoell dojo man </joey>
<joey> like you know dolphins not every </joey>
<joey> evolution kill Harbor's babies in </joey>
<joey> Scotland yeah Jesus Christ yeah dolphins </joey>
<connor> need to chill yeah </connor>
<garnt> obsession with dolphins that's that's </garnt>
<joey> how you know things have gotten too </joey>
<joey> smart but monkeys do that too right like </joey>
<garnt> yeah but you know come on yo [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> Dolphins but don't don't let's not </garnt>
<connor> slander monkey here that's right monkey </connor>
<connor> come on they're just they are without </connor>
<joey> rules come on at least dolphins have the </joey>
<joey> decency to not throw [ __ ] at each other </joey>
<connor> uh bro I would rather you throw [ __ ] at </connor>
<joey> me than beat up my childhood death but </joey>
<joey> monkeys do that anymore they don't yes </joey>
<connor> they don't no my monkey should never do </connor>
<joey> that I guarantee there's been instances </joey>
<joey> where a monkey has just gotten fed up </joey>
<joey> with another one's child and was just </joey>
<garnt> like imma kill that thing </garnt>
<garnt> guarantees is it true Connor is it </garnt>
<connor> guaranteed show okay hold up guarantee I </connor>
<garnt> want to say this is I want to preface </garnt>
<garnt> this is no different no different to us </garnt>
<connor> they only kill other like maybe the same </connor>
<connor> species but like they kill another </connor>
<connor> family's kids to stop them from [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> breeding we did that yeah but the other </garnt>
<garnt> way Connor go get your man </garnt>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> monkeys are engaged in warfare that's no </connor>
<connor> different from what we do they're just </connor>
<connor> these dolphins are just killing babies </connor>
<garnt> for fun no reason </garnt>
<garnt> well I mean they're both [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> on the record you'll see you're saying </joey>
<joey> oh yeah because it's for Warfare they're </joey>
<joey> doing a service </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> but we don't we don't like yeah we don't </connor>
<joey> have a kill babies for fun event </joey>
<joey> well no because we have a thing called a </joey>
<garnt> legal system one of his dolphins are </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah I agree why do we go </joey>
<connor> dolphin watching uh because </connor>
<connor> again it's what we came back to with the </connor>
<connor> animal survival thing it's all branding </connor>
<connor> yeah dolphins are branded himself as </connor>
<joey> cute and they're [ __ ] monsters </joey>
<joey> but like how come no one goes like </joey>
<joey> monkey watching because monkeys fight </joey>
<joey> back </joey>
<joey> the Dolphins too </joey>
<connor> also no infectious monkeys because we </connor>
<connor> know they're one step away from us </connor>
<garnt> they're gonna [ __ ] us out because like </garnt>
<garnt> with with an eight you can see how </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] built they are bro like you know </garnt>
<joey> that thinking [ __ ] have you been close </joey>
<garnt> to a dolphin before I know they can swim </garnt>
<joey> with dogs I know it can [ __ ] you up </joey>
<joey> right they can [ __ ] you up yeah oh </joey>
<connor> they're terrifying not as consistently </connor>
<garnt> as monkeys </garnt>
<garnt> but also you'd have to like like apes </garnt>
<garnt> are like land mammals you know we have </garnt>
<garnt> to like go in their Turf together </garnt>
<connor> we should give them the pool yeah what </connor>
<garnt> are they gonna do I'm gonna pull the </garnt>
<garnt> plug out yeah well they're gonna do like </garnt>
<garnt> come up here and like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> the moment Dolphins evolve where they </joey>
<joey> can just come up on land and start </joey>
<joey> smoking the [ __ ] out of you is when we </joey>
<garnt> stop [ __ ] with dolphins when when's </garnt>
<garnt> the dolphin boxing event when's that </garnt>
<garnt> gonna be when we're gonna put dolphins </garnt>
<connor> in the ring right we could do that with </connor>
<connor> other animals do that with other animals </connor>

<connor> description down below back to the </connor>
<garnt> episode get yourself a JoJo SI right let </garnt>
<connor> me let me tell you how much humans have </connor>
<connor> broken the Evolution game right because </connor>
<connor> animals now they're that's a legit </connor>
<garnt> survival tactic is putting all of your </garnt>
<garnt> points into cuteness right that's like a </garnt>
<connor> legit survival tactic now we're forcing </connor>
<connor> them to put their points in cute yeah </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] your son's dead yeah I can make </connor>
<connor> a cute version of you or you're not </connor>
<joey> breathing everything why are toy poodle </joey>
<garnt> exists yeah could you imagine that thing </garnt>
<garnt> in the heart between the Wilderness </garnt>
<garnt> we're terrible but yeah because they </garnt>
<garnt> have to like they've got uh you know </garnt>
<connor> Socrates came along and told us how to </connor>
<connor> think sovereign </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's just like you know we talked </garnt>
<garnt> about how [ __ ] dumbass [ __ ] koalas </garnt>
<garnt> are yeah you know [ __ ] pandas will do </garnt>
<garnt> everything they can to not [ __ ] make </garnt>
<garnt> babies they want to be extinct they </garnt>
<garnt> literally want to be extinct and humans </garnt>
<garnt> are like no you're not allowed to become </garnt>
<garnt> extinct we were too cute you know it's </garnt>
<connor> like the Emos of the [ __ ] Animal </connor>
<connor> Kingdom I I think it's like I don't want </connor>
<connor> to be here I think there's a lot of it </connor>
<joey> does it's like our fault but they're </joey>
<joey> they're going extinct right oh yeah it's </joey>
<joey> because we just down all their [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> homes I think so I think if pandas tore </connor>
<connor> our homes down yeah I wanted to die I </connor>
<connor> think I think I'd I'd be I wouldn't want </connor>
<joey> to breed either they just they destroyed </joey>
<joey> it I think a panda's gonna come with me </joey>
<connor> like no it's okay don't worry about it </connor>
<connor> we'll take care of you </connor>
<connor> and then we have the audacity to show </connor>
<connor> them Panda porn yeah what is this some </connor>
<connor> Black Mirror [ __ ] what we shout like </connor>
<joey> we are Overlord and they started showing </joey>
<joey> us porn and it's kind of [ __ ] up if </joey>
<joey> you think about it that's like if </joey>
<joey> someone like broke into your home and </joey>
<joey> like ransacked your [ __ ] and then you </joey>
<joey> lost everything and you're like well I </joey>
<joey> guess I I don't want to be here anymore </joey>
<joey> and that same robber came back and was </joey>
<joey> just like oh don't no it's fine </joey>
<joey> yeah we'll buy some new furniture don't </joey>
<joey> worry </joey>
<joey> I thought that's basically what we're </joey>
<connor> doing I guess the argument would be that </connor>
<connor> you know uh the Panda's capacity to </connor>
<connor> think isn't as good as ourselves </connor>
<joey> they haven't they haven't discovered </joey>
<connor> philosophy yeah yeah they don't have </connor>
<connor> there's no Panda Socrates yet so there's </connor>
<garnt> no really like you know yeah bro this is </garnt>
<joey> why we should never ever like run into </joey>
<garnt> aliens like Humanity </garnt>
<connor> oh yes [ __ ] you know and then we're </connor>
<connor> thinking the aliens are any better than </connor>
<connor> us maybe they're just as bad what do you </connor>
<connor> mean with like you know thinking and </connor>
<joey> everyone disagreeing to be honest I </joey>
<joey> don't think it matters I don't think I </joey>
<joey> think I don't think it matters what we </joey>
<joey> think yeah because like uh I think what </joey>
<joey> was it it was it was I think it was </joey>
<joey> called the 99 problem that was like </joey>
<joey> posed by some [ __ ] force or something </joey>
<joey> but it was this like yeah Socrates </joey>
<joey> he's the only ever person </joey>
<connor> well like I think it was something along </connor>
<connor> the lines of like </connor>
<connor> um and please fact check me on this okay </connor>
<connor> um but like I think it's something along </connor>
<connor> the lines of like the the DNA like </connor>
<connor> genetic difference between uh or </connor>
<connor> disposition between in like apes like </connor>
<connor> monkeys and chimpanzees and us is that </connor>
<joey> uh I think there is like a 99 match when </joey>
<joey> it comes to like DNA like basic </joey>
<joey> structural DNA and that one percent that </joey>
<joey> chimps don't have is what makes us that </joey>
<connor> that much smarter right ships I saw a I </connor>
<connor> saw her a [ __ ] thing uh someone </connor>
<connor> tweeted it was really dumb as [ __ ] they </connor>
<connor> were like oh well yeah we just have more </connor>
<connor> DNA so like </connor>
<connor> and then and then someone applied being </connor>
<connor> like you know there's more DNA in an </connor>
<joey> onion than a human yeah yeah it's got </joey>
<joey> nothing to do with it </joey>
<joey> it's like I'm smarter than you I have </joey>
<garnt> more DNA well you know you we still have </garnt>
<garnt> like lizard dna in us like when when why </garnt>
<joey> do you think Lizardman exists </joey>
<connor> aside from [ __ ] Mark Zuckerberg you </connor>
<connor> know the biggest proof that there is </connor>
<connor> yeah like I believe like when we're </connor>
<connor> embryos we still like form a lizard tail </connor>
<garnt> that right </garnt>
<joey> no we gotta fact check this now please </joey>
<joey> fact check that but like </joey>
<connor> if you're right I I'll I'll give I'll </connor>
<joey> give you a crisp handshake if you're </joey>
<joey> right do we evolve with lizard Tails </joey>
<garnt> when when we're babies have we grow I </garnt>
<garnt> believe we grow a slight tailbone and </garnt>
<joey> then it disappears but going back to uh </joey>
<connor> yeah um maybe that's [ __ ] weird if </connor>
<connor> that is swear to God's favorite toxics </connor>
<joey> yeah oh I'm sure well isn't the Cox it's </joey>
<connor> just an after uh oh like you know it's </connor>
<connor> just the leftovers of the tales that we </connor>
<connor> used to have as you know when we're </connor>
<connor> rapes right isn't that what that is </connor>
<joey> it well isn't that why like the appendix </joey>
<joey> as well is like just the uh The </joey>
<joey> Leftovers of the like the second stomach </joey>
<joey> that supposedly like we used to have bro </joey>
<garnt> the appendix man well don't get me </garnt>
<connor> started on the [ __ ] appendix why do </connor>
<connor> we have two lungs why not just one just </connor>
<connor> one big one just one big one why do we </connor>
<joey> not only have one nostril why do we have </joey>
<connor> two hearts yes </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> correct yeah yeah I believe that I mean </connor>
<connor> yeah the human tails think it says that </connor>
<connor> a half a billion years is </connor>
<connor> apparently sprouted Tails almost dead </connor>
<joey> balance yeah yeah so it's just like an </joey>
<connor> after like do we still evolved but what </connor>
<connor> I think God is saying is that when we </connor>
<connor> reproduce now </connor>
<connor> okay okay </connor>
<connor> going back to the 99 problem right it's </connor>
<connor> called the 99 problem because </connor>
<connor> hypothetically right if an alien species </connor>
<connor> came to Earth yeah right and they looked </connor>
<connor> exactly like us right or maybe not even </connor>
<connor> exactly like this but genetically they </connor>
<connor> were exactly like us but now it's the </connor>
<connor> opposite of what we had with the Apes </connor>
<connor> now we have a 99 disposition between us </connor>
<connor> the human race and these aliens but the </connor>
<connor> extra one percent we don't have is what </connor>
<connor> makes the aliens that much smarter so </connor>
<connor> much of a difference that is that it's </connor>
<connor> the equivalent to US between chimps </connor>
<connor> right so it's like you know we look at a </connor>
<connor> chimp like playing around with some </connor>
<connor> blocks and you know the chimp puts the </connor>
<connor> square block into the square hole and </connor>
<connor> we're like </connor>
<connor> very good you know my my son just </connor>
<connor> learned algebra two weeks ago right that </connor>
<connor> could be the same thing for the aliens </connor>
<joey> yeah the aliens would be like oh you're </joey>
<joey> learning quantum physics or my </joey>
<joey> five-year-old just learned that the </joey>
<joey> other day yeah exactly like that's </joey>
<joey> terrible so like so the real question is </joey>
<joey> why would aliens right </joey>
<joey> give a [ __ ] about what we think okay but </joey>
<garnt> like here's his one thing to them we're </garnt>
<joey> probably just like The Chimps yeah </joey>
<joey> that's that's that's an argument and </joey>
<joey> that's why it's scary yeah that's why </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] terrified that's why I </joey>
<joey> don't think we should ever like </joey>
<joey> encounter aliens at all but like one </joey>
<joey> thing I've kind of just realized during </joey>
<joey> this one conversation is that we've </joey>
<joey> we've had we've had one like example of </joey>
<joey> evolution yeah the example that's </joey>
<joey> happened on earth right yeah and uh </joey>
<joey> We've evolved you know intellect </joey>
<joey> smartness and we've seen that in animals </joey>
<joey> one thing I'm kind of noticing now is </joey>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> um the smaller you are the more likely </garnt>
<garnt> you are to just be an [ __ ] what if </garnt>
<garnt> that's just like what if that's what if </garnt>
<connor> you know you know what I mean well </connor>
<connor> because you realize that you can [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> people over yeah also like how as a lion </connor>
<connor> do you [ __ ] someone over as an [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> what if that's just I don't know man </joey>
<joey> like pushing your child off a cliff </joey>
<joey> that's a pretty big [ __ ] move like </joey>
<garnt> what if what if that's just an earth </garnt>
<connor> thing what if you can just evolve </connor>
<connor> intellect without being an ass soul what </connor>
<joey> if that's just something that's just </joey>
<joey> outside of our perception that's what </joey>
<joey> I'm saying man we are still the </joey>
<connor> Neanderthals in this chain thousands of </connor>
<connor> years from now we are going to be humans </connor>
<connor> that will </connor>
<connor> developers like you're just describing </connor>
<connor> like plants </connor>
<connor> they just don't do anything they don't </connor>
<connor> mind their business we need them we [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> them up have you not seen that him like </garnt>
<garnt> Shyamalan film [ __ ] that's what I'm </garnt>
<joey> saying man we got to start cutting the </joey>
<joey> big dollars out I'm telling you like </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> maybe if we could stop feeling emotions </joey>
<connor> we wouldn't be enough we've decided that </connor>
<connor> you know a dolphin killing a child is an </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] move maybe to them they're like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is your normal Tuesday </connor>
<connor> we we decide we're putting our morals on </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] dolphin like the dolphin gives </connor>
<joey> a [ __ ] so what you're saying is [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> are human construct yes what what we </connor>
<connor> just fight is decide as an [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> changes every [ __ ] generation that's </connor>
<joey> true that's true right like we had like </joey>
<connor> uh I don't know like yeah you could </connor>
<connor> smoke indoors before if you did that now </connor>
<connor> I think you're an [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you could do that like 50 years ago so </connor>
<connor> we've just gotten more sense here yeah </connor>
<connor> we've just changed like what we think is </connor>
<connor> acceptable and not yes of course yeah I </connor>
<joey> mean social norms are always changing </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah you know it's no different </connor>
<joey> manner </joey>
<joey> evolving that's all that's up for </joey>
<connor> debates exactly I don't think it's fair </connor>
<joey> to say it's cut and dry yeah evolving is </joey>
<garnt> not the term yeah it's like it's VR porn </garnt>
<garnt> Evolution or Devolution I don't know but </garnt>
<garnt> uh I don't know how it's like helping </garnt>
<joey> the human race </joey>
<joey> technology it is definitely the </joey>
<joey> evolution in every other aspect </joey>
<connor> oh my God is there a Survivor bias with </connor>
<garnt> evolution </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know isn't that the whole point </garnt>
<garnt> of evolution it is literally </garnt>
<joey> survivorship but </joey>
<joey> see I don't know it I feel now it's </joey>
<joey> gotten to the point where that's not the </joey>
<connor> thing that determines </connor>
<connor> the next step in evolution like </connor>
<connor> I like could you like Okay so let's say </connor>
<connor> like like dinosaurs just got [ __ ] over </connor>
<joey> yeah like they couldn't have evolved </joey>
<joey> their way out of being struck by a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] meteor yeah yeah at the same way </joey>
<connor> we couldn't right so like in some ways </connor>
<garnt> it's like yeah survival to finish oh </garnt>
<connor> with a few asterisks well the thing is </connor>
<connor> of course the humans don't turn out yeah </connor>
<connor> I've decided to destroy your home well </connor>
<connor> that's like that's like uh interesting </connor>
<connor> actually because I I think I saw like a </connor>
<connor> let me know video about like the </connor>
<connor> apocalypse and I think like the </connor>
<connor> conclusion he came up to is that it's </connor>
<garnt> actually really really [ __ ] hard so </garnt>
<garnt> completely wipe oh yeah Wipe Out the </garnt>
<connor> human rights yes yes we know this </connor>
<garnt> because we're we have like [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> bunkers and [ __ ] underground yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah stockpiling the only way is to </joey>
<garnt> literally just blow up the Earth yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly just wipe out all of it yeah for </garnt>
<connor> every you know let's say there was a you </connor>
<joey> know a nuclear bomb went off you know </joey>
<joey> not everyone who gets striked by that </joey>
<joey> dies yeah yeah exactly Will Survive it </joey>
<connor> maybe it's not the healthiest but the </connor>
<garnt> people who make it through yeah no </garnt>
<joey> exactly it's it's really really hard to </joey>
<garnt> completely wipe off the human race yes </garnt>
<garnt> as it is right now we're like </garnt>
<garnt> cockroaches but big yeah </garnt>
<joey> we're the [ __ ] virus where the virus </joey>
<joey> are we are the Cockroaches Next Level </joey>
<joey> next level of humanity is just like the </joey>
<joey> Cockroach man and terraformers that's </joey>
<joey> what we can evolve into dude </joey>
<garnt> oh my God that was Evolution the </garnt>
<joey> evolution dude it's like reverse Planet </joey>
<connor> of the Apes we were the Cockroaches all </connor>
<garnt> along you know I think she's ahead of </garnt>
<garnt> point </garnt>
<joey> something to think about what were we </joey>
<garnt> saying before about uh yeah obviously </garnt>
<garnt> like and all it took was an asteroid to </garnt>
<garnt> like wipe out all of the dinosaurs yes </garnt>
<garnt> but they weren't smart enough to like </garnt>
<connor> not survive out now you know they were </connor>
<connor> they once because they were too [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> big </joey>
<garnt> you're literally yeah that's what that's </garnt>
<joey> what that's a lot so God what you're </joey>
<joey> saying is if there's dinosaurs evolved </joey>
<joey> enough to the point where they're like </joey>
<garnt> you know what there might be this thing </garnt>
<garnt> that falls from the sky one day and we </garnt>
<garnt> just all get wiped out over it so let's </garnt>
<garnt> build a bunker on the ground to save </garnt>
<joey> ourselves I mean yeah then the dinosaurs </joey>
<garnt> could have survived it's not like an </garnt>
<garnt> ideal Survivor you know survivorship </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but the point is you can you know </garnt>
<garnt> there is certain sects of humanity that </garnt>
<garnt> through millions of years can eventually </garnt>
<connor> repopulate the world I'm glad there are </connor>
<connor> crazy bunker people out there yeah </connor>
<connor> because we need we need them yeah yeah I </connor>
<connor> don't want to be one I'm happy to die </connor>
<joey> when the when the asteroid comes out </joey>
<joey> yeah but aren't you then afraid that </joey>
<joey> those are the people who are going to be </joey>
<connor> the next Humanity bro if you look back a </connor>
<connor> thousand and you see people we had we </connor>
<connor> didn't have much better I think we </connor>
<connor> turned out okay I think I think I think </connor>
<joey> we'll be all right well we'll pick </joey>
<joey> ourselves back up again I'm sure </joey>
<connor> yeah did you see how World War One </connor>
<joey> started like I think uh yeah we haven't </joey>
<joey> we don't have a good track record of the </joey>
<connor> smartest people being in the best </connor>
<joey> position yeah yeah I mean uh we're doing </joey>
<joey> all right </joey>
<joey> what I've learned is that like Evolution </joey>
<joey> and survival of the Fitters doesn't get </joey>
<connor> rid of stupid people </connor>
<connor> that's what I've learned it's because if </connor>
<connor> you think about it oh no stupid people </connor>
<joey> have always been around it's just the </joey>
<connor> idea of what is considered stupid yeah </connor>
<connor> just because like let's say it's the </connor>
<connor> whole thing with politics rights my </connor>
<connor> agenda is better than yours and and it's </connor>
<connor> for them that's Survival and the way </connor>
<connor> that they want to live and that's there </connor>
<connor> so that's you know you're getting into </connor>
<joey> that now so every single person on the </joey>
<joey> internet just says like oh survival of </joey>
<connor> the food is we'll get rid of all the </connor>
<garnt> dumb people and be a smarter human race </garnt>
<connor> I don't think that's alpha males yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah alpha males I don't think that's </garnt>
<joey> ever gonna happen </joey>
<joey> no I mean because then because then once </joey>
<joey> you get rid of all those people there's </joey>
<joey> gonna be a new type or personality or </joey>
<joey> trait of some kind that will just fill </joey>
<connor> its place again I mean our strength as </connor>
<connor> humans is that we have like everything </connor>
<joey> stupidity is a social construct someone </joey>
<joey> someone someone thought hey we should </joey>
<joey> just make something that [ __ ] flies </joey>
<joey> and can carry me it's like no one ever </joey>
<joey> that's the dumbest [ __ ] ever heard if I </joey>
<joey> was like Middle Ages I'm like [ __ ] off </joey>
<joey> oh yeah yeah we need we need crazy </joey>
<joey> people to come up with the coolest [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yes of course I mean it's a cross </joey>
<garnt> stuffed insane yeah because that's the </garnt>
<connor> same they've actually made pizza cross </connor>
<connor> edible but like yeah the first person </connor>
<joey> who came up with that they were like oh </joey>
<joey> whoa whoa whoa why are the Italians not </joey>
<joey> figuring this out </joey>
<garnt> let's go completely off topic well like </garnt>
<joey> we need crazy people </joey>
<joey> I I like to think that stuff crossed was </joey>
<joey> invented when someone just took a pizza </joey>
<connor> and just rolled it up it was just like </connor>
<joey> it's like yeah </joey>
<garnt> and it was like hang on a second I can </garnt>
<garnt> do that I remember I remember I had this </garnt>
<garnt> conversation with Joey Watts where it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like who do you think like invented </garnt>
<garnt> the first [ __ ] you know do you </garnt>
<joey> remember this conversation yeah we </joey>
<joey> talked about an afterdog I'm pretty sure </joey>
<connor> did we actually I think so I think I had </connor>
<connor> the same response of like a [ __ ] sake </connor>
<connor> I'm sure people were doing it they just </connor>
<connor> didn't put a name to it you know </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean like thinking like </connor>
<connor> philosophy we didn't put a name to </connor>
<connor> philosophy I think we Googled it and it </connor>
<garnt> was like the Greeks or the Romans the </garnt>
<connor> Romans it was popularized it again it's </connor>
<connor> a philosophy thing all over again they </connor>
<joey> just put a name on it PornHub okay </joey>
<joey> Romans invented giving head </joey>
<joey> they were so fighthead that they decided </joey>
<joey> to give heads </joey>
<joey> you're doing okay I'm losing my mind </joey>
<garnt> you're doing okay I'm losing my mind </garnt>
<garnt> yeah same here same here it's okay my </garnt>
<joey> mind has expanded right yeah the galaxy </joey>
<joey> galaxy we are the new philosophers of </joey>
<garnt> our time and that's how you know our </garnt>
<connor> generation is [ __ ] if you guys are </connor>
<connor> listening oh damn it God damn it all the </connor>
<joey> hell all right well hey look at all </joey>
<joey> these patrons though they're they're </joey>
<joey> Giga brain because they're supporting </joey>
<joey> the show and letting us talk about dumb </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] I'm so sorry to all people we've </connor>
<garnt> treated with this I'm sure they're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> be so many angles just like to all the </garnt>
<joey> philosophers scientists historians </joey>
<connor> biologists yes uh scientists uh I feel </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> geneticists literally any form of field </connor>
<joey> that has some kind of uh it takes life </joey>
<joey> my apologies psychologist my apologies </joey>
<joey> to Socrates uh I didn't mean uh I didn't </joey>
<joey> mean to butcher you like that bro uh </joey>
<joey> shout out to Aristotle </joey>
<joey> but uh Hey if you like to support the </joey>

<garnt> hope you're listening to this in the </garnt>
<garnt> show we are not high by the way we are </garnt>
<joey> in Japan it is illegal to procure drugs </joey>
<joey> here yes </joey>
<joey> um this is uh I don't know why we're </joey>
<connor> talking about this </connor>
<joey> we started off with haughty and end up </joey>
<garnt> with dolphins and yeah I'm really glad I </garnt>
<joey> brought my glasses today this was the </joey>
<garnt> perfect episode for it yo thinking been </garnt>
<garnt> real quiet since philosophy dropped man </garnt>
<garnt> yeah been ripping real quiet man </garnt>
<connor> everyone just stopped like they just </connor>
<connor> went they went from a door to like yeah </connor>
<garnt> all right before actually before before </garnt>
<garnt> we end the podcast yes genuine like </garnt>
<garnt> math that's a weird thing to me off </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<connor> math exists we just figured out how to </connor>
<joey> explain it as my physics teacher once </joey>
<joey> said </joey>
<joey> science makes maths its [ __ ] yeah but </joey>
<garnt> like if without science think about that </garnt>
<garnt> would be pointing if you think about it </garnt>
<garnt> math is like the universal language it's </garnt>
<garnt> the only language there technically no </garnt>
<connor> no no no no no no no no no isn't it </connor>
<joey> crazy that the Indians invented zero </joey>
<connor> okay okay </connor>
<connor> I'm actually gonna kill you guys okay </connor>
<connor> okay so </connor>
<connor> math is just like English but we just </connor>
<garnt> use that to explain the things that are </garnt>
<garnt> happening and how they interact it's </garnt>
<garnt> just a language that we chose right yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's a it's a human culture </connor>
<joey> yeah we it's the way that we communicate </joey>
<joey> does math exist outside of humans of </joey>
<connor> course it does yeah but like the concept </connor>
<connor> of explaining it doesn't but like the </connor>
<connor> stuff interacting and all the the the </connor>
<connor> the formulas that are happening those </connor>
<garnt> things are happening whether we don't </garnt>
<joey> know but like do you do you not find it </joey>
<joey> weird Okay this this is what blows my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] mind right you know the you know </joey>
<connor> you know like a few years ago where they </connor>
<connor> changed what a kilogram is right they </connor>
<connor> mathematically change what a kilogram is </connor>
<connor> because before they had this weight that </connor>
<connor> was a kilogram it was like in a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bunker in France or some [ __ ] yeah and </connor>
<connor> that was a kilogram yeah and then they </connor>
<connor> changed it to be more space scientists </connor>
<connor> on equations that used a universal </connor>
<joey> constant I believe it's like a consonant </joey>
<connor> constant the plan constant </connor>
<joey> why are there constants in our law of </joey>
<joey> the universe does that know that that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] me oh okay why is why is this why </joey>
<connor> did like the universe go yo speed of </connor>
<connor> light that's the thing now that's like </connor>
<garnt> that's as fast as you can go to give you </garnt>
<connor> a very easy way of kind of explaining </connor>
<garnt> this all right like the difference </garnt>
<connor> between Celsius and Fahrenheit they're </connor>
<connor> both communicating the same thing right </connor>
<joey> but they both they're entirely different </joey>
<connor> numbers right but one is dumb yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly you can convert right yeah and </joey>
<connor> it's the same thing if we rebuilt math </connor>
<connor> again from the ground up we could make </connor>
<connor> new constants that matched all the </connor>
<connor> formulas that we'd already made right </connor>
<connor> yes it's just the the we have decided </connor>
<connor> that for our math we're going to use </connor>
<connor> this is the constant if we changed it </connor>
<connor> the other constant we chose would have </connor>
<connor> to change right it's just we have </connor>
<connor> decided that this is how we're going to </connor>
<connor> express these these numbers and these </connor>
<garnt> interactions </garnt>
<garnt> sorry mathematicians uh that I'm gonna </garnt>
<joey> leave it there how do you invent some </joey>
<garnt> some Indian one day was just like </garnt>
<joey> we need a number that means nothing and </joey>
<joey> before that there was no number four </joey>
<joey> isn't that crazy </joey>
<connor> so think about it right because I'd say </connor>
<connor> numbers back then was purely for like </connor>
<connor> like trade or whatever you're using it </connor>
<connor> right so you would you would have one of </connor>
<connor> something you never had zero of </connor>
<connor> something so there's no need to have a </connor>
<connor> zero because your math wasn't using that </connor>
<garnt> concept yeah but surely before okay </garnt>
<garnt> caveman all right you need to </garnt>
<garnt> communicate hey there are three X's </garnt>
<garnt> along there are three deers that we can </garnt>
<garnt> hunt surely surely that was a concept </garnt>
<garnt> that was needed before markets and </garnt>
<garnt> selling stuff existed surely yeah but </garnt>
<joey> the Nintendo Falls once standing around </joey>
<garnt> being like there are Zero D is to hunt </garnt>
<connor> goodbye goodbye all right we're going to </connor>
<garnt> continue this conversation off screen uh </garnt>
<garnt> we'll we'll see you guys later </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
