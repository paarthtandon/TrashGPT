<SPEAKER_04> - Get your nostalgia talk out of here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pokemon wasn't that great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I'm pretty sure you'd
give Digimon an eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Digimon is better than Pokemon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I will fight you on this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Digimon kid is like
the OG neighbor's kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean?
- What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> (bright upbeat music) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's up crack heads? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Welcome to another episode
of "The Trash Taste Podcast." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm your host, Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm with the other two crack heads. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like how you like
started with alliteration </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> at the start of this podcast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So now it's just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, what happened to that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You gave up with the alliteration. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's up you crack heads? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There you go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Stop saying crack heads,
we need to monetize. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, we won't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It'd be fine, YouTube knows it's a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - YouTube has a sense of humor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube's notorious for
having wild sense of humor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - YouTube gets the jokes,
YouTube gets the memes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they understand satire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - They never de-monetize
for no reason at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Never happened in the history of YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, of course not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ask any YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not like It happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the last Chris episode or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, I think that was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the copious amount of alcohol
we consumed in that episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that was the demonetization. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Chris forced us into just being a mess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which I'm fine with, but it's just a mess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But, welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hopefully, this one's
not gonna get demonetize, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we're gonna be
talking about, Anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whoa, wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> We're gonna be talking about what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you remember when? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Trash Taste talking about Anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you remember when this
podcast was Anime podcast? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're gonna bring that back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm glad that I stopped this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> from becoming an Anime
podcast my influence. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did everything in my power. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then me and Garnt were like no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we must bring it back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I'm feeling nostalgic now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I get to talk about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Anime again on this podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My fucking God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, we barely talk about
Anime on our own channels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I like it that way. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I like being an Anime
fan that's what I like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We're all Anime fans but today
we're gonna talk about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're gonna talk about some Anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most specifically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are gonna be doing what we do best, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is roasting our
Trash Tastes in Anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - As like Anime YouTubers, and Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gotta do me like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, fair enough,
fair enough though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One of the most
annoying questions we get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll asked them sure is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is your favorite Anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you get asked this at every panel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> at every fan meetup you've ever gone to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I swear to God, I
don't know about you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I have a different answer every time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I've loaded a default answer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> so that I don't have to think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that will like satisfy them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, same, I just say sold online, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so that they can laugh and shut up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But as Anime YouTubers we are normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ones judging other people's tastes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but now we are putting
our own taste on the line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we are judging each other's tastes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and letting you all judge
our tastes along with us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like normally we don't
promote my Anime list or, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we'll get into what we're doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's basically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we are going to be showing
each other's my Anime list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then afterwards
we are going to be... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you guys remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was this trend in
the Anime community before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called three by threes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where you basically pick nine Anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a three by three grid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you show to your fellow brethren. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And that basically encapsulates
kind of your taste of Anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's basically just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a Pinterest collage of Anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're a bunch of fucking
Tumbler girls in this community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right?
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is my collage guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just got my collage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it definitely started by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like Tumblr or Pinterest
or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was started
by 4Chain actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of all things 4Chain creates, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they made this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So in Trash Taste spirit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna bring back
trash box can right here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you guys remember
from our Akiba episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was over half a year ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was like six seven months ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But we are gonna bring him back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And to make it fair, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> we're gonna pull out... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh wait, what's this doing in here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was me, I did put that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I've made it very clear
how I feel about Funkopops. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where it belongs, where it belongs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - She's been living there for awhile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can chill with Mike this episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll give you some slides. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do wanna mentioned while Joey is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> pulling out the first name that... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> This is my hidden Anime list. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I actually have one
from when I was a teenager </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right.
- that I never made public, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and people would always
ask me for my Anime List. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I actually made a my
Anime list under SeadogVA </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and just put like Boku
No Pico as Like a 10. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then every now and then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I get a comment on it being like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I hate you, Connor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So, hi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, my username as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I've done a video on it already, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so people know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my username is not even the Anime Man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was blasphemy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was the username I used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> before I was the Anime Man to DeZinga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you, a Big Bang Theory fan? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, DeZinga? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where did that come, oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because my surname is Basinger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And is it like Big Bang Theory? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bazinga, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's never heard that one before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've never heard
of that one before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, fucking pull a name out already. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've just been like fingering that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a fucking a mellinum there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The first one is, oh, it's me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, I'll go first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fan fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's check out Dezinga's Anime list. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So first thing I got to ask is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when was the last time you
remember updating this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like I'm gonna say this now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're all picking up our mals, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't updated my mal in years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I'll give you an idea, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm looking at my watching lists right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Boku No Hiro Academia
second season is on you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've got 91 Days here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and that was like what, 34 years ago? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tell us some. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I've already
finished that one though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but that's like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How long ago was that, 91 Days? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Two years ago? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - God, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - When did season two of My Hero come out? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like two years ago? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think two years ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was two years ago? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No, it wasn't two years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like fucking three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Three guys realize they're boomers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Three, four years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Three, four years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's been that long
since I've updated it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So wait, wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're telling me, you've watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> My Hero Scademia season one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I finished season one, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How come you've like never
talked about this before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it was like
the most six out of 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> show I've ever watched. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But you'd normally milk
that for all it's worth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, yo it's mid bro, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm triggering all the
little weeds out there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, like I could but
also it's like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> To me like calling My Hero Academia mid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just as much of a popular opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as saying that it's a 10 out
of 10, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first thing that
pops out to me on this... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's mid but you gave
it a seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How is seven mid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But it wasn't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the second coming of
Jesus that people thought. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, all right, go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first thing that
pops out to me here, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The first thing that pops out to me here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is how I know Joey's my
fucking brethren here, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because as we all know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I started as the Anime Zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And my very first Anime
Zone review was bleach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I gave a seven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I can see that Mr. Joey the Anime Man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also gave Bleach a seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Despite the fact how much
we've shitted on Bleach </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in our like professional career. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look, look, look, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when I shit on Bleach, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, granted, I've never really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> publicly shit on Bleach all that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't make like a
fucking Anime Zone review </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Bleach or anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, look the only thing,
it's three points off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> for the Eisenach. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> And then everything else was perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean I would argue everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off the so Sole Society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean you can like the.... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The way Kamindo work was fine as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, I mean it was fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never watched but
we never watched .... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't need to, you
are not missing much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And if you do just read
or watch up to Saul society, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the first talk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is what I've
heard, you can't just stop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> If you're like, really into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You kinda have to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't just though
you want to see it go down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No you can. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean it depends like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because Bleach didn't go out with a bang. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I know, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just like kinda fizzled out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well I have watched all like reviews </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of Bleach for some reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've watched like every
eye patch Wolf video on it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, yeah cool, this sounds good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look don't get me wrong,
it was back in the day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it was serializing it was
a super solid show in Manga. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like as much as I like
to think that I'm like oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like all the underground like
weird, non-mainstream show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love my show in and Bleach was one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like so I said it was
just fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly to this day, I
think Bleach is one of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the coolest Anime to come out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it definitely I
like, out of the big three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like One Piece,
Naruto and Bleach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Bleach was just like
that fucking cool kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It always seemed like the edgiest one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was definitely the edgiest one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean have you seen
what .... looks like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It looks like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I mean I used to
always see the mute AMVs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and was like Lincoln park with Bleach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean that was pretty much Bleach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No that was Bleach, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it wasn't like, it
went better with like Bleach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they had like half skills and share </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what's
going on with this man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, just fucking sick dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the powers were sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just, the sword powers
were sick then like Kubo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna see some more
bad guys god damn it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Say what you want about Kubo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but like he has a good fashion sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The way he dressed the characters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they just always looked cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Really.
- The drip was clean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the perfect way to
decide to each characters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The drip was clean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like say what you want about Bleach, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> those characters had drip man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't go as far as to say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bleach might be maybe not the first, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but definitely one of the biggest shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that kind of gave like I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe it's street wear and
Animes like collaborations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would argue maybe came from Bleach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the characters, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in like the title channels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that he wrote during the Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Like he gave them such cool
fucking looking street wear </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that honestly you can see people wearing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> like people being me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is why Drip Goku exists. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, Bleach is the
reason why Drip Goku exists. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait this a meme?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is Drip Goku? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's this fucking, I
don't know who made it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll show you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like it's this
fucking meme of like Goku, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like in the fucking, like b-boys stands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wearing this fucking drip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a big meme right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why this is a meme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I tried to explain it to some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like but why is it to meme? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, I don't
know, but it's a meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the drip is clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is going back to Dragon Ball fans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what is Dragon Ball memes man? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did this start on Twitter? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know all I
remember seeing is Drip Goku. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a meme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then Vegeta wearing
like the Supreme black sweater </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as always just being
like, that's clean man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, no my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goku got drip apparently
that's all I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goku got drip, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there would be no Drip
Goku without Drip Bleach. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And if it wasn't for Bleach,
there will be no Drip Goku. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I feel liked
every kind of Dragon Ball meme </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> under the sun has just been
like every cancerous meme </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and like literally cancerous memes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In terms of the Dragon Ball Community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I get lost for words you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the fuck did I just says. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised you've never
seen it's all over Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - So you rated Bleach the
same as My Hero Season One. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Would you still stand by that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I would, because like look again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as much as I don't think My Hero </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the second coming of Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Season one was solid as
fuck, like I enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would say for me, My
hero it goes season two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> then season one, then season three, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We haven't had season
four yet, haven't we? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, no, no, no, no, no we haven't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I wouldn't know, we have no. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, we haven't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's coming up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Marilyn, have we had My
Hero Academia Season Four? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's coming.
- It's coming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay, season four is
coming so we don't even know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're such fake amateurs
we don't even know if we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> My Hero Academia Season Four. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> The most mainstream I make. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The biggest three attitude is don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if there's a next season
of My Hero Academia or not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the next one for now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw on Twitter everyone was
like the next doc is boring. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like great, just another year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of just mediocre fucking showing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Even the show in right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like, yeah whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I mean like the
thing is with My Hero </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I started of
really, really liking it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And to me like out of all the modern show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and it had the potential
to be the greatest, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like they had the potential
to reach like a higher ceiling </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> than say something like say Black Clover </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or Demon Slayer or something like that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But it seems like the setup is there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and the potential is there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but there just hasn't
been that moment for me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> to really make me love this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it seems like the more I watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just the less and less
interest I get in there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well that's how I kind
of felt watching season one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the first half of season
one to me was like, okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like this premier, like
superheroes, quirks, okay cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can see why people are
into this and it's good shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like action scenes were
pretty fucking solid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> characters pretty fucking soul. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then the further along
I got, I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's just a show in like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just good.
- It's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's acceptable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like I struggle to
find words just to describe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how I feel towards it 'cause
I'm just at the beginning, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just like yeah, I really liked this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm pretty hyped for this
and the more I've watched, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I'm just like, yes good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes, no, not really much to say about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just good.
- Is good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's adequate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like going to a
cousin's birthday party. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just like, yeah I'll go, I'll go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> but like, I'm not that thrilled
about but I'll turn up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I'll be supportive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How's your cousin's birthday? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's how I feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> That's how the show is in my mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's it exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's the thing like
people make it out to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm not praising
the shit out of a publicly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> people immediately think, "Oh
Joey hates My Hero Academia." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't hate My Hero Academia,
I just think it's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just cry every time Deco talks man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not a fan of Deco, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I'm not a fan of Deco either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't understand why
people love Bucky girl so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like, is there
something like going wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the childhood of Bucky girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like really into him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause To me it's like,
he's just kind of an asshole. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, I understand why
people love Todoroki. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that is like set up to
be like, yeah fan favorite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Why Bucky goes people's
favorites, I don't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the worst kid in school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone's like, I love this kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like people like
talking about Bleach, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like back in Bleach
days when people said </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that Rangi was their
favorite, I'm like yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> he's just an angry kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's a nice guy secretly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like have you ever met someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who's an asshole in real
life who is secretly nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fucking was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's weird to me right, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same kind of Twitter accounts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and the same kind of fan base. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I see like defending Barker and having him </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as their favorite character. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Is like the same kind of
accounts that I see fucking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> trying to counsel people
for like ten-year-old tweets </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like trying to
counsel people for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And here they are being like, oh I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Barco go like was a bully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> back in like middle school, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But he's like turned around now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's good guy now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - His got friends to support him now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a lot easy to get
behind fictional characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> turn around story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like those people were defending Vegeta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's talking, he fucking
tried to blow up the planet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two walks go man, Jesus fucking Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's all right, he's a good guy now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But speaking of Vegeta,
you gave Dragon Ball </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and Dragon Ball Z both a nine out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I thought Dragon Ball was shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, it's good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh a nine? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You gonna look me in
the eye and say it's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> the original Dragon Ball is a nine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay that's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again this puts into
perspective how long ago was that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I probably put that in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - How many fucking Doraemon movies, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you gave a Doraemon movie a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You gave that a 10 and
you're going to give. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait which one, which
story I want a movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's so goddamnit
many, 16 you gave a 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What is special about 16? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wasn't my Schindler's
list of Doraemon movies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what was it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the third Doraemon movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's 16. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, that the remake is 16. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the original is the
third one, which I couldn't find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> which doesn't exist on
my Anime list for summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I gave that a 10 purely
because I watched that movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That was one of the first
Doraemon movies I ever watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I mean, if you guys
don't agree with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don't give me that I'm
the bad guy now, I get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like honestly, like sweat, like even now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I could probably rewatch that movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and still find it enjoying,
yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Doraemon holds a special place in my heart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as you can tell from the amount
of Doraemon movies I put in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I'm just like I didn't even know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there were this many Doraemon movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude they still making Doraemon movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised someone else
has been watching Doraemon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like further along than when
they were a kid watching on TV </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause that's the only exposure
I've ever had to Doraemon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I probably would never go out my way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch a fucking Doraemon movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I completely understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you did not grow up with Doraemon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I do not blame you for not
watching a single Doraemon movie </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or episode because that shit's
hard to get into as an adult. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> But if you grew up with it like I did, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then you can easily go back and watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't man to me it's kinda
like, yeah as a grown up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> grown ass adult I would just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch the fucking Teletubbies movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like Dora the Explorer while watching, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean like yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess it's like to
like a niece or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they'd be like, oh
sure you watching you watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, what the fuck
is happening in these days? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> This shit is wild bro, what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's probably all my parents thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when I was watching Doraemon, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like what the
fuck is this boothing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I noticed you gave Fullmetal Alchemist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and Fullmetal Alchemist
Brotherhood both a seven. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because it's like My Hero, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, come on,
- it was good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - just bring it, Brotherhood is not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like at least an
eight or a nine, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was acceptable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Acceptable? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it was acceptable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hold on, hold on, hold on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me act angry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait you gave Fullmetal
Alchemist a seven, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how dare you Joey, how dare you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I am so fucking offended right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the audacity of this
bitch man, the audacity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - To the new viewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt has never watched
Fullmetal Alchemist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That scene with Nina and the dog, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mike did you know I do
get the feels from that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love how that's the first
thing you would think of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not trying to say like,
you need to give it like a 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I'm just saying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's like minimum eight, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay here's the thing, with that one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I still stand by that to this day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because like a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was not the first Anime I watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> I watched that way after a kid. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah me too. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah but it was
probably one of the first </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> ones you watched right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - For that first 20. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly.
- But does that count? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This might've been in
like the first 200 for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I don't know, I feel
like out of all the Anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've watched except the
ones with bad stories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's the thing, my experience
with Fullmetal Alchemist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is basically guns next step, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is because I hear about it so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I watched it out of obligation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt, hasn't got to the stage yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't got to that stage yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Every time someone asks
me a day gets added on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly.
- I'm pretty sure I like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like that
was like that as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm just like, you
know what, I've got time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll fucking watch it, just
because I hear about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Some in the same like sitting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or like how did you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I watched, so people are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> okay you don't have to watch
the first Fullmetal Alchemist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just watch Brotherhood all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You hear that all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> But am like no, no I wanna see why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people saying that, all right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I watched the original and I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okay this was adequate. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> So, Brotherhood must be a lot better, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot, lot, lot
better, that's what I heard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it is.
- Yeah, I think it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, yeah, it's better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> but it's essentially the same thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It deserves a point higher better. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's essentially the- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, the first Fullmetal
Alchemist is like a low seven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and Brotherhood is like a high seven. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, fuck off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is, that's all it is to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also am critiquing your scores here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> knowing that some of these
Anime I've also scored myself </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I have no idea what I said because I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my list was done in 2014. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy shit seven years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I see you've given Naruto
a six compared to Bleach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So would you say that you
preferred Bleach over Naruto? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That a fucking absolutely
I prefer Bleach over Naruto. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, I have never
dropped a show more times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than I have Naruto. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Like Naruto's been one of
those shows where it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've watched it, I've
read it and watched it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like close to the end. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But along that way,
there were so many points </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> throughout "Naruto" where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ah maybe it's not worth it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - You didn't get that
with "Bleach" at all? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I did get that
bit with "Bleach" once, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during the "...." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, "Bleach" for me was
just like a constant downhill, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Naruto" just kinda went up and down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think back sometimes I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was "Naruto" a good show,
would hold up to this day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I still think best parts of "Naruto" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are still like a fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, again and that's why I
probably gave it a six, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's because like, I
completely understand why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is one of the most beloved
Anime out there today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so like I saw parts
of that, but again this was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't grow up with "Naruto"
like a lot of people did, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this was again another
show that I kind of just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was just another
show in for you, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is just another show in for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so again I'm not
saying that "Naruto" is bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd just like to point that out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not bad, but it's
not a 10 out of 10 for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay I'm trying to see what else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I'm getting interrogated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is an interrogation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's an interrogation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like we've been in interrogation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is like True-Crime Weaver edition. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Notice his hand move,
his hands are off the table </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saying that he is quite nervous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry we're not like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what is the lowest one
that you've rated on here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm trying to see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably only one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm trying to see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, it's I think it's "Pupa." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, "Pupa." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I gave "Pupa" I think I get
"Boku na" and "Pupa" one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, one of the
biggest that surprised me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going through your list
is okay, be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you completed every
Anime you've scored on here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No fucking way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is so fucking many. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Except for maybe "Sazae-san." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You completed "Sazae-san," completed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did complete "Sazae-san" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause it's still going after 50 years. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But other than "Sazae-san" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I honestly think I have
finished everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like I remember one of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause when are we gonna get to my list. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One of the reasons why my
list seems like a lot emptier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because if I don't complete a show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just don't bother putting it in my list. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right?
- And. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well that's why I have like
the on-hold section as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh he got the fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> When did you stop updating this man? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You really were the anime man before this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck, you watch so much anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've also rated
"Tokyo Ghoul" season one, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the same as season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Come on, they're no way near the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - To be fair I would rate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what did I give season one and two? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you think you
gave season one or two? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I gave season one
and two like a seven, maybe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I would give season two maybe like a four. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I was gonna say it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not even from the mostly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would give it like
a four, I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> what I was on about. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll give it like a four. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Trigun" a seven, you stand by that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, there were a lot
of parts about "Trigun" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really enjoyed, but I think
the problem with "Trigun" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> is that I was a little too over
hyped, when I came into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right?
- Because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I heard so many people being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yoo "Trigun" is like same
levels as like "Boku no" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or "Cowboy Bebop" or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like up there with the
big, like classic leagues. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, all right I'll get into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I watched it and again it was good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but not to give spoilers, but
the last quarter of "Trigun," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like what the fuck is going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really, really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought the last quarter
of "Trigun" was fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I enjoyed it, but I was like,
what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean its been a long
time since I watched it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would say this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't watched it in
literally decades now I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's been a long time
since I watched "Trigun." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Zetsuen no Tempest" as
well, you gave that a seven. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is that like, if
there was a benchmark </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> for seven out of 10 shows, it
would be "Zetsuen no Tempest." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually, I can't remember
what I rate on that one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, isn't it
based on the Shakespeare. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's based on Shakespeare. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, was it basically, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I think it was
on his diary originally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Very very loosely inspired
off a Shakespeare store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't remember which one it was, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I gave a points because at the time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it was quite creative and new. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've really liked it, like it's one of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I put "Zetsuen no Tempest"
in the same category </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as I do "Darker than Black," right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love "Darker than Black". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I watched it was kinda
like, when I think back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like it seems average in my memory, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but for some reason it sticks with me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I always think back to this show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, what did you see? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you see? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I did finish my point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Yuri on Ice" a three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Were you just trying like
piss off Twitter that day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I just genuinely I
just thought it was boring. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it's not a three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just thought it was
fucking boring, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't wanna get into this again man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like at the time I got
so much shit for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I remember did you
make an apology video? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, because I said that I
didn't like "Yuri on Ice." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He made an apology video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because at the
time like "Yuri on Ice" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like the hottest thing right back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't remember
when it was like 2016, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2017 something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> And all I said in the video was, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't think "Yuri on Ice" was. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh no, I said something along
the lines of a 99% of people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> watch "Yuri on Ice for
the "Yaoi Elements." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 1% watched it for the
actual sport element. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And so many "Yuri on Ice" stands </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> called me homosexual because of oh sorry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not homosexual they called
me a homophobic, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> They call me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Homophobic
- homophobic because of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> First of all, hey I'm not homophobic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you also gave "Free!" a five Joey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> so man this is looking so bad for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you harmed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because "Free!" I gave a
higher score than "Yuri on Ice," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again because Koto Animation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> animated that way better than
they did "Yuri on Ice," so? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't really think there's any world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like any review that you could warrant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that "Yuri on Ice" just below a five. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it was a really good story, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was a minimum five, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> What would you give it?
- What would you give it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would give it a six, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it like you, could you
reasonably put it below a five, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like at a four? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, if it's not your thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because the thing about it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't my thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thing about "Yuri on Ice" is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they introduce way too many characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just like kind of
didn't focus on any of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also I'm sorry, I couldn't stand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the main fucking character, I hated him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I loved the guy who just
came while he's dancing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that guy was funny as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, again there was
some funny parts of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a reason why I
didn't give it a one, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like there was some parts
about it that I enjoy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, there's a reason
I didn't give it a one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's the reason
I didn't give it a one, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was some parts about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like was it a fucking like slug </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to watch all of it, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, it was good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like every episode pass I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I could be watching
something else right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - First I can actually beat you up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for saying something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah for sure, I thought
you really liked it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah she likes it and she's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well that's your opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, here's here's
something I noticed, "Kissxsis." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Masterpiece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seven out of ten. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So do you wanna explain why it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> either like a one or ten. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm guessing it's not
a one, 'cause he got, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> he came to realization with his friend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> No if I put that in my list
like after the first time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched it with my friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have given it a ten, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- But then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I rewatched it, 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was drunk to shit when I
watched it for the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me rewatch it just to double check. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, it's
good, not a ten though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Somebody's anime like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> why would you subject
yourself to this shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because back then, this
is when I was like literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching everything that came out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Attention all phantom thieves, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this episode is sponsored by AFK arena </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who are doing a persona five collaboration </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which you can get involved with right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Unlike the super grand the RPG games, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like we all know that I despise </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I don't like
wasting any time in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> AFK arena like the name was suggests </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> allows you to play without even playing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a dream come true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is optimized to the max, Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hell yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> For example, I could be
cooking, sleeping, shitting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'll still be getting
XP from my characters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can be doing all
three at the same time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and still get spirits. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will be worried if you will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Man, that is just men maxing loaf. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could be also be listening

arena, King towers and more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tell Me what you love
about AFK arena, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So What I love about AFK arena, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as someone who plays a lot of gadget games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that there are some games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you probably have to
focus when you're grinding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but thankfully AFK Arena
allows you to skip all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - AFK Arena has collaborated
with multiple properties before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> including "Assassin's Creed,
Overlord and now Persona 5." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you know "Persona 5" Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, it's only my
favorite game of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tell you what, I never saw this coming. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Kill me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a joke right, a persona, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're killing me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah "Persona 5" is one of my favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> JL pages all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's aesthetic, it's funky, it's classic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it plays really well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I love all the
characters and gameplay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly everything about
it, I enjoy the hell out of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And this the aesthetic
of it, it's just, wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have replay that game
about five or six times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well "Persona 5" is a renowned JRPG </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you very much "AFK Arena" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for sponsoring this
episode, back to the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What I will say about
this going through this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that you've finished a lot of shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've watched like a few episodes off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're not gonna be on my list. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you've like just straight up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finished them and scored them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't trust someone
who would get through </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> some of these shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think there's something wrong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> someone's gone wrong in the head, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just to make you keep watching. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to understand
like back in like 2016, 2015 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is all I fucking did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like no fucking wonder
you burnt out an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're like, when
you've actually finishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most of these shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know in the movie "Old Boy," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when that guy's trapped in
that room for like 10 years? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I'm pretty sure he
watched less anime in this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like how do you get through this guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay yes, I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I'm looking through my list right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and like I comment to my
past self for the fact that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I finished "Infinite Straddle" season two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It wasn't the that
you've finished season one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you went through season
two, like my fucking God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You swear that you
didn't lie on any of these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, legit, other than "Sosaye san" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 100% have finished all of these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, we'll find out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And that is like, I
swear on my own grave. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did like a little fucking
reaction that said bullshit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'll say fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I swear I finished all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, I mean overall your list </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is like exactly what I'd expected. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You give the shows that are
universally accepted to be good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> good ratings and the universally
to be bad, bad ratings. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean I have good taste, what can I say? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got the public tastes I say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I have the public taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty in line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gave "Yuri on Ice" a three, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's far from public taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah you can't just do one
and be like one will take. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I won't notice, you
gave "Charlotte" a seven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's a pretty high
score for what I think is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Change my eight is like
worst piece of work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I would give that
realistically like a five or four. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Would you say if the
director is esteemed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or like the show makers are esteemed, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're more likely to
pick up a fairer review. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think if I'm a fan of like the creator </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like the studio or like
someone in the production team </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then I'm more willing to give it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, say like "Charlotte," right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like that's a Mitojune production </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like I love everything Mitojune makes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but so I gave it a seven. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But realistically thinking
back on "Charlotte" now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realistically I give
it like a four or five. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - See this is why I'm the perfect critic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I just don't know anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I go into the show and I'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know what the
fuck the studio made this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like let's just watch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it's like Bones, who's Bones? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is Bones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gave it "Another" nine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No you're on stand by that, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd still give it like a night, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I really enjoyed it, I
don't care what anyone says, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I really enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then again, I'm a fucking
horror anime simp so.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes it's like an
anagram fry of shit taste, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes.
- that's what I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there is no good horror anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Have you watched Mononoke? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's not horror. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I rest my case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a horror the same way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that like fucking "Monster" is a horror, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes "Monster" is a horror. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's horror the same way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that fucking "Grave of
Fireflies" is a horror, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like it's different kind of vibe bro. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what I mean it's
not like it's scary, scary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kind of like the thing... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know man I was
pretty fucking on edge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I watched "Mononoke." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes it's unnerving, but
it's not like it's definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> not in the same kind of genre as "Another" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just final destination,
the anime adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but even camp here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I liked the campiness
of it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love my fucking like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your honor I rest my case. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - To me "Another" was like a
really good beat great horror. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you trying to defend
the fucking umbrella scene? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How did you know a burst out laughing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when that happens man? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe because I watched it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The entire last episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just a Mr. Bean episode at a time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> let's cut the shit off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The entire last two episodes
was just a slapstick comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I won't put some Benny Hill music on that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again I really love the
campiness of it, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, fuck that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I completely get why
people hate "Another." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I just thought it was
really like tongue in cheek, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like camping. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Give me the box, let
me pull up the next one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sorry it will be funny
if I pull out myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The next list we're gonna be discussing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh mine, wow I guess we're
just going in the order now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who fucking needed this anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't remember when
I've last updated this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I stopped updating my mail- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think we just go with the most recent. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I moved over to "Kitsu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it depends if "Kitsu"
is also updating this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But this is going to be my
teenage tastes I'm guessing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Teenage taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can tell this is your teenage taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like I don't
know, in the past episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you talked so much shit about "Akira" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and yet you've given
it an eight out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What would you give it now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would give it like a six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A six okay, well you are still updating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you think you
gave "Akame ga Kill?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Just curious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it really low? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no I'm just curious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What di you give it?
- A three or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What would you rate it today, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> if I asked you to rate "Akame ga Kill." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like two, three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really it's not that bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I would also give it the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, you gave it a four. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay good, teenage me a taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd say "Akame ga Kill"
was one of those shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I thought it was awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then all the comments
were the Manga's better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Manga's better, trust
me guys, the Manga's better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was one of those few times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why called them on their bluff, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I call it the Manga readers on their bluff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I read the Manga up to the end, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, this
is just the same shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just elongates, you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone was complaining about the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only ending of "Akame ga Kill." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But "the Manga" is like equally as edgy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it just elongates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just has a different ending </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's equally as bad in my opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You also rated "Aldnoah Zero." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you gave it a six. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you gave that season
one a six and season two a six </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but season two come on is
infinitely worse than season one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I don't know what I was thinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Aldnoah Zero season one" is
actually like pretty decent, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah you still good of
stuff about "Aldnoah Zero." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Aldnoah Zero season one" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't remember why I gave it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you maybe finished both
of them at the same time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you finished season two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - and was like am pissed
off with this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I remember "Aldnoah season one" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> being pretty interesting
and then it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it was great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the cliffhanger
season ending happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just like, holy
shit this is super interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then season two, just
kinda pissed on everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that season one set up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then the left of
the how became like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know this is like teenage gauntlets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because you gave "Baka
to Test to" an eight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still stand by that, it is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you also gave season
two an eight as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Season two was not as good as season one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never watched Baka, what
is "Baka to Test to" about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Baka to Test to" it's
just like, it's like a comedy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of trashy, like romance, itchy- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be honest I like it so,
I thought it's really nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The human ambassador
for domestic girlfriend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's right up his phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like one of
the first comedy anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that actually made me laugh
and I didn't think was generic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And now that I look back, I think yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was probably pretty
generic, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I look at the art
style and I'm just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is premium, mid 2000s anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is nothing interesting
to say about this at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gave "Baccano!" a
10 as well, I like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think we all gave
"Baccano!" a 10 on my list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I didn't give it a 10 on my list </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what that's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I'm curious to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what your three by threes are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the real personality test comes in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hold on, I got to ask that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Marilyn, do we have beers? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no Nebo, gave me some beers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - We have beers, okay I'm
just checking to make sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it will be fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, no we also have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, we've got the Pikara juice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We also have Pikara umesu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You like that right
Connor, you like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pikara juice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We're gonna be smashing
some of this, right Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like fuck the beers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No don't ever get,
he doesn't even deserve </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Pikara juice give it to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll rather have a beer than this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't want some
of Pikara's goodness. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't want Pikara juice too? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I noticed as well you
also gave "Btoom" an eight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But Joey gave "Btoom" a six. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually would side
more with Garnt on this one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> even though it did end kinda shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah wasn't the ending absolute shit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the show was really fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and the opening was a banger bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Opening fucking 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude fucking 10 out of 10
opening, but soon the show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was just pure fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know like it is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah dude it was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was one of the few death games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that didn't feel like it was
one, a "Battle Royale" rip-off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- 'Cause the problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with every death game anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it feels like a
"Virgin Battle Royale," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Battle Royale" did it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like why would I want
to watch anything else? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Btoom" it was just like
it didn't try to pretend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it wasn't a "Battle Royale" rip-off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really like "Btoom". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It went off that and it
just was a hell a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know I think
I gave it a lower score. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think when I first finished it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I also gave it maybe
like a seven or an eight, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then I read the Manga
and I was like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that wasn't that great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess for some reason, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like "Btoom" has always
been one of those shows, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like stuck with me, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I've always just
wanted the season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I still like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still think about it,
I still think about why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it didn't have a season two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, I know
Sydney read the Manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> She said the Manga is
also pretty good as it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah the Manga is way better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay you gave "Eromanga-sensei"
10 so it did to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But you are my brother because
you gave "Gankutsuou" a 10, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I also agree.
- Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gave "Code Geass" season one a 10 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and "Code Geass" season two an eight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are your thoughts on that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What are your thoughts
on that, I'm interested. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, So I remember giving it a 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, So thinking about
"Code Geass" right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I gave it a 10, the
first time I watched it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I thought it was
like a fucking masterpiece. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was perfect, it was everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I recently, not recently, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I rewatched "Code Geass" with Sydney </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and there was a lot of flaws in season one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I guess I just kind of
ignored as a kid or just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of forgot about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like okay, like I remember
rewatching it and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why is there an episode
dedicated to chasing a cat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and how did I just blank
this from my memory? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That episode was very good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I remember first
watching "Code Geass", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like easy 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like the greatest
anime can become. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think I just remembered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the good points of "Code Geass", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause there was a lot of like
plot holes and everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's how, can we spoil "Code Geass"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everything I think it's
we've got spoil "Code Geass", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I know it's universally it's like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Skip to this timestamp
below 'cause "Code Geass" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you haven't watched "Code
Geass" and you want to watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's one of my most
spoilerble shows out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I remember rewatching
it and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> man they've really had
to like twist the ploy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in order to make Nina or
what was not Nina, Euphemia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just fucking massacre everyone, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I remember watching
it and I'm just thinking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> man the plots kind of over
now everything's sorted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Racism is over. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everyone go home. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just the most roundabout way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like okay guys we gonna
make the plot continue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How can we make the plot continue? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was literally a
scene where the the Lelus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> goes "Hahaha wouldn't it be funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "if I told you to kill
the Japanese haha psychs" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it wasn't psycs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, that did happen, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like I just remembered thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well, I remember thinking as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a huge plot twist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and now watching it as
an adult, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just, Oh this kind
of doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> This is kind of pretty cheap right there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This is pretty cheap writing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So yeah like I would give </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> "Code Geass" season one maybe an eight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think because of the high
of "Code Geass" was so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> They like you almost forgive it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The highs are very high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So like you forgive it for
a lot of the shit it does. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then season two was like, that was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what it is about season two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like a car crash that somehow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Roller was the season. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Season two was a car crash </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that somehow perfectly parallel parked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it was absolute disaster </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and somehow it like just
landed its ending perfectly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember rewatching
"Code Geass" two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> after season one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And going on the problems
I had with season one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season two just took all the like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> small problems of season one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just extrapolate it to them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, let's take every
stupid plot twist in season one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just make it 10 times bigger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - True, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think the exact moment
that lost me in season two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like, it was I am Iam spoker
scene, but just with Lelus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know I just thought this
is not clever anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, true.
- It's just stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And everything up to that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to like the final few episodes
was fucking dumb but the. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They stick the landing man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like the ending is still I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the best ending ever in anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its obviously yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - I would think. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'd agree with that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I would think it's probably
the best of the top of my head </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> the best ending anime is
produced so far so God knows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that an unpopular opinion? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - God knows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay hold on a second,
I'd like to point out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for someone who says he
doesn't like Ghibli Films, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gave "Mononoke Hime" a 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Will you stick by
that, because if you do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then I can high-five you but
if not, the backhand is coming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, what did they
give "Spirited Away?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I think thinking
back "Mononoke" is one of mine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gave "Spirited Away" a nine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Con, I really had to think about that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I don't like Ghibli Films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think "Manonoke" and "Sirits Away" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> are some of the few where I stick by them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I stick by them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also love how you gave "Gyo" a six, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's pretty fucking high if you ask me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought it was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just, have you read the Manga? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have read the Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did you give it a six? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I would give it a three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait what is "Gyo?"
- "Gyo, is a Jinjinto. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Gyo" is a Jinjinto Manga that's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they made a movie
about it like five years ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it is horrendous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was a fun movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I had a fun time watching quickly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was so sad watching it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause the thing about "Gyo"
is that I watched the anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> not knowing any background about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not knowing it was Jin Jinto. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought it was just like a
campy B movie horror movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which it is.
- Which it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I remember because I went into that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking it was gonna be absolute trash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I watched it and despite
it actually being trashy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was trash, it gave me
the same kind of enjoyment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as you do watching a
shitty B movie horror. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it wasn't like
it was shitty animation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause "Gyo" the movie
was animated by Ufotable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and man they, you could see some effort </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being put into this man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but you also got
to admit that like the 3D, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of the 3D elements, I was
just like, God this is ugly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but is that a good thing,
because it's a horror </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like I don't even know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - To be fair in 2012 it
wasn't, they weren't very good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was compared to some of
the 3D that came out in 2012, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to like "Studio Gonzo Gantz 3D," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which just makes me wanna
vomit when I think about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't remind me of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it was good looking 3D. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah true, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like Ufotable put some effort into that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I respect them for doing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You watched "Halo Legends", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but think you're the only person
on my anime to watch that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't even know that
was an anime by Halo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - RIP to the other 19,000
people who have rated this show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I've watched, that was my stint </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I watched that and the
"Mass Effect" anime as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you think you
gave "Halo Legends"? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Did I say that, did I
say what you gave it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think so, no I didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gave it a four, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay I stick by that 'cause I'm on- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, hold on a second, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you gave "Re:Zero" season one, a six. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did I actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - What's that about? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Why the six? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - What would you say? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What would you give it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I gave it a seven or an eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I gave it an eight probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I don't know why I gave it a six. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it was because
everyone was hyping it up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna be different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was kind of underwhelmed by it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now 'cause I have rewatched "Re:Zero" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in preparation of season two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would give it a seven, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I remember coming out of "Re:Zero" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just feeling empty, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it just no 'cause it kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a good time watching it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was just a girl
reaction of it was a good time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm probably gonna forget
this show in a few years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I didn't end up getting it, so I. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You also gave "Space
Dandy" a six as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really liked "Space Dandy" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really liked it too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you look at it like a
Saturday morning cartoon, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's pretty fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Space Dandy" it was
very hit for miss for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gave "Sololine and
Sololine two" also with six. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So in Garnt opinion, "Space Dandy" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and SAO are on the same level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - On top of that, he also
gave "Guilty Crown" a five. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So would you say that SAO is better than- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - SAO is better than "Guilty Crown". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you say that SAO is
better than "Guilty Crown?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I wouldn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You were a little
harsh on "Guilty Crown". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was a little harsh on "Guilty Crown". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Guilty Crown" I would
give a higher score, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but going to "SAO" versus "Space Dandy" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean I've rate this
based on my pure enjoyment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and "Space Dandy" was either
like nine on enjoyment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or a two depending on the episode, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is probably why I rated it as six. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There were some killer episodes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then there was some episodes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that were just a fucking drag </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where 'Sword Art Online"
was just like a constant. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was a plateau. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was just a constant six
I watched this I'm trash, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I enjoy this whatever move
on, you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Would you care to
explain this for me, Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "JoJo" seven, what's
up with that, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was that power one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it the original one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The original one he gave a
six, which you also watched. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The OVA.
- The OVA,yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You haven't rated any
other "JoJo's" ever won. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm gonna say is the "JoJo's"
series as a whole Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I rated part one, well it is a seven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a seven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanted to get
angry for something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I just wanted to get
riled up a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You also gave a "Totoro" an eight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay that's wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what the fuck was I thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was I trying to look like I
had good taste, oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no it's a fucking four in my opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you think you
gave "Kuroko's Basket"? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Eight? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You did yeah, I'm surprised. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I honestly thought you
would bash "Kuroko" more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I loved "Kuroko" yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think for some
reason I think you hated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I love "Kuroko". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - NO, I love "Kuroko" and
"Kuroko" was a sports anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that got me back into sports anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So no I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You watched all of "Mekaku City Actors?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I noticed that, he gave it a four, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I would also agree with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck how did
you sit through all that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was just, I don't
know I liked the aesthetic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't know why it was just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I was just high that day and I just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was so disappointed with
that 'cause I loved the novels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because.
- And I just completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking destroyed it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was me after watching
"Boku no a Gantry" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and go through the shaft type. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm just like, this is gonna get better. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> This is by studio shaft. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I legitimately thought
that Mekaku City Actors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was like a gay porn novel
because of the internet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because all you ever see about
Mekaku City Actors online </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is gay stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it is, yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> There's a large Fujoshi
fan base for Mekaku city. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I brought the op of Mekaku City Actors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> is a fucking banger, I
still listen to that shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, it's awesome. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, it's great. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - All the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you think you gave "Monster?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did I give it a 10? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll stand by that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I love monster. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's one of the animes
that like, I dropped </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then came back to. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that I was so glad
that I picked back up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because, obviously it's really
fucking slow in the start. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is really slow, but I
feel like "Monster" is a rarity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of an anime, where it's an
Anime that has an amazing Manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that could have easily be sliced up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and have a shirty adaptation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But "Monster" is one of the few epic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like masterpiece Manga, that
go to masterpiece adaptation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, like, thank God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it got 70 something
episodes that they did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Could you imagine if
"Monster" was a 24 episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly, that's why I'm
scared if 20th Century </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> gets adapted man 'cause that's
like Monster but even longer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and even more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, I find it
hilarious, Ikkitousen Aturo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's Ikkitousen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you wanna explain what Ikkitousen is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ikkitousen is like,
imagine like the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the above the shows, like
high school for the dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean?
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a battle fun service show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and back in the day, this
was the most degenerates kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of fan service ETD action
show you could, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like so many,
it's like we are boomers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking love Ikkitousen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it goes just like, nope. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck your memories, it's shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I mean, I look back now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I'd rate a higher,
I don't know, it's a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would rate it like maybe a four purely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's just so attractive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean like back in the
day, this was all we had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nowadays there's so much trash anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and trash kind of found surface-y shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but back in the day, it
was kinda like Ikkitousen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then nothing else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nothing really else, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nothing really else </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was nothing like Ikkitousen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gave that "Zetsuen no
Tempest" a seven as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm thinking back, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd probably give it an eight now, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gave- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I need to watch it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gave "Yuri on Ice" a seven as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a "Trigun" a nine, that's fair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Tokyo Ghoul season one" and six, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and "Tokyo Ghoul season two", a five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, would I rate it lower now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would honestly pretty rate it lower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Maybe, I would rate it lower now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's literally like a
lot, it's one of the shows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where I don't know if the
Manga readers are right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> because everyone talks about
"the Tokyo Ghoul Manga." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Has anyone, have you guys
read "the Tokyo Ghoul Manga?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so nobody knows if
the Manga readers were right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for "Tokyo Ghoul" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but apparently it's one of the
most popular Mango out there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and one of the highest rating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I find it interesting how
you gave "DanMachi" a five. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll stick by that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was "Sword Art Online,"
but beat us all out in lines. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So "Sword Art Online" was like a six. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why was that "Sword Art Online" show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so popular when it came out? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought it was acceptable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I gave him maybe like a six or seven. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just saw some passionate around there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't know it was acceptable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was bigger than five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gave "Prison School" an eight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You stand by that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I stand by that.
- I stand by that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Prison School" is one of the most, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, this regarding
the ending of the Manga, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it is one of the most
hilarious Mangas I've read. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The Anime adaptation did
a pretty good fucking job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He gave Warren.... a serve a five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I wasn't sure if
I should comment on that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was a bit offended by that
and I'm pretty mad at him. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never watched this, I have no idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm Curious "Psycho-Pass," a seven? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Season one, really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really, no, no,
- I thought it's better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - no, it's a nine now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, okay, thank God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like like "Psycho-Pass," I
remember "Psycho-Pass" is one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the few shows that has stuck with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's one of the shows
where I rewatched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I loved it way more rewatching it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than I watched the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I think, watch- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The film is so damn good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think I didn't
appreciate "Psycho-Pass," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through the first time I watched it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the more I watch "Psycho-Pass,"
the more I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now, like, I gave it a seven
when I first watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I was thinking back
to like my top 10 favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime of the decade of the 2010s. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Psycho-Pass" was up there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it still has
some like the Villain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was one of the best Villains in the Anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It still has some of the most unique ideas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've seen an anime
that has like stuck with me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't think has aged at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the scene halfway through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where the main character
has to make a choice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has stuck with me for a long time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the one scene that
has also stuck on me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is I can't remember what
exactly what episode it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's the episode where
they start beating the shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of this character, in like the middle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the street, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And because of the system
that's been set up, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> no one reacts just
because they've never seen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something like this before. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right.
- And I don't know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought that was like such a unique idea </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that was completely natural </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in this world that Gen Urobuchi has built. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's unfortunate- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The whole building is like amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's unfortunate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the biggest unfortunate
thing is that season two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I haven't watched season three yet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they just didn't
have as interesting ideas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as was in season one, but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who told you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Now when you have like a giant
karma top to like follow up. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> but I want them to be
cheaper and thanks to Honey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I've saved up to sometimes
$20 on some of those cosplays. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which goes a long way, honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you're buying a lot and
you're spending half a grand </SPEAKER_05>

good saving, I'll welcome it. </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, to end it off though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I gotta point out this
blast for me right here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gave the first "Pokemon movie," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Mewtwo no Gyakushuu," a four out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yep.
- Get out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Get your fucking nostalgia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you seriously
telling me the third movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Teiou Entei no" is better? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You've given that a six. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gave a "Teiou Entei" movie more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> than the first "Pokemon movie." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, I watched them as a kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think I remember
the "Entei" movie more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking give a
shit about "Pokemon" guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I give a shit about "Pokemon." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, this is all
nostalgia talking here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I rated this as an adult or
a teenager, like yes, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, clearly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, fucking off the "Pokemon" man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like get your nostalgia talk out of here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Pokemon" wasn't that great, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I need a fucking beer
Garnt, I'm tired of this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I'm pretty sure
you gave Digimon the net. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Digimon," is better than "Pokemon," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll fight you on this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was the "Digimon" kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Digimon," the first movie
was fucking brilliant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have an amazing sound track. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The "Digimon" kid is
like the OG neighbor's kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That meme of like, oh, go and
look after the neighbor's kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously weird and it was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a Digimon fun.
- It's a Digimon fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I bet you were the
kind of kid who was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't play "Yu-Gi-Oh,"
I play "Duel Monsters." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Refuses the jewel without the brakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, did you did either
of you watch, "Digimon?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I only watched the movies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, but are you still
sticking by "the Pokemon-" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, I watched
them both the same age </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I preferred "Pokemon." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because "Digimon" had
an actual plot, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think at that age,
that wasn't my concern. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, (laughs) I think at that age, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the concern is which monsters look cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think the thing was right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that I would watch "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then go play "Pokemon"
and be like, yo, this is sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll play "Digimon," go and play </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the disgusting RPG games they have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> that was impossible to fit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Have you ever played that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've played some of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't even complete that shit now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Unlike 12 year old, like 10 year old me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was stuck on the fucking
thing, like a first level, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't do anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, what's sick, fuck me,
this for children's TV show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because the thing
about "Digimon and Pokemon" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> is that I never gave a shit
about the games, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't really care
about the Pokemon game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I got to have you on this spot. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I actually watched the
"Pokemon anime" years </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> before like I played the actual
games for the first time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And the thing that stuck
out to me for "Digimon" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was that, even as a kid,
I could recognize that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this had story arcs. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, even as a kid, I'm just like what- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You are the most pretentious
kid I have ever met. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, I was just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This kid in his fucking
diapers, written in his phone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like writing on his mouth lips, like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mother, turn this "Pokemon" show off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I want story in my children's shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I was always thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> why is Ash not getting
anywhere in his life? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was angry by that as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone was angry about
that, but "the Mewtwo movie." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I was scared that true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That had fucking fanta. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mewtwo was a fantastic fucking character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you can relate to
that guy, so fucking harda </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then with the whole like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't tell me that you didn't cry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know when you watched
the first "Pokemon Movie." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I cried. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't tell, me you didn't cry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the Pikachu crying scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never gave a shit about Pikachu man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're dead to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never give a shit about Ash. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bye-bye. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking it's a loud
fucking yellow rat guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get over yourself, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I glue him on is a
fucking diabetic, dinosaur </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so be it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would insult you "Digimon" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's so fucking forgettable, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't even remember anything to insult. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can only remember what a name Agumon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - What a shit name,
Agumon, what is that shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I'm saying is "Digimon"
was the original easy guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I'm glad that someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course I'm gonna rep "Digimon". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go fucking tweet it Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was born out of my mom's womb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, mother, is
this a new world, yes it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm fucking, I love my "Digimon" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and as a kid "Digimon" is a
better story than "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I would define. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hey guys make sure to follow
us on the Trash Taste Twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to just absolutely shit all
over this man's opinions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I'm moving on, let's
go over to Connor's list, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is rather. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can I have beer first please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you want to be a beer first? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I need to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Can I have a beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I gonna have to take
bullying from you guys. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every week we should. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need alcohol to toll
me from the bullying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We should rename the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to Connor fucking fans of two boys a wave. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean, we've both
gotten so much shit from you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause every weekend Connor
has to defend his shitty take. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well I mean, it's kind of hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm looking at this list right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and so far there's a lot of shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you haven't even given a score. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think there's a
lot of them, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this is so shit I don't
even wanna give it a like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> hold up Garnt, don't

<SPEAKER_06> until I've had my beer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, we're starting now
Connor, we're starting now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You better prepare your fucking anus here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like,
- Well what's up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Boku no" an eight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay well, listen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just an eight, the fucking "Boku no" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> stan gave "Boku no" an eight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Listen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey, your taste is shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the job is so much
better, eight out of 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know why I did that,
I mean clearly I was a fool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know who that person is, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> who signed into my account
and changed my score. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love the fact that
you gave "Bakemonogataria" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a higher score than "Pokemon". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You give us shit for "Pokemon". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait hold on you gave
"Clannad: After Story" a 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Were you shitting on me for
fucking liking "Clannard?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah the first season is shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What did I give that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You didn't even give it a score. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so forgettable, I didn't even wanna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking rate that piece of shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Chobits" if I could rate that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I give that like a seven or an eight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was a fun show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that was great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a fun show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why the fuck did I give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "C: The Money of Soul and
Possibility Control" an eight? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Dude, I never even finished that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, "Code Geass" season
one and two the same score. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, did I really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Second thing I immediately notice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after our discussion we
just had, "Pokemon" four. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought you were my boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay I can probably explain
why that is the case, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause this was made in 2014, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it was probably the age of
like, I'm a big boy now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> "Pokemon" that's old
Connor that's child Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> me adult Connor I don't
like "Pokemon", I'm a man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought you were my boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, I am, I would actively
change that to a 10 if I could. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God, big sad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really, a 10 Connor? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What else am I gonna fucking- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay one thing I've
found hilarious, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is why I didn't wanna go last. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I can't be, I have to
talk shit about your scores </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and not know my own. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Connor, has given "Stein's
Gate" and "Sword Art Online" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same score of eight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gave "Sword Art
Online" an eight, fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gave "Sword Art
Online" season one an eight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that I'm
actually having a stroke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's just having
an aneurysm right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Listen, I can explain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gave the same score.
- You gave it the same score. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can explain all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Please explain it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, I'm not even gonna question you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> giving "Steins Gate" an
eight, okay that's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I meant to put 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And "Sword Art Online"
I meant to put a 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor for which one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 10 for "Sword Art Online". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always ignore what if I had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuinely I enjoyed "Sword Art Online", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if I went back and watched it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm sure I would be like,
what the fuck is this shit? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I enjoyed it for like what it was. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I liked the idea cause was my first ever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> like video game anime. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - So it was fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then you think about it more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you think about Kerio
and Tony and you're like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> wow this show is really garbage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the time, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, at the time everyone's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we've all gone through
the stage where we thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Sword Art Online" was a cool concept, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> back when it was a cool concept. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean look admittedly,
as much as I'm known as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the guy who publicly
hates "Sword Art Online" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like I've said that like
first couple of episodes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really great buildup with the premise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then it kind of just
fell apart after a while </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when they were like let's make Kurito </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the edgiest protagonist alive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then that's when I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, you had a great premise yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just kind of ruined it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the worst, main character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have no idea why I gave "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it go a three at nine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I would never, ever do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why, what would you give it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a five? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Show is shit man.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Boring show.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's boring man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but you have to understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a man who skipped stories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no yeah, what I wanna know is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how the fuck do you watch "Pokemon?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why did you even watch it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You watched an animated
light novel, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watched "Pokemon" and I got through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I watched like the
next three seasons or so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And how did you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you manage that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you manage that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was confused a lot of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I also just like thought
a lot of it was weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, 'cause this is the,
you have to bear in mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> this is the first time
I'd ever seen any anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where like there was a
protagonist or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Who was just like touching
a kid, like the ghost skill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, wait what the fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, well, why is he
making this child porn bro? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's all right man, it's
a deconstruction of heroin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what they call it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I want to know is how
you got the patients to do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because even me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, you again, back in the age of like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when you're an anime
fan, you can kind of like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> put up with anything 'cause
you've just gotten into it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And that was when I watched it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause it always high up on the list </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> and that might've been the
thing that made me be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what, no, I'm not
watching anime, fuck anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But here's what confuses me right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that like you gave
"Pokemon and Gotei" an eight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and I would assume the
majority of the Montari series </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like a mid school. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But you love "Katana Nagatari" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Katana Nagatari" is
like fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's the same style. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay it's the same style. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's written by the same dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but it's done like
a million times better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so much more entertaining
than "Baka Nagatari" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ever was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not saying "Katana
Nagatari" is bad or anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm saying it was fucking great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just find it weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they're both great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like I guess in my mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when I think of "Katana Nagatari" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just feels like a
Quentin Tarantino film, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when I love war shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, like the dialogue
is really important, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the one that like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't really like it when seeing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait how did you not find that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> with the "Mogna Nagatari" series? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I didn't find
the dialogue interesting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In like "Katana Nagatari." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like the one selling point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of "the Mononatari series." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't find it interesting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was sold and rice circulation came on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, yo this is a fucking bomb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I went to see her. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey, man give give us
the fucking wine here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I needed off the enumeration. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Katana Nagatari" was
like legit, oh shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay I'm in my three by three, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I honestly I didn't put "Katana Nagatari" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I just didn't forgot it existed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That would go with my three by three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - So "Katana Nagatari" is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it gave me everything that like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I love about like "Kill Bill" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and "Pulp Fiction" in anime form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and with kind of store
with a setting that I love, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is like Samurai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really love Samurai stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean again, I'm not
disagreeing with you on that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 100% agree with all of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just saying like,
it's both a lot of words. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's both like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's both weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's both characters that are very- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it by "Shidi or Sharift?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No "Katana Nagatari"
is not Shidi and Sharift. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know something
about "Katana Nagatari." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I just really fucking enjoyed so much more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than I ever did the Monogatari series. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's the closest
you've come to enjoying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just reading words then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I think because
there was a lot of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the action was really fucking
good in "Katana Nagatari." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it made sense on the story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you didn't like any
action in the Monogatari's? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Monogatari series
action was fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was fucking insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Come on man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know why but yet
the action was far better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than I had any right to be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly, Sharif was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right em gonna flex for a quick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like that fight where
it was like Arora Rogi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> versus like I think it was
Karen in the second season? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- It was like the big brother </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> versus-
- They fight with Karen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't even remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no the fight was Combo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah that one with Combo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - You remember the monkey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That shit was fucking insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was brutal, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even find if remember this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay I'll show you afterwards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and you'll learn to appreciate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would say though,
the toothbrushing scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's probably the thing that made me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like curious about Hamtai. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh this is
actually kind of hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly like the toothbrush scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm gonna say it's hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like it birthed
so many degenerates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because that's culture was born. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's culture was born </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> thanks to the toothbrushing scene, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is a classic scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would defend that scene as
being like the classic scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I noticed you gave me "Noragami" a 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did I really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Masterpiece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did I really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who are you and how much
time did you spend on Tumblr? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you a 12 year old? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, I don't know
what mindset I was in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to ever give, I don't think
there's any point in my life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I genuinely liked
"Noragami" that much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - In my opinion, the
only 10 out of 10 aspect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> about "Noragami" is the opening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that was a good show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - The opening was fucking bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then again, I find
it absolutely hilarious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that you gave "Black Butler" a five. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And he gave "Black Butler"
season two specials a three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, I still would. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone, I made it no, I
would not try and hide it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I did not like the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your life is a lie seed OVA fans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> he was never a "Black Butler" fan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He was never a "Black Butler" fan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gave "Monogarati
second season" a 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I definitely suffered as
a teen getting into anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I was heavily influenced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by what everyone else was saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean I agree with, I agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was fucking, I'm a liar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Second season is definitely a 10 for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gave "Monogatari" 10 as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is definitely the
case of teenage Connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saw that everyone was
saying the show was good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that I didn't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm just gonna put it a high score. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I can tell because you
gave "Mirai Niki" a nine. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Did you actually? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think I really enjoyed
that show when I watched it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I legitimately did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You must've watched as a teenager. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah you must have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was like "the
Elfen Lied" of human race. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Again, this is when I was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - He gave "Elfen Lied" a nine as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was such an aging kid man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Listen, listen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like that too
when I finished mine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was when I was 14,
that was seven years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I probably just said how
old was I when I was 14? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was 17? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, 17 when I made this list, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This just sounds about
right for 17 year old Connor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like "Deadman Wonderland" an
eight, yeah that checks out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You gave "Monster" a seven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I may have to down before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, that might've been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from me having to recover from the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I dropped it and
had to pick it back up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You dropped it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - About yeah, about 10 episodes in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause the shit didn't fucking move </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but then actually, but
then you when you watch it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like, holly shit it's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, holy shit, nevermind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Holy shit, oh hold up homies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was blind but now I can see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gave "Cowboy Bebop" a seven as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> which honestly, maybe it's
an eight but it's honestly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not a 10 or a nine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are some shows on here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm surprised you watched
at all, like "Zombie Loan". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Zombie Loan" I have no
idea why I watched that show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but I remember being angry
that I watched that show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember being like mad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I wasted my time watching that show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the only reason
why I watched "Zombie Loan" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was because I heard it was a
pitch pit show and I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like peach pit and I was like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I gave " School Days" a one though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I see that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I see that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hell, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You finished "Sunday Without God". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah I noticed that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't finished that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I finished it, but I definitely
did not give it a seven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's for sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you gave it a seven. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait which one is "Sunday Without God"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly, that's the
point I'm trying to make. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, "the Girl With The Shovel." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I watched that because. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm surprised you watched that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was when, I can actually tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact time I watched that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember very well when I watched that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> So, when I first got into anime, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I was watching it on like
the shitty like parrot sides </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to figure out what the fuck was going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I accidentally watched
"Fullmetal Alchemist" twice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> not realizing like what
the fuck I was doing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then I finally got a
free trial for crunchy roll </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and so I watched ass much anime as I could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the 48 hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that was one of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're not sponsored by Crunch Roll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're just let you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually, that was one
of the ones that I watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that was- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was "Zombie Loan" one of them as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, that was before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So I remember that was pretty
the first ever 12 episode show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched on Crunchy Roll I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some of this shit
just doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You watched "Outbreak Company." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would never expected
you to watch that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would not have paid
Connor to watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you're the
only other person I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has watched "Outbreak Company." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You finished "The World God Only Knows" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and gave it a nine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah all three seasons, I
actually really liked that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really like what is going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I liked it as well
that just doesn't seem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's surprising to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That I'm just like my jaws on the floor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause if you were to tell me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that Connor finish this show in lights, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait you also gave "Higurashi" an eight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Season one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I would take that back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What would you give it now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I watched the doubts maybe a four. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I'm looking at some of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, is this me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like he gave "Devil is a
part-timer" a fucking 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love that, I love look, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you actually look up my account </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> my profile picture is
"Devil is a Part Timer." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I loved "Devil is a Part Timer." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised you watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Eden of the East"
- Yeah, I did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the two movie and gave them a nine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I really enjoyed "Eden of the East." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- I thought you could try it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - How we never talked about
"Eden of the East" together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't how have we never talked? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I fucking love. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It brings up "Eden of
the East" never comes up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a fucking great show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but no one ever
brings that shit up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's got a great first
season but like the movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just didn't conclude it
in the way I wanted to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He gave both of them are nine though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought "Eden of the East" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> had one of the most interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> premises you could find. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay since no one talks
about "Eden of the East" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna sell "Eden
of the East" right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's give some love to
"Eden of the East" right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm gonna be honest I remember
my feelings for the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I cannot fucking remember what happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have one memory of this
show and it was like a ship </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and a bunch of naked people coming up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all I remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No the ending of the first
season of "Eden of the East" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was fucking great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What is the premise again? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so the premise
is they have a smartphone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I can't remember exactly
how much money they were given </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but he had like 13 people who
were given these smartphones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and on this smartphone,
you have like this AI </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they could request
anything to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were given a budget
of I think $10 million. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it was more than that actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it like a million or 10 million. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 10 Billion yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 10 billion yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is $100 million. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So they were given a
budget of $100 million </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and all they were told
was to save the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that was their objective. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And so the series is just the story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of these different
people and their own take </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on what $100 million
means to save the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And honestly, like, I don't
wanna spoil like what happens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so good watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's fucking great
especially the first season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's only 12 episodes, just go watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna rewatch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna rewatch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not just 12 episodes is 12 episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a movie, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's two movies. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Two movies.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you sure it's two movies
not just one recap movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because he gave both
of them a nine out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, but I feel like the first season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the problem with the first season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I didn't conclude the story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but the first season
was fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The movies were not as good in my opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't even know they had movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I don't remember much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about what happened in the movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Some of these shows, I
legitimately can't remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like fully watching but I.. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just surprised
you watched the "Hentai" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the one eye nickel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "The Stony Cat and the Hentai." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I did watch that, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think he done the audio as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That doesn't seem like
a show you would watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why have we never talked about this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You watch "Black Bullet?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You haven't rated it,
but you watched that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You watched "Black Bullet?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I watched all of "Black Bullet." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember, I actually do really enjoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like romance slice of live
shows, but I used to binge them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the time, but now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You watched "Black Cat" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, "Black Cat" shit though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the moment was away though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I watched "Gatchaman Crowds." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember I gave that a six, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that was so reluctantly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I did not enjoy watching that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I watched, there's a bunch
of other shows that I watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after this, I didn't include like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's that fucking
card game like "Wixoss," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever it's called. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - That was fucking shit, I hated that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm angry that I watched that.
- You watched that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hated that I watched that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why did you even watch that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it to me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not like looking up anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I don't wanna know
anything about the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just give me the fucking
show, let me watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if I hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just brain dead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I wanna- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just brain dead monkey boats, like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you, because here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guarantee, if you just give me a show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tell me to watch it, I'll
watch it, I might enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you try and sell me on a show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I immediately will stop
being like, I don't know, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm completely the
opposite, I'm the opposite, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like, I've gotten to the point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I need to be sold on a show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I need to have like a reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why I'm watching the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, is this show gonna get good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Am I gonna have something
that I get out of the show? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to know that before
like truly gets into a show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because otherwise, nowadays
I end up dropping shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after one episode, if it doesn't hook me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even like critically highly claimed show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I don't know, that
something good is coming up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's gonna be worth my time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then I'm just not gonna give it a chance. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I just don't
have that patience anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've sat through enough shirty shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to know that I don't wanna
waste my time anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just sad, 'cause
I do miss that feeling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of finding hidden gems,
where I can just be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I have zero expectations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I gave "Kyoukai no
Kanata" wait this is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Kyoukai no Kanata." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Kyoukai no Kanata," seven, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In fact, I haven't rated
that, but I did watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wish I did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, one thing, that scares me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you've watched "Fate/Zero," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you rated the second season
lower than the first season? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You mean the actual action
packed second season, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where everything gets concluded, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is lower than the first season? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Which is the setup? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What happens in "Fate/Zero?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like completely
going against everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like all the character
build up before is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I hate story, I love action </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the season where there's
more action, I'll rate low. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I really enjoyed, when
they were introducing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like all of the characters in "Fate." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what my favorite part of "Fate." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like "Fate/stay night" as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my favorite part of "Fate/stay night," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is when they introducing the characters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause you're like, I
know there's an assassin, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I know there's a writer. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What are they gonna be? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then when you watch "Fate/stay night," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're like, wow, writer
is shirty in this one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> compared to "Fate/Zero." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - 'Cause like "Fate/Zero, you watched, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You're like your writer, he's the best. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Alexando, I'd fuck him. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But like, then you watch,
then that's the reason </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> why I fucking hated "Fate/stay night," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> except for the animation,
because I was like why- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which, wait. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Which "Fate/stay night"
are you talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're talking about the
original "Fate/stay night?' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - (inaudible) works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The series, not the movies, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The series. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I don't wanna
get into this with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> The point is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just need clarification
because what you say can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Fate" fans will like
on their seat right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Aren't you cool? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I can't believe they had, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there was no like good Alec,
they should've just brought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Alexando back again and be
like, hey, I'm back baby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like, it's a free cool, I guess like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey, I'm back in the future. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back in the future. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm back in the past, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause he was like the
best part of "Fate/Zero. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> He was the best part of "Fate/zero. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - 100% </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like, he was... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Had my castors relationship
with the fucking Weevil, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever is called, lord vakins' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Weevil, Waiver? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Waiver, what I'm fucking doing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Weevil (laughs). </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who the fuck gives a shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't even believe she's in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Honestly, he's kind of won that's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why he's in my mind, that's what he is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's another thing that I gave? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> What I don't, I disagree with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of ones that
you haven't given a score like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Darker than Black,"
I stand by being a nine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause if you watch the DOB
dude, Troy Bakers in that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this is before Troy Baker
stopped doing Anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, fuck man, he
kills it as November 11. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like for "Darker than Black, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is a show that I've actually
rewatched quite a few times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know why if we
watch it quite a few times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fun man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just really liked the
world of Dark than black. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not gonna lie, I
don't remember anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like Quirks, but instead of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's actually fucking cool and weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause, I remember watching
it, it was like X-men. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But what I found interesting,
was the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they had to like do this really
weird activity every time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they enhance their power. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - With a smoking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why, I just
thought that was really cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like it has an fucking
amazing soundtrack as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was like by "Yoko Kanno." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like one of the biggest differences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between the first season,
every other season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was Yoko Kanno's music just
set such an amazing tone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for this world and this environment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it just made you it just
felt good exploring this world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just being in it and. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like I gotta rewatch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's fun dude, I'm watching Dub dude </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the Dubs really fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're saying this is a Joey now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, honestly, like "Troy
Baker" is November 11th, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of my favorite performances </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love "Troy Baker," so
you'll sole me on that, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because "Troy Baker" placed the guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> who has to smoke, even
though he hates smoking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've watched the Dub as
well, it was fucking crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he's so good at it, man, God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, well I. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hold on, you watched "Saki?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And you gave it a seven. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Saki," that's the
one with things on here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, no, the Mahjong one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the body pillow we have outside. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I watched that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you've actually watched that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I watched all of Saki
and I'll hope at the end, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, I'm gonna understand Mahjong </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and at the end I was like,
I don't understand Mahjong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, with this golden wind and shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> going on and stuff like that,
And I'm like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, it just doesn't seem
like a show you would watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I watched all of
"Persona 4" the animation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I noticed that.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I noticed that as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you've never played "Persona 4?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Never played "Persona." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll be 100% honest with you at the time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I legitimately didn't know it was a game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's like wait, did you
watch "Danganronpa" as well? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah he did he gave it a four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have played "Danganronpa" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought the anime was actually- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For the shows that I haven't rated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you can ask me and ask me what I'd given- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay what would you
give "No Game No Life?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well that if I was 14- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - A hard 10 bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course what of now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now like a seven honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Seven okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's about that would say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What'd you give "Accel World?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a four. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What would you give "Another?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Another" was shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well you watched "B-gata H-kei" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually I did I loved "B-gata H-kei." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that is funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is actually like
a fucking great show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have read the Manga. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can tell you exactly why
I watched 'Another" as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was talking
to a girl at the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and she was like of course my
favorite show is "Another," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the best show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, fine I'll watch this show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I'm trying to like
Simp I'm try so I'll try. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Another" was kinda like
the true crimes documentary, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the anime, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause everyone knows
white girls love true crime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and before they get into true crime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're a little younger they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Another" yeah erased, yes,
all these shows that I love. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like I too
like "Final Destination" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and watching trashy horror movies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can do that all day long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's literally what Sydney gets me to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I'm like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay I'll give you props though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you a watch "Claymore"
and gave it a nine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly I loved "Claymore." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Claymore" was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Man I, that is one of the
animes that got done most dirty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why I'm surprised
you gave it a nine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because "Claymore" Manga- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Claymore" Manga nine or 10 honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Claymore" Mangga masterpiece, anime- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Anime made me like feel things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that I hadn't felt before man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is that thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a level of uncomfortableness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that I haven't experienced before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I don't know why
there's something so unnerving </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and uncomfortable about
watching "Claymore." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I felt that
when I watched "Basara" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I know what you mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It like fucks you up a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then I can tell like,
I honestly I wish I... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna try my best to
try and read the Manga. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I was set I was gonna
read something else- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I recently rebought all the Mangas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just 'cause I want to
read it again 'cause- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What was the other fucking show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I said I was gonna read
the Manga by the way? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have no fucking clue. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You finished "Eyeshield 21," right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I did, I wanna do- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, I actually, I downloaded- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (inaudible) was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no I was gonna read that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I actually downloaded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first 30 chapters of
"One Piece" being like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, he is getting into "One Piece." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (cheers and claps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I haven't had the stomach- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mark it in your calendar. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> and come back to us in 10 years time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we'll see where he is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But honestly like "Claymore"
is a fucking amazing Manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> One of the best Mangas out there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly I really think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The anime did it there- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is the Manga finished,
like totally rapped up? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay good, good, good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 22, 23 volumes something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And 'cause like the "Claymore" anime had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Anime original ending
if I remember correctly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes it did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and it was complete
shit, from what I remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember having a good time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember, I watched the dub </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I remember the voice actor Greg Ayres, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like playing the whiny
characters he always does. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think he was a little too whining. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, that's just Greg Ayres. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, its true, he's too
fucking good at his job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no I remember that was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swear he was typecasting that role </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like the longest fucking time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, 'cause there were
so many of those characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and no one else could do a voice like him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's like sounding whiny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was always him doing
the whiny character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would say "Eureka
Seven," seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, I when- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Original one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I watched that everyone
was talking about this show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like Jesus had came down
himself and brought a show </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I watched it and I thought, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> honestly this is kind of shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's good but like
it's kinda fucking boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that how you feel about- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Obviously now now I will give it a six. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that how you feel
about "Ergo Proxy" as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gave that a seven as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Ergo Proxy" I remember I was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the fuck is happening? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again this doesn't seem like an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you would watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like "Ergo Proxy" is the last anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would think Connor to watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like watching like when you go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a modern art museum
and you look at this shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like, yeah I get
it, that was what I - </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I felt like
watching "Ergo Proxy." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You saying that you've
watched "Ergo Proxy" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the same amount of
like what the fuck I would get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you came up to me tomorrow and said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I watched "Serial Experiments Lain." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that shit I've been wanting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to watch that for a while. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I just haven't had the
opportunity to be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I wanna waste a day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And not really enjoy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And have an avid brain that is hurting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I feel like you
watch shows that to come out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> with like just your brain being like what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like that's not fun half
the time, so I never even- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean it is fun depending on your mood </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I remember like, I took me ages </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to watch "Serial Experiments Lain" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I was just in this
weird mood where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, I want my mind to be fucked up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That sounds like a fun
experience right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I did it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna challenge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's like me with,
you've asked me "Pun Pun." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm waiting to wake up
for the day where I'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I want depression right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why the fuck did I give
this anime, what's it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I noticed that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why would you, I was about to say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you gave that a nine and I'm
like, was it the milf titties, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that what it is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It must have been milf titties. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It must have been milf titties, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all I remember from that show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They get it a little
two bonus points fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but again, that was in the
same weekend that I watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the other show on the
country will 48 hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I remember "the
Maoyuu Maou Yuusha show" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was like Studio Arms and if
you don't know Studio Arms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not know Studio Arms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were like famous
for being a Hunter studio, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like transitioned into anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's probably why
it connected a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yeah, I mean, that was
like one of the first show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they produced that was an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was seen as just not complete trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I wouldn't call it a
fucking nine out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember there's a
little sexual things going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Some vibes of little
milf, some kind of thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean I'd say as an
impressionable teenager </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can see why you are connected with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on a personal level you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connected with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He connected with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah, I think that's
pretty much everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you haven't rated a lot of these. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would bump Kill the kill at one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for getting me in the hand tie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the only thing I would- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - "Kill la Kill" is what made
me be like, you know what? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Anime girls are hot. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm like, you know what
is there a hand tie of this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and there was. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's how I was
like, oh this is good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why you need to
get into the Jinchis man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're gonna get him into
that event eventually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can run away- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eventually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait okay then, if you liked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "the Maoyuu Maou Yuusha"
did you like "Log Horizon?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I loved, "Log Horizon" is
one of my favorite shows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay that makes sense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's written by the same people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm actually hyped even though I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I need to rewatch a little
bit of Log season two. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I remember I fucking loved the world. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like in "Log Horizon" it's fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Log, was fucking great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Automata" is a fucking amazing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like I don't know how they
like fucking write stories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look am glad as well- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And all the stuff like
that, it's so great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm also glad that the show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't like fucking blow
its load like immediately- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - And stop telling us everything about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I love it when the show
is tease us with the words like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> here's a little crumb- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Crumbling knowledge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they just don't
mention it for a few episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, oh shit
yeah, we all right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're in a fucking
video game and I forget- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And we forget all that.
- We're in a video game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I remember "Log Horizon" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember watching the first
two, three episodes of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dropped it immediately
'cause I'm just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is this Beat a "Sword Art Online." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like the worst I think
muscle Locker Ryzen was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> one like the animation is like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It ain't great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the most typical
five out of 10 animation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this is just a third way seasonal show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And the first three or
so episodes were like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the most generic kind of introduction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you could get to a world. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it didn't start getting
interesting until they properly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> started explaining like
the game mechanics- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - And seeing the game
mechanics being broken, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like within this world was
just so fucking interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that whole awkward
like there was a guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> who would killing the villages? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was fucking cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like we've all
ready sold me immediately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like when they first discovered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that they could make things taste good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they like invented the burger- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, yo this
is really interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This isn't even an easy cut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this is just like an entrepreneur
business fucking anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's what
"Youmore show" was as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was basically just like a
business textbook for read. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - How the fuck do you guys
remember what happens in these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like seven out of 10 shows bro? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The moment something
isn't like exceptional, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like that's going in the field. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Log Horizon" is not a seven anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Log Horizon" is not
a seven out of 10 anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Log Horizon" is an a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Forget. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the "Maoyuu Maou" would
have gone front of the fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> cold that went straight into
the let's forget everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Maoyuu Maou" show was cool
because again, it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again it's against "Dub to Maoyuu Maou" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's like somehow can
like make you learn shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> while reading these stories. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how he does it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I have really- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like spice able, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like spice able exactly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the reason why I love spice able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like I actually
learned like a proper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like useful business skills- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like wait a minute I'm
just getting horny over this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what if this Wharf wife, but I'm learning- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He is a marketing genius. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I'm learning things about
economics, that's not legal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not allowed, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't be horny and
smart at the same time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not how that works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just feel like I have like
amazing brain compression. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I, my brain zips- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What does that mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know like how
when you compress a file </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like lower the memory it takes up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I do with anime
immediately when I'm done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like zip that shit
up, put it in storage, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> forget about that thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then when I rewatch shit,
it's like unzipping the file, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, oh, yeah this did happen, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Has this man like min-maxed his brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I actually think I've sorted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the storage on my brain appropriately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've got a sorting algorithm
literally just for anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My fucking God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yes I think this is
a good time to move on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to our three by threes now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, there's a reason
why I have my laptop up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because we're gonna create, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna share each other's
three by three of anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have we explained, we have
explained at the beginning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We've explained about
three by three are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like to expand further on that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I love seeing people's
three by three right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I feel like a three
by three is the closest thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you get to a Rorschach
test for like animate fans. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - True, true. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - 'Cause you get- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You got to see, 'cause like asking what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> someone's favorite anime is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like a fucking stupid question, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like if you've seen enough animes- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It changes all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It changes all the fucking time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like we've like a kind of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with nine animes to choose from, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a good sample size
to really get a grasp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> on what this person's taste is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like not all their tastes,
because I don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how hard a time you guys
had choosing nine anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just shoved through
to get nine that I like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I had a pretty difficult time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just choosing my nine anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You have a fucking, you
putting like a seizure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just thinking like what am I
gonna do for like breakfast? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like oh, my God, like Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I swear, you like take so long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to contemplate decisions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I can come up
with mine pretty quickly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just because like I literally
thought of the first nine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> we're gonna look at mine first. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But I literally just
thought of the first nine </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that I think is like, yeah I love this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because I think that's
the most important thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is like, I feel if you
think too hard about it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> then you will kind of
reshaping your tastes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Thinking too much is
generally a bad policy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I was like, all right
what are the nine shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I fucking love? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thinking is just a bad policy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I personally think is
overrated, I just go with guts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that an unpopular opinion? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unpopular opinions and
thinking's overrated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thinking is overrated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right so let's take
a look at mine first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's see what you got here Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Lucky Star" Connor yo what the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you wanna introduce to
the audience who cannot see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or don't go to these shows? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] So top row from left to right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> is "Serial Experiments Lain, Palepoli." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Middle row

<SPEAKER_08> "Lucky Star Mononoke" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> And then bottom row is
"Shitokayak, Automo," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Monogatira series, Yuhacha." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why, "Lucky Star?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I I've got to ask, man, why? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It's right bang there in the sense of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Starring at me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't worry about placements too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't worry about placements too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This could be in any
random order, but yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Reason why, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I completely get why
someone would look at me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> and say for bro "Lucky star" is not good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because truth be told </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you watch "Lucky Star" today, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it probably be sure, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "Lucky Star" to me is so time-sensitive </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because all of its jokes
are time-sensitive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Like "Lucky Star" was one of those shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that made fun of like
"Otaku and Wieve Culture" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back in like the mid 2000s. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm turning this into a like video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I'll tell you a
"Lucky Star" is my friend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Lucky Star" is a Reddit
humor before Reddit got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's it's like the it's
like the late 2000s Reddit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and the Reddit just didn't exist. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, oh,
"Lucky Star" was amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I couldn't sit through it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't finish it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - See like, it's weird
because randomly like a couple </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of days ago I was just scrolling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through YouTube and all my recommended </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there was just like a "Lucky
Star," like funny compilation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Fuck, I haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> heard of "Lucky Stars." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got time for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like six minutes long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck it I've got time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like an Oxymoron to me "Lucky
Star," funny compilation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You guys sucks.
- Excuse me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I don't know, I think
it's because like especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around the time when I watch "Lucky Star," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like really heavily into, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously of course like
animate obviously but, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was really heavily like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Otaku culture especially in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And "Lucky Star" kind of
went over all of that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And putting it to perspective of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's pretty fucking ridiculous looking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from an outsiders perspective. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, just-
- Meat calf is weird, huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, not even that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It was just like the
fucking comic cut scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's still funny to this day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Just because it's so accurate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean I just, I look
back a lot just on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never liked it
originally but I look back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at some of the scenes and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This doesn't age well to me at all." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, exactly and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why I never recommend
"Lucky Star" to people today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it has no issue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The jokes are no issue. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have a question, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck is this
show in the bottom corner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have seen that sure
- [Joey] Which one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the bottom left? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (speaking in a foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] What's the English name? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Fucking, God, I don't even know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] I think I've watched that show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] It's basically like a comedy show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that has in it a lot of itchy jokes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have watched the show.
- I've watched the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I don't remember anything about that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I 100% have watched the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> There's this small girl,
the small girl is angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that she doesn't have big tits right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I laughed.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's one of the jokes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, why is this I your three by three? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay this is in my three by three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> because A, first of all, I
think it's fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> B, it kind of encompasses
my love for comedy, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and my love for Hiei. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're a broad term of a common years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Lucky Star" and the rest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What encompasses your
love for comedy arts? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What about the show it
encompasses your love for comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I don't know what else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, what the fuck answer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were you expecting?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because it's very
insecured and the jokes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that are constructed
are very good like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay the reason why I put this in is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> because it encompasses
my love for trashy shows. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This show is not good in any perspective. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just saying it right now, all right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> This is how you know my three
by three is legit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Give me some of those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (speaking in a foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is not a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's trashy, shitty comedy with HE jokes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's crap, all right?
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And here is the reason why I put it in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Important question then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every show in here, would
you re-watch it today? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You would?
- I would. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You would rewatch "Lucky Star?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did I not just say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was literally watching a
compilation two days ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just know that is a lie honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just didn't believe that.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would a 100% rewatch
all these shows here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I go say, I was like I didn't put it on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was this close to
putting you on the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am glad that you put it on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd put "Yu Yu Hakusho" in
because it represents my love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> for showing in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I got to be honest, right boys? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I legitimately tried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to watch "Yu Yu Hakusho"
no less than a week ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I put it on, first episode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Fuck I can't watch this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I thought it was the "Dab" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then I was like the
"Dab" was too awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw Japanese and fuck
it's awful as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't stand this.
- It talks great, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The audio was driving me insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I actually couldn't watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was such a bad faulty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know that it's old, but I
actually couldn't sit to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So basically your
review of "Yu Yu Hakusho" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is where it's old. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, honestly like I feel bad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'm like that but I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Fuck I actually can't watch this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh read the "Monger" then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God you're really
gonna hit me with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Audio problems? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Read a book. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What was your problem with the audios </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause like "Yu Yu Hakusho" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> from what I remember was
one of my favorite dabs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I never watched the
dabs, I have no idea. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I swear 10 seconds into the
dab like fireless Japaneese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I gotta send the shit off like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well seriously? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who the fuck paid Yoskay
'cause Yoskay fucking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like killed-
- I know this is probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just a case of watching it years later </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and being spoiled for sex- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean for me, I'd put "Yu Yu Hakusho" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because obviously I love my showing in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But I feel like I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never felt the
same level of excitement </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I felt watching and-
- I wish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Yu Yu Hakusho" that
I have from any other- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm envious, I want that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yu Yu Hakusho has
some of my favorite arcs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in all of shown in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Dark Tournament arc Tuesday, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is one of the best arcs in shown in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know the Dark Tournament
is the best tournament arc. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hands down.
- Of all time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hands down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And this is a tournament arc </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that came out fucking 20 years ago now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it buff the tournament genre, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and still is the best. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The reason why Tournament
Hawks have become a meme, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and are so hyped is
because of "Yu Yu Hakusho." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's because of "Yu Yu Hakusho" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like "Dragon Ball" might
have like popularized it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> but then "Yu Yu Hakusho," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> perfected it.
- Perfected it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then it hasn't been perfected since </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but like- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well go on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Also like "Since We," is
one of the best villains </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> in all of showing in as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah and "Togo" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Togo" as well.
- Fucking "Togo" oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Such a good character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not gonna lie growing up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to be Hiei so bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like I looked at Hiei </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like
everything about this guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is so fucking-
- Is he the guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a black hair?
- He's the guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with black hair.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everything about Hiei- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why Could I guess which
one you're talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everything about Hiei
is so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is there's a "Serial
Experiments Lain" at all? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's top left. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think because like well again, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I still think it's fucking
insanely ahead of it's time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Like this was made back
in like the late 90s. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it talks about fucking societal issues </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that are relevant today. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And that's, I don't know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I think that's like a huge artist, like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm curious what kind of
stuff does it talk about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And to show what kind of society- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So basically to grossly oversimplify, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Serial Experiments Lain"
is essentially this idea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> that your digital identity, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and your real life
identity, sees no barrier. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And so basically it
follows obviously lane </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who kind of goes through this
like discovery of herself </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and the world and being like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> wait, so we can create digital identities </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of ourselves on the
quote unquote, internet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, obviously back
then it was very primal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just came out then like 1990- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's 98.
- Eight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just to give them the
"Bloons Tower Defense." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Exactly.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just before "Flash Player," right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fuck.
- But basically, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's this idea that like, wait, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> so if things happen in the digital world, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then is there really
no consequences of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the real world and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very sensical. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they did that in 12 episodes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's, I will attest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that "Serial Experiments
Lain" fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I remember I watched it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first time last year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty recently.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well 'cause he was on like
to watch this forever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I was just like you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm finally in the mood to watch this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll give it a watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember thinking man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this normally when you
see a piece of media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> that focuses around
technology, and like stories </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> around technology.
- Bad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It ages horribly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I remember watching
"Serial Experiments Lain" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and thinking how is this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how does this seem like
it's more relevant now </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> than it is-
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - When it first came out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Over like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because this show-
- Like 10, 20 years ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This show "Low Key" foretold
the future of social media. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I can understand that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you are really in touch
with the internet back then, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you could probably see where it was going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think.
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I think and obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I picked "Serial Experiments Lain" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that obviously because I love it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but also I love I mean the
shows that make you think, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> quote unquote.
- [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That to dive more into that
kind of stuff like you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah make you thonk right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like "Ogre Proxy" is in
the same field as that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love that show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And you know "Rosaphone" as
well was in there as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] And "Climate?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] I mean, I just
think it's good in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> It made me cry like a witch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> It bought my love for mitogenic. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Bought my love for fucking- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Fooly Cooly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor And Joey] Fooly Cooly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Is just a monster piece. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] I've never watched Fooly Cooly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's seven episodes and it feels like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> a fucking five hour long movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a very dense show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Very dense.
- I would say it does not- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why does dense always
just sound like an insult? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a dense model. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a thick show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you want to say? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, it's a it's a compact show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Compact are lesser than dense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Dense sounds like it's
like brick shithouse. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like filled with garbage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, it's a compact show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now I'm listening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Compact? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now I'm listening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There is like "Fooley Cooley" has 24, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I would dare say 24 episodes
worth of material packed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into seven episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would agree with that.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's one of the best
soundtracks of all time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Soundtrack is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've no more questions,
you're free to go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, okay.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, oh no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You had a choice of any anime movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you pick a Ghibli movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, look, man, you gave it this 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> out of 10, was it on your list? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you also didn't change that school? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it a good movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Would I put it as like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What anime movie is the
best anime movie Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's gonna say "Your Name." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're gonna find out when I went to- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's show it Garnt, shall we? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's check out "Mine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Jump right into it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's jump right into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's check out "Mine" and
see see what you guys see that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] All right Well,
we can we can ignore </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> the filth in the middle but, honestly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] What's that
showing in the middle? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It's "Oreimo."
- [Garnt] It's "Oreimo." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay so let me let me let me spell out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my three by three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] So from top left,
going down, row by row. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you got "Your Name, Bakino." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] "Fate Zero,
Evangelion, Oreimo, Log Horizon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One piece, Haruhi or The Disappearance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Black Lagoon."
- [Connor] God this scream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody's gone to anime
"The Two Thousands." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jesus Christ, look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Look at this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Look at this fucking "Black Lagoon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Evangelion and Haruhi" on the scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking get out of here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not gonna lie, I was not
expecting "Black Lagoon" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could see it.
- [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so-
- There's nothing like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never heard anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> about "Black Lagoon"
coming from Garnt's mouth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's fucking good.
- No, it's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just I'm just curious
why Garnt likes it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watch the anime don't review on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking brilliant,
it's one of the shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I haven't had too much
of a chance to talk about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But like before I get into that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let me tell you the thought process </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I (coughing). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me tell the-
- Too much emotion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me tell you the thought process </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I put into like picking these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tell me of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> process Garnt.
- [Joey] Go on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I you know at the beginning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "How the fuck
do I pick my favorites?' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I have like too many favorites </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I can talk about, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So then I thought okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's a big thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> What if I just picked the
anime that I have rewatched? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay.
- [Joey] All right, all right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because if I've rewatched something, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and this is like
rewatching not for my job, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but rewatching for my own enjoyment. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> If I've rewatched something, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that means there is
something fucking special </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about that show that has stuck with me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've felt like I've
wanted to go out of my way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to re-experience that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I agree with that, I agree qith that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - And even even on some shows
that I think is fucking great. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, for example, like
stuff like "Monster" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> or like clearly critically
acclaimed shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not want to rewatch more of those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's had its time in the sun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in terms of like, what I
truly like enjoyed to the cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't go out at the moment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't go out and rewatch "Monster." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't do that but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay hold on, but I get that right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I'm looking at
this right now being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, rewatch that, rewatch that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you rewatch one piece? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have rewatched one piece. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it even possible
to rewatch one piece? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay, I've okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh man you got that
Steins Gate time machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or some shit, Garnt
how are you doing that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, I've watched
one piece basically up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to "The Time Skip" all the way once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I've rewatched it again once. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I've rewatched some
my favorite arcs multiple time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucking know it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this was back when I
had time to watch anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I would just like whenever I got, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever I had time- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you said rewatched right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought you were talking about like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, I've rewatched "The
Water Seven Article, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've rewatched Alabasta." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't think you really watched those. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You really shown your age, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you need years to rewatch that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> No wonder you're older
than me like fuck me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you need like 10 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love how you compensate
and be like no, no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> only up until before the time skip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like it's still like 400 episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why like I was
having trouble putting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a show in on 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is show in that I actually truly love, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I would you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> think that I would go back and design </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I was gonna put "Yu Yu Hakusho" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was thinking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not "Seven Deadly Sins," Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You know my love for
"Seven Deadly Sins" right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like one piece to me will
go down when it finishes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Will go down as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It already is one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the greatest anime/
manga series of all times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But to me when I think back, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think back because one
piece isn't the perfect show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, yeah, I rewatch one piece so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, does anyone claim it is? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Like everyone forgets about
the laws of one piece, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where everyone forgets about the fucking- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - "Sky Island." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Sky Island," I wasn't
a fan of the "Foxy Ark," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was a filler "Cannon Ark" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that everyone doesn't talk about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What does that mean (mumbles). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Dressrosa" was was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was way too long.
- Way too long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was dragged out to shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but nothing in my opinion
can touch the highs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of "One Piece." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When "One Piece" is at its best, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it is the greatest
thing you can find on anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will stand by and say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> even though I've watched
every mitogen anime. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've cried more times
watching "One piece" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> than any other show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - When you have that many episodes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Something's gonna hit right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Like fuck me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is that I wasn't expecting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean like there's plenty of shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that have a lot of episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And haven't had the highs
that "One Piece" has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know as I said man has
some- (laughter drains speech) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you know anything about such? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pokemon has some pretty high highs man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well like what I find amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> about "One Piece" it's been going on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like, what 20 years now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Almost 30. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Almost like, I can't
remember when it's like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it started in-
- 96. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 98 or 96 something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I remember I've just
caught up with the manga </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like, what the one oak </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is now one of the longest oaks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so long that has three parts . </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it still has moments that
make me feel fucking magical. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like one piece
is like I watched some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the best moments in "One Piece" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I get reminded this is
why I fucking love anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is why I love fucking love manga . </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is why I love this medium. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did the author of "One Piece" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like intend for it to be as long as it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or just like fucking just popularized? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think he had planned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the thing about "One
Piece" is that it's this long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And yet there is this foreshadowing slap </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's happened like fucking
hundreds of chapters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's not from this planet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is being explored now, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think he didn't
expect it to be this long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But he but when he got popular, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he realized he can explore
basically every idea here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that he wanted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of people, I feel
kind of undermine Oda, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just because it's like, oh yeah, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> he made one piece but whatever. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's so long blah blah blah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think people when
you look deeply into it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people really undermine
his skill for storytelling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because I mean again- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's be honest, you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to be held accountable like captivated- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's been number one on "Shonen Jump" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the past like 15 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you don't do that by luck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not luck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unlike what I find amazing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's been going on this
long and it's not one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no it's not only still got
fucking amazing moments in it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even when some of the greatest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in some of the latest chapters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some of the latest moments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But to no matter how far
you go into "One Piece," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you feel like there's still an upswing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You still feel like he hasn't peaked yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unlike how would you write a story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like almost a 1000 chapters long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you still think man
there's an upswing coming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's something great upcoming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's insane every
time a new arc started. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And I would keep up to date </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with like what the manga was saying. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Everyone would be like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how is it that the next
arc is even better? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> How does it keep getting better? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah how- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought this was
the peak of "One Piece" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it just keeps getting there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - How's the hotdog stand arc,
keep just blowing me away? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> How does the waterpocket
venture supreme arc, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> keep blowing me away? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah re- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the name doesn't
make fucking sense to me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no it is
literally that proZD video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it talks about anime arc names. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Unlike any "One Piece" fan
who's watched that video knows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that he's just calling
out "One Piece" fans there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> because we were literally
talking about this video </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> before the podcast started. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And we were just, me and
Joey we were just talking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about "The Big Mamak." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- And then Connie </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> was just like, oh yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a real arc, are you guys serious? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought they were joking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> They were just like a big
momma's house or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was just a joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I felt that right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember when I've
watched the "Alabaster Rock" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in one case, I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the greatest thing ever made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then "Water Seven
Came" out was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how it getting better? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then the "White Beard Rock" came in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - "White Beard Rock"
was just like oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Guys, guys guys, I
hate to rush you Garnet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we have nine anime to talk about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So come on.
- I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can talk about one until the fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sun goes down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] 'Cause frankly
I don't really wanna hear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your opinions on this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I honestly do not know
about it, even galieon- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] I already know
your opinions on "Eva," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I already know your
opinions on "Your Name," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I already know your opinions "On Fate." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Back in there was
like saying I like "Coming." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Back in there
I was like I like "Six" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of course you do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] It's just fun, it's just fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] And then we've gushed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> over "Hierarchy" obviously
like disappearance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Motorizing as well
very excited to see that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause like I was thinking back to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because obviously I'm the
fucking Issa Kai man, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was thinking like, "Log Horizon" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is the Issa Kai come back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's the only
Issa Kai I've rewatched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Out of everything like
"Reasonable" I watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> because it was my job. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought that was
literally the only reason </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I watched "Re:Zero." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "Log Horizon" is the only
Issa Kai I've come back </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to be like, man that was
some good fucking moments </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in this and I really wanted
to re-experience some </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of these ideas that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well season three is out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'm probably gonna rewatch- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think now, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, it's out this season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm probably gonna re like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Log Horizon" is the only
like pure Isa Kai right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I can like recommend
without it's got no catch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Like it's not like "Re:Zero" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where it's like oh it's so
time loop catch you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's the interesting thing
about "Log Horizon" is just- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Hey guys, hey guys.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - There's a gimmick. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Log Hhorizon" is just an Issa Kai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is just like good Issa Kai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I agree.
- I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I agree, it deserves to
be a it has its place. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just can't get over the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that you on ironically like "Arima" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just like it for the
longest time I'm like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is "Arima or bound?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the child bound.
- Incest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's it, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not about incest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It is about insects.
- It is about incest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Incest just happens in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a difference between the two Mr. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is about incest and
Beskow getting cocked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what that's all about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't just say
there is incest in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's like a sense of of flavor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can't just drop that
in there and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, there's also like, What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What do you mean is this a
small thing incest to you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is something okay, so let me- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Defend incest 4k edition. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm a fucking doer
man, I'm a fucking doer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't care if this like
watch this get me counseled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like four years or
like fuck four years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Watch this clip in 40 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get counts it like one
month, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, everyone forgets that "Oreimo" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was a legitimately good fucking show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it first aired. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna have to stop you right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was a good show.
- I'm gonna have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to stop you right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like everyone thinks I put "Oreimo" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the same level or something
like "Eromanga Sensei." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No fucking "Eromanga Sensei"
was trashed from episode one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it knew it was trash. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And "Eromanga Sensei is what happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you take all the
trashiest parts of "Oreimo" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and put that and put that into a show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oreimo" was a nice, wholesome
look at Otaku culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With incest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the thing is when it was airing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, yeah, this is this is a parody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of all like the incest light novels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was about a parody. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone thought that he
was just taking the piss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of like, you know, this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the little girl Emoto
fucking craze happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in anime on line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you don't watch
the final three episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can watch the entire
series of series of "Oreimo" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just think that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the final three
episodes happened and it- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That has sparked an outcry I didn't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's sparked an outcry right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's definitely because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason the reason
it sparked an outcry was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because no one was actually expecting it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it went from
like, 20% incest to 99% . </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was 100% .
- It was 100%. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a 100 there was no percentage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that could be shaved off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It went full incest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was unapologetic person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So fully admit that
it would full incest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yet it's in your top nine anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because the reason it's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I have re watched it because it is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've rewatched it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I've already said I've rewatched
everything on this list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - How do you?
- I don't even want to see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because this show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like this show is the
epitome of everything I love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about trashy Eromanga and anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's-
- When you say that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it just sounds like satire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean,
it sounds like satire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is not, it is not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so remember when you
went through my anime list, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I gave "Iketose" a two? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like, back when I was a teenager, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like yo- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You couldn't have real interest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo, yo, I'm better than
this fan service shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm better than this trashy anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got a good fucking taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the show that
fucking changed all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> When I was just like, why
am I enjoying this so much? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why do I like this
fucking filth trash show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean look, I have shows like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, "The Kisses" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being a perfect example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I didn't put it in my
fucking three by three though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, this buddy is putting incest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in his fucking top nine, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - In the middle of all places. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was a legitimate deliberate choice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I put it in the middle
because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this is this show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This single show has probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had the biggest overall effects </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on my taste in modern anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You literally fucking made "Oriema" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out to be like the free
space in a bingo card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean, it's just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fucking did it and because it is yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is a fucking trashy anime, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are trash moments there but, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I will defend the point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That "Oriemo" wasn't complete trash. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There was some legitimately
good heartwarming moments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in there and it wasn't complete. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It wasn't all trash, okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was it wasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> an "Eromanga Sensei"
- It really was okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't "Eromanga Sensei" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just saying, you're going to jail buddy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Eromanga Sensei" is
already EMA rescanned. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all it is and you
have to admit to that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to admit to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Eromanga Sensei" is the trashiest plus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of "Oreimo" concentrated
it is dense "Oreimo." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your Honor, I didn't know she was 12, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll be honest, Your Honor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ladies and gentlemen this
man has the largest anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> YouTube channel on the platform, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that this is what he's saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm fucking proud of
this shit, I put it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally put this
stuff front and center, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I regret nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I regret fucking nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is on my computer now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I can't wait to use it as blackmail. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, let's check corners. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gentlemen, gentlemen, here's my nine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> My arguably the strongest
nine we've had today. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Okay, you want to
go from top left to bottom? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] So, "Hunter
Hunter, Golden time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Bow Corrado, Ping Pong Animation , </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sakamoto, Kaiji Mob
Psycho 100, But on a Fish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Jojo." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll tell you what this is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the guys, I have
good tastes in animi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lick off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just about to say that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro isn't it good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like how? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Guys you wanna know
what personality I have? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Absolutely no fucking personality. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sorry that I
don't like incest Garnt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is that what you wanna see on my list? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where is the lack of incest? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the I cite my
sources in my video essay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like levels of like animatates,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No bro, these are legitimately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> If I had to use a name
like the top nine shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I have and like a little
bit of variation genre. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This would be it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, because
I looked at this list </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, yeah
this is what my nine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> by nine would be, if I literally went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> through my like modern Mao </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and just pick the top highest
rated anime on that mount. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm trying to tell you my
fucking tastes in anime Garnt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is my taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sorry that's its
too normy for you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is no no, no, it's not even normy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just it's try hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, it's legit.
- That is what it feels like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is legit my favorite nine shows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, well I mean,
obviously we don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> hold on to get fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] We've talked about "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] "Golden Time"
is like my favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like "Volcarona."
- [Joey] We talked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about "Volcarona."
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] "Ping Pong."
- [Connor] I fucking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> love "Ping Pong."
- [Joey] Can you still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like "Ping Pong?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] 100% right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] I love "Ping Pong." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Ping Pong," right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Other than like mob, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that's also why I love them
all for the similar reasons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like "Ping Pong" is like one
of the only animators right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You get all these fucking stupid animates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when the guys Opie is fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it no one fucking gives a shit right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, okay, wow, Kyoto is
a giant dick again, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Cool, we have another Isa Kai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, that overpowered . </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, they have an ability
that's unique to them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what real life sucks, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one has a unique ability. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've really liked there's
a fucking anime that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bro, life kind of sucks, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes people just
gonna be better at things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that you love, even if they hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's was so real and hurt man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It hurt because I've been on both sides </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the "Ping Pong" like
animation, like the characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been talented at
something that I fucking hated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I felt bad for
people who really wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be good at that thing
that I was good at. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've also tried my
fucking hardest at something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and you speak Japanese fluently above. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, you know, I've been on
both sides of the spectrum </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of things on the animation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, you know, I'm kidding
now, but I mean really. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Ping Pong." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What I call what I call "Ping Pong", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a life anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it hurt because I was like, fuck, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you really had to like
pull that out of me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That made me a little like goddamn okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, then I'm curious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Have you seen a "March
Comes in Like a Lion?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay 'cause I think
if you love "Ping Pong," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you would love-
- Everyone has told me that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because "March Comes in Like a Lion" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "March Comes in Like a
Lion" is about a genius </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who can't understand the idea of losing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But that in itself, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is what's causing him
to lose in real life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it's literally the
opposite of "Ping Pong." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That just like school when they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're a gifted child </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and they can't fucking
do anything later on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, and obviously like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well I wanna know, why
why "Sakamoto" three? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is that a top nine anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so fucking
funny man, that's shit- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm about to stand with my boy here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like "Sakamoto" is fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Sakamoto" is one of
the funniest animes- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Sakamoto" is so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so fun.
- It's so funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can put that shit on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the "Mr. Bean" of anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the "Mr. Bean" of anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if "Mr. Bean" was like a
fucking like a millionaire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was pocking any where. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Shit so, you really got to diss me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you just like what like yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Pedophilia, "Brotherly Love." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay here is what I understand though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every three by three right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> As we've established so far, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and every three by three I've
seen back when it was big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> has at least one show that shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like universally, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think all these shows
are fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is why I just press X to doubt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just don't like shit shows Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Which do you want to put
like "My Whole Demon" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or some shit missing still. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This thing was made as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't have like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you have a guilty pleasure anime? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, no, no, really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't really watch anime ever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, the grand reveal? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I frankly, I've revealed this before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I never fucking want to
re watch anime, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you wouldn't re watch any of these? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would I rewatch
that I've already watched? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause do you don't
want to re-experience it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll be honest with you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd rather experience something different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So there's no like you will rewatch? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like have you never
gotten to the point right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you're just tired
of trying something new. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And because no, no, you're you're tired </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of trying something new.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why do you make it sound so sad? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just tired of trying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna go back this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because it's fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because sometimes you try something new </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just like, "Man this
just ain't doing it for me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just want something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You want something
that's it's comfortable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know for me that feels sad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It feels like you're trying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to capture something
that's gone in your life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean, I
don't know it feel sad to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm in this photo and I don't like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's chasing something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that doesn't exist anymore in my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is Maylene laughing at me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because in my mind, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I could I could easily
I watch like "Sakamoto." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I couldn't have rewatched any of these? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Would I willingly do
it of my own free will? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not because like to
bring it the other way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like for me watching new
shows is me chasing that high. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That that is me chasing that high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I felt with the
shows I've already liked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the more anime you watch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and just the older you fucking get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that just gets harder and harder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I don't
watch my channel anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the thing inside
reveal of this video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor doesn't watch anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I do, I watch anime
I just don't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean look, honestly like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I feeling sauce about this three by three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just because again because
all nine of these shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> are like universally praised. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All is "Golden Time"
universally praised? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, "Golden Time" is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I felt it was trash. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fucking love "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Golden Time" took everything for- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought it was trash and I liked it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was trash. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No "Golden Time" took
everything "Toradora" did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just perfected it.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would literally it's
like if you like in my mind, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like my two favorite
like romance or whatever like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Todora and "Golden
Time" but "Golden Time" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> felt like the better version. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Golden Time" is my
favorite romance of all time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would think and yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I thought he doesn't like "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I love "Golden Time."
- Okay shit, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've met less people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who say they didn't like "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause like the thing
about "Golden Time" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that you know there were flaws </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because who the fuck like
binary as a character? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like talking about
compressing your memory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I've only just remembered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that ghost boundary was a thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And that was just something I've just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that was like sports. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> In this like amazing series </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's I seem to remember "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But like I think that's "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just think this is how
adult romance should be. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> This took everything that was good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as you said about "Toradora" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and just made it better, perfected it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Put it in university, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't make it like just
this high school romance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Had enough adult elements that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Didn't have an annoying
us fucking lowly younger- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - True that was really fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love "Kajou" the against
the "Gambler" that was- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Kajou" is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Kajou" is great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whatever shows it's sad
that no one gives a chance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it also weird that it's only in 720P. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's really fucking weird, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> no for ATP I think or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah that was never released- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah it isn't for ATP. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It isn't for ATP </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's such a shame
'cause like it's such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a fucking good show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was either that or like "One Outs," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really fucking like "One Outs." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "One Outs" is fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "One Outs" is fucking dope, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean I guess it looks very
basic from the outside looking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not basic, it's not basic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not basic in the sense where- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just thought we were
putting on nine favorite shows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like oh like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no we were, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but what we're saying is that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there isn't a single guilty
pleasure animate here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Because obviously- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Refers to guilty pleasure anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well I can show you those bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oreamo" that's more
than a guilty pleasure, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a criminal pleasure Joey I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - A guilty pleasure, in my
opinion a guilty pleasure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is a show that you love no matter what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though you know it is shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yep, okay, but then I when I
was making this nine by nine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> looks like "Deadman Wonderland." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I loved "Deadman Wonderland" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never finished and it was you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was kind of a mess of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, I don't think
it's better than any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of these shows for me personally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like I've talked to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and I know what your tastes are basically. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You're trying to call me out? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I don't really
see that represented here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because I know like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You my tastes like you know
me Garnt, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like you only hunging
out for a couple weeks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you calling me a liar? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you calling me a liar Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We hardly see each other everyday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, like I know
you love like fucking hot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cold brutal shows like
"Jojo, Baqi, Gantz:e." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised I thought
"Baqi" was gonna be there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought "Baqi" was
gonna be up there as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, I love
"Baqi" as like 'cause there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a few episodes in "Baqi" the
anime but it's like mate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's just so many
fucking funny moments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that like it'll stand to me forever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's the best way I can do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know you like Chad shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the best way-
- I like a Chad show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the best way can
describe Connor's taste, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's just got Chad characters in it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Chad characters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I really want Conner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to watch or read "Face the North" stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause I know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you would fucking love that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like the right amount of chat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If there's just too much chat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes a little too much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean, you like "Jojo" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that's like a hall of a chat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a different, that's
a different kind of chat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Jojo"is like the build different anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Like that is on own league
like Garnt has said. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think God should be treated as anime, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's a lifestyle. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- It's an artwork. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like in "Facing the North Star," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I see that I really
find that appealing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because they're just like too match show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want a bit of weakness
to the character, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, if you've read it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you'll know every
character is weak as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Read it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, okay, fine, fine. Fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think you should
read it, you'll love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It pisses me off when
I'm watching an anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the main character is like
a wimp beyond comprehension </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just causes any problems
himself because he's a wimp. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, yeah, listen,
we'll get to do what you say no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ,and you wouldn't have been dragged off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a call or something- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you talking about "Daycare?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, something else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's a lot of shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> where I'm just like this
literally could have been avoided </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you just like stopped yourself right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> from seconds like this
whole problem, you know? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know ma like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not satisfied.
- I have a good taste? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not satisfied with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Will offer me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Will you offer me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just some shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you're expecting
me to have shit taste? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is like too polished. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have good taste, what can I say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can I can make a
better one three by three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Go on, make my three by three for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay it would be like
I said it would be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Jojo, Baqi," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Baqi," yes I love "Baqi" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's not in my top nine shows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you talked about it so often. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I love it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's I wouldn't put it
higher than any of these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for enjoyment in my mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like it's it's okay because- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Show that I love and shows
that I want to talk about, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are like different I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's okay like this is
like getting like it like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess that we should have defined </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the rules more appropriately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> It should be like Connor,
give me the nine shows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that you think about,
keep you up at night. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's what I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well you didn't tell me you said put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> your nine favorite shows
that represent you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What like, What I don't
understand is you say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like the shows I talk about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it shows I like I'm not the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Why would you talk about a
show if it's not your favorite? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's some shows just
like well, "Ping Pong" right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all of it is encaptured in the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's nothing more to add
on but you fucking watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like like it's amazing, I
fucking love it and watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't improve it.
- No buddy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - By talking about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the exact point right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you sometimes you see a good show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and you like fuck me,
that was a good show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I'd like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't talk about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, but
sometimes you watch a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and you're like, man,
this is sticking with me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> This is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like "Ping Pong" stuck with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, though I'm not saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Ping Pong" shouldn't be on this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What shouldn't be on this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Hunter Hunter?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, five dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Hunter Hunter" through
that shit move me man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I see you talking more about
"Pokey" than "Hunter Hunter." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's because, okay
let's be honest, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Mob Psycho: and "Hunter Hunter," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I rarely hear you talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I never had talking about this at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay I talk about "One
Punch" more than talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about "Mob Psycho." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, why did "One
Punch make it there?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I think "Mob
Psycho" is a better show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than "One Punch" man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well then why wouldn't
you talk about "Mob Psycho" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's a better show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well again, 'cause it's a better show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I feel like there's not much to say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, just go watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But this is like like my favorite show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause "Baqi" I love "Baqi" right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, I have to sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Listen get to the point
where he fucks someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and becomes extra powerful." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I love having that conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, if you haven't seen "Baqi" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a scene where he has sex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was on only one scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, honestly, and
that one scene is enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to be like anime of the year on my mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, give it an award. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's exactly what I'm fucking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a scene that's stuck with you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can bring up and
you want to bring up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So why was that not this is dope? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the way that I see it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that like, let's say Garnt wants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to take me to like an event and he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he has to specifically
tell me like Connor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> don't bring up the "Baqi"
sex scene to like my friends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the level of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just want to talk about it like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not like it's defined my taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For some reason, I just want
to talk about that scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and how fucking weird it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like Cannon
when I'm talking to you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know kind of shows you would like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You look at someone's three over three </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you can like recommend some shows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that they would like for example. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I knew, for example,
that you would love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a show like "Dota Had
Dodo" you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Cause that that is grimy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's grimy, it's a Chad anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just Connor it just you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just gonna say if I
didn't see this three by three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you told, no, no, and if
you ask me me recommend me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an anime, "Ping Pong" is the
last one I would bring up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - For me?
- For you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It again it just doesn't seem
like a show you would like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I love that that's actually
like top three five. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can see the biggest
the biggest one for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like "Mob Psycho" and "Hunter Hunter." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro "Hunter Hunter" is my
favorite show to the whole show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sorry, "Hunter Hunter" is my
favorite show of all time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What about "Jojo?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't really count that as a show in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - It is a show in.
- But it is a show in. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - It has to be categorized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's no "Jojo" category. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> But that should be as far
as I'm concerned, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay that's it, then what
is this "Jojo" category then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just, "Jojo" is like
its own beast right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's nothing you can compare "Jojo" to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I agree with him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I disagree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, compare "Jojo"
to this something right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Baqi." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I's not the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not exactly I'm not saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that both the same thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> But they give off the same
kind of feeling you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where's just like there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is some ridiculous
fucking things happening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're just having- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A summer good time? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yes, but also-
- No, no, no, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not saying that they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on like the same level or anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But they give off the same vibe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the thing is they're
just both fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the thing is-
- I'd ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that a bunch of 80s
and 90s shown in back then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had this kind of feel to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like "Face the North
Star" also has scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck did I just read? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you just recommended
them that to him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause you think he would- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- No, that's exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I'm showing in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Jojo" when like halfway through, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is like, right let's just be gay now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, trust me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a lot of gay parts
in "Fcing the North Star." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And is that really?
- Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I just thought it was like
the manliest manly anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> ever in existence like.
- [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I guess that's pretty gay and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is pretty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's pretty gay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is a thing called bara, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if you're a where of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's good to say the YMCA
music video is pretty manly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty manly, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But "Pinata Fish" is one
of my favorite shows as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking love "Pinata Fish." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, "Pinata Fish" is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Pinata Fish" is a good show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I was expecting
that because you've talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about it before, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You've even made a whole
video on "Pinata Fish", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I expected that but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - So you're complaining that
I picked good shows, is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes.
- What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because everybody's three by three has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to have at least one show where it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hold on a second. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's see if I could put a bad show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I like in my three by three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's got to be at least one- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You'll see the money conman. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What I'm saying is
every three by three has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to have at least one shitty
show that you know is shitty, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just don't care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look, look. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly what is it the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Walled Garden Merits" that's a shit show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you put that on here? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also you probably would. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you see what I'm making this right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We had like what like

<SPEAKER_05> Jojo, Vampire Knight, Golden
Kamuy, Story of Saiunkoku, </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_07> - I've watched all of
these at least two or two, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> two to five times each. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> (crowd mumbling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did not influencer her, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's told the same thing with
it's the shows you rewatch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and the shows you just get back to. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> - Most of my body pillows are the Hakuoki. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (both mumbling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay, let me
preface that I think out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all of us, Maylene
owns more body pillows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than the three of us put together. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many do you own?
- How many do you own? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right now in Japan, I only- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no al together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Including in the US, how many do you own. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know like 50. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But hold on, hold on they're
not all big body pillows. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's doesn't make it any better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't matter we
weren't asking about the size. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We are asking about the number. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I do have that- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hey five zero.
- Five zero. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I do have like kitchen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - A new queen of degeneracy
has come along man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I even have you know the body spray </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to make the pillow smell
like the official character. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because why not? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You wanna know what they
know what they smell like? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you boys honestly
want me to be like this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this what you wanted from me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Listen, you can be the weird one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This guy likes his
children, he can have that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm very normal thank you very much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think enough else and the other show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I got a thorough grilling
on the entire episode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from having normal tastes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm happy to have normal tastes this time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I've heard of I've
watched "Cres" actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was incestuous. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that is very incestuous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That is like "Oreimo" but
with beautiful characters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that she's "Oreimo" gender based. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - There is two incestuous anime on here, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> the "Vampire Night."

<SPEAKER_02> - This is what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Again, I mentioned I do not
know anything about the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The only thing I know it's the only person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who love that show to
about to be a pedophile. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So Maylene.
- I'm not a pedophile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know man, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, yeah.

<SPEAKER_06> like they're so fucking old dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will though say that I- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This was once in like
Minecraft potato corner team. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_07> - No.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> You just know that because
Maylene placed the catch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not a princess like "Idol Master" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> if they were all guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so like out of
everyone here Maylene, </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> There's more future bait on here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than actual like regular shows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Jojo" counts as "Bujo" so? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - At the bottom three,
is like all "Bujo' based. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm saying that out
of all of this, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like from "The New World" </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm normal, I like normal shows. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Monsters" pretty normal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think.

<SPEAKER_07> - I like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I am a normal human being- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - NO, no but these two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know why you like

<SPEAKER_08> But you know what? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It was more entertaining </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> than honest fucking if

<SPEAKER_05> - The incest one.
- Yeah that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a better way to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen, I can't always
