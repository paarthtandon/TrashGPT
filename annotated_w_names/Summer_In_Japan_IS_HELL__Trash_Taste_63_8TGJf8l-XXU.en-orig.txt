<connor> hate it when you can't complain about </connor>
<connor> the weather where you're from it's like </connor>
<connor> you know what i i said on twitter i was </connor>

<connor> something to be proud of you live in a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like the actual sun </garnt>
<garnt> i [ __ ] hate that [ __ ] like no matter </garnt>
<garnt> how hot it is where you are and you </garnt>
<garnt> could be [ __ ] dying in the sahara </garnt>
<garnt> desert or something you get to you get </garnt>
<garnt> to like the nearest town you're like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] man i just survived the sahara and </garnt>
<garnt> someone from texas or somewhere and be </garnt>
<connor> like oh how hot was it how hot was it </connor>
<connor> you didn't measure it when you measure </connor>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<garnt> where i am a little [ __ ] no because </garnt>
<garnt> what i've realized okay i've like living </garnt>
<garnt> in japan has made me change my opinion </garnt>
<connor> because before </connor>
<connor> okay so before moving to japan or before </connor>
<connor> like moving on to totally unrelated </connor>
<connor> it's not totally unrelated because </connor>
<garnt> before moving to japan or moving out of </garnt>
<garnt> england my favorite season was summer </garnt>
<connor> okay yeah i was i was we've discussed </connor>
<garnt> this in the podcast before and we were </garnt>
<connor> like yeah </connor>
<connor> or maybe it was just off camera </connor>
<connor> i remember we were like talking about </connor>
<garnt> because i think you and i both like the </garnt>
<joey> winter like much much more winter's </joey>
<garnt> worth season lots </garnt>
<garnt> off winter's worst season maybe this </garnt>
<connor> should become a conversation that we </connor>
<garnt> have every single year the summer turns </garnt>
<garnt> around and everyone's like you guys </garnt>
<garnt> spoke about this already i'm like it's </garnt>
<garnt> in my head shut up no because like i i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't realize that uh </garnt>
<connor> it's like summer wind uh summers in </connor>
<connor> england are actually pretty good and </connor>
<connor> that's why summer was my favorite season </connor>
<joey> that doesn't get in england it's like 25 </joey>
<connor> degrees celsius summer yeah that's the </connor>
<connor> thing right that's the thing no no it </connor>
<garnt> gets hotter than that god that gets </garnt>
<garnt> harder one there's someone the summer </garnt>
<connor> before we left right yeah but that one </connor>
<connor> week is pure hell because uk we don't </connor>
<connor> have air conditioning just doesn't exist </connor>
<joey> true in homes yeah the one time i went </joey>
<joey> to the uk it was during that week it's </joey>
<connor> horrible because you know at least in </connor>
<connor> japanese summer it's like oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> walking outside [ __ ] this is </connor>
<connor> it's it's way worse but you can just go </connor>
<joey> in any any building anywhere and you're </joey>
<joey> like oh cool </joey>
<connor> they've got the they've got yeah they've </connor>
<joey> got the ac running at full like full </joey>
<joey> blast like it's good but in the uk </joey>
<joey> you have no escape in the uk it's like </joey>
<joey> maybe the gym has ac the supermarket </joey>
<connor> probably has it but like that's it like </connor>
<connor> when you go home you're like </connor>
<garnt> put on the tv </garnt>
<garnt> yeah cause like what do you do to cool </garnt>
<garnt> down in the uk have like nine fans on </garnt>
<garnt> you so so you do have bands yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> fans don't do [ __ ] yeah fans don't do </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] fans are like that's just </joey>
<joey> dissipating </joey>
<joey> placebos yeah of like you're like yeah </joey>
<connor> it's definitely doing something you're </connor>
<connor> like why am i still sweating so much </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> because all it is is just taking the </joey>
<joey> stagnant hot air and just moving it </joey>
<connor> around right yeah occasionally i just </connor>
<connor> like you go up to it you know i put my </connor>
<connor> shirt over the fan yeah i'm like this is </connor>
<connor> true cooling that's that's the best </connor>
<connor> feature </connor>
<connor> maybe it's a nostalgia thing for me </connor>
<connor> because growing up or like spending my </connor>
<connor> summers in thailand uh you know um in </connor>
<connor> thailand we tried to save costs as much </connor>
<connor> as possible you know so </connor>
<connor> like the ac is always like the last </connor>
<connor> resort that's like when we're literally </connor>
<connor> like dying of heat stroke yeah any other </connor>
<connor> time it's just like come on you can </connor>
<connor> survive with the fan so like i spent </connor>
<connor> most of my like time and experience </connor>
<connor> being cooled down by a fan and ac was </connor>
<connor> just like okay if we don't put the ac on </connor>
<connor> we're probably going to die here so it's </connor>
<connor> it's i think that's why it's like kind </connor>
<connor> of nostalgic for me like </connor>
<connor> i kind of like the fan like i kind of </connor>
<connor> like the female fan just just on me but </connor>
<connor> i admit like if you're not used to it </connor>
<connor> like i felt sorry when you visited </connor>
<connor> yanaki visited us in the uk because you </connor>
<connor> have to subscribe yes yes sleep in my </connor>
<connor> room and we that was like there was one </connor>
<connor> fan in there there was a single fan in </connor>
<garnt> like my entire house like joey you can </garnt>
<garnt> have the fan and i was like i don't </garnt>
<joey> think i actually did anything for you </joey>
<joey> i was butt [ __ ] naked in your bed i'm </joey>
<connor> like i'm still dying it sucks it it </connor>
<connor> doesn't help and it doesn't get cold </connor>
<joey> during the night the fan yeah i get like </joey>
<joey> the whole like fan being nostalgic </joey>
<connor> though because like i have that exact </connor>
<connor> same thing at my suffering is nostalgic </connor>
<connor> for me </connor>
<connor> at my grandma's old place in the middle </connor>
<connor> of nowhere in the mountains yeah we </connor>
<connor> didn't have ac </connor>
<connor> it was just because the house was too </connor>
<connor> big to have a single ac unit yeah like </connor>
<connor> also all the doors were always open so </connor>
<connor> it was always with a fan yeah but is it </connor>
<connor> it's nostalgic </connor>
<connor> is it good memories though no </connor>
<connor> i love just dying slowly </connor>
<joey> that was the time when i almost died of </joey>
<connor> heat in my grandma's house good times </connor>
<connor> you might be confusing nostalgic with </connor>
<connor> like ptsd </connor>
<connor> i like i like the feeling of like i </connor>
<joey> prefer the heat the feeling of summer </joey>
<joey> over winter like any day of the week i </joey>
<joey> don't know i'm just like i'm just </joey>
<joey> depressed in winter winter's just like </joey>
<garnt> even even like dying in this heat i </garnt>
<garnt> still prefer </garnt>
<joey> what i'm experiencing experiencing now </joey>
<joey> to winter what what happens to you in </joey>
<garnt> the winter </garnt>
<connor> yeah what happens which is just the </connor>
<connor> worst scene to [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it is it's the worst season okay okay </connor>
<connor> okay yeah i think it's like </connor>
<connor> scientifically proven that </connor>
<connor> people are less people are more happy </connor>
<joey> with more sunlight right </joey>
<joey> i think it's literally more healthier </joey>
<joey> for you to get more sunlight because you </joey>
<joey> are literally happier see more there is </joey>
<joey> sunlight in the window there's like </joey>
<joey> barely any sunlight in the winter and </joey>
<joey> okay here's here's the thing that </joey>
<joey> depresses me the most okay especially if </joey>
<joey> you're working a nine-to-five job you </joey>
<joey> have to commute to work you wake up it's </joey>
<connor> you wake up maybe seven a.m or whatever </connor>
<connor> if if you have to commute long it's like </connor>
<connor> seven eight a.m you wake up it's dark </connor>
<connor> you go to the office at nine and it's </connor>
<garnt> still just like the sun's just rising i </garnt>
<garnt> love you stay </garnt>
<connor> you stay inside literally all day you're </connor>
<garnt> just in the office with after artificial </garnt>
<garnt> light you go out it's 5 p.m and again </garnt>
<garnt> it's dark i like that i like the night </garnt>
<connor> how could </connor>
<garnt> like how can you look how could you not </garnt>
<garnt> want any sunshine in your life </garnt>
<garnt> you know most of the time i have my </garnt>
<garnt> curtains closed </garnt>
<garnt> too hot even </garnt>
<connor> in my office now i have them closed all </connor>
<garnt> the time and like the second thing </garnt>
<garnt> everything's dead in the winter there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's no color at all you look outside </garnt>
<garnt> everything's gray everything's drab how </garnt>
<garnt> can you be happy with like zero color i </garnt>
<connor> don't know i i just think you're you're </connor>
<connor> a boring person </connor>
<garnt> like like literally the only thing to </garnt>
<connor> look forward to in winter is christmas </connor>
<connor> like i'm pretty sure they're interesting </connor>
<connor> about christmas i'm pretty sure they </connor>
<connor> invented christmas because if they </connor>
<garnt> didn't have christmas like everyone </garnt>
<garnt> would just have nothing to look forward </garnt>
<joey> to objection i'm from australia we </joey>
<garnt> didn't have such thing okay </garnt>
<joey> you know i don't know it's it's fun it's </joey>
<joey> cozy you know you get to it's yeah it's </joey>
<joey> cozy you get to also you get the most </joey>
<connor> drip in winter you know like i agree </connor>
<connor> okay that you get no drip in there </connor>
<garnt> i wouldn't be wearing this i wouldn't i </garnt>
<joey> wouldn't be wearing this drip in the </joey>
<joey> winter </joey>
<joey> you get the best drip and you get the </joey>
<connor> best sleep </connor>
<garnt> yeah the sleep is clean yeah i don't </garnt>
<connor> know the sleep the window open a little </connor>
<connor> bit sometimes it's kind of chilly </connor>
<joey> nice it's like you're kind of like it's </joey>
<joey> kind of like just it's not cold but it's </joey>
<joey> like a little bit like oh okay maybe i </joey>
<joey> could you know put something light on </joey>
<joey> but the moment you hop in that bed and </joey>
<garnt> you put that blanket over you and you're </garnt>
<garnt> just wrapped in a warm cocoon there's </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm unstoppable this sleep is on my </garnt>
<garnt> side now and you just get the best </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] sleep yeah the mornings suck but </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the mornings dude for me all the </garnt>
<garnt> mornings suck i can't wake up in the </garnt>
<joey> morning so it doesn't make a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> difference to me </garnt>
<garnt> okay the only thing i could say i will </garnt>
<garnt> say is that i can wear turtlenecks in </garnt>
<joey> the winter exactly </joey>
<connor> would they be steve jobs without weird </connor>
<connor> sucks because you your options are so </connor>
<connor> limited in the winter it's like </connor>
<garnt> shorts but that's the last but that's </garnt>
<garnt> why i like british summers because what </garnt>
<garnt> i realized is that british summers is </garnt>
<garnt> just like a comfortable like it's it's a </garnt>
<garnt> comfortable temperature most of the time </garnt>
<connor> pre-global warming yes </connor>
<connor> it was good because you know this didn't </connor>
<connor> used to happen and it was never like </connor>
<connor> this in the uk where it was that bad i </connor>
<garnt> remember we always complain about </garnt>
<garnt> british summers to be like every like </garnt>
<garnt> every british person i've met is just </garnt>
<garnt> like oh you haven't experienced british </garnt>
<garnt> summer it's like really it's it's rain </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes it's cold sometimes and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like it's like it actually slaps </garnt>
<garnt> compared to other subjects i would </garnt>
<connor> compare to other places yeah i would </connor>
<connor> have agreed with you until like two </connor>
<joey> years ago when for some reason two years </joey>
<joey> in a row which had horrible heat waves </joey>
<joey> that just ruined the summer for me </joey>
<joey> because it was always fun in the uk the </joey>
<connor> best part about it is i like it in </connor>
<connor> summer when the day is hot and the night </connor>
<connor> gets cool yeah but in japan it doesn't </connor>
<connor> get cool oh it does </connor>
<joey> no i think it does no compared to like </joey>
<connor> compared to now like because you know </connor>
<connor> it's like what [ __ ] 2 p.m right now </connor>
<connor> it is like the hardest time of the day </connor>
<connor> right now right yeah yeah but compared </connor>
<connor> to that euro yeah carry on </connor>
<connor> but compared to that when it's you know </connor>
<connor> the sun finally goes down like what like </connor>
<connor> 8 00 p.m yeah maybe and like around like </connor>
<connor> nine or ten it's like it's pretty </connor>
<connor> comfortable that's that's the kind of </connor>
<joey> weather where i'm like okay i'm really </joey>
<joey> comfortable i can't concentrate with </joey>
<joey> that guy </joey>
<connor> we're gonna cut </connor>
<connor> max you're right what's wrong with you </connor>

<joey> to completely reload their weapons with </joey>
<joey> just a push of a button the enemy is </joey>
<connor> danzo that sounds ops it sure is gone my </connor>
<connor> favorite mech is the panther it has the </connor>
<connor> ability called the stasis barrier put </connor>
<connor> down an invincible wall that blocks </connor>
<connor> enemy bullets and slows anyone that </connor>
<connor> passes through it if you like to </connor>

<garnt> that i like having as much as i said as </garnt>
<garnt> much sunlight as possible and i just i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like the best </garnt>
<garnt> like my favorite time period of the </garnt>
<garnt> entire year is about like what's what's </garnt>
<connor> the word like dusk summertime when like </connor>
<connor> the sun's setting it's about seven eight </connor>
<connor> pm and you're just watching the sunset </connor>
<connor> man you feel like a [ __ ] anime </connor>
<connor> character because it's just like it's </connor>
<connor> just you know it's it's it's that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] scene where you're just like </joey>
<connor> where the [ __ ] dude in every opening </connor>
<joey> where like they're the protagonist is </joey>
<joey> watching the sunset and the wind's just </joey>
<garnt> blowing how often you are you're </garnt>
<joey> standing out how old are you </joey>
<connor> being like how the [ __ ] are you watching </connor>
<connor> it yeah how often are you watching this </connor>
<garnt> shut the [ __ ] up no it's anime shut the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up </garnt>
<joey> scene on tatooine right where he's like </joey>
<connor> watching the sun go down how often how </connor>
<garnt> often are you watching the sunset </garnt>
<garnt> honestly that's why i love my balcony </garnt>
<garnt> that's why i have a hammock out there </garnt>
<connor> because oh no you [ __ ] off you're not </connor>
<connor> watching the sunset every day i'm not </connor>
<joey> watching it i'm not watching it every </joey>
<connor> day but the hottest time of the day in </connor>
<joey> my opinion because you're getting that </joey>
<joey> like direct [ __ ] sunlight the whole </joey>
<garnt> time of the day is [ __ ] now i can't </garnt>
<joey> stand out there </joey>
<joey> it's hot until the sun goes down </joey>
<joey> like the moment the sun rises it's the </joey>
<garnt> hottest time of the day </garnt>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<joey> no i mean i don't know man i like going </joey>
<joey> outside and i don't want to have to </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] you know </joey>
<joey> shed away my life expectancy to just go </joey>
<garnt> outside yeah i guess that's why for me </garnt>
<garnt> in japan i think my favorite season is </garnt>
<garnt> probably spring </garnt>
<joey> for me it's the autumn autumn yeah like </joey>
<garnt> around like october it's probably my </garnt>
<connor> favorite time of the year just because </connor>
<connor> it's like again you have that </connor>
<connor> you know variance in drip right you can </connor>
<connor> wear a jacket if it gets a little bit </connor>
<connor> cold in the night but you can take it </connor>
<connor> off and you know rock a long sleeve </connor>
<joey> right but it's also not so cold that </joey>
<joey> it's excruciating but it's not too hot </joey>
<joey> either </joey>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like that's the same spring </garnt>
<joey> though and i like the i like the whole </joey>
<joey> have we talked about hanami at all like </joey>
<joey> the cherry blossoms sir i mean like so i </joey>

<garnt> anime right you know what cherry cherry </garnt>
<garnt> is awesome you know what [ __ ] cherry </garnt>

<garnt> disappointed to find out that cherry </garnt>
<connor> blossoms are only around for like one </connor>
<connor> week and they [ __ ] off because i'm like </connor>
<connor> hold out there and </connor>
<joey> all the anime all the time what's going </joey>
<joey> on with that yeah they film all the </joey>
<connor> anime in the same week </connor>
<connor> i realized it's like a cult in japan </connor>
<connor> like they they're obsessed with this </connor>
<joey> they had on me like everything revolves </joey>
<joey> when hanumi's coming up everything is </joey>
<joey> hanami yeah like well yeah everything </joey>
<connor> has to become cherry blossom it's like </connor>
<connor> everything everyone just joins like a </connor>
<joey> caller because there's a really like </joey>
<connor> extensive history right right but it's </connor>
<connor> like it's nuts like it's i understand </connor>
<connor> why it's an anime so much now but when i </connor>
<connor> got here i'm like wow literally </connor>
<connor> everything is decorated like like it's a </connor>
<joey> call of duty gun skin it's like </joey>
<joey> everything's there every it doesn't </joey>
<joey> matter what it is it gets a cherry </joey>
<joey> blossom skin i mean not gonna lie man </joey>
<joey> like a good honey is [ __ ] dark yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah but it's good it is disappointing </garnt>
<joey> it's really weird yeah </joey>
<garnt> this week yeah this year this year i'm </garnt>
<garnt> sorry </garnt>
<connor> i didn't do anything this year because i </connor>
<connor> i i totally forgot i didn't know when it </connor>
<joey> was coming i i had one of the best </joey>
<connor> harmonies this year i'd rather enjoy me </connor>
<joey> river it's just like rows and rows of </joey>
<garnt> sakura trees do you want to explain what </garnt>
<garnt> hanami is to the viewers </garnt>
<joey> literally means flower watching yeah in </joey>
<connor> japanese so it's it's basically this </connor>
<joey> kind of i wouldn't even say it's like a </joey>
<garnt> festival it's more like an event that </garnt>
<garnt> happens isn't it even a public holiday </garnt>
<connor> no i feel like it's a mutual agreement </connor>
<connor> amongst everyone to get drunk in the </connor>
<connor> park yeah that's kind of what it is </connor>
<joey> pretty much pretty much but it's yes </joey>
<connor> it's like because the sucker are only </connor>
<connor> around for about a week and some maybe </connor>
<connor> sometimes not even a week later a couple </connor>
<connor> of days yeah uh people go out and like </connor>
<joey> celebrate by just sitting under a tree </joey>
<joey> having a picnic under the sucker tree do </joey>
<connor> you think it's [ __ ] great do you </connor>
<connor> think it's worth because i know a lot of </connor>
<connor> people who are like i want to come to </connor>
<connor> japan during that time do you think it's </connor>
<joey> worth coming japan just for it i think </joey>
<joey> because i think if it's the first time </joey>
<joey> you come into japan i think it's worth </joey>
<garnt> yeah i think now because we've lived in </garnt>
<garnt> japan for two years we're kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> we're kind of like used to it but i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like seeing hanami for the first time </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing like all like the cherry </garnt>
<garnt> blossoms just like falling off the trees </garnt>
<garnt> and you have like the ground is </garnt>
<garnt> literally covered in cherry blossoms </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like everywhere i think that's a </garnt>
<joey> pretty cool like a couple of years </joey>
<joey> definitely just nodded to you saying </joey>
<garnt> that right now it's like oh it's like in </garnt>
<garnt> the end like you literally walk through </garnt>
<garnt> a park and it's lit it is literally like </garnt>
<joey> every [ __ ] anime scene where like the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] cherry blossoms yeah the cherry </joey>
<connor> everywhere watering down </connor>
<connor> still looks dark it looks dope as [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i don't know what it is japan that just </connor>
<garnt> it's like so aesthetic but it's just </garnt>
<garnt> it's just the perfect aesthetic i mean </garnt>
<joey> japan is like kind of aesthetic all year </joey>
<joey> round but i'd say like the most </joey>
<joey> aesthetic is probably during the suckers </joey>
<connor> i'd say if you are gonna do it </connor>
<connor> definitely get out of tokyo because like </connor>
<joey> every single hanami place in tokyo like </joey>
<joey> every single park that has the cherry </joey>
<joey> blossom trees is this packed </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah you you will be </connor>
<connor> like because we met two years ago we did </connor>
<connor> like a small one yeah and we had to get </connor>
<connor> like a corner of dirt </connor>
<connor> in the park right next to the road like </connor>
<joey> it was the only literally the only spot </joey>
<joey> left in this massive where did you guys </joey>
<joey> go like shinjuku no we we're in uh </joey>
<garnt> saitama yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah right and it was like </connor>
<garnt> it was rammed as well it was so full </garnt>
<garnt> because what what people normally do </garnt>
<garnt> here in japan is during the cherry </garnt>
<connor> blossom week or season or when they're </connor>
<connor> blooming uh people go to the park they </connor>
<garnt> get like a kind of like a picnic area um </garnt>
<connor> and then they just get [ __ ] pissed in </connor>
<connor> public right right it's great i'd say go </connor>
<connor> like when you come to japan definitely </connor>
<connor> do like a week in tokyo and then if you </connor>
<connor> if you're you know if it aligns with the </connor>
<garnt> hanami do a week somewhere else where </garnt>
<connor> you can then go and celebrate the hanoi </connor>
<garnt> yeah i feel like doing because you can't </garnt>
<joey> really explore japan in one week i don't </joey>
<joey> think no you can't you kind of explore </joey>
<joey> tokyo in one week yeah feel i've been </joey>
<connor> here for like two years now and i've </connor>
<garnt> barely explored japan </garnt>
<garnt> how is hanami in like hakuna you said oh </garnt>
<joey> i mean it's great because it's like i </joey>
<connor> mean hakuna is still you know very much </connor>
<connor> a tourist destination but i mean </connor>
<connor> compared to like shinjuku going or like </connor>
<connor> yogi park it's like yeah you don't get </connor>
<connor> any space at all no absolutely no space </connor>
<connor> at all and i mean like i i guess as well </connor>
<connor> like in hakuna and a lot of places in </connor>
<connor> hakone they've definitely like </connor>
<connor> positioned a lot of like uh onsens and </connor>
<connor> like yokans and stuff like that yeah </connor>
<connor> around the sakura and like around all </connor>
<connor> the aesthetic parts of hakone so </connor>
<connor> yeah it was great i mean like we we </connor>
<connor> stayed in like an airbnb that was </connor>
<connor> overlooking uh like a bunch of like </connor>
<connor> sakura trees on the lake and yeah in the </connor>
<connor> distance you could see mount fuji and it </connor>
<connor> was like the most like aesthetic [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> harmony that i ever had and i was like </connor>
<connor> you know what it's it's kind of worth to </connor>
<joey> go all the way out there sometimes to </joey>
<joey> just like get a little bit of peace of </joey>
<joey> mind right because otherwise it's just </joey>
<joey> be like you'd be rubbing shoulders with </joey>
<joey> the person next to you being like look </joey>
<joey> at the pedal over there oh my god </joey>
<garnt> it wasn't the people it was like the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] kids running around i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> getting pissed is great getting pissed </garnt>
<connor> with like a bunch of like five </connor>
<connor> six-year-olds running around you like </connor>
<connor> playing football or whatever </connor>
<garnt> it's not exactly like the best kind of </garnt>
<garnt> vibe to get pissed drunk if you're </garnt>
<connor> sitting like where i am now you are </connor>
<joey> probably like this close to someone as </joey>
<joey> well yeah someone else is like </joey>
<joey> matt and picnic set well you see you </joey>
<connor> stayed in airbnb have you stayed in many </connor>
<joey> airbnbs in japan um </joey>
<joey> not really yeah i mean because like 90 </joey>
<connor> of them got [ __ ] axe yeah so for the </connor>
<connor> olympics uh </connor>
<connor> the japanese government changed the the </connor>
<connor> rules around airbnbs basically just </connor>
<connor> gutting them and making it so that you </connor>
<connor> had to make it you did follow a lot of </connor>
<connor> but they basically made it so you had to </connor>
<connor> follow hotel rules like you had to have </connor>
<connor> like the fire escape and like the floor </connor>
<connor> lit up to the yeah it's they made it </connor>
<connor> they basically made the rules impossible </connor>
<connor> on purpose where you couldn't turn a </connor>
<garnt> profit like reasonably basically because </garnt>
<garnt> i have stayed in an airbnb yeah i stayed </garnt>
<garnt> in one as well the first time i visited </garnt>
<garnt> it was super cheap you get like what do </garnt>
<garnt> we get me and alan got the airbnb for </garnt>
<connor> what like </connor>
<connor> it was really cheap like 150 bucks yeah </connor>
<garnt> but it was like a really really small </garnt>
<connor> room i remember but it was right in </connor>
<garnt> chennai </garnt>
<joey> oh remember was that the one yeah that </joey>
<joey> was the one i got really sick in </joey>
<garnt> whatever you threw up in </garnt>

<connor> like really budget energy drink </connor>
<connor> all right from that day </connor>
<joey> yeah i swore never to drink budget </joey>
<connor> energy drink even even energy drink is </connor>
<joey> bad enough but the budget one where it's </joey>
<connor> like 50 cents for two liters is like </connor>
<joey> it's like brake fluid like no one like </joey>
<joey> of course you're gonna throw up drinking </joey>
<joey> that stuff i'm glad i did because i </joey>
<joey> didn't have to digest yeah exactly but </joey>
<connor> jesus </connor>
<garnt> yeah we </garnt>
<connor> have a mate from home uh who's now </connor>

<connor> what would i even take like could you </connor>
<connor> even taste the energy drink at that </connor>
<joey> point because red the the flavor of red </joey>
<connor> wine is so overpowering </connor>
<connor> i feel there's some things where even if </connor>
<joey> even if that tasted amazing i'm like no </joey>
<connor> this is </connor>
<joey> morally wrong this is too broke for me </joey>
<joey> like this is so broke </joey>
<connor> and there's nothing wrong with that i </connor>
<connor> just don't want to partake in it </connor>
<connor> you can be broke nice </connor>
<joey> no no it's fine it's fine it's not poor </joey>
<connor> it's broke it's different broke is a </connor>
<connor> mindset </connor>
<connor> poverty and being poor is you you are </connor>
<connor> just your finances don't be poor just </connor>
<joey> being broke is the mindset of like i'm </joey>
<connor> gonna live like an animal and i you know </connor>
<joey> i don't i don't partake in that you know </joey>
<joey> you can be rich but be broke at the same </joey>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> listen the reason why if you're homeless </garnt>
<joey> just no no that's poverty god that's </joey>
<connor> different there's a difference to </connor>
<joey> poverty it broke </joey>
<joey> big difference guy come on </joey>
<joey> like there's a difference he's trying to </joey>
<joey> get me in a corner here saying being </joey>
<connor> poor is bad yes it is gone you want me </connor>
<joey> to say </joey>
<joey> i mean you're not doing a very good job </joey>
<garnt> of fighting like pushing your arms </garnt>
<connor> you can clearly afford red wine and you </connor>
<connor> can clearly afford energy drink why </connor>
<connor> would you mix them that is like that is </connor>
<connor> you're making yourself broken for no </connor>
<garnt> reason you know is that broke that's </garnt>
<garnt> broke that's broke i don't drink energy </garnt>
<garnt> drink period anymore i don't know at </garnt>
<garnt> what age it was where i was just like </garnt>
<connor> man red bull kind of sucks doesn't do </connor>
<connor> anything for me anymore actually no i </connor>
<connor> drink those i don't know if it counts is </connor>
<connor> it andrew drink the uh or i'm on c </connor>
<joey> oh yeah that's kind of weird i don't </joey>
<joey> know if i count that as an issue i love </joey>
<connor> those things yeah it's like a vitamin </connor>
<connor> drink it's a vitamin drink that's </connor>
<connor> definitely not healthy but it's in the </connor>
<garnt> same like section as like oh you mean </garnt>
<garnt> you mean the japanese ones yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> like a glass it's like a glass thing </connor>
<joey> it's got a really satisfying pop yeah </joey>
<joey> like you pull this metal tab in it </joey>
<joey> really a really nice pocket </joey>

<joey> who because i don't really drink genji </joey>
<connor> drinks but i love this thing yeah it's </connor>
<connor> so tasty i feel that works better than </connor>
<joey> any drink yeah i don't know if it's </joey>
<joey> placebo but yeah i mean it definitely </joey>
<joey> tastes a lot better for my body than a </joey>
<connor> red bull i think i don't feel awful </connor>
<connor> after drinking that yeah i think it's </connor>
<connor> because now it's gone to the point where </connor>
<connor> if i have an energy drink it's literally </connor>
<connor> going to make me unable to sleep for </connor>
<garnt> that night and it never used to be that </garnt>
<garnt> way normally i could like down </garnt>
<garnt> five energy drinks or whatever and like </garnt>
<connor> be fine the night so you have the </connor>
<connor> opposite problem i don't i don't get </connor>
<connor> anything from them anymore all right </connor>
<garnt> that's cause you're doing like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> five cups of coffee a day i'm not </garnt>

<connor> all right yeah exactly yeah i quit </connor>
<connor> coffee i only just drink a lot of tea </connor>
<connor> when i stopped drinking them yeah but </connor>
<joey> tea also has caffeine yeah much though </joey>

<garnt> without like the tea it like itself if </garnt>
<connor> you just eat tea yeah but i like the tea </connor>
<joey> leaves yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> tea if you would just eat the tea leaves </connor>
<connor> oh okay like if you would just eat it </connor>

<garnt> were putting in your body </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i still don't care </garnt>
<joey> what </joey>
<joey> what </joey>
<joey> trying to stop thinking about that [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> off okay i i care when i can feel the </garnt>
<garnt> effects does that does that make sense </garnt>
<connor> does that make sense no </connor>
<connor> i guess </connor>
<connor> you mean like the immediate effects yeah </connor>
<joey> like if like oh i have a tummy ache </joey>
<joey> immediately afterwards but i probably </joey>
<connor> shouldn't put it in my body yeah so like </connor>
<connor> i can just tell we're about to get on an </connor>
<connor> american topic this is gonna you know </connor>
<connor> what i mean like i feel like america's </connor>
<connor> gonna die </connor>
<garnt> okay no like there was a point i i feel </garnt>
<connor> like where you could just put any [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> in your body and you could just not feel </connor>
<connor> any like after effects at all it would </connor>
<connor> just like go away after a while but now </connor>
<connor> like i have gotten to a point where for </connor>
<connor> example i try to keep a healthy sleep </connor>
<joey> schedule because if i don't get a </joey>
<joey> healthy sleep schedule i just feel like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] and i don't know i don't </joey>
<joey> i just feel like there was a point when </joey>
<joey> i didn't care about a sleep schedule and </joey>
<garnt> it didn't matter so you like discover </garnt>
<joey> sleep for the first time </joey>
<connor> i think your sleep schedule you know </connor>
<connor> when you've got [ __ ] to do that's right </connor>
<garnt> that's it right that's it when you've </garnt>
<garnt> got [ __ ] to do and you want to be </garnt>
<garnt> productive like not like waking up late </garnt>
<connor> actually affects that and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> yo um i never thought about this when i </connor>
<connor> was a uni student because i did </connor>
<garnt> everything at 4am in the morning and i </garnt>
<connor> still got a passing grade yeah right </connor>
<connor> so i'm jealous of youtubers who get </connor>
<connor> cancelled you know they just get like </connor>
<connor> they just gotta take a break they just </connor>
<connor> get to like [ __ ] off for four months you </connor>
<joey> know what i mean like this is just </joey>
<joey> getting canceled you get a sleep sketch </joey>
<connor> i'm like [ __ ] off man you cancelled him </connor>
<connor> he gets to take a four month like paid </connor>
<connor> vacation his videos are still getting </connor>
<connor> views what are you on about like </connor>
<connor> this man this is gonna come back and </connor>
<connor> come back in five months david david </connor>
<connor> dobrik got two month vacation that's all </connor>
<connor> he got </connor>
<garnt> this is [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> so what's it what is the right amount of </garnt>
<garnt> time for like a youtuber council break i </garnt>
<joey> don't know mate but the more the more </joey>
<garnt> the more when i saw david dobrik and he </garnt>
<connor> came back zero repercussions his views </connor>
<joey> came as his video that he came back with </joey>
<joey> got the same amount of views dislikes </joey>
<joey> likes are amazing you've got amazing </joey>
<joey> likes yeah you know i'm like this man </joey>
<connor> got a [ __ ] month vacation this is </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] and he got he got free articles </joey>
<joey> about him he can get verified now on </joey>
<connor> twitter </connor>
<joey> he wasn't already but i was like what </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> there was like no no there was like no </connor>
<connor> repercussions and i'm like wow what what </connor>
<connor> what point is it like damn </connor>
<joey> cancer doesn't look too too bad right </joey>
<joey> now i mean </joey>
<garnt> if if logan paul can literally come back </garnt>
<garnt> from showing a dead body i feel like </garnt>
<connor> anyone can come back you know it's </connor>
<connor> joey said a joke is a joke please don't </connor>
<connor> cancel jerry </connor>
<connor> but i was just thinking about it because </connor>
<connor> you saying that like oh um my mom made </connor>
<connor> many jumps and logic there um </connor>
<connor> because you were saying oh yeah well </connor>
<connor> you've got [ __ ] to do but when you you </connor>
<connor> know when you where you as youtubers you </connor>
<connor> always have [ __ ] to do because there's </connor>
<connor> no vacations you can't just take a month </connor>
<garnt> off </garnt>
<garnt> people take a month off for a mental </garnt>
<garnt> health break which is like i say with </garnt>
<garnt> inverted commerce because it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> become a cliche now even though it's </garnt>
<garnt> very important and beautiful they just </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] need it but you know it's sad </connor>
<connor> because if you get cancelled you almost </connor>
<connor> get a better vacation because </connor>
<connor> there's people still talking about you </connor>
<connor> while you're gone and people like </connor>
<connor> searching about you and making videos </connor>
<connor> about you like i know that sounds awful </connor>
<connor> and you know it's not great but like you </connor>
<connor> are still getting way more traffic yeah </connor>
<connor> than he would be just taking a break </connor>
<connor> right so if you do something kind of </connor>
<connor> semi semi bad you know just something </connor>
<connor> that's like </connor>
<connor> do something light you know just just do </connor>
<connor> something like oh just i don't know just </connor>
<connor> fart on a dog or something i don't know </connor>
<connor> just something that's like not too bad </connor>
<connor> what's something that you can you'll get </connor>
<connor> backlash for but isn't really that bad </connor>
<connor> that you can just come back from in a </connor>
<joey> month you know what i mean and then </joey>
<joey> you'll get your cat vodka </joey>
<joey> yeah perfectly fine you know yeah </joey>
<connor> starting to think i should get a pet </connor>
<connor> okay that's a joke </connor>
<garnt> that's a joke that's a joke this is a </garnt>
<garnt> trash taste getting cancelled speed run </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i just thought about it and i was like </connor>
<connor> hold on a second all these people just </connor>
<connor> get like </connor>
<connor> basically paid vacation this is [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> i mean i think it's like different </garnt>
<garnt> severity yeah the people get like quite </garnt>
<connor> severe yeah it's quite bad but i've </connor>
<garnt> noticing more and more a lot of them </garnt>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> if they haven't really done anything </connor>
<connor> criminal </connor>
<connor> they just kind of like bounce back super </connor>
<joey> easily i mean there are some people who </joey>
<connor> did cheat about that david was kind of </connor>
<garnt> criminal to be fair let's be honest yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was kind of criminal i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<connor> endangered someone's life </connor>
<garnt> came back all right like it just amazes </garnt>
<connor> me it's like it's like jesus christ like </connor>
<garnt> a cult yeah but then there's like </garnt>
<garnt> examples like edp four five five yeah </garnt>
<connor> he's he's definitely not coming back </connor>
<connor> i mean he's trying to realize he's come </connor>
<connor> back edp was a youtuber who uh got </connor>
<connor> caught trying to meet up with 14 year </connor>
<joey> olds yeah and uh didn't he like try to </joey>
<connor> start his own website or something yeah </connor>
<connor> he did </connor>
<connor> did he actually yeah he did because he </connor>
<connor> he got his youtube band and then he was </connor>
<connor> like finna go to facebook you know it's </connor>
<connor> better than his facebook golfband yeah </connor>
<joey> facebook banned so he's like </joey>
<joey> finna start my own website </joey>
<joey> he's trying really hard man but yeah the </joey>
<joey> the main point of this whole me going on </joey>
<connor> this tangent was that uh yeah i feel </connor>
<joey> like yeah as youtubers you don't really </joey>
<joey> get a break i know we're complaining oh </joey>
<joey> boohoo </joey>
<joey> uh who cares i mean we have easy jobs so </joey>
<connor> whatever but i mean it's you know we </connor>
<connor> don't really get like set vacations </connor>
<connor> which sucks um and i kind of miss you </connor>
<connor> know one thing i really do miss doing is </connor>
<joey> just being able to two weeks off just </joey>
<joey> play video games </joey>
<connor> just catch up with [ __ ] like i don't </connor>
<connor> even want to go places anymore like </connor>
<connor> because i travel anyway on like weekends </connor>
<connor> or whatever i find three days here and </connor>
<connor> there that's fun but it feels like </connor>
<connor> you're still doing something but i just </connor>
<connor> want that that i miss that feeling of </connor>
<connor> like i'm gonna take two weeks off catch </connor>
<garnt> up to all the movies catch up to all the </garnt>
<garnt> manga just can't play all video games </garnt>
<garnt> you know maybe might start persona </garnt>
<garnt> probably won't just buy it just look at </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<connor> so many games so many games in my </connor>
<connor> backlog that i just want to play like </connor>
<connor> the new mass effect remaster got </connor>
<connor> released and i'm just like i want to </connor>
<connor> play that but i'm going to i haven't </connor>
<connor> even played persona 5 royal yet and [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> it [ __ ] knows where i'm going to get the </garnt>
<garnt> time to do that </garnt>
<connor> yeah i now have two wish lists i have </connor>
<connor> the wish list where i will actually use </connor>
<connor> the thing and the wish list where this </connor>
<connor> is just a wish list where it would be </connor>
<joey> nice but i won't use it yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it's the cancelled wishes yeah because </joey>
<garnt> like you said you had a day the other </garnt>
<garnt> day where you just woke up and you did </garnt>
<joey> nothing and it was i mean yeah i kind of </joey>
<joey> just woke up one day and i was like well </joey>
<joey> i don't really have any like videos to </joey>
<joey> work on i don't really have any like </joey>
<connor> other side projects to work on so i'm </connor>
<connor> just like you know what i'm i'm gonna do </connor>
<connor> a power move yeah not do anything like </connor>
<connor> not do anything without i didn't even </connor>
<connor> check my phone that day i was like no </connor>
<connor> phone turning off i'm just gonna do [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> around the house and just hang out and i </connor>
<connor> was like yeah damn is this what like a </connor>
<connor> weekend feels for every other i'm </connor>
<connor> literally experiencing a weekend for the </connor>
<joey> first time in my life i was like oh my </joey>
<joey> god this is f i should do this more </joey>
<garnt> often yeah [ __ ] like i think for us </garnt>
<connor> especially the last few months have just </connor>
<connor> been super [ __ ] busy with us building </connor>
<connor> this set and having to like film a bunch </connor>
<connor> of episodes to get ahead i remember we </connor>
<connor> had like what like this two-week period </connor>
<joey> where it was like we finished building </joey>
<joey> the set then we filmed a trash taste </joey>
<joey> episode every day for like yeah it was </joey>
<joey> like we had a recording session with </joey>
<joey> either trash taste or like a netflix </joey>
<joey> shoot or some kind of some kind of other </joey>
<connor> live stream every day for like two weeks </connor>
<joey> without any breaks on weekends or </joey>
<connor> anything that was brutal that was like i </connor>
<connor> was i was like close to burn out there </connor>
<connor> yeah i do film my schedule lap on planet </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> like i'm i'm jealous of you right i'm </connor>
<joey> jealous of you the most because you you </joey>
<joey> view streaming as a down time i'm just </joey>
<joey> like i </joey>
<connor> wish [ __ ] i wish my down time could be </connor>
<connor> work </connor>
<joey> i wish i could get paid i wish i could </joey>
<garnt> be paid for my downtime i'll just enjoy </garnt>
<garnt> it and that's like people always </garnt>
<garnt> complain at me like oh make a stream </garnt>
<connor> schedule i'm like nah bro because i just </connor>
<connor> i just do whatever i want but i just i </connor>
<connor> stream often like yeah around the same </connor>
<connor> times but people are like yeah why do </connor>
<joey> you need a stream schedule you literally </joey>
<joey> stream like three or four times a week </joey>
<connor> yeah because i i think to myself i most </connor>
<connor> of the time whether i decide to stream </connor>
<connor> is normally on the day that's normally </connor>
<connor> like if i've worked too much or maybe i </connor>
<connor> want to just chill out you know maybe </connor>
<connor> i've got too much work to do so i don't </connor>
<joey> want to do it because the moment i </joey>
<joey> commit to a schedule is when it's </joey>
<joey> working yeah yeah exactly if i say i </joey>
<connor> have to stream at this day it's work </connor>
<joey> yeah and then that's why i won't stop </joey>
<joey> having fun so well i mean like i guess </joey>
<joey> for you it's like good because you have </joey>
<joey> that one game that you can stream which </joey>
<joey> you also just play casually yeah i think </joey>
<garnt> i think when you cause that's </garnt>
<connor> right but it's it's right now but like </connor>
<connor> i'm you know i'm like so i mean i guess </connor>
<garnt> totally my strengths </garnt>
<garnt> by the time this is out you would have </garnt>
<garnt> found out the winner of the tournament </garnt>
<garnt> arc 2 which we are currently being part </garnt>
<connor> of yeah well we are because we were </connor>
<connor> recording these advanced because uh me </connor>
<connor> and gonna plan to get to the uk as we've </connor>
<connor> mentioned so uh yeah we're quite far </connor>
<connor> ahead right now but yeah we're in the </connor>
<connor> middle of the chess tournament so we're </connor>
<connor> playing a lot of chess recently yeah i'm </connor>
<connor> really enjoying um but yeah no i mean it </connor>
<connor> is i think when you are streaming it is </connor>
<connor> very helpful to have at least one game </connor>
<connor> that you can come back to when you're </connor>
<connor> like running out of ideas i think i </connor>
<joey> think that's what i'm currently trying </joey>
<joey> to find right now is that one game where </joey>
<garnt> i'm just like the problem the problem is </garnt>
<garnt> my one game that i've just played a lot </garnt>
<connor> it's just like not very popular yeah </connor>
<connor> and whenever i play it everywhere yeah </connor>
<connor> and whenever i play everyone's just like </connor>
<connor> oh he's obviously doing this because </connor>
<garnt> it's a sponsored stream and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like no i just just enjoy the game no </garnt>
<connor> one [ __ ] plays this game but i'll </connor>
<connor> play it i did notice that when i started </connor>
<connor> playing apex uh </connor>
<connor> because i </connor>
<connor> apex is probably the game i stream i've </connor>
<connor> streamed most um </connor>
<connor> that my viewership was quite much </connor>
<connor> considerably lower than normal but i was </connor>
<connor> like well no [ __ ] it i like this game </connor>
<connor> i'm going to keep playing it and then </connor>
<connor> after time it actually like went up to </connor>
<connor> the point where if i stream new games </connor>
<connor> now it's normally lower than apex yeah </connor>
<connor> this is a built up like the follow-up </connor>
<garnt> but i feel like you have to you just </garnt>
<garnt> stick through </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like you also got very lucky as </garnt>
<connor> well because the apex did just have a </connor>
<connor> massive boom in general yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because of like every v tuber under the </connor>
<connor> sun </connor>
<garnt> shadows yeah yeah apex raid of shadows </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know why that was not even </connor>
<connor> intentional i was just playing it and </connor>
<connor> then i started seeing every youtuber's </connor>
<joey> playing i'm like whoa what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> see like that's not going to happen with </joey>
<garnt> my comfort game because my comfort game </garnt>
<connor> is about 30 years old what's your </connor>
<connor> comfort game like any final fantasy game </connor>
<connor> oh yeah i'm just like like i can't i </connor>
<garnt> can't like [ __ ] stream final fantasy </garnt>
<garnt> 6 even though it's one of my favorite </garnt>
<joey> games of all time because no one's going </joey>
<garnt> to [ __ ] watch it and it sucks you </garnt>
<garnt> know well would you even want to stream </garnt>
<garnt> your comfort games </garnt>
<joey> yeah i mean yeah because i think like </joey>
<connor> again it's like apex with conor where </connor>
<connor> it's like it's just a comfort game right </connor>
<connor> like you don't necessarily have to </connor>
<connor> see it as work or like you don't have to </connor>
<connor> necessarily be like entertaining and </connor>
<connor> wacky and goofy and you know yeah try </connor>
<connor> and hold an audience right like you can </connor>
<joey> just play a game casually yeah as you </joey>
<joey> would normally do and people would just </joey>
<connor> be there to watch you play it right yeah </connor>
<connor> it's different it's it's very different </connor>
<connor> to my normal streams as well i'd say </connor>
<joey> depends on what i'm doing like you're a </joey>
<joey> lot more quiet during your apex stream </joey>
<connor> yeah definitely yeah because i'm i'm </connor>
<joey> focusing on the game so it's like i talk </joey>
<garnt> in between stuff happening yeah um so it </garnt>
<garnt> depends what's going on </garnt>
<connor> but that's why i like i like talking to </connor>
<garnt> japanese people on there it's fun yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm trying to find more things that </garnt>
<garnt> i want to watch um that's that's like </garnt>
<garnt> that's i feel like i'm i'm more of like </garnt>
<connor> i like doing passive things rather than </connor>
<connor> active things a lot of times in my </connor>
<connor> downtime like the other day uh like a </connor>
<connor> few days ago i ended up watching all of </connor>
<connor> loki for like the new marvel series it's </connor>
<connor> actually really [ __ ] good and like i </connor>
<connor> don't i'm not that invested in the </connor>
<connor> marvel franchise so i was like i'll just </connor>
<connor> put on one episode just see what it's </connor>
<connor> about and i just ended up binging the </connor>
<connor> entire thing and i was just like this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing because it was only six </connor>
<garnt> episodes but every episode is 40 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> long so i basically just binged an </garnt>
<garnt> entire season of anime just that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's how i think of things but it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't anime but it was an anime and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like damn how why can't i do this </garnt>
<garnt> with anime anymore [ __ ] man i miss that </garnt>
<connor> so much i'm so busy now where i like </connor>
<connor> dread good stuff coming out because i'm </connor>
<joey> like [ __ ] yeah i gotta find tana watch </joey>
<joey> this now see if only you could like </joey>
<joey> watch loki on twitch right just use that </joey>
<joey> as your down time just have people watch </joey>
<joey> just have watch parties yeah honestly i </joey>
<connor> would love to have watch parties with </connor>
<joey> like different things i'm watching yeah </joey>
<connor> but obviously dmca </connor>
<joey> obvious reasons can't do that yeah um </joey>
<joey> but like </joey>
<joey> because like i know sydney her her </joey>
<joey> downtime thing is that she watches </joey>
<joey> horror movies and </joey>
<garnt> i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how she finds so many [ __ ] horror </garnt>
<garnt> movies to watch i didn't know this many </garnt>
<garnt> horror movies existed she watches at </garnt>
<garnt> least three new horror movies every week </garnt>
<joey> dude at least but the the successful of </joey>
<joey> horror movies is like never ending it's </joey>
<garnt> actually insane because i was never i </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like i was never big into horror </garnt>
<garnt> movies i don't really like horror movies </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> and i assume you guys aren't big fans </garnt>
<garnt> either because none of it showed up on </garnt>
<garnt> our three by threes no i don't like not </garnt>
<joey> a single one there's some good ones but </joey>
<joey> it's it's like it's not my favorite </joey>
<connor> genre yeah yeah yeah um but she somehow </connor>
<connor> finds so many shots huh shining is </connor>
<connor> really good shining's good i i like the </connor>
<connor> shine like there's only a few horror </connor>
<connor> movies that i really like shiny's one of </connor>
<garnt> them i've really because like my my </garnt>
<garnt> taste in horror movies is really niche i </garnt>
<garnt> think because i like kind of loved </garnt>
<garnt> craftian horrors because i don't like </garnt>
<garnt> the usual like you know jump scares </garnt>
<garnt> ghost paranormal stuff what's the </garnt>
<connor> problem is that so much horrors jump </connor>
<connor> scares now yeah it is it is cheap and </connor>
<connor> easy to relax yeah that's i think that's </connor>
<connor> why i'm such a big fan of like jinji ito </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that because it's really </connor>
<connor> like the horror that i like is really </connor>
<garnt> just the ones that really unsettle me </garnt>
<garnt> like the macabre horror yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah no i i'm exactly like that like the </joey>
<connor> kind of like asian horror is like </connor>
<connor> definitely </connor>
<connor> more my taste in horror because yeah </connor>
<connor> again it's like you see like you know </connor>
<joey> you watch one paranormal activity you've </joey>
<garnt> basically seen them all how the [ __ ] did </garnt>
<garnt> paranormal activity get so big it's </garnt>
<joey> because steven spielberg greenlitted he </joey>
<garnt> literally is that true yeah so i </garnt>
<connor> actually read up on it because i had the </connor>
<connor> exact same thought i was like i saw </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] the trail of a paranormal </joey>
<joey> activity 73 and i was like yeah why are </joey>
<connor> there so many but i remember when it </connor>
<connor> when it came out i was in school and </connor>
<connor> ever everyone was like this is the </connor>
<garnt> scariest movie ever yeah it's so scary </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i know right and i was just </garnt>
<garnt> everyone was like [ __ ] their pants </garnt>
<garnt> over it i remember because i was in </garnt>
<garnt> university at the time and so i was like </garnt>
<connor> all right i'll see what the hype's about </connor>
<connor> because uh back then my roommates had a </connor>
<connor> watch party and then we watched uh </connor>
<connor> paranormal activity the first one and i </connor>
<connor> everything everyone was like jumping at </connor>
<connor> just like the [ __ ] closet opening and </connor>
<garnt> i'm just like i can literally see the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] string being used to open this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] door how is this scary what is </garnt>
<connor> going on </connor>
<connor> one remote press </connor>
<connor> one that i thought wasn't bad was it the </connor>
<connor> invisible men it wasn't that bad </connor>
<connor> actually is that what it's called oh the </connor>
<connor> invisible man yeah the one about the </connor>
<connor> invisible man </connor>
<garnt> sydney showed me that one i like that </garnt>
<connor> one it was all right yeah i quite like </connor>
<connor> that one yeah the cinema is pretty good </connor>
<joey> i enjoyed that one i like um i watched </joey>
<joey> the other day i finally watched um what </joey>
<connor> is it hereditary oh </connor>
<joey> oh how was that one because because i </joey>
<connor> missed out on it when it first came out </connor>
<connor> so i i kind of missed the initial hype </connor>
<connor> yeah because i was like western hearts </connor>
<connor> whatever for me yeah but then i think </connor>
<connor> felix showed me midsummer which is done </connor>
<connor> by the same guy arias yeah yeah and i </connor>
<connor> was like okay this is very creepy but </connor>
<connor> also kind of cool and experimental so i </connor>
<connor> was like all right well i heard </connor>
<connor> hereditary was pretty good i watched it </connor>
<connor> it's uh </connor>
<connor> it's weird i don't i wouldn't i almost </connor>
<connor> wouldn't even call it a horror film it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i don't know it's you know what it feels </connor>
<garnt> like it feels like if david lynch made a </garnt>
<connor> horror film yeah you know okay where </connor>
<joey> it's like it's it's scary but it's also </joey>
<garnt> as as we established in the previous </garnt>
<garnt> three by three joey the big arts knob </garnt>
<connor> yeah david lynch </connor>
<connor> i feel like you just to make a good </connor>
<connor> horror movie you have to be [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> yeah well </joey>
<garnt> you'll just be completely [ __ ] up to </garnt>
<joey> make any horror content i feel you need </joey>
<garnt> to be [ __ ] up maybe in some aspects </garnt>
<garnt> actually uh me and sydney watched uh we </garnt>
<garnt> we had uh we had a night the other day </garnt>
<connor> that we just kind of like binged part of </connor>
<connor> like the final destination series </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> the reason for that was because i kind </connor>
<connor> of i kind of remembered my very first as </connor>
<connor> a teenager i love those films yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i remember the very first time i watched </connor>
<connor> final destination and was it was </connor>
<connor> actually in school right right um so i </connor>
<connor> think i was like i think it was like </connor>
<connor> middle school at the time so i was like </connor>
<connor> i think around 12 13 years old and i </connor>
<garnt> don't know if the same thing for </garnt>
<garnt> australia but you know like at the end </garnt>
<garnt> of term in school right it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like a free frog and the teachers it's </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like that period where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> the last two classes of the year or </garnt>
<garnt> something teachers just let you let you </garnt>
<garnt> do whatever the [ __ ] you want right yeah </garnt>
<joey> was that true in australia yeah i </joey>
<connor> definitely it depends on the school but </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i think most schools it was </connor>
<connor> kind of just like </connor>
<joey> i'm going on break in [ __ ] three days </joey>
<garnt> yeah whatever yeah so it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like in the school thousand </garnt>
<garnt> you just had a week period where you </garnt>
<connor> just basically basically go to class and </connor>
<connor> every teacher would put on a different </connor>
<joey> film or just like roll in the team yeah </joey>
<connor> just roll just roll on the tv and </connor>
<connor> everyone will watch a different film and </connor>
<garnt> like [ __ ] ninety percent of the time </garnt>
<connor> it was shrek it was fun okay yeah okay </connor>
<connor> it was just awesome </connor>
<connor> yeah we watch shrek </connor>
<connor> good to know that that was just a </connor>
<connor> nationwide it's that time of year okay </connor>
<connor> end of year all right i guess it's shrek </connor>
<connor> again </connor>
<connor> and i remember this one class um one of </connor>
<connor> one of my classmates brought in a dvd </connor>
<connor> yeah right because </connor>
<connor> we were just </connor>
<connor> because the teacher would ask what does </connor>
<connor> everyone want to watch and so this guy </connor>
<connor> samuel </connor>
<connor> he he brings out the dvd and he brings </connor>
<connor> out final destination and he was like </connor>
<connor> this is this is a film i think the </connor>
<connor> entire class would want to watch and </connor>
<connor> everyone's like yeah sure anything </connor>
<connor> i think we were like 12 at the time </connor>
<joey> i had not heard a final destination at </joey>
<joey> the time but we're like yeah sure like </joey>
<joey> because like you know anything to get us </joey>
<joey> away from shrek or whatever </joey>
<joey> or whatever whatever the usual films </joey>
<connor> we're watching right so he was like miss </connor>
<connor> this i i think that the classroom would </connor>
<connor> watch would want to watch this and </connor>
<connor> nobody kind of like opposed it so and </connor>
<connor> the teacher had never heard of the film </connor>
<connor> before </connor>
<connor> okay so she was like dangerous so she </connor>
<connor> was like this boy just had this dvd on </connor>
<connor> him i i think he knew what he was doing </connor>
<connor> right yeah and so um so the film starts </connor>
<connor> off in final destination and characters </connor>
<connor> are always like it's it's i don't know </connor>
<connor> what the rating was like back then </connor>
<connor> but characters were </connor>
<connor> already swearing but </connor>
<connor> i think in pg films in like the uk even </connor>
<connor> if you have like one or two swear words </connor>
<connor> it can still be skewered towards like </connor>
<connor> the lower ratings if it's just like one </connor>
<connor> or two swelling i think so yeah yeah um </connor>
<connor> so like characters so i remember the </connor>
<connor> opening scene where they like get on the </connor>
<connor> plane and people start arguing whatever </connor>
<connor> um it's it's kind of sus because you can </connor>
<connor> hear people obviously swearing </connor>
<connor> and the teacher's just like uh samuel is </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> is is this suitable for this adrian is </connor>
<connor> like yeah miss don't worry it's just the </connor>
<connor> opening scene don't worry miss like just </connor>
<connor> don't worry about it and she's like okay </connor>
<connor> okay and so i remember the opening scene </connor>
<connor> is where like i i think it's it's where </connor>
<connor> the plane crashes that's the first final </connor>
<connor> destination i remember </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> so a bunch of 12 girls just watching </connor>
<connor> uh watching this plane take off and then </connor>
<connor> obviously um the plane starts to crash </connor>
<connor> uh the the wing snaps and everyone's </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] screaming it's terrifying right </garnt>
<garnt> in the scene and then you see like blood </garnt>
<garnt> splatter and then you see someone </garnt>
<garnt> getting burned alive </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> immediate </garnt>
<garnt> immediately like the [ __ ] the teacher </garnt>
<garnt> gets up aggressively like aggressively </garnt>
<garnt> gets off to the tv doesn't even doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> even switch it up unplugs the tv and </garnt>
<garnt> goes </garnt>
<garnt> samuel </garnt>
<garnt> get outside now </garnt>
<garnt> that was my very first experience at </garnt>
<joey> final destination absolutely chad samuel </joey>
<joey> he was like he probably walked out i was </joey>
<connor> like worth it </connor>
<connor> i remember one of them put like uh it </connor>
<connor> was an art class i remember this and </connor>
<connor> like the teacher was not tech savvy at </connor>
<connor> all right and uh he put meat spin on all </connor>
<connor> the pcs </connor>
<connor> and then took just unplugged all the </connor>
<joey> mouse and keyboards and he the teacher's </joey>
<joey> having a mental breakdown didn't </joey>
<joey> understand why he couldn't just like he </joey>
<connor> was like [ __ ] hammering the keyboard </connor>
<joey> yeah like why was it turning off and </joey>
<connor> then i started hitting the monitor then </connor>
<connor> trying to turn the monitor off i don't </connor>
<connor> even think he knew how to turn it off </connor>
<connor> and then he didn't know how to turn it </connor>
<connor> off he didn't even think of unplugging </connor>
<connor> it or anything so this was still playing </connor>
<connor> the whole time and then goes and gets </connor>
<connor> another teacher to come around it's like </connor>
<connor> why don't you turn it off he's like oh i </connor>
<connor> didn't know how he pressed the button to </connor>
<connor> turn it off classic mead spin he's like </connor>
<connor> meat spin and there's like these poor </connor>
<connor> girls as well i've never seen this don't </connor>
<connor> look it up if you don't know what that </connor>
<connor> is because obviously we're all like 12s </connor>
<connor> that's if you're a guy and you're a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] idiot yeah i mean it was </connor>
<connor> i mean it was like meat spin lemon party </connor>
<garnt> i didn't know what goatee was that was </garnt>
<connor> obviously like a few years past </connor>
<garnt> that you came in the office like well </garnt>
<connor> like a month ago i was like i just found </connor>
<connor> out what goats </connor>
<connor> or something right and we were like oh </connor>
<connor> how did you find that out right how did </connor>
<joey> you find out how did you find out about </joey>
<joey> goatsee in 2021 you you guys were the </joey>
<joey> ones who told me about it really yeah it </joey>
<connor> was it was like literally a recording a </connor>
<garnt> trash taste and you were just telling </garnt>
<garnt> uh why was i talking about goats wait </garnt>
<garnt> this is in an episode oh this wasn't an </garnt>
<garnt> episode it was like before we started </garnt>
<garnt> you didn't know what it was no i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> i was like how did you have wait you </garnt>
<joey> know what meat spit was you know what </joey>
<joey> goats i had to explain to god what goats </joey>
<connor> he was please don't look it up </connor>
<connor> some men spreading his butt cheese </connor>
<garnt> it's 20 21 okay you don't need to know </garnt>
<garnt> what meat spin is or don't see these are </garnt>
<connor> all just like people doing horrible </connor>
<garnt> things yeah like people stuff yeah </garnt>
<connor> pretty sure you can find way worse stuff </connor>
<connor> in the internet now anyway so yeah of </connor>
<connor> course you do yeah but that back back </connor>
<garnt> when we were growing up this was just </garnt>
<garnt> like the [ __ ] you'd like show your mates </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] hey there's this really </joey>
<garnt> cool thing if you google meat spin oh </garnt>
<garnt> two girls one cup </garnt>
<joey> is still scarring to this day yeah i </joey>
<garnt> remember watching that yeah going back </garnt>
<garnt> to horror movies like i would like to </garnt>
<garnt> find </garnt>
<garnt> a horror movie i really liked has anyone </garnt>
<connor> seen annihilation the one with natalie </connor>
<connor> portman </connor>
<connor> that sounds so familiar </connor>
<connor> uh there was a plot breakdown so the </connor>
<connor> plot breakdown is that </connor>
<connor> um there's an alien artifact or some </connor>
<connor> artifact from space that crash lands </connor>
<connor> um somewhere somewhere in the world </connor>
<connor> obviously and it creates this kind of </connor>
<connor> force field barrier right </connor>
<connor> and uh you can easily enter the barrier </connor>
<connor> but you can't get any like electrical </connor>
<connor> signals or any like communications </connor>
<garnt> uh this features natalie portman and </garnt>
<connor> hawkeye </connor>
<garnt> not </garnt>
<garnt> no you're thinking of uh a rival that </garnt>
<connor> was the one which i really like arrival </connor>
<connor> i hope that was good that was good </connor>
<garnt> that's not a horror movie though oh i </garnt>
<joey> thought it was okay yeah i mean it's </joey>
<joey> just a sci-fi oh okay yeah i just i just </joey>
<joey> wanted more sci-fi stuff which which i </joey>
<joey> think is why i was really going to loki </joey>
<connor> and so </connor>
<connor> and so </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> they can't get any </connor>
<connor> sorry they can't get any signals in </connor>
<connor> there so they don't know what's going on </connor>
<connor> in there and every team that they've </connor>
<connor> sent in there just never finds their way </connor>
<connor> out so they really they literally don't </connor>
<connor> know what's going on in there and this </connor>
<connor> force field is slowly slowly expanding </connor>
<connor> so eventually it will cover the whole </connor>
<connor> earth so they need to kind of stop it </connor>
<connor> right they need to kind of figure it out </connor>
<connor> and so </connor>
<connor> they send this team of scientists to go </connor>
<connor> investigate what's inside there and i </connor>
<connor> kind of won't spoil it from there </connor>
<joey> because a lot of sounds good a lot of </joey>
<connor> weird things happen and it's not like </connor>
<connor> it's not so what i liked about it is </connor>
<connor> it's it was just like really it's really </connor>
<connor> terrifying but not because of any jump </connor>
<connor> scares just some of the ideas within </connor>
<connor> this you know with some of the ideas of </connor>
<connor> what happens to the people within this </connor>
<connor> circle are just like really unsettling </connor>
<garnt> and really terrifying it is very much </garnt>
<garnt> like a kind of like jinjito ideas where </garnt>
<garnt> it's just really weird kind of ideas </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't you kind of have to have </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't know what kind of mind you </garnt>
<garnt> need to come up with these things </garnt>
<garnt> uh but it's that i i would like more </garnt>
<garnt> horror like that and i don't know where </garnt>
<garnt> to start with recommendations which is </garnt>
<garnt> why if anyone if anyone knows any then </garnt>
<connor> i'm all open what was that film with the </connor>
<connor> woman nicholas cage </connor>
<garnt> and there's like numbers and there's a </garnt>
<garnt> kid who like has the knowing </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<connor> i don't know how i remember that's the </connor>
<connor> one have you seen that movie yeah i've </connor>
<connor> seen that movie what is it </connor>
<connor> i can't remember but i remember being </connor>
<garnt> really [ __ ] stupid </garnt>
<connor> look at nicholas cage like he like stops </connor>
<garnt> like a plane crashing or something no i </garnt>
<garnt> i think because i watched this as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> i remember he i i think it's like </garnt>
<garnt> something to be a series are we just </garnt>
<connor> like trying to poorly recollect movies </connor>
<connor> like like what's this movie i want that </connor>
<connor> like this thing okay okay i'm going to </connor>
<connor> try and recreate this movie from what i </connor>
<connor> have how do you remember this perfectly </connor>
<connor> um because okay so as a kid in the </connor>
<connor> summer </connor>
<connor> oh this is going on another tangent now </connor>
<connor> so my summer's considered consisted of </connor>
<connor> me going to thailand and me spending </connor>
<connor> like six weeks in thailand and obviously </connor>
<connor> i wouldn't have something to do every </connor>
<connor> day so </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> like part of my childhood childhood </connor>
<connor> experience is going to the mall </connor>
<connor> and go and in like and just like in in </connor>
<connor> basically every southeast asian country </connor>
<connor> there'd be these stands where you have </connor>
<connor> these like dvd covers and you just like </connor>
<connor> you just like flip through the covers </connor>
<connor> and just choose which movies you'd want </connor>
<connor> to see and some of them weren't out on </connor>
<connor> dvd yet officially right so you just </connor>
<connor> flip through them you just want i want </connor>
<connor> that one i want that one i want that one </connor>
<connor> and one that one and then they'd ask you </connor>
<connor> to uh go go walk in the mall for like a </connor>
<connor> good half an hour to an hour and then </connor>
<connor> they'll call you i'll tell you when your </connor>
<garnt> purchase is ready right which was a 100 </garnt>
<garnt> totally legal of course of course um but </garnt>
<connor> you all know there's nothing very strict </connor>
<garnt> copyright yes yes yes yes um so like my </garnt>
<garnt> summer would just be basically watching </garnt>
<garnt> every </garnt>
<garnt> blockbuster hollywood movie that came </garnt>
<garnt> out that year because that that i i </garnt>
<garnt> looked forward to it because i could </garnt>
<connor> literally pick every film through this </connor>
<connor> day knowing is still the best </connor>
<garnt> and to this day i still remember knowing </garnt>
<garnt> that's why that's honestly why 50 first </garnt>
<garnt> dates almost went went on my 3x3 because </garnt>
<garnt> i'd watched that so many times what are </garnt>
<connor> you going to say because of knowing </connor>
<connor> i was like what is this episode because </connor>
<connor> only one movie that tops no </connor>
<garnt> yeah so like i've watched so many of </garnt>
<connor> these films which are now what i </connor>
<connor> classify as like airplane films because </connor>
<connor> now i would not watch them in any other </connor>
<connor> circumstances unless i was on an </connor>
<connor> airplane um but of knowing was one of </connor>
<connor> the films that i was stuck inside </connor>
<connor> indoors in thailand </connor>
<garnt> had nothing to do but just watch films </garnt>
<garnt> and uh from what i remember it was they </garnt>
<garnt> i think it had to do with like a time </garnt>
<garnt> capsule that was buried ages ago oh </garnt>
<connor> right yeah that was it and there was </connor>
<connor> like a number like a cipher or something </connor>
<garnt> yeah there was some kind of cipher </garnt>
<connor> numbers or something that like </connor>
<joey> and that like </joey>
<joey> predicted the apocalypse or something um </joey>
<connor> that sounds dumb and nicolas cage was </connor>
<connor> just like i see the future i see what's </connor>
<connor> going to happen the number is basically </connor>
<connor> and uh </connor>
<connor> stuff nicholas cage things happen yeah </connor>
<connor> and then uh the world literally ends </connor>
<connor> because i think it's a solar flare that </connor>
<connor> uh kills everyone uh spoilers if you </connor>
<connor> ever wanted to watch knowing i wanted to </connor>
<connor> watch if if he ever wanted to watch the </connor>
<connor> masterpiece that is nicholas cage's </connor>
<connor> knowing </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> how did we get on this topic </connor>
<connor> just talking about movies </connor>
<connor> is that a horror movie i i think it is a </connor>
<connor> horror it's supposed to be a horror it's </connor>
<connor> not as it is horrible i'm looking up </connor>
<connor> right now </connor>
<connor> i'm looking at right now knowing my name </connor>
<garnt> is casey can we take a break because i </garnt>
<garnt> need to pee and i'm very hot right now </garnt>
<connor> yeah i found out it is a science fiction </connor>
<connor> film not a horror film but it was uh it </connor>
<garnt> was it was it was pretty felt like </garnt>
<garnt> horror it was pretty horrible what ever </garnt>
<joey> happened to nicolas cage i know he's </joey>
<joey> just busy kind of went off the rails in </joey>
<joey> here a little bit and then i don't know </joey>
<joey> i don't i don't feel educated enough to </joey>
<connor> talk about it but </connor>
<connor> i don't really keep up with nicholas </connor>
<joey> cage's life </joey>
<connor> i mean how many nicholas cage films have </connor>
<connor> you seen a fair amount too many too many </connor>
<connor> probably more than i'd catch i probably </connor>
<connor> watched one and i was like what all </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<garnt> you're not watching one </garnt>
<garnt> huh yeah i was about to say connor </garnt>

<connor> idea i was fearing loathing in las vegas </connor>
<joey> and i was like all right is that a </joey>
<connor> remake is that a remake </connor>

<joey> casino yeah oh yeah </joey>
<joey> and i was like </joey>
<joey> all right </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<connor> i just got like at that moment i was </connor>
<connor> like i understand nicolas cage now </connor>
<connor> and then everything else i've seen from </connor>
<joey> nicolas cage has just been like youtube </joey>
<garnt> clips from other movies honestly that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's all you need to like experience </garnt>
<garnt> nicholas kidd i feel that's the best way </garnt>
<joey> to experience this okay just out of </joey>
<garnt> context movie clips right i think one of </garnt>
<garnt> my favorite youtube nicholas cage clips </garnt>
<garnt> is this there's a lot by the way there's </garnt>
<connor> a lot but one of my favorites is just </connor>
<connor> someone edited </connor>
<connor> edited him like uh during like a driving </connor>
<connor> scene or something and it's just like </connor>
<connor> it's just </connor>
<connor> him like getting into a car and just it </connor>
<connor> out of context it looks like he's just </connor>
<connor> play driving like </connor>
<connor> it's it's so hard to describe but it's </connor>
<connor> uh it's it's </connor>
<connor> you gotta watch it and another another </connor>
<connor> thing is just nicholas cage slowly </connor>
<connor> losing his mind as well yeah well have </connor>
<connor> you ever seen no one i think sorry yeah </connor>
<connor> it's just like him slowly getting more </connor>
<connor> and more crazy as the clip goes to the </connor>

<garnt> putting to memory oh my god yeah like on </garnt>
<garnt> the topic of horror films one thing that </garnt>
<garnt> always like </garnt>
<garnt> fascinated me as a kid that i don't </garnt>
<garnt> think is around anymore is like i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> part of the part of the you know the </garnt>
<connor> blockbuster or rental dvd experience for </connor>
<connor> me was going to the rental like the </connor>
<connor> blockbuster and just seeing like the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] horrific </connor>
<connor> dvd covers of like every horror movie </connor>
<connor> right i don't know why like they those </connor>
<garnt> fascinated me as a kid and they're bad </garnt>
<connor> or like what do you mean horrific like </connor>

<garnt> terrified i was like because the </garnt>
<garnt> blockbuster near my house well that </garnt>
<connor> that's not their anymore obviously there </connor>
<connor> was it was separated into aisles for </connor>
<garnt> different genres yeah all of the action </garnt>
<connor> blockbusters were in one aisle yeah all </connor>
<garnt> the romance were in one hour and then </garnt>
<connor> right on like the far left of the </connor>
<connor> blockbuster there was the aisle for all </connor>
<connor> the horror films yeah i was so scared to </connor>
<connor> walk down that aisle </connor>
<connor> just because like just in my periphery </connor>

<joey> can't keep track i can actually remember </joey>
<connor> i can actually remember the time where i </connor>

<connor> because like i think i was like five or </connor>
<connor> six years old yeah and i was in the </connor>
<connor> living room and my parents were watching </connor>
<connor> the ring </connor>
<connor> and like obviously you know i was kind </connor>
<connor> of just hanging around while they were </connor>
<connor> just watching that movie but i i </connor>
<connor> remember i looked over at the tv and it </connor>
<connor> was the scene where sadoko comes out of </connor>
<connor> the tv yeah and that was the moment i </connor>
<connor> was like i hate this i i hate anything </connor>

<garnt> don't know why american pie was always </garnt>
<garnt> on tv in the uk yeah yeah on itv2 it was </garnt>
<garnt> always on yeah it was always on it was </garnt>
<connor> always on at like </connor>

<connor> the american pie films all the time okay </connor>
<connor> it was always like everyone in the uk </connor>
<connor> has seen american pie it was always </connor>
<garnt> uncut as well it was it was the closest </garnt>
<connor> thing we had like to uh </connor>
<garnt> when uh i was available american pie two </garnt>
<garnt> and of course there was like the lesbian </garnt>
<garnt> make-out scene oh my god and of course </garnt>
<garnt> that was the scene that they had to walk </garnt>
<garnt> through </garnt>
<connor> have those movies aged well i don't </connor>

<joey> pie in a while i think all those kinds </joey>
<joey> of like teenage comedy films have just </joey>
<garnt> not aged like like scary movie has not </garnt>
<connor> aged well scary movie was never funny i </connor>
<connor> don't know i think i remember there was </connor>
<joey> less funny now yeah one time i was </joey>
<connor> watching something and it was like i </connor>
<connor> think there was drugs and sex in it and </connor>
<connor> i was just playing my game boy yeah well </connor>
<connor> this is going on they were like oh i </connor>
<connor> remember i was like 12 saying my parents </connor>
<connor> like i don't know he doesn't understand </connor>
<connor> anything and i'm like i'm like oh i </connor>
<connor> think i do i just i'm just pretending </connor>
<connor> like i'm not paying attention </connor>
<garnt> did your parents ever say anything </garnt>
<garnt> during like those [ __ ] awkward scenes </garnt>
<connor> or no that's right it was just like the </connor>
<connor> awkward side it was just silence that's </connor>
<joey> what makes it more awkward oh i always </joey>
<connor> used to like get up and like be like i </connor>
<connor> gotta go to the bathroom </connor>
<connor> yeah i did yeah i remember i was like if </connor>
<joey> one of my parents didn't do it i was </joey>
<connor> like i should say all right i'll be the </connor>
<connor> one to go to the bathroom you know what </connor>
<connor> film i remember watching at like age 10 </connor>
<connor> with my parents i think this is why they </connor>
<connor> played it because i was so young where </connor>
<connor> they thought he's not gonna understand </connor>
<connor> anything yeah it was brokeback mountain </connor>
<connor> nice </connor>
<connor> like my parents okay i don't remember </connor>
<connor> what happened to it because i was 10. </connor>
<connor> but i do remember there was there was </connor>
<joey> gay things happening yeah it's just jake </joey>
<joey> gyllenhaal and heath ledger having a </joey>
<connor> water session yeah yeah i remember but </connor>
<connor> that's yeah i was like oh okay i don't </connor>
<connor> know what's i don't understand what's </connor>
<connor> happening but my parents were like for </connor>
<connor> some reason they were like yeah let's </connor>
<connor> just broke back around him with our son </connor>
<joey> it's so unfortunate though because </joey>
<connor> that's actually a really [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> news because i went back and watched it </connor>
<connor> after i was like uh i think 18 because i </connor>

<connor> check off i don't know </connor>
<connor> you never watched a film with your </connor>
<connor> friends that has a sex scene in it i'm </connor>
<connor> trying to think i think i've watched </connor>
<joey> like funny porno plots with my friends </joey>
<joey> like fake taxi with my friends i've just </joey>
<joey> watched porn with my friends </joey>
<connor> i think i think i have watched i have </connor>
<joey> been like let's watch this funny porno </joey>

<joey> don't think i've ever gone through that </joey>
<joey> no that's like my favorite pastimes like </joey>
<joey> watching cursed porn with my friends </joey>
<connor> i had a friend as well i was like he can </connor>
<connor> watch straight uh normal movies with </connor>
<connor> straight sex in it but he couldn't watch </connor>
<connor> not normal movies with gay sex scenes in </connor>
<connor> it with his friends it's just super </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable </connor>
<joey> that's just a bit of macho insecurity </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> that sounds a bit insecure yeah i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know man sounds like you're a little </garnt>
<garnt> insecure he's like no no no i just don't </garnt>
<connor> like it i'm like why don't you like it </connor>
<connor> and then he's like i'm not homophobic </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<connor> what's wrong with the little guy on </connor>
<connor> guyana yeah bro </connor>
<joey> like frankly as a man i enjoy watching </joey>
<connor> other channels </connor>
<connor> i think there's nothing manlier than </connor>
<joey> being able to sit there and enjoy that </joey>
<joey> you know come on man what's wrong you </joey>
<joey> know man it's just blokes hanging out i </joey>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<connor> i feel like yeah that happens a lot of </connor>
<connor> guys like that in the uk though you know </connor>
<joey> there's always there's always one guy </joey>
<joey> like that i feel in every guy i feel i </joey>
<garnt> feel like </garnt>
<garnt> lad's culture is definitely like a thing </garnt>
<joey> in the uk which is like kind of i'll </joey>
<joey> save in australia yeah yeah do you guys </joey>
<garnt> have lads culture in australia your </garnt>
<joey> friends who would be like that if you </joey>
<connor> try if you're oh yeah absolutely like </connor>
<connor> you know like because i went to a boys </connor>
<connor> school as well so it was even more so </connor>
<garnt> where it's like just macho and security </garnt>
<joey> everywhere where you know you'd be out </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's after school it's kind of </garnt>
<joey> toxic yeah yeah i didn't and they'd just </joey>
<connor> be like you know a girl from like you </connor>
<connor> know a nearby girl school or whatever </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah oh you you oh you should </connor>
<joey> totally smash her bro you should totally </joey>
<connor> smash it i'm just like i'm not you know </connor>
<connor> i try to be confrontational because </connor>
<joey> they're your friends right but i also </joey>
<connor> try and i'm not going to sit there and </connor>
<connor> be like dude that's pretty you know </connor>
<garnt> that's pretty not okay that's just </garnt>
<garnt> it's pretty it's pretty [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> i've had arguments with my friends about </connor>
<connor> it as well or i'll just be like yeah </connor>
<connor> that's uh that's kind of homophobic </connor>
<garnt> but that is homophobia yeah exactly why </garnt>
<garnt> do you think because we spend so much </garnt>
<garnt> time on the internet that we've just had </garnt>
<garnt> like more awareness about this kind of </garnt>
<connor> culture and stuff i think so because you </connor>
<connor> know a lot of my friends would never be </connor>
<connor> like they're not i don't think they </connor>
<connor> would ever be like i hate gay people or </connor>
<connor> anything like that right but also you </connor>
<connor> have to understand where that comes from </connor>
<connor> if you if there's something where you </connor>
<connor> can watch a normal sex scene but you </connor>
<connor> can't watch a gay sex scene yeah like </connor>
<connor> why is that like what's going on there </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> if you're a normal person surely who </connor>
<connor> doesn't give a [ __ ] you'd have no </connor>
<connor> problem to either right yeah you know </connor>
<connor> maybe you would find one harder than the </connor>
<connor> other but surely you wouldn't have a </connor>
<connor> problem right yeah i don't know if this </connor>
<connor> is too much for trash taste viewers </connor>
<joey> i mean like just because you're okay </joey>
<joey> with watching a sex scene doesn't mean </joey>
<connor> you need to be like into it no that's </connor>
<connor> what i like </connor>
<joey> don't have to actively dislike it but </joey>
<joey> like you don't have to like turn it off </joey>
<connor> or like go in the other room yeah you </connor>
<connor> know what i mean like there's a point </connor>
<connor> you can just sit there and be like all </connor>
<joey> right it's not for me but i'm not going </joey>
<joey> to be disgusted but it's part of the </joey>
<joey> story right yeah it's like this is what </joey>
<joey> it is yeah that's what i was saying i </joey>
<joey> was like you know if it's part of the </joey>
<joey> plot it's what it is man like they're </joey>
<joey> like oh it's just kind of weird isn't it </joey>
<joey> i'm like i'm like is it weird explain </joey>
<connor> how it's weird don't watch brokeback </connor>
<connor> mountain if that's the case </connor>
<connor> that's literally what that movie is </connor>
<connor> about i was like i was like that's the </connor>
<joey> problem though you think it's weird like </joey>
<joey> it's not like it's like it's not it's </joey>
<connor> not weird that people [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> i think i think the problem is that it's </connor>
<garnt> just a lot of the times especially like </garnt>
<garnt> in loud culture people just have never </garnt>
<garnt> thought about this too deeply because </garnt>
<connor> that's that's like they have these they </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm not saying that someone is yeah </connor>
<garnt> i totally agree with you go ahead yeah </garnt>
<garnt> no because like this this is what i feel </garnt>
<connor> every time i go back to my hometown and </connor>
<connor> i see some like my hometown friends who </connor>
<connor> like i i very much grew up in like lads </connor>
<connor> culture hanging out with like let's </connor>
<connor> let's land </connor>
<connor> uh and they still like [ __ ] go to you </connor>
<joey> know go every every [ __ ] summer go to </joey>
<joey> ibiza and you know try to smash as many </joey>
<joey> birds as possible </joey>
<joey> it's you know that that kind of that's </joey>
<connor> what it is that's kind of like lads </connor>
<connor> culture and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> as i've grown older i'm just like this </connor>
<connor> is a kind of a toxic mindset in a lot of </connor>
<connor> ways you know it's uh it's it's very </connor>
<connor> much </connor>
<connor> uh because i think the problem is that </connor>
<connor> they don't really talk about it they </connor>
<connor> don't really talk about their don't </connor>
<connor> really talk about their feelings or like </connor>
<connor> really think about things too deeply </connor>
<connor> because yeah that's not a loud thing </connor>
<connor> it's considered weak yeah that's </connor>
<connor> considered weak yeah you're not an alpha </connor>
<garnt> male if you talk about your feelings and </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] and also you know they don't really </garnt>
<connor> have conversations like this yeah they </connor>
<connor> don't talk about it so normally when </connor>
<connor> i've when it's been saying that i've </connor>
<connor> spoken about people it's like </connor>
<connor> especially in like where i'm from it's </connor>
<connor> like the first person who's ever been </connor>
<garnt> like now why do you feel that way about </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> now why is it that it makes you </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable you know what i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so what do you mean by that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's not on that and i was just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> you know and i've had like </garnt>
<joey> confrontations about it because it's </joey>
<joey> like yeah they get very defensive about </joey>
<joey> it yeah like they feel like oh [ __ ] wait </joey>
<joey> is he trying to say that i'm i'm in the </joey>
<joey> wrong for feeling this way yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> it's like well no i'm not trying to but </joey>
<joey> it's like why are you feeling that way </joey>
<joey> maybe i think maybe you just want to </joey>
<connor> have a discussion about it maybe maybe </connor>
<connor> oh like maybe look at like what's going </connor>
<garnt> on </garnt>
<connor> it's funny because like some of the most </connor>
<connor> kind of insecure </connor>
<connor> feeling of people i've ever met are like </connor>
<connor> the uh like some of the like biggest </connor>
<garnt> lads i've ever seen like the prop like </garnt>
<connor> jim bros who </connor>
<connor> sometimes it's it's insecurity sometimes </connor>
<connor> it's it's uh it toxic masculinity </connor>
<connor> sometimes homophobia it's like it's </connor>
<connor> whatever it is it's like get to the core </connor>
<connor> of it if that's what's bothering you you </connor>
<connor> can't watch brokeback mountain without </connor>
<garnt> being disgusted </garnt>
<connor> that's a great movie that's a great move </connor>
<connor> all i'm saying is if you're a guy don't </connor>
<connor> be afraid to talk about your feelings </connor>
<connor> with other guys i feel like i feel like </connor>
<connor> i didn't have that when i was growing up </connor>
<connor> because i thought i thought that it was </connor>
<connor> the mentality where if i did this with </connor>
<connor> my bros then i was the weak one you know </connor>
<connor> that's that's not what that's not what </connor>
<garnt> bros do to each other yeah you know and </garnt>
<connor> i i wouldn't say we're like sjw or </connor>
<garnt> anything like that i just i don't know i </garnt>
<garnt> just don't </garnt>
<connor> don't want to discriminate i don't </connor>
<connor> exactly why should you you know i don't </connor>
<connor> know exactly my personal opinion i'm </connor>
<connor> sure that i'm i'm no doubt there's some </connor>
<connor> viewers of trash tastes like i can't </connor>
<connor> believe this they've spoken about this </connor>
<connor> issue and stuff but i mean that's i mean </connor>
<joey> it's a sensitive time </joey>
<connor> stuff that i would talk about yeah but i </connor>
<connor> mean there's some things that are </connor>
<connor> sensitive and there's some things where </connor>
<connor> i'm like no that's just straight up </connor>
<connor> wrong yeah </connor>
<garnt> of course yeah i mean there's you know </garnt>
<connor> there's some things where i'm just like </connor>
<connor> i i think we i think we should talk </connor>
<connor> about this and i think you know it's i </connor>
<connor> think </connor>
<connor> it's not toxic at all to at least start </connor>
<connor> a conversation because i think a lot of </connor>
<connor> a lot of the times a lot of people just </connor>
<connor> haven't really never really put any </connor>
<connor> thought into it and they correctly </connor>
<connor> don't yeah they grew up in a culture </connor>
<connor> they grew up in a lifestyle and that has </connor>
<garnt> just never </garnt>
<garnt> put them in a position that challenges </garnt>
<connor> the way they think yeah and if someone </connor>
<connor> does feel uncomfortable with us talking </connor>
<connor> about this topic or hearing that idea </connor>
<connor> makes you uncomfortable i would say just </connor>
<connor> like don't get angry about it don't </connor>
<connor> don't you know react to it just think </connor>
<joey> like all right just turn off trash taste </joey>
<connor> go watch no no no </connor>
<connor> just think why does it like why does it </connor>
<connor> get you angry like what about it like if </connor>
<connor> that's like a whole religious thing all </connor>
<connor> right fine that's that's that's your </connor>
<garnt> problem about like i don't know like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i cuz like i just feel like </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's better now for at least people </garnt>
<garnt> who are like i guess on the internet and </garnt>
<garnt> especially on social media because </garnt>
<garnt> people are talking about this more often </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which is good but i still like </garnt>
<connor> they're they're </connor>
<connor> you forget sometimes that </connor>
<connor> we are not i i don't even know if we're </connor>
<connor> the majority you know because you like </connor>
<connor> every time i go home i don't know </connor>
<connor> it's hard to tell because we're i'm like </connor>
<connor> so ingrained in obviously our jobs are </connor>
<connor> surrounded with the internet and </connor>
<connor> surrounded with you know people who </connor>
<connor> think like me yeah that i it's weird </connor>
<connor> whenever you go to like go back home see </connor>
<connor> family </connor>
<connor> see friends from back home and you're </connor>
<connor> just like wow everyone thinks exactly </connor>
<connor> the same everyone has not changed much </connor>
<connor> at all because they just there's no one </connor>
<connor> in their community or in this group of </connor>
<garnt> friends that are exposed to the same </garnt>
<connor> thing as we are so yeah no totally yeah </connor>
<connor> because obviously on my channel like </connor>
<connor> very pro-lgbtq but like </connor>
<connor> obviously going back home it's not a </connor>
<connor> thing that's spoken about much it is </connor>
<joey> kind of it depends who you ask really i </joey>
<joey> think now more than before definitely </joey>
<connor> yeah with how the world's just changing </connor>
<joey> right yeah my parents pretty good with </joey>
<connor> it i i always try to educate when i can </connor>
<garnt> try and tell them about it yeah like i i </garnt>
<garnt> would like to think most of the time it </garnt>
<garnt> is just pure ignorance and oh totally </garnt>
<connor> especially in small towns yeah </connor>
<garnt> you know obviously not everyone is on </garnt>
<garnt> the internet all the time everyone's in </garnt>
<garnt> a big city you surrounded so it's you </garnt>
<garnt> know a lot of the time they just don't </garnt>
<garnt> come across it they're just like oh it's </garnt>
<connor> a that guy's very funny on tv and he's </connor>
<connor> gay </connor>
<connor> really </connor>
<connor> that's what it's like that's what my </connor>
<connor> parents are </connor>
<joey> but i mean you know it's uh </joey>
<connor> it's it's i mean it's everywhere right </connor>
<joey> now so it's like it's good yeah yeah i </joey>
<connor> just iron him it's uh it sucks that it's </connor>
<connor> one of those things that it even has to </connor>
<connor> be somewhat controversial </connor>
<connor> to talk about right and we've already </connor>
<connor> spoke about trash taste i'm sure that </connor>
<connor> some people will be alienated by it but </connor>
<connor> it sucks that even has to be something </connor>
<connor> that alienates people yeah you know when </connor>
<connor> it should affect people are gay get over </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<joey> you sometimes forget heath leisure is a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] australian in that movie is he </garnt>
<garnt> australian </garnt>
<connor> oh okay yeah do you think he's british </connor>
<connor> i think a lot of people think he's </connor>
<joey> british i have no idea i think everyone </joey>
<joey> thinks he's american oh dude yeah i </joey>
<garnt> thought he was american because i my </garnt>
<garnt> first experience with heath ledger was </garnt>
<garnt> uh 10 </garnt>
<connor> just great actor yeah fine </connor>
<connor> but yeah i feel like a lot of you know </connor>
<garnt> if you're in hollywood i think we've </garnt>
<garnt> talked about this haven't we how they're </garnt>
<garnt> good at like </garnt>
<garnt> they're gonna doing the american accent </garnt>
<garnt> but uh you you watch like some of like </garnt>
<garnt> the worst the worst attempts that people </garnt>
<garnt> are attempting a british accent it's </garnt>
<connor> like comically bad oh yeah i love keanu </connor>
<connor> reeves but it's british accident oh him </connor>
<connor> in like dracula dracula yeah that was </connor>
<garnt> so bad </garnt>
<garnt> that was hilarious it's a tie between </garnt>
<connor> that and uh [ __ ] at the end of django </connor>
<connor> when tarantino appears and it's like an </connor>
<connor> australian oh my god </connor>
<connor> what's going on </connor>
<connor> on the inside when i saw that i was like </connor>
<connor> this movie was almost perfect and then </connor>

<connor> podcast do we find us out what does </connor>
<joey> people say </joey>
<joey> cicada </joey>
<joey> yeah does that say american or uk what </joey>
<joey> is that what's good </joey>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<joey> well the thing is that we don't have </joey>
<garnt> them in my life my life is a lie </garnt>
<garnt> my life is a [ __ ] lie lord cicada has </garnt>
<garnt> been one of those i should say chicago </garnt>
<connor> cicada is one of those words i've only </connor>
<connor> ever been here heard </connor>
<connor> americans say yes because we don't have </connor>
<connor> it in the uk no one says it in the uk </connor>
<garnt> sure </garnt>
<connor> i've never heard that any british person </connor>
<connor> they said it literally sounds like </connor>
<connor> something out of harry potter no it's </connor>
<connor> cicada </connor>
<garnt> have you ever heard a british person say </garnt>
<garnt> cicada no i have never heard a british </garnt>
<connor> person say i'm saying now i'm getting it </connor>
<connor> in my head now yeah i know it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like you have to rewind that right </connor>
<connor> now i remember because </connor>
<connor> we literally we literally had a netflix </connor>
<connor> shoot uh where we had to talk about like </connor>
<connor> summer anime things i put zakat </connor>
<connor> i thought cicada or cicada was spelt </connor>
<connor> c-i-r-c-a-d </connor>
<connor> yeah he literally wrote sir </connor>
<connor> sir </connor>
<garnt> and i did and i didn't know you got </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> yeah i thought cicada had a r in it this </joey>
<joey> entire time and apparently it doesn't </joey>
<joey> um it's cicada now yeah but yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> i've said this before they never fix you </joey>
<joey> but i remember when i first moved japan </joey>
<joey> and i literally had gone my entire life </joey>
<joey> thinking that every cicada sound effect </joey>
<connor> in every anime was just a stock sound </connor>
<connor> effect right because they all sound </connor>
<connor> exactly the same you watch like one </connor>
<connor> summer anime episode and you're like </connor>
<connor> they're just using the same [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> sound effect as the other anime right </connor>
<connor> and i didn't realize until i moved to </connor>
<connor> japan that </connor>
<connor> cicadas just all sound exactly the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] same yeah i thought it was just </garnt>
<garnt> a [ __ ] audio jungle stock sound </garnt>
<garnt> effects no </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know how they sound so similar </garnt>
<joey> it's literally just been hardwired into </joey>
<joey> their brain to be like </joey>
<garnt> sound like this at this exact interval </garnt>
<garnt> yeah to the point where i was like </garnt>
<garnt> sitting at home one night um or one day </garnt>
<garnt> and i literally thought i had the tv on </garnt>
<garnt> playing a random anime and i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> realize that just the window was open </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i literally like went to my living </garnt>
<garnt> room to turn off the tv because i was </garnt>
<connor> like i'm not no one's watching anything </connor>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> lo and behold it was just the window and </garnt>
<garnt> i couldn't tell the difference between a </garnt>
<connor> tv stock sound effect and the real life </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> man </connor>
<joey> have you seen them flying yeah they're </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] massive they're terrifying yeah </joey>
<connor> i was outside uh the trash taste office </connor>
<connor> and uh i was just walking listening to </connor>
<connor> music just jamming you know and one flew </connor>
<connor> in my [ __ ] face and i [ __ ] smacked </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> i smacked it and i felt really bad cause </connor>
<connor> it hit the woman in front of me on her </connor>
<joey> and her back </joey>
<joey> you literally just tossed this </joey>
<connor> yeah and she turned around i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] [ __ ] playing ping pong yeah i </connor>
<connor> just hit it i </connor>
<joey> what's scarier is when they land on your </joey>
<connor> balcony but like like they don't say but </connor>
<connor> you think they're dead they just don't </connor>
<joey> move yeah they just like kind of pop and </joey>
<joey> just flop down you're like oh is he dead </joey>
<joey> and then you touch it's like </joey>
<connor> yeah there's one outside my door so i </connor>
<connor> opened the door yeah and then </connor>
<joey> what is that </joey>
<joey> scarier than any horror film because i </joey>
<connor> just opened my door you don't expect </connor>
<connor> that yeah there's nothing in my door you </connor>
<connor> never expect a jump scare at your door </connor>
<joey> that's [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna use the last of last of my </joey>
<connor> life to troll this huge it was literally </connor>
<connor> like under the door so i opened the door </connor>
<connor> and it was just it got like </connor>
<connor> the door like like rubbed it or </connor>
<connor> something and you're like </connor>
<connor> what is that i've never seen one before </connor>
<garnt> either no i've never seen one this is my </garnt>
<garnt> first time i had never seen one before </garnt>
<connor> either so i had no idea what they look </connor>
<garnt> like and these [ __ ] [ __ ] are so </garnt>
<connor> big yeah they're [ __ ] masculine </connor>
<connor> they're [ __ ] back in my like </connor>
<connor> apartment </connor>
<garnt> they're terrified also another thing i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know is that like i had always </garnt>
<connor> assumed i remember the first time i came </connor>
<connor> to japan like these [ __ ] are </connor>
<connor> loud like yeah like like you you need to </connor>
<connor> wear you need like noise casting </connor>
<connor> headphones to like even survive outside </connor>
<connor> you think it's like a swarm of them yeah </connor>
<connor> i thought i walked past this tree and </connor>
<joey> i'm like man these there are like a </joey>
<joey> swarm of cicadas just in this tree and </joey>
<joey> then it's like it just like suddenly </joey>
<joey> just stops and i'm like what's going on </joey>
<joey> and then i i realized it's one </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] making all this sound yeah </joey>
<joey> one [ __ ] makes so it's so loud </joey>
<joey> and it's actually like impressive how </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] loud this cicada is yeah right </joey>
<joey> because i </joey>
<joey> i'm on my balcony and like i can hear </joey>
<joey> what i think is a swarm of cicadas on </joey>
<joey> like the other side of the city or </joey>
<joey> something and then i realized just one </joey>
<joey> because it just like it's so weird like </joey>
<joey> having like a like it's so weird going </joey>
<joey> outside and just hearing like a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> noise like it sounds like an alarm yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it just suddenly stops as well and then </garnt>
<connor> it just suddenly stops </connor>
<connor> why why do they make noise what are they </connor>
<joey> trying to this on a mate or something </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] say why are they i think they're </joey>
<joey> like don't they like rub their legs </joey>
<connor> together to make that sound or something </connor>
<garnt> i think it's like a violin yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like the world's shittiest violin </garnt>
<garnt> yeah cause apparently they can only mate </garnt>
<garnt> during like a very short period of their </garnt>
<garnt> life </garnt>
<garnt> um during the summer yeah during the </garnt>
<joey> summer so they're like </joey>
<joey> they're [ __ ] horny as [ __ ] man they </joey>
<joey> need to [ __ ] they're the lads of the </joey>
<joey> insects yeah yeah and then they [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> once and they die and then that's it </joey>
<connor> that's just their entire life they they </connor>
<joey> live for that one [ __ ] and then they die </joey>
<joey> make as much noise as possible </joey>
<connor> i came too early died </connor>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> honestly i can think of worse ways to </connor>
<connor> die yeah than having like a not so </connor>
<connor> amazing that you're like all right life </connor>
<connor> is peaked now i am </connor>
<garnt> death initially some people die from </garnt>
<garnt> cows you know that's for [ __ ] sake </garnt>
<connor> i'm bringing this back right because </connor>
<connor> after that i i realized god was like how </connor>
<connor> do people die from cows i'm like god </connor>
<connor> they're like four tons what do you mean </connor>
<connor> how do people die from cows like so many </connor>
<garnt> people in the suburbs </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you can die from cows but you can </garnt>
<garnt> die from anything that's like four </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] tons from any like heavy animals </garnt>
<connor> that's why should not make me look like </connor>
<connor> an idiot for saying a cow can kill you a </connor>
<garnt> cow [ __ ] kill you </garnt>
<garnt> just because a cow can kill you doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> mean that you know probably if you get </garnt>
<garnt> killed by a cow you're doing something </garnt>
<garnt> stupid right yeah that's just that's </garnt>
<garnt> just my opinion right you'd have to try </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] hard to die from a cow </garnt>
<connor> most most ways people die are from </connor>
<connor> stupid ways god as well </connor>
<joey> believe it or not i remember a statistic </joey>
<joey> in japan where it's like more people in </joey>
<connor> japan die from vending machines and they </connor>
<connor> do shark attacks oh well yeah that makes </connor>
<joey> sense yeah right how from shaking the </joey>
<joey> vending machine and landing on you and </joey>
<garnt> dying okay well that's just idiots being </garnt>
<joey> idiots you deserve that if you're sure </joey>
<joey> that's what i mean it's the same thing </joey>
<connor> with a cow like you're not gonna be </connor>
<connor> walking through the [ __ ] panic and </connor>
<joey> then suddenly cow's like let me come and </joey>
<connor> squish you </connor>
<joey> also very very i think they can bite you </joey>
<connor> at all oh yeah um </connor>
<joey> if you're strong enough to uh push a </joey>
<joey> vending machine on yourself yeah why are </joey>
<joey> you wasting all that talent you know </joey>
<joey> what i mean like how do you get the </joey>
<connor> vending machine to fall on you it can't </connor>
<connor> be easy do you jump on it like why are </connor>
<connor> people doing this i i don't know </connor>
<connor> you cannot you have you tried moving a </connor>
<connor> vending machine it is not easy </connor>
<connor> like you really have to be committed to </connor>
<connor> this stupid act like you really are </connor>
<garnt> admitting like all right i'm breaking a </garnt>
<connor> sweat today like this is how i'm gonna </connor>
<garnt> take it off the yeezys for this one </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i'm saying about dying dying </garnt>
<connor> from cows you know why why why [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> try push like lying under a cow </connor>
<connor> or just like i'm standing behind a couch </connor>
<garnt> just go swim in shark infested water </garnt>
<connor> apparently i think you you know i think </connor>
<connor> you've more chance of dying via the the </connor>
<connor> cow honestly um have you ever seen </connor>
<connor> enough live league videos people [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> with animals to realize </connor>
<garnt> watch live link i don't know you just </garnt>
<joey> just casually sit down and watch live no </joey>
<connor> but sometimes i think i'd rather watch a </connor>
<connor> horror film on facebook or twitter and </connor>
<connor> one gets on there somehow and you just </connor>
<connor> how i don't know i'm just happy i'm a </connor>
<connor> widow yeah you just see like uh you know </connor>
<connor> like a monkey punching a man or </connor>
<connor> something i don't know what </connor>
<connor> what wait what </connor>
<joey> sure he does retweet some of those </joey>
<connor> questions she just sees [ __ ] and then </connor>
<connor> like people like [ __ ] around with </connor>
<connor> monkeys and then the monkey just beats </connor>
<garnt> them up </garnt>
<garnt> honestly like if i see the live link </garnt>
<garnt> logo that's like a i should probably </garnt>
<connor> there is a worrying amount of people who </connor>
<connor> think that like they can just like do </connor>
<connor> whatever they want their animals </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> but it's normally like like third world </connor>
<connor> countries and it's like scary because </connor>
<connor> they're like [ __ ] with like a monkey </connor>
<connor> and then the monkey just beats them up </connor>
<connor> and you're like well i mean fair enough </connor>
<connor> what did you expect yeah you kind of had </connor>
<joey> the right you know in court i would i </joey>
<connor> would i would fight anderson you know </connor>
<joey> you're likely [ __ ] with the smartest </joey>
<connor> animal yeah like because like i'm very </connor>
<garnt> wary whenever i see anything live like </garnt>
<garnt> because i've seen enough [ __ ] up [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> on the inside it's also a meme i've seen </connor>
<garnt> people put live league on them like meme </garnt>
<garnt> stars </garnt>
<garnt> so now i'm like i'm not sure if it's </garnt>
<garnt> meme or not it's it's like playing games </garnt>
<garnt> like reddit 5050 or whatever it's called </garnt>
<joey> right that's the only that's the only </joey>
<joey> time i've seen enough lively tower where </joey>
<connor> i'm just like yeah no nothing good comes </connor>
<connor> out of live sometimes it comes on and </connor>
<joey> you're like this is intriguing enough </joey>
<connor> where i don't think i can stop watching </connor>
<connor> now like the the premise i'm hooked i </connor>
<connor> don't know man i very quickly pulled </connor>
<connor> them yeah i'm just like you guys have </connor>
<connor> more willpower than me </connor>
<connor> when i see the premise or the first one </connor>
<connor> second the video i'm like damn i can't </connor>
<connor> turn it off now </connor>
<garnt> is that wrong with me i feel like that's </garnt>
<garnt> bad i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm just wired to click bait i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> monkey brain activates right your </garnt>
<garnt> curiosity </garnt>
<garnt> is you spelling uh circada incorrectly </garnt>
<garnt> yeah circada i realized like the other </garnt>
<connor> day i'm like [ __ ] i can't spell [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> without autocorrect anymore </garnt>
<connor> my spelling is so bad without </connor>
<garnt> autocorrect yeah that's pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> something i realize now when it's not on </garnt>
<garnt> i just kind of like type [ __ ] and i know </garnt>
<connor> that it will fix it for me </connor>
<garnt> i just type fast </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i'm i got something </garnt>
<garnt> similar as well where i'm like i can't </garnt>
<garnt> do mental arithmetic anymore like i i </garnt>
<garnt> literally like what like i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> oh what's uh nine times eight and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> get out the calculator </connor>
<connor> like i'm so reliant i should do it but </connor>
<connor> it'll take me yeah 20 seconds i can do </connor>
<garnt> it but it requires thinking and i don't </garnt>
<garnt> i i'm not all </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<connor> there you go okay i had to think about </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> graduating masters in engineering by the </connor>
<connor> way yeah </connor>
<garnt> what was your method of getting that </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<joey> don't </joey>
<garnt> because the nine times table is the </garnt>
<joey> easiest yeah that's what i would i would </joey>
<joey> the nine times nine is 81 then just </joey>
<joey> minus eight </joey>
<joey> that that's that's way too complicated </joey>
<garnt> even if there's an even easier </garnt>
<joey> anything times nine is super [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> easy i should have done that i don't </joey>
<garnt> know no i mean i i don't really have a </garnt>
<connor> system it's just figuring whatever your </connor>
<connor> brain is wired to do fast right yeah </connor>
<joey> well for me if it's nine times eight </joey>
<joey> then it's like well eight is so it </joey>
<joey> starts with a seven because whatever </joey>
<joey> you're timing by nine is always one </joey>
<joey> digit below yeah and then the two digits </joey>
<joey> uh sums up to nine am i i never </joey>
<connor> understood you know how every time you </connor>
<connor> would ever have like a new math teacher </connor>
<connor> they would always teach you that weird </connor>
<connor> way of solving a plus and a minus yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean and they're like right so </connor>
<connor> we're gonna add 425 to uh 522 and then </connor>
<connor> they're going to do right so we're going </connor>
<connor> to add the four to the five easy it's </connor>
<connor> great that now you know i'm like </connor>
<connor> do you really need to write this down </connor>
<joey> can we just like can we just </joey>
<joey> and then there's always like the like </joey>
<connor> just the really obscure ways to do it as </connor>
<connor> well where it's like there's got to be </connor>
<connor> an easier way yeah yeah all right </connor>
<connor> all right so when you bring the one over </connor>
<joey> pull out your dictionary yeah or it </joey>
<connor> would be like dividing by and they would </connor>
<connor> have this weird ass timetable or </connor>
<connor> something to do it and i'm like this </connor>
<connor> feels so convoluted why don't why not </connor>
<connor> just like figure out some other methods </connor>
<joey> like teacher when am i ever going to </joey>
<joey> divide 973 by 67 like i'm not i'm never </joey>
<garnt> going to i'm never going to go and count </garnt>
<connor> down i don't need to know this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> every every single like yeah like it is </connor>
<joey> great that you if you can do that with </joey>
<joey> your with your mind but there's a party </joey>
<joey> trick there's absolutely no setting </joey>
<joey> where you are ever not going to be using </joey>
<connor> a calculator and even if you are they </connor>
<connor> will not allow you to do that because </connor>
<connor> they won't trust you you should be using </connor>
<connor> a calculator for good practice </connor>
<joey> even if you could divide yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> insane numbers that people like no </joey>
<connor> that's not it it's good for like </connor>
<connor> estimates when you're talking </connor>
<connor> engineering terms you're like okay well </connor>
<connor> could maybe you try this much no i don't </connor>
<connor> think they just just off the top of my </connor>
<connor> head that doesn't seem right yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah that's good but in general like you </connor>
<connor> know those exams you know it's just </connor>
<garnt> funny how like mental arithmetic has </garnt>
<joey> just become become kind of like a party </joey>
<joey> trick yeah like you there's there's </joey>
<joey> always like you always see that one guy </joey>
<joey> every so often where you get the you get </joey>
<garnt> like the bill and they can just like </garnt>
<garnt> divide exactly the right amount in their </garnt>
<joey> head yeah but but it's also like the </joey>
<joey> shittiest type of party trick because </joey>
<joey> it's the party trick that you do and </joey>
<joey> nobody believes </joey>
<garnt> and people check it anywhere either way </garnt>
<joey> it's like nah let me put the calculator </joey>
<connor> out </connor>
<connor> oh it </connor>
<connor> numbers now that is just my life but yes </connor>
<garnt> exactly the same spelling now where i </garnt>
<garnt> just i could not live without </garnt>
<garnt> autocorrect and i don't know i feel like </garnt>
<connor> it's it's do you have those words that </connor>
<connor> you just you you know what they look </connor>
<garnt> like but you're like i just can't bother </garnt>
<garnt> to learn how to spell it right you know </garnt>
<garnt> what i mean i just want necessary i was </garnt>
<connor> literally about to say that </connor>
<connor> that is the one where i'm like i </connor>
<connor> honestly cannot remember which is the </connor>
<connor> two seas 2s yeah i just typed two s's </connor>
<joey> right </joey>
<connor> i don't know i just got no i'm pretty </connor>
<joey> sure the one for me that always [ __ ] me </joey>
<connor> up that i still never get right is </connor>
<connor> guaranteed yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> was like is the u in there is there an a </connor>
<joey> in this is it guaranteed or is it </joey>
<joey> guaranteed </joey>
<joey> this is what i just i don't care i </joey>
<joey> haven't like yeah </joey>
<joey> necessarily i'm just like i'm pretty </joey>
<joey> sure it's two s's </joey>
<joey> no it's not is it it's two s's i don't </joey>
<joey> know maybe it is </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> n-e-c-e-s-s-a-r-y right yeah i'm pretty </connor>
<connor> sure it is but yeah i already hold on </connor>
<connor> let me check </connor>
<garnt> i'll never get out of the autocorrect i </garnt>
<connor> just type and then click yeah it's that </connor>
<garnt> one yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but i think the thing about spelling is </garnt>
<connor> that it doesn't </connor>
<garnt> at the end of the day spelling is </garnt>
<connor> irrelevant </connor>
<garnt> at the end of the day you know you can </garnt>
<garnt> spell word wrong and people will still </garnt>
<connor> get like the meaning of the word most of </connor>
<joey> the time right </joey>
<joey> isn't there this phonetics yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> haven't you seen like the video where if </joey>
<joey> you put the first letter right and the </joey>
<connor> last letter right you just mixed it up </connor>
<joey> on the internet i've seen that yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like you've seen the ballerina that </joey>
<joey> spins the other way too gone </joey>
<connor> have you seen the dress that's blue and </connor>
<connor> green gold oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> i remember that oh my god i completely </garnt>
<joey> forgot about that the internet was on </joey>
<joey> fire for a week unnecessarily over a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] dress i remember meme culture </garnt>
<garnt> but i remember that was like the hot </garnt>
<garnt> thing back then back in the day </garnt>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> i knew i knew that dress meme went too </joey>
<joey> far when people were like all right so i </joey>
<joey> went into photoshop and i got the color </joey>
<joey> drop </joey>
<joey> and i can confirm the hex digits that it </joey>
<garnt> is in fact blue and gold what wasn't </garnt>
<joey> there that like audio </joey>
<connor> kind of yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah that one oh yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i remember that </joey>
<joey> i just saw that i was like who cares </joey>
<connor> yeah i i felt like after the whole dress </connor>
<joey> debacle it felt like everyone was </joey>
<joey> looking for the next thing that everyone </joey>
<joey> would </joey>
<connor> interpret differently interpret </connor>
<joey> differently and i just didn't give a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] that was a nice meme that lasted </joey>
<garnt> three days yeah i remember like the only </garnt>
<garnt> what what they called the </garnt>
<garnt> audio </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like audio illusion audio illusion </garnt>
<connor> that's the it's actually it's not really </connor>
<connor> an audio illusion it's just did you ever </connor>
<connor> did you guys ever do like the uh </connor>
<connor> frequency test where you have to like </connor>
<connor> test your frequency </connor>
<connor> and um </connor>
<connor> like i remember i was fancy i remember </connor>
<connor> my frequency was like so [ __ ] good as </connor>
<connor> a kid and i thought i'm never gonna lose </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> i don't know like dude as a kid do you </connor>
<connor> ever did you ever get that point where </connor>
<connor> i grown up told you that this is gonna </connor>
<connor> happen to you when you grow up yeah and </connor>
<connor> as a kid you're just like that's never </connor>
<connor> going to happen to me it's never going </connor>
<connor> to [ __ ] happen to me </connor>
<connor> i remember the first time i felt old was </connor>
<connor> the first time i did the second time i </connor>
<garnt> did did a frequency test when i was like </garnt>
<garnt> mid-20s and i'm just like this isn't the </garnt>
<garnt> same number as i remember as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> the grown-ups are right i'm getting old </garnt>
<joey> wait wait so is the frequency test like </joey>
<joey> the how much you can hear is that the </joey>
<garnt> one yeah so like the better your hearing </garnt>
<garnt> is the higher the frequency oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah generally when you get around to 30 </joey>
<joey> it starts to get a lot worse yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean doesn't like who the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> needs to hear like the </connor>
<joey> high kilohertz i mean i i immediately </joey>
<connor> felt that like because you know in like </connor>
<connor> some arcades in japan no yeah i like </connor>
<garnt> that keto tone that like stops like uh </garnt>
<garnt> animals from coming into oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> every time we walk past like an arcade </garnt>
<joey> with like a bunch of friends they'll be </joey>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] i'll be like what </connor>
<garnt> i legitimately don't it's that it's </garnt>
<connor> actually an advantage here yeah right </connor>
<connor> yeah because sydney sydney can hear it </connor>
<connor> and i can't anymore yeah right yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> apparently it hurts i'm just like i </joey>
<garnt> don't know apparently like in a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> shops in japan they just play this like </garnt>
<joey> i can't describe it i think isn't it you </joey>
<joey> could like </joey>
<joey> stop </joey>
<joey> teenagers i've also heard it's to stop </joey>
<joey> birds from flying cats and cats okay can </joey>
<garnt> you hear a connor yeah i can hear it </garnt>
<garnt> okay what does it sound like i was gonna </garnt>
<connor> describe what it was and i realized i've </connor>
<garnt> never been here </garnt>
<joey> i just realized i've never heard of an </joey>
<joey> uncomfortable ring in your ears </joey>
<garnt> is that if they've just put this high </garnt>
<garnt> frequency alarm or ring to stop </garnt>
<garnt> birds mosquitoes animals and loitering </garnt>
<garnt> oh okay </garnt>
<connor> i don't know which one it's actually for </connor>
<connor> might be is it for humans or animals i </connor>
<joey> don't know apparently it's for both </joey>
<connor> because you can hear it as well </connor>
<connor> probably should have picked a lower </connor>
<connor> frequency though because it doesn't work </connor>
<connor> if you've just got [ __ ] hearing then you </connor>
<connor> just immune to it like well it's funny </connor>
<connor> to stop like kids </connor>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<joey> okay okay that's uh </joey>
<joey> i've never been able to hear it though </joey>
<garnt> even even when i was a kid yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> you've been listening to like music for </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i think there's so many concerts </joey>
<connor> where my ears just got [ __ ] you're </connor>
<connor> gonna be like 14 what why are you saying </connor>
<connor> to me god i'm still like that yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> true you are your hearing is really bad </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> no but i talked about on the podcast </joey>
<joey> remember i was like because when we went </joey>
<connor> to go do the health checkup and i got an </connor>
<connor> a for my hearing and then i realized oh </connor>
<connor> i don't have bad hearing i just don't </connor>
<connor> listen </connor>
<connor> you're just [ __ ] dumb yeah i just i </connor>
<connor> just don't care about what you're saying </connor>
<joey> sometimes but i just shut it out true </joey>
<connor> true that's what it is yeah boys have </connor>
<connor> any fun plans for the summer </connor>
<garnt> you know what i miss </garnt>
<garnt> um this is like the first time in my </garnt>
<garnt> life where i've just not lived near a </garnt>
<connor> body of water </connor>
<connor> like you're surrounded by water what do </connor>
<joey> you mean we're literally an island </joey>
<connor> country no but like we're we're in tow </connor>
<connor> we're in tokyo right yeah and i think </connor>
<connor> the closest thing is like tokyo bay yeah </connor>
<connor> like part of part of the summer </connor>
<connor> experience for me is just going to the </connor>
<connor> beach somewhere and just like having it </connor>
<garnt> having a nice chill </garnt>
<garnt> you know beer or something and haven't </garnt>
<garnt> been able to do that for the past two </garnt>
<garnt> years and i've really i've really missed </garnt>
<joey> that experience i mean it doesn't really </joey>
<joey> matter because like the beaches have </joey>
<garnt> been closed no exactly it doesn't matter </garnt>
<connor> anyway because i can't go to the beaches </connor>
<joey> anyway yeah like okinawa's on the </joey>
<connor> lockdown so i can't go there so just i </connor>
<connor> just doesn't feel like i've i've had the </connor>
<connor> worst part of the summer experience </connor>
<garnt> which is just the [ __ ] blistering </garnt>
<garnt> heat and haven't been able to just enjoy </garnt>
<garnt> the nice trapped in a concrete jungle </garnt>
<connor> all right yeah basically so what are you </connor>
<garnt> going to do for your summer then go on </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know what can i do for the </garnt>
<joey> summer is there anything fun you can do </joey>
<joey> in the summer that doesn't involve a </joey>
<joey> beach or a pool or any body of water </joey>
<connor> stay inside play video games that sounds </connor>
<joey> pretty pretty [ __ ] good </joey>
<connor> that's what you do in winter though </connor>
<connor> right both seasons both seasons all </connor>
<connor> seasons </connor>
<garnt> because uh another thing is that uh we </garnt>
<garnt> get mosquitoes here in japan and we </garnt>
<connor> don't </connor>
<joey> yeah we do oh yeah yes </joey>
<connor> do you not get bitten no </connor>
<connor> lucky i never get them </connor>
<joey> how would you not get [ __ ] i get eaten </joey>
<connor> alive </connor>
<connor> maybe my blood doesn't taste good i </connor>
<joey> don't know i've never had a mosquito </joey>
<joey> apparently it does depend on your blood </joey>
<garnt> type okay i think it does because i get </garnt>
<garnt> bitten to [ __ ] whenever mosquitoes </garnt>
<connor> i know i can be in an area where someone </connor>
<joey> will get bit in a ton i won't have any </joey>
<garnt> on me i literally like god always tells </garnt>
<joey> me yeah i literally laid outside on my </joey>
<joey> balcony for like half an hour came </joey>
<garnt> inside and i had like 10 bites on my </garnt>
<joey> back </joey>
<joey> i'm not even joking </joey>
<garnt> don't we just don't have any bugs that </garnt>
<garnt> are annoying because well you guys are </garnt>
<garnt> mosquitos no </garnt>
<garnt> do you not remember when we were just </garnt>
<joey> chilling out in england in my garden i </joey>
<joey> just thought i got lucky </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> i just thought like oh this is a </connor>
<joey> stronger this is stronger blood type </joey>
<garnt> somewhere in the vicinity that they're </garnt>
<connor> going there's no mosquitoes no i'm just </connor>
<connor> that guy because like i'm just that guy </connor>
<garnt> who like </garnt>
<connor> i'm i'm the bait right because is that </connor>
<connor> meme of like the blades falling down and </connor>
<connor> the guy covering yeah it's gone everyone </connor>
<garnt> else everyone else at the party yeah </garnt>
<garnt> cause like if people hang out with me in </garnt>
<garnt> thailand or japan or whatever they get </garnt>
<connor> bitten less because i'm there i'm the </connor>
<connor> bait i i am what every mosquito goes </connor>
<connor> towards and i don't know why </connor>
<connor> because because in thailand we have we </connor>
<connor> have this saying where um normally it's </connor>
<connor> the mosquitoes go for the foreign people </connor>
<connor> because it's the foreign people who have </connor>
<connor> the sweet blood because the mosquitoes </connor>
<connor> aren't used to their blood so that was </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> so that was the [ __ ] life well </connor>
<connor> technically i didn't grow up in thailand </connor>
<connor> so maybe there's some kind of truth to </connor>
<connor> it but apparently apparently if you have </connor>
<garnt> never been beat well if mosquitoes are </garnt>
<connor> beaten by a mosquito is [ __ ] you know </connor>
<connor> what's going on huh </connor>
<connor> coming to our neighborhood </connor>
<garnt> i've never i've never get bitten by </garnt>
<connor> mosquitoes i'm so [ __ ] dude is it </connor>
<connor> like a blood type thing i don't even </connor>
<joey> know apparently it's like a blood type </joey>
<connor> thing it's also like a skin thing as </connor>
<connor> well like certain skin like if you have </connor>
<connor> like oily skin you're more likely to get </connor>
<connor> bitten like that i don't know there's </connor>
<connor> lots of theories out there i i think </connor>
<connor> it's literally just like if you're </connor>
<garnt> unlucky you're unlucky kind of thing </garnt>
<connor> yeah pretty much beer </connor>
<connor> oh yeah no apparently if you're you get </connor>
<garnt> uh you're more likely to get stung if </garnt>
<connor> you're drunk </connor>
<connor> is that true yeah apparently the </connor>
<garnt> mosquitoes drunk i don't know that's </garnt>
<joey> probably why they're like um guys come </joey>
<garnt> time for a sesh right because they get </garnt>
<connor> drunk in the blood right </connor>
<connor> baby </connor>
<connor> drinking so i don't know what's going on </connor>
<connor> is there a reason why mosquitoes go for </connor>
<connor> people more or less yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> there's like seven reasons yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't know if any of that has actually </connor>
<connor> been like scientifically confirmed i </connor>
<joey> feel it's just like it might be like a </joey>
<connor> little like coincidence it's not tasty </connor>
<connor> enough what the [ __ ] like what are they </connor>
<joey> like tasting </joey>
<connor> as well that's probably what i'm not </connor>
<connor> tasty bro what i want to be tasty </connor>
<connor> you don't want to be tasty missing out i </connor>
<joey> want to be tasty that's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> mosquitoes are [ __ ] they're the worst </joey>
<connor> they're the </connor>
<connor> nobody likes mosquitoes people they </connor>
<garnt> could be like the biggest animal lover </garnt>
<garnt> in the world and they see a mosquito and </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] that little [ __ ] isn't like </joey>
<joey> the mosquito i think i read somewhere </joey>
<joey> isn't the mosquito like the only animal </joey>
<joey> in like the food chain where if you got </joey>
<joey> rid of them it just wouldn't change the </joey>
<joey> food chain </joey>
<garnt> i don't know if that's an urban legend </garnt>
<joey> but i hope it's true i think it's </joey>
<joey> something like that because i remember </joey>
<joey> saying because like i think i looked it </joey>
<connor> up because i was like because in </connor>
<connor> australia we have a [ __ ] ton of flies </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah during the summer right like </connor>
<connor> it's [ __ ] horrible especially if </connor>
<connor> you're like out in the desert yeah </connor>
<connor> nothing but flies it's disgusting and i </connor>
<connor> think i just thought to myself like man </connor>
<connor> i really just wish all flies just </connor>
<connor> disappeared and then one of my friends </connor>
<connor> was like oh no like flies are like </connor>
<connor> really important to the food chain yeah </connor>
<garnt> like there's a lot of animals that eat </garnt>
<connor> flies and that's all like yeah is there </connor>
<garnt> an animal where if we just </garnt>
<joey> it just disappeared one day </joey>
<joey> would the food change still be intact </joey>
<joey> and i think mosquitoes was one of the </joey>
<connor> humans probably oh yeah </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<garnt> we were the </garnt>
<garnt> mosquitoes are [ __ ] useless things </garnt>
<joey> because i mean they just [ __ ] carry </joey>
<joey> diseases right like that's all they </joey>
<garnt> really do yeah they all they do is like </garnt>
<joey> give malaria to people right </joey>
<joey> there's probably like one other thing </joey>
<joey> there's probably one like really obscure </joey>
<joey> species of spider or something that </joey>
<joey> could only feed on mosquitoes that would </joey>
<joey> die out that's like integral for the </joey>
<connor> food chain </connor>
<joey> it's always like that like no no this is </joey>
<connor> one animal that specifically eats this </connor>
<connor> thing yeah how would you even eradicate </connor>
<connor> mosquitoes i would even go about that </connor>
<garnt> i don't know i don't ask the aussie they </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] they've they've had like enough </garnt>
<connor> problems trying to eradicate a certain </connor>
<joey> like the yeah toads right yeah yeah so </joey>
<connor> we had so we had the we have a lot of </connor>
<connor> sugar cane in australia uh yeah during </connor>
<connor> like the 1800s and then cane flies were </connor>
<connor> introduced which are these specific </connor>
<connor> breed of flies that only eat ca sugar </connor>
<connor> cane and which completely wiped out a </connor>
<connor> sugar cane </connor>
<connor> and we're like well [ __ ] we gotta get </connor>
<connor> rid of these flies because our food is </connor>
<connor> getting [ __ ] up yeah and then someone </connor>
<connor> was like i've heard overseas there was a </connor>
<connor> specific type of toad called the cane </connor>
<connor> toad that specifically only eats cane </connor>
<connor> flies </connor>
<connor> someone thought oh that's brilliant </connor>
<connor> that's gonna solve all of our problems </connor>
<connor> let's introduce it so they introduced it </connor>
<joey> yeah all the cane flies disappeared but </joey>
<joey> then somebody realized </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] nothing eats cane toads </joey>
<joey> and they're literally poisonous and </joey>
<garnt> they're killing our native animals </garnt>
<connor> so now we just have a cane toad outbreak </connor>
<garnt> and you just can't get rid of it and we </garnt>
<connor> just can't get rid of them dude it's </connor>
<connor> like me playing chess they like suddenly </connor>
<joey> thought one move ahead they were like </joey>
<connor> they didn't plan anything else like this </connor>
<joey> feels like a vast oversight in like </joey>
<joey> possible downsides yeah there's no pros </joey>
<connor> and cons list someone was like bro my </connor>
<connor> mate's got one bring it over yeah let's </connor>
<garnt> just test it out sounds like the </garnt>
<garnt> beginning of like an always sunny skit </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> like you you're just like oh let's bring </garnt>
<connor> over the cane toads and you just hit you </connor>
<connor> just see like the [ __ ] intro intro </connor>
<connor> title gang choices gang introduces cane </connor>
<connor> toads to the to the food chain </connor>
<joey> but then again australia hasn't had very </joey>
<joey> much luck with uh animals i mean we had </joey>
<garnt> an emu war we lost yeah i'm like what </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] is that about like i i </garnt>
<garnt> hear every australian say that and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like that just sounds like i said </garnt>
<connor> the great emu awards are the dumbest </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ever yeah they went to war against </connor>
<garnt> and they lost and we lost </garnt>
<joey> okay do you want to explain that dude </joey>
<garnt> have you seen anemu no they're [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> terrifying can they kill you yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's australia everything can kill you </garnt>
<connor> you should have known that one yeah </connor>
<connor> were they eating crops they're ruining </connor>
<joey> crops yeah they were ruining crops uh </joey>
<connor> and and again like they kind of just </connor>
<connor> like over bred themselves to the point </connor>
<connor> where there was just a [ __ ] ton of emus </connor>
<connor> and just not enough space so they </connor>
<connor> started invading farmland obviously </connor>
<connor> farmers got pissed off about it so they </connor>
<connor> tried to </connor>
<connor> get them out of it but obviously it's </connor>
<connor> one man versus a [ __ ] two and a half </connor>
<connor> meter bird </connor>
<connor> that can literally just kick you in the </connor>
<connor> chest and kill you </connor>
<connor> so uh i think it went on for like </connor>
<joey> a month or something i don't know how </joey>
<joey> long it was it was a very short bit it </joey>
<connor> was a very short they wasted so much </connor>
<connor> money and like ammunition and time </connor>
<joey> ammunition yeah yeah they were shooting </joey>
<joey> them shooting them they're like trying </joey>
<connor> to gun them down yeah but they could bet </connor>
<joey> like but the emus were literally like </joey>
<joey> the spartans and they were like because </joey>
<joey> they would think it was like we we were </joey>
<joey> like xerxes army and the emus were the </joey>
<connor> spartans and they're like oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> because they would like they weren't </connor>
<connor> fighting them but they were just they </connor>
<connor> just kept getting away yeah it was like </connor>
<joey> a looney tunes </joey>
<joey> they couldn't they couldn't kill them </joey>
<joey> it's just like the benny hill theme for </joey>
<joey> later mom straight they they had to wait </joey>
<joey> and ambush them that's how they </joey>
<connor> see it because they travel in flock </connor>
<connor> they go together in flocks and they were </connor>
<joey> trying to ambush them and they're also </joey>
<joey> extremely fun they can run like 60 70 </joey>
<connor> now the moment they started opening fire </connor>
<joey> on them they just ran away and they </joey>
<joey> would only kill like you know like </joey>
<joey> maybe yeah but they wasted like a </joey>
<joey> hundred grand in ammo like ammo isn't </joey>
<connor> cheap i feel like because we're so used </connor>
<connor> to war you think the ammo is like </connor>
<connor> affordable yeah like ammo is super </connor>
<connor> expensive yeah so they were just wasting </connor>
<connor> hundreds of thousands of dollars on </connor>
<joey> bullets especially when that war was </joey>
<joey> happening as well as probably even more </joey>
<connor> expensive and then one day someone was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> yeah it's not worth it is it no it's </connor>
<connor> wave the white flag and then they just </connor>
<connor> retreated and it was embarrassing </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<garnt> they just failed miserably </garnt>
<garnt> what is going on in australia i'm sure </garnt>
<garnt> everyone who's like watched internet </garnt>
<connor> videos has heard about this yeah like </connor>
<garnt> this is a very internet video topic that </garnt>
<garnt> sounds like an internet historian skit </garnt>
<connor> you know like yeah surprise he hasn't </connor>
<joey> made a video on it yet to be honest it's </joey>
<joey> great material </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean it's it sounds like on the </joey>
<garnt> same level as like you know the 4chan </garnt>
<garnt> tumblr wars or something like </garnt>
<connor> it just doesn't sound like it really has </connor>
<connor> just feels like the the laziest strategy </connor>
<connor> of killing them you know like there were </connor>
<joey> people who knew there were people who </joey>
<joey> died as well during the great evening </joey>
<connor> walk i feel like nobody thought this </connor>
<connor> plan through like surely there was a </connor>
<connor> better way of getting them you know what </connor>
<joey> i mean like that's what pisses me off </joey>
<joey> most it was the laziest solution they're </joey>
<joey> like firing squad and they were like </joey>
<joey> yeah okay like nobody thought is this </joey>
<connor> really the best idea you know yeah no </connor>
<joey> probably because someone probably took </joey>
<joey> one look at the [ __ ] shotgun they had </joey>
<joey> and they were like we got this </joey>
<garnt> easy double </garnt>
<garnt> we need a [ __ ] hollywood breakdown on </garnt>
<garnt> this you know where where's the </garnt>
<garnt> hollywood summer blockbuster of the </garnt>
<garnt> australian emu war come on come on come </garnt>
<garnt> on hollywood get it together there's a </garnt>
<garnt> story line there man versus </garnt>
<garnt> should have carpets zack snyder come on </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is the next black slider </garnt>
<joey> film </joey>
<joey> it's like a 300 spin off </joey>
<connor> that's like planet the apes from the </connor>
<joey> perspective of the emu so yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah one of them is voiced by uh </joey>
<garnt> raymond from everyone loves raymond get </garnt>
<garnt> back nicholas cage come on yeah nicholas </garnt>
<connor> cage is what is the is the main role </connor>
<joey> rate and the supporting role is ringing </joey>

<joey> freaking his mind yeah he's freaking out </joey>
<joey> i can't go on </joey>
<connor> but he has to </connor>
<connor> oh my god and ends with the climatic </connor>
<garnt> scene where they run what's the what's </garnt>
<garnt> the summer experience in australia </garnt>
<garnt> because like australia it's like winter </garnt>
<garnt> there christmas yeah christmas </garnt>
<garnt> like i always hear about like it's </garnt>
<garnt> summer it's like winter on australia but </garnt>
<garnt> like what is winter for australia is it </garnt>
<connor> actually cold or do you just do you like </connor>
<connor> swap them do you just refer to winter </connor>
<connor> like hot summer is winter </connor>
<connor> no like july it's july july is the </connor>
<joey> coldest time of year in australia but is </joey>
<connor> it winter it's july winter it depends </connor>
<connor> where you are so in sydney it doesn't </connor>
<joey> get cold enough to snow </joey>
<joey> but if you drive for like two hours into </joey>
<joey> canberra it snows like a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> i've been always under the impression of </connor>
<connor> the temperature that winter is the time </connor>
<joey> of year like winter is always november </joey>
<joey> to january </joey>
<joey> sorry november to february february yeah </joey>
<joey> i guess that is winter is it the same in </joey>
<connor> australia where you would refer to that </connor>
<connor> period of winter no that's summer </connor>
<connor> but everyone else around the hottest the </connor>
<joey> hottest time of the the hottest day of </joey>
<joey> any year is always uh new year's eve but </joey>
<connor> i always thought that it was like okay </connor>
<connor> no matter what country you're in this is </connor>
<connor> winter yeah that's what that's what i </connor>
<joey> thought it was winter it doesn't matter </joey>
<joey> the temperature what are you talking </joey>
<joey> about </joey>
<joey> because winter is the coldest time of </joey>
<joey> year for us that's </joey>
<connor> may to august yeah i know i just thought </connor>
<connor> that winter as a concept was a time </connor>
<joey> period not the season now it's </joey>
<joey> definitely a season for us um because </joey>
<joey> like at least from my memory the hottest </joey>
<joey> day of any year is always the last day </joey>
<joey> of the year right so i i used to our </joey>
<connor> family always used to go to that one </connor>
<connor> maids place who had that giant swimming </connor>
<connor> pool in his backyard because </connor>
<connor> you're in that pool till about two in </connor>
<connor> the morning because it's so [ __ ] hot </connor>
<connor> i remember the hottest experience i've </connor>
<connor> ever had in my life it was new year's </connor>
<connor> eve yeah it was 45 degrees </connor>
<connor> all right obviously 45 degrees </connor>
<connor> everyone's in the pool even after the </connor>
<connor> sun went down it was like 41 degrees </connor>
<connor> yeah and it was so hot that i remember i </connor>
<connor> went home like that morning it was like </connor>
<joey> 5 a.m and the fridge had just exploded </joey>
<joey> from the heat like the fridge just </joey>
<garnt> stopped working bro the fridge was like </garnt>
<connor> all right guys i'm out yeah have a nice </connor>
<joey> day just life </joey>
<connor> happy new year </connor>
<joey> my final message to the world yeah so i </joey>
<joey> remember my parents got super pissed off </joey>
<joey> because they just like </joey>
<joey> literally first day of the year they </joey>
<joey> went to the electronics store and bought </joey>
<joey> a new fridge because it just it just </joey>
<connor> got busted from the heat </connor>
<connor> fridge is one of those appliances though </connor>
<connor> that i'd be excited to get a new one i'd </connor>
<connor> be like wow we can really mix it up with </connor>
<joey> the fridge this time well yeah but like </joey>
<joey> you know i think it's good when you can </joey>
<joey> buy a fridge on your own accord right i </joey>
<connor> disagree i prefer when my appliances </connor>
<connor> break </connor>
<joey> because i'm like oh i have to spend </joey>
<connor> money oh there's no oh whoa i guess i </connor>
<connor> have to get the most expensive one geez </connor>
<connor> when you're upgrading you're like oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i've got a perfectly good one </connor>
<connor> i don't really need oh you start to </connor>
<garnt> starve with a cockroach fridge a washing </garnt>
<connor> machine or whatever or whatever it is </connor>
<connor> because it was a good appliance your </connor>
<connor> standard of an upgrade it's quite long </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> from </connor>
<connor> from cockroaches to no cockroaches </connor>
<connor> there's some appliances where i'm like </connor>
<connor> it does it literally doesn't need </connor>
<connor> anything fancy like a microwave does not </connor>
<connor> need to be fancy no microwave just heats </connor>
<connor> he heats thing up good thank you it </connor>
<garnt> literally vibrates more water molecules </garnt>
<connor> literally how would you do that </connor>
<joey> differently because i'm using joey's old </joey>
<joey> one yeah um because joey just gave me </joey>
<garnt> his one because he wanted to get an uh </garnt>
<joey> microwave oven microwave oven which i i </joey>
<garnt> don't believe in i think that's nonsense </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i got the kettle from joey because </garnt>
<garnt> cause </garnt>
<garnt> when did joey give you the microwave was </garnt>
<joey> it when you moved here why are you guys </joey>
<joey> like taking my hand me down it's not </joey>
<connor> because because you were like do you </connor>
<garnt> want a microwave and i was like sure </garnt>
<connor> because because i remember when because </connor>
<connor> this was literally in the first week </connor>
<connor> when we moved here and we were just like </connor>
<connor> settling in whatever and uh you were </connor>
<connor> just like oh do you want a kettle we </connor>
<connor> gotta you you can have a free kettle </connor>
<connor> yeah no no they were making it out to be </connor>
<connor> like a gift yeah yeah yeah back off this </connor>
<connor> is not a gift yeah i know this is </connor>
<connor> knowledgeable i remember thinking of the </connor>
<connor> time oh my god such good mate here is </connor>
<garnt> he's just he's just helping me like he </garnt>
<garnt> just helped me give me helping me like </garnt>
<joey> decorate the house </joey>
<joey> i was using those older sibling skills </joey>
<connor> yeah because i remember it was like he </connor>
<connor> was like do you want to just take the </connor>
<connor> microwave i was like why would i why </connor>
<connor> were you saying that why would i just </connor>
<connor> take the microwave and they're like oh </connor>
<connor> would you see like a gift and i'm like </connor>
<connor> some [ __ ] gear yeah </connor>
<connor> a new one yeah i'll take it but don't </connor>
<connor> don't preface that it's again because we </connor>
<joey> were gonna buy an oven </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah and then we realized oh </connor>
<connor> it's it's not just an oven it's a </connor>
<connor> microwave yeah i remember the accuracy </connor>
<connor> cause like now i'm not a gift because </connor>
<joey> now living in japan i know getting rid </joey>
<joey> of appliances is a [ __ ] nightmare </joey>
<joey> it's a [ __ ] nightmare so i'm just </joey>
<joey> like that [ __ ] just wanted to </joey>
<joey> get rid of his appliances that he wanted </joey>
<connor> to replace you and he framed it as a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] gift yeah so the person welcome </connor>
<connor> to japan </connor>
<connor> he's the kettle i don't know okay here </connor>
<garnt> you go i'm such a good mayor i'm giving </garnt>
<connor> you i'm literally giving you free fresh </connor>
<connor> you like kettles right yeah </connor>
<joey> i do i do </joey>
<joey> i actually don't use my kettle anymore i </joey>
<joey> use the the hot hot pot thing oh like </joey>
<joey> thermos pot whatever it's called </joey>
<joey> well you put like two liters of water in </joey>
<joey> a pot and it keeps it boiling the whole </joey>
<joey> thing oh yeah </joey>
<joey> it's more energy efficient </joey>
<connor> fancy but yeah in japan if you want to </connor>
<connor> get rid of your appliances this is </connor>
<connor> something that you should definitely be </connor>
<connor> aware of oh it's the worst um because if </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> over like a if it's a big appliance so </connor>
<joey> like i think a hair dryer or bigger is </joey>
<joey> considered as a big appliance right </joey>
<joey> you have to call it </joey>
<joey> so literally any applause you have to </joey>
<joey> call up the </joey>
<garnt> local government in your area and tell </garnt>
<joey> them you want to get rid of it and then </joey>
<joey> you've scheduled it right i i actually </joey>
<joey> just finished doing that the other day </joey>
<joey> because we had to get rid of our old </joey>
<joey> dining table and our old like cabinet </joey>
<connor> that had all of our dishes in it because </connor>
<connor> yeah wait why didn't your old moving </connor>
<connor> company do it oh yeah the movie company </connor>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> uh we just kind of forgot it oh yeah we </joey>
<connor> just kind of because i thought i </connor>
<connor> originally wanted to i originally had </connor>
<connor> the old kitchen table that we have yeah </connor>
<connor> on my balcony because i thought oh i </connor>
<connor> could use this if i'm like barbecuing or </connor>
<connor> doing something outside and i need </connor>
<connor> something to like place it on yeah but </connor>
<connor> then i kind of didn't use it it got hit </connor>
<connor> in the rain i forgot to put like a </connor>
<joey> lacquer on it so i just started rotting </joey>
<joey> and i was like all right </joey>
<joey> i need to get rid of this now and it was </joey>
<connor> oh my god dining tables do that if you </connor>
<joey> put them outside yeah yeah so uh but </joey>
<joey> it's it's cool though because in my area </joey>
<joey> that you can like register it through </joey>
<joey> like line oh that's cool but </joey>
<connor> the sucky thing is had to wait about i </connor>
<connor> don't know four weeks to throw it out </connor>
<connor> because they were like oh you have to </connor>
<connor> schedule it ahead of time and i'm like </connor>
<connor> oh okay maybe it's like always the third </connor>
<connor> thing it's like you know next week or </connor>
<connor> like this weekend or something you know </connor>
<joey> whatever it's like so uh yeah uh the </joey>
<connor> next open slot is uh 40 days from now </connor>
<connor> and you have to give them the precise </connor>
<joey> measurements of the thing yeah as well </joey>
<joey> which is i mean it's obviously i </joey>
<connor> understand why but it's one of the </connor>
<connor> things where it's like this is a hassle </connor>
<connor> that i've never had to do in the uk </connor>
<joey> before yeah so why am i measuring </joey>
<joey> something that i'm about to throw out it </joey>
<connor> yeah i made sure the moving company that </connor>
<connor> i've hired at the moment for my place </connor>
<connor> i'm like you thought of things away </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> you throw them away you think about the </joey>
<joey> like things like fridges or like washing </joey>
<joey> machines and stuff like that is that </joey>
<connor> like there's usually a service where </connor>
<connor> when they bring the new one they take </connor>
<connor> away the old yeah that's true that's </connor>
<garnt> true like we just got a new washing </garnt>
<garnt> machine and they take away the oil and </garnt>
<garnt> they take away the oils like oh thank </garnt>
<garnt> god yeah yeah that's why you know </garnt>
<garnt> whoever sold you the [ __ ] cockroach </garnt>
<connor> they were just like man they [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> they were like 500 iq we got him to pay </connor>
<connor> for this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> we got him to pay for this i got scammed </connor>
<connor> that was a scam there you go </connor>
<connor> first time in japan </connor>
<connor> i got a gift </connor>
<connor> welcome to japan what a warm greeting to </connor>
<connor> a foreign country </connor>
<connor> but yeah no i made sure the movie </connor>
<connor> company was like you you've thrown </connor>
<connor> things away right yeah yeah i was like </connor>
<connor> great </connor>
<connor> everything needs to go every get rid of </connor>
<joey> everything i'm literally throwing away </joey>
<joey> like nearly everything i own </joey>
<joey> because i'm like it's all it's time for </joey>
<joey> an upgrade because i'm like yeah because </joey>
<connor> my bed was like 200 bucks for like the </connor>
<connor> bed and the mattress it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> terrible yeah it's like uh i'm sure like </connor>
<joey> you know prisoners in isolation get </joey>
<joey> better beds than what i've got so i was </joey>
<joey> like you know i'm get rid of it </joey>
<joey> yeah they get a whole padded room but </joey>
<joey> it's an absolute it's absolute nightmare </joey>
<connor> right because yeah i do yeah yeah people </connor>
<garnt> get the whole soundproofing yeah yeah so </garnt>
<connor> uh because if you want to do like myself </connor>
<connor> i have to disassemble the bed </connor>
<connor> and then like put it down yeah into the </connor>
<connor> thing schedule when they're gonna come </connor>
<connor> get it and then kind of like </connor>
<connor> schedule getting a new bed myself in </connor>
<connor> between the day i'm throwing it out it's </connor>
<joey> a real nightmare yeah yeah that was that </joey>
<joey> was a nightmare for us and that's why </joey>
<connor> like when we moved into our new place </connor>
<connor> because we threw the bed our old bed </connor>
<connor> away yeah yeah when we were waiting for </connor>
<connor> the new bed we had to sleep on like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] blow up mattress for like a week </connor>
<connor> oh wow just because the timing was off </connor>
<connor> yeah but like yeah cause i'm thinking </connor>
<connor> like get rid of my desk in my place oh </connor>
<garnt> because you're thinking about getting in </garnt>
<garnt> there </garnt>
<garnt> well i'm just dreading having to like </garnt>
<connor> schedule a [ __ ] i have to wait another </connor>
<connor> month to like throw this thing out and </connor>
<joey> then i have to take it down myself and </joey>
<connor> disassemble it i'm just like oh </connor>
<connor> yeah it's pain in the ass yeah it sucks </connor>
<connor> please please make it better you can get </connor>
<joey> a service right that's why i'm thinking </joey>
<joey> i'm just gonna like i'm just going to </joey>
<joey> pay the money just get someone to just </joey>
<garnt> come and get rid of them because it </garnt>
<garnt> takes some if you want to get rid of </garnt>
<connor> your appliances it's probably going to </connor>
<garnt> take like all day just to sort out </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean if you can make you know </connor>
<connor> it's probably what an hour to </connor>
<connor> disassemble then you've got to [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> around with the calling the people yeah </connor>
<connor> taking it down figuring out when you've </connor>
<connor> got to do all that stuff like it's </connor>
<joey> probably what three hours of work yeah </joey>
<joey> you could probably make more than the </joey>
<joey> money it would cost to do that yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> so it's like definitely i would rather </joey>
<connor> because i also don't it's sometimes not </connor>
<connor> even the money it's like i don't want to </connor>
<connor> deal with this stress like this is a </connor>
<connor> stressful thing that i don't like </connor>
<connor> dealing with yeah and so i will pay a </connor>
<joey> premium to not have to do that not only </joey>
<connor> that but like i have to deal with it in </connor>
<connor> this weather yeah as well it's like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that disassembling that dining table in </connor>
<connor> this heat was hell i like fixing my </connor>
<connor> electronics and like opening them up and </connor>
<connor> doing that stuff because i enjoy that </connor>
<connor> but i don't enjoy disassembling </connor>
<connor> furniture and desks i don't think anyone </connor>
<joey> does yeah i like assembling furniture i </joey>
<connor> don't like disassembling things some </connor>
<connor> people are like like so good with that </connor>
<connor> stuff and they they enjoy it they're </connor>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> but like disassembly furniture is like </garnt>
<garnt> the most depressing thing in the world </garnt>
<connor> because like at least if you're </connor>
<connor> assembling furniture you have something </connor>
<connor> to look forward to yeah yeah you have </connor>
<connor> the final product what are you looking </connor>
<garnt> forward to after disassembling the </garnt>
<connor> furniture nothing </connor>
<connor> but that's why in the uk i used to just </connor>
<connor> put it on like websites and i'd be like </connor>
<connor> who wants it for free i'm just just </connor>
<joey> coming oh yeah yeah we we use the </joey>
<connor> service for that when we move to get rid </connor>
<connor> of our couch yeah i'm like who wants it </connor>
<connor> we're just like we just there's a </connor>
<connor> website where you can just like just put </connor>
