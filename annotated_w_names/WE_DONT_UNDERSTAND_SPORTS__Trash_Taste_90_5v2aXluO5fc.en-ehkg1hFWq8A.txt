<SPEAKER_03> - Hey guys, do you like charity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gamers, we have a big announcement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We are going to be doing
a 24 hour charity stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You heard that, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the world situation
kind of messed up right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for all sorts of different reasons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we thought we would come together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stream for 24 hours to support
Doctors without borders </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on our channel twitch channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch.tv/trashtastepodcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are we gonna be doing
on that stream though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is the question, you're probably asking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We have a bunch of
different things planned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> including guests, games and humiliation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and Joey will eat a ghost
pepper, maybe who knows. If we- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So make sure to open up that wallet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to make sure that Joey can suffer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the reason we're
doing this. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not here for the charity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm here to make Joey suffer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the event will be starting 11:00 am, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan time on the 19th of March. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you live anywhere else in the world, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> here are some just basic time zones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that hopefully mood on is
putting on screen right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If not look it up yourself
on time converter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, it'll be going on 24 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and we'll hopefully change
the world for the better, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even for a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And on with the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait, you're not gonna,
you're gonna solve it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna solve it, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because I fucking got
my yellow down here somehow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can't start recordings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until Joey solves his rubics cube that's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fine's.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I've got
like, I need a chip, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like, it'll just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (video fast-forwarding)
(light upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I completely forgot about
that we talked about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right there we go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (upbeat light music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Welcome poop enthusiast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to another episode of Trash Taste Podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm poop enthusiast one
with poop enthusiast- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not a poop enthusiast.
I'm a bidet enthusiast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a difference. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You literally just said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> God, I need to shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I don't. I need to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope that's the first,
second of this episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - The same way you need to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not getting into this guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even wanna humor this clown. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What you've been up to Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pooping, pooping,
doing a lot of pooping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not playing Final
Fantasy XIV like an idiot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For fuck sake Joey, for fuck sake Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I called you out right from the Get Go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I remember, so we record the episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where Joey's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt don't play Final Fantasy XIV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I think it was
like four weeks ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah and I'm like, okay Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're a good mate, I will trust you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then what happens? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get a condition in which
I need to stay in the house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every day for about two weeks straight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I have nothing to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm not well enough to work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So what I do first, I complete
13 Sentinels, which is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you finished it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] I finished it. And then it was- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it good?
- It was as fucking insane, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as you said it was.
- Good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then I sit there,
twiddling my thumbs, going, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what now, what do I do now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I look at the
date and I look at Twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and Final Fantasy XIV, comes
back on sale to the public. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, either
this is a sign from God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or the devil, either one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's definitely the devil. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Either one it's a sign. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only way to get you guys
to do anything is be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't do this, don't, don't,
don't, don't watch this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't play this game. You won't like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, was that the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was being too negative,
I had to do the opposite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't watcha this week.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just saying that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it, that's it.
That's all I've to say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's so funny, I didn't either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] That's crazy.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shit couldn't be me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah, I mean talking
about addiction Joey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you recently going
to new Gotcha game as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> We mentioned it very
briefly in the last episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like the week where we just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what am I gonna start
heroine this week as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Addicts anonymous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything just goes wrong this week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you've recently
just been addicted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to torturing yourself.
- I'm not addicted to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna be done with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm tryna finish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're definitely addicted to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like hurting myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're like a fucking mas- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, you don't like hurting yourself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you say after like your
10th Jump King stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] It's like, you
know what I'll do it again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then getting over it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the Pogo stick or-
- [Joey] I call it Pogo Stuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pogo Stuck, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, first of all, I wanna clarify. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't enjoy hurting myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, I enjoy challenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes challenges. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that not just
mentally hurting yourself? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Challenges require us to
go through some uncomfortable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> feelings and challenges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get that, you know but I think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I get that sentiment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think what makes
a challenge, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> satisfying is when you
do it every now and then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, not every stream. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well you know what, I
had this like revelation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> While I was sitting there
and I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nobody bets an nine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if you spend 1000 hours playing a FPS, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the moment you put 10 hours
into a shitty jumping game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's like, you've got a problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, what's up with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I still think putting a thousand hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> into an FBS is a problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not a problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't know, you're not a gamer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> A thousand hours into an FPSs is not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well over how long? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, like a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A month! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, no that is a problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is a problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold on, is there even a
thousand hours in a month? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It would be just under I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because that would be a slight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that would be a different
problem entirely if there wasn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, there is not. No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> No, there is. What am I saying? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many hours in a month? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Staff] 720 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So this man is like in
the hyperbolic time chain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can watch YouTube
at 1.5 times speed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I FPS in 1.5 times.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like FPS, I can get it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause at least there's a bit more variety </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than literally pressing a button </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and pointing in a direction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and doing that for 10 hours straight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never had like my
wrists hurt before from gaming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but doing the space bar games,
that hurts my wrist actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno why that hurts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That is carpal tunnel speed run. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cause it's like the same action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> over and over and over, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. But it's good
content though, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Not right now, it's terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's good content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's terrible right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like dementia stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just going around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and doing the same thing
over and over again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not making any progress. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And but when I do beat it... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I'm saying
it's good content to watch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well it's a great YouTube highlight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause then it's done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you're in the middle of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like, I don't
know if I can do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna have a mental breakdown. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't know if like this can be done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Mark did like seven YouTube
parts and just gave up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like soul crushing, that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like it's good
content in the same way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that, you know Mr. Beast saying
PewDiePie a million times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whatever is good content, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know, it's not
exactly what I'd call fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's it's definitely suffering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not a J I can,
you know, bring back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you know, I'd be
all the Jump King DLC, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty gonna do the
other one at some point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I might have done it by the
time this comes out who knows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I finished playing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, oh my God, thank God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the challenge is over, I can finally rest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I played Pokemon Arceus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, it was kind of difficult, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but at no point did I ever
think, I can't do this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this is too much.
- [Joey] Well yeah of course, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a Pokemon game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I missed that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I missed that moment where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if I can do this,
like this is so difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why you are a gamer and I'm not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the moment I see a
part of a game where I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't do this, I'm like, guess I'll die. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just don't do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I know someone
else has done something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, well I can do it then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you play Sifu then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's that?
- [Staff] Oh Sifu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah Sifu, it's like a
new game that just came out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is kind of like based on, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> old school martial arts films. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I've heard, it's like pretty damn hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's pretty challenging. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like got, I mean I
haven't played it yet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've seen other
streamers and other people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about it and I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to use like
the Dark Soul analogy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because everyone uses the
fucking Dark Soul analogy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you know, difficulty
didn't exist before Dark Souls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I have heard that
it is a challenging game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get through that has... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What I don't understand is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I think like Dark Souls like nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to these rage games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but what I don't understand is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, you say you wanna
go for a challenge, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't wanna learn how to speed run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So speed run is a different
thing for me entirely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think so. I think- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I think it's exactly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think speed running
is closer to the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're doing with Jump King and Pogo Stuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than it is to do with like challenging, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, like just
mechanically challenging games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, here's this is where
I think speed running for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is like something that,
I mean, I've enjoyed it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've done it in the past, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> speed run like Cuphead back when they had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an exploit in the game that they removed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it's like not really fun to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it takes a lot longer now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So I used to enjoy doing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I found that the point was is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, let's say you get to a certain point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get to a really good time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you start shaving off
like microseconds, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're a streamer and you
know, you wanna stream content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it becomes really difficult to keep saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, this is content over and over again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm not a speed runner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm tryna make content, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so if I'm tryna make
like a YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm tryna make highlights, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't be like Jump King
speed run highlights part 17. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, it just doesn't work like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also with like saying my
Pogo Stuck or Jump King, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> When, if I'm not speed running, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I tried speed running Jump King, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got pretty good time, but in 12 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I can do better, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but again, I'd have to grind it a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's not that entertaining. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But having a hard goal that is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have done it, at this point
you're done, you can stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's way more satisfying,
I think as a viewer to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also as a content creator, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a lot better for like
a narrative in a video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to have like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's pretty
simple to turn speed running </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> into content. You just-
- Well, you can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just set yourself a hard target, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a hard and you get on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like when I say you should
be doing speed running content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't mean like you should be going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a fucking world record or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, you know, like maybe
setting your goal to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, if the world record </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like 10 minutes in this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Then, you know, my goal is
to get a PB of 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well then that sense then yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You could do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like Ladvick did it with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the games that, he did like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Can you beat all Jump King in an hour? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For all three maps, you know
that that's interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That's way more appealing to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than Trish tryna grinding
at the best time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Very impressive with the
people who can do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just not consistent enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's fucking
hard. This like these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've been pretty consistent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with all these like hard ass games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. I mean, you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you're like one step away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You seem to have found a niche of just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, I will just do
this one repetitive thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is this one mechanic in the game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and do it for 10 hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds exactly like
what a speed runner will do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you know, it's
one of those things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I keep saying that when I wanna buy time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like one of those things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One of those things, one more thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You basically can- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You need perseverance
to like an extreme level </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> for a lot of these games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I feel that most people
will just think this is stupid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, I can see
like the micro improvements. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that like tiny,
tiny improvements every time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like this is
pure opium right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's not.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay, okay.
- It's not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get better.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like I get that for like say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a mechanically intensive game, like Sifu, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like Dark Souls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You would not be feeling this satisfied </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you weren't streaming this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I would never do it alone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it isn't as satisfied. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you are finding like the micro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the micro thing that you find fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about this game to try and
cope with how much of a like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much of a shit time you're having. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much of a shit time
you're having while doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at least people
are watching you do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I'm not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The chat is the silver
lining in this whole thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So like Jump King initially
I thought that it was dumb, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was unfair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - After playing it, I
think it's like amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like it's like, I'm not kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's an amazing game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you have said that
though if you hadn't beaten it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, absolutely not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand if you play it
and you think it's unfair, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you play those games
more and especially like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, Pogo Stuck is no,
it's awful, awful game, not- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You said that for
Jump King like literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> two, three weeks ago, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I said Jump King was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is gonna be Polish
things when he beats Pogo Stuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like best game ever made amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jump King has the bang of visuals, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely amazing sound. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I do like the aesthetics of Jump King. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a it's a package, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, I will hold my- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I will reserve my opinions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because by the time
this episode comes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me and Joey will probably
have already done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our Jump King race. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You try and beat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You gonna go for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, if we can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Sure, but I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean probably not on
that race, but personally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I start something,
I'm going to finish it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. I like if like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think this race is gonna be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason why I came
up with the race ideas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because, you know, I like myself enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to not torture myself on
stream for entertainment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So he dragged me. He dragged me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He dragged me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, I need someone
else to feel the pain with me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was literally on camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You could, rewind by that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, Jump King sounds fun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt, do you wanna do Jump King? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You wanna do too? You haven't played, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, what a coincidence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Me neither. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think like, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we've probably already done it by the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this episodes coming out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like as of right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's like we're
giving ourselves like maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> four hours just because Garnt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I are incapable of streaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for more than four hours in any game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think 10 to 15 hours is a good range </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of how long it might take you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right. So that race,
we probably won't beat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think afterwards,
once we get the idea, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> then we'll probably
like individually do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and then try and beat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's weird, 'cause like games like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they like trick you into thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that the only progress that matters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is how far you've gotten. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it's like in games like
jump king and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're gonna have to restart so many times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's not about how far you can get, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's how many times can you do
all of the jumps to the point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you felt perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, can you do that more consistent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It kinda sounds like speed running. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kind of. Yeah, yeah.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But at least with Jump
King, you get a mental break, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, you can stop for a moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you can kind of like, okay, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Poker Stuck doesn't stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The Pogo doesn't stop
moving. It's just awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like speed running. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean the more I think about
it, the more I'm just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The more I think about Pogo
Stuck is just a speed running. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it's a speed running simulator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Try it, try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one of those games
that looks a lot easier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than it is for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I've done like
Bener 40's getting over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's easy, that's nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like coop and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, even then I was just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought Getting Over It was hard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> after playing these games,
Getting Over It is like medium, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not even like hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean I beat Getting
Over It in three hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> My first time, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like you started
with Jump King and then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I guess you downgraded
to Getting Over It. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get the mindset. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not about how good
you are at the games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But getting the mindset
to improve at the games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I could. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just go into like Zen
mode, zero ranging from me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't beat a game like
that while fucking being like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did most of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was furious. It's so hyper man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If you ever get to the top, the castles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the soundtracks are like very hype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can imagine it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like I see you guys
have been playing Pokemon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean you've been playing in a bunch of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You finished it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's finished like the main story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You finish it on stream
or finish it by yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't get RCS,
that's all I have to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So there's like
a lot of post post game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I've heard like
mixed things about RCS, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is stop me from
getting it right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, I've heard
like it's a really fun game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's just a really empty world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's the best Pokemon game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've had in like five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fucking know a very long time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A very long time. I agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like saying like,
this is the best Big Mac </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever had. It's
like, it's not that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's way better than
the Big Mac down the road. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This isn't like saying
that like our queen of time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> came before in like the Zelda, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is, that we haven't
had a fresh Pokemon game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in a long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I know this is old news by
the time this has come out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think it's still good to retro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I'm still playing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm playing all the
post game and I'm doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> all the side quest and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm just that kind of gamer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a hard Pokemon game.
- It gets very hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some of the battles are hard as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's kind of annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it feels like they revolutionized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what they needed to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And somehow just completely like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did stupid choices for certain things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just like make
battles for like the first, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like two thirds of the game, just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way too easy.
- [Joey] Way too easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right and then randomly they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how about we just fuck you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And they just start making
them really fucking hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the thing that I notice is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not just the fact that
there's just this immediate jump </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the levels of the Pokemon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But like I feel out of
all the Pokemon games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the AI in this game is so fucking gearing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh yeah. It's smart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're very, very smart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like they do some
moves where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like competitive level Pokemon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just getting,
'cause like I'm so used to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, fighting like
really dumb end PCs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in Pokemon games, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like in all the main light Pokemon games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this time around, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're playing 5D chess now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it just gets fucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I felt like in
previous Pokemon games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just knowing the typings
of the Pokemon was enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like easily comfortably get you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas the points in
this game, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I know all the typings, I
just can't beat this one guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there's this one fight in the game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's very difficult. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it took me like 10 attempts to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Very frustrating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you can't just
like autopilot your way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through the game anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You do have to, after a
certain point in the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you wanna beat a certain
fight, you do have to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think and grind and actually I doubt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll do it first time,
it's very difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I managed to do it first time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but only because my chat was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a hard as fuck fight coming up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So you better at least like prepare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, guys come
on, fucking easy whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I do it, I almost fucking died, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I should probably go grind a little. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, look I completely get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why people don't wanna touch the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because when I first booted up the game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, God this
looks like a PS two game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It doesn't look
great and it doesn't run great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Graphically, it doesn't look great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It runs like shit a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you're like playing
it through a capture card, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's a little bit better, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I play it a little bit on
stream, like on the switch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and it plays okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's still not amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's still nowhere
near as like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking Mario Odyssey
levels of like frame rate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think you get over it very quickly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the gameplay just
so refreshing and fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and like, yeah, I get the world is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> empty or whatever, but- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - People said it was
empty, but there's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean the Pokemon are
the thing that you give. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, I hated having to collect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> these fucking berries in
the trees all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I kept running outta poker balls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, you know, you
could like go on a mount, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you couldn't collect stuff on a mount, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so you had to get off
it to collect the stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then immediately get back on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can collect stuff on a mount. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No you can't. Oh no, no you can't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> No you can't.
- You can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No you have to get off the mount. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, oh, like throwing it outta tree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, I thought you meant just
like stuff on the ground. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, stuff on the ground. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. Okay sorry my bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, what, what.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But like the best part of the
game is just catching Pokemon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They actually like recaptured
that joy of being tan again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The moment when you
can just like be hiding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in a little shrub and you
just fucking yeet a poker ball </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just across the field and
you catch that Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without anyone noticing you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like the best feeling every time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also like, you can,
like, let's say your level 30, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you can catch a level 70
Pokemon with enough persistence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you just get very, very lucky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, really like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my God, this is so exciting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a hype moment when
you like catch level 70 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at level 30.
- But you can't control it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, it's still like really cool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so you can have these
really strong Pokemon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt like they had a
good range of Pokemon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They didn't just choose
the normal ones you expect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I think
people were a bit too harsh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on it I think.
- I agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I think people
were a little bit too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, because I mean, I get
the whole argument of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, it's Nintendo it's game freak. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, they should have
a billion gazillion dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to put into, you know,
making a smooth game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and giving it the best graphics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I personally think that
like the graphical choice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess, that they went
for like fit the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't really care
about graphics that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Me neither, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno either, but they
were noticeably lacking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It wasn't that they weren't
good, it's that they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There were definitely
some moments where I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, that tree in the distance
is freaking out for no reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's just ignore that. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought those good
quality of life changes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, it's Pokemon, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So when they take one step forward </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they just tear their leg off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like they, the moment
they have something good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they start just fucking it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I bet, I hope that we
get more games like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they basically made it so that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't need to battle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But also the battling is way smoother, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's not this animation bullshit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like that it happens,
you know, you can run around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can, it's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I know it's Pokemon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they're gonna be like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now let's just get rid of that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's not do that anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, why what's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I really hope that I'm wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Enough fans need to
make it fucking operol </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for them to like bring
back a certain thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like Pokemon fans are loud as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like it's just Pokemon
company doing their own thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's usually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it it's just the
Pokemon company being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we can make whatever fuck we want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We know you'll buy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I mean they will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean Pokemon's like the most profitable, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like franchise of all time
for like a reason, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a fun game though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say, I think I'd said it
was six or seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Six or seven. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd give it like, yeah,
seven or eight. I'd say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a really refreshing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Considering I bought the
pearl and diamond remake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I have barely had the motivation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to even put it in my switch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that says a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know it's weird for me right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because as someone who
doesn't really have to time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to play games, I like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if something's not like a nine or a 10, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I very rarely go out and play it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless I'm streaming it or making content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But how would you know
if it's a nine or a 10, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't play it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Normally I just watch reviews </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and listen to recommendations. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if you've
heard of a thing called IGN. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hopefully I'm gonna think
order medic critic obviously, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously the most trustable source. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So basically the only
game Garnt has ever played </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is Awkward Enough Time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is a light novel though, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So that might get you into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And you never shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] There's a lot of dialogue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's really weird, 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it takes me a lot to get
into a game sometimes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, I've tried to
really like narrowed down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what my taste in video games is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the more I think about
it, the more I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have no idea. 'Cause like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like we've Final
Fantasy XIV for example. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, so I was playing that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a little here and there
during when I was ill, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember literally
yesterday, literally yesterday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were in the lift and I turned to Terry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, Joey, gotta be honest with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start Final Fantasy XIV, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But you don't need to worry Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like it's not addicting at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I'm like, I played
it, I've stopped myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm good. I'm good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I shook his hand and everything to him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he shook my hand
and then I went home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, I don't
really have anything to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I'll just like, 'cause the thing is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a nice comfort
game for me to like zone out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just, you know, tap buttons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then so I boot it up and
then I get into like my first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like big boss battle, like big raid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I remember finishing the raid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, oh no, that was really fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was really fucking fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need you to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna take back that
handshake I gave you that night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I thought we had
like established something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, there was a
trust that was formed there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he just ripped it away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I really, really wanna
continue playing now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look at the clock,
I'm like, it's midnight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we gotta Trash Taste
recording in the morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I'd go for another two hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And again another hour or two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can squeeze, how much sleep do I need? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, 'cause here's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never really gone to MMOs, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I never went through a
phase where I got addicted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to RuneScape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was gonna say Runecraft, then RuneScape </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or WoW whatever like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this is like my first proper MMO. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, I wasn't really into it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I thought like I didn't
really enjoy the gameplay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like the battle
system for Final Fantasy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially at the beginning
was like really fucking basic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like just point at
something and tap a button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and do like a basic three
hit combo and then that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, you know,
I'm here for the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna stick here for the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I experienced the
first raid, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, that was pretty damn fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm scared for
myself now. I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's been a while since
I've had the experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just having a moment in a
game and just having like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I guess like it felt
like an ember had been lit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like, I wanna experience that again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I'm saying man,
like MMOs are a lot like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like quick sand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where it's like, the more you try to quit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the more you just get sucked in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm glad I got it out of
me when I was like 14, 15. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really have an
urge to play MMOs at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Me neither. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean like what did
you guys find addicting about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> MMOs when you got into it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the number one
thing that got me addicted, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I'm glad you haven't
experienced yet personally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is when you have like a
large group of friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you see often who also play it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where like, it's just like
I have like a group of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three or four mates, like
during the RuneScape era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like the Maple Story
era that I could just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ring up on Skype and
just be like, all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> SO, Sesh for like seven hours
and like, yeah, let's do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you just play it
while you're in a conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's the best way to kill time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like you finish
that seven hour session </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, what have I just done? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think it's a
game where like the goals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or for me at least felt like they were, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's never ending supply of goals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whereas like a game, like,
I don't know if I do this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the campaign in a card or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's say I'm done in then hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But RuneScape, it's
just like never ending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And every time I hit a milestone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I got more cool quests I could do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I thought, wow, that's so sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, I got this really badass item. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so like, every time you
are grinding towards something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You always just kind of
unlock these cool things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that were just enough serotonin boost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to keep you being like invested a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then even when you finish through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like all those side quests, for example. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You see one player that
just walks past your plan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you go, I want what he has.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do I get that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then now your quest is to be that guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It just never ends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then also like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if you can
do this in Final Fantasy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but in RuneScape you could
lose like all your stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you could just lose all your game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - By dying.
- Yeah by getting killed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - By dying, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've died fucked of on it and
lost nothing. So thanks a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, there you go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like Pussy MMO.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hold in your hand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I wouldn't
be able to get into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like RuneScape or WoW then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like one of the
big factors I feel look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into video games is like, I
need a reason to keep playing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And most of that reason is storyline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like gameplay loop a lot of the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not enough of a
reason to keep me invested in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me invested in the game
for like long term. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Having said that your
thing about the Maze thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when I was doing this boss battle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I wonder how fun this would
be with friends to do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the same time.(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're gonna be that guy who're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt can't join us today cause
he has a raid or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing)
- Yeah. He has an event raid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's only available during these hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah. I mean, this
is I guess the start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of I don't know what, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just, maybe I might
stream it who knows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know how before
you were saying that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> viewers of Trash Taste could tell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we record these
episodes based on my hair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Then now they're gonna be able to tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> based on the size of his eye bags </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are gonna be falling
from endless nights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Final Fantasy XIV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, oh man they're
like this far down now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he is like, you finish three raids Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I also stay away from them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause my little brother was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> addicted to World of Warcraft. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I could like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just see how much he would play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it onto like no avail.
- [Joey] Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - At the end of it, he was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, it wasn't that fun.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> After like years of playing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well of course it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every fucking league player </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like Overwatch player that
invests way too much time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into this one game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And of course what'd you
have to show for it well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I reach diamond, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Usually what you have to show for it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can be summed up in one sentence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, yeah, it was, fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is it that playing like
a hundred games for 10 hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like seen as okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But playing one game for a
thousand hours is like no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Double standards right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What society.
- We live in a society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fucked up, we live
in a society that ain't right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just feel like there are
just so many games nowadays </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that are available even if
like you have nothing to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you feel like
you have nothing to play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or no big releases have come out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just go through your
fucking steam library, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My steam library is like, my- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - God, I have not
touched my steam library. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I think to myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, I'm like, okay, so
I just finished this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Go when I finished 13 sentls, for example. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, all right,
cool. I finished that game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck now what do I wanna play? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Normally people be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, I have a, fuck like
300 games of my steam </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I haven't even like installed at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nope, instead I go to
the PlayStation store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I download Sona three knock turn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, yeah let's
play this. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And now I'm just playing that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, I would rather have
one game that I'm really into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> than a hundred games
that I mildly enjoyed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, like to me, like
Pokemon RCS for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seems like kind of fun, but
it doesn't seem like a game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I could like properly,
like throw myself into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, it's weird for
me cause I'd rather be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fully invested in just
like emotionally invested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in one like a few things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why Final Fantasy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why did that get you emotionally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I heard from every person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who fucking talks about Final Fantasy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has a good story and I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] To be fair as much as I- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I heard about like NFTs are great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you just listen NFT reviews. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's, you know, if you're asking addicts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> why something's great,
it's probably not a good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like did you talk to people who played it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and didn't like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That there's the catch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone who's played it
has said it's a good game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, for example like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I played the Trial,
when it first came out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll admit it's a great fucking game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But I like used a hundred
percent of my brain power </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, you know what, I
know it's a fun game brain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you are not going to play it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like if you are
only talking to people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are into it, oh they
seem to all like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, 'cause they're into it.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's the thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone at least around me that I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has, or is playing
14 has said nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but good things about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I feel like there
are some people who are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe, you know, people who are- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for example, addicted to
League or addicted to Overwatch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they're like, no
just don't get into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't have fun with this game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but that's cause
you're in you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> every game has its life graph, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Final fantasy is just
in it's like its infancy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to League. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We have like 15 years or
no, 10 plus years of League </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of don't do it, don't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We know time has proven
us, history has taught us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well 14 at this rate might
also gets to that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look I dunno if this
will be a purely age thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm in for the story
and once I do the story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I won't really have any other
reason to continue playing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're always coming
out with another expansion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - (chuckling) Well, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that micro transactions in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't seen any. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it micro transactions or expansion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Staff] (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a Japanese game of course there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> migration transaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well like you, from what I understand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you pay for like any new expansion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is basically like
another part of the storyline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, WoW was the same as well right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You had to pay for expansions? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - WoW's a subscription service, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was a monthly plus
you had to pay for expansions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Staff] And now you
have to pay for coins </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like.
- Yeah. I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't know too
much about the MMO world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I play Gotcha, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I can choose to put money in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a requirement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the cancer cell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fighting the aids cell at this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know it's better
than MMOs, Gotcha games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone's into that
Lostark aren't they? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Everyone's into Lostark. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what it is.
I'm too scared to ask this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen a lot of my
friends play it on stream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, okay, that looks fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But right now I'm into Heaven Burns Red. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm just playing that.
I mean for the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This episode is
sponsored by Express VPN. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you use bathroom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you always close the
door behind you right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Of course.
- Right Connor right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't, I don't.
- Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So why would you let
people look in on you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you go online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Using the internet without Express VPN, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like going to the bathroom
and not closing the door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Did you know that
your internet service provider </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knows every single website you visit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And what's worse is that
they can sell this information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to ad companies and tech
giants who will use your data </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to target you.
(Joey exclaiming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Express VPN puts a stop to this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It creates a secure encrypted
channel between your device </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the internet so that
your online activity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't be seen by anyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I use Express VPN on all my devices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it works on everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> phones, laptops, even routers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So everyone who shares your
wifi can still be protected, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if they don't have
Express VPN themselves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the best part is using Express VPN </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is as easy as closing the bathroom door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You just fire up the app, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> click one button and
boom you're protected. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So if you're like me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you believe your online
activity is your business </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> secure yourself today, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by going to expressvpn.com/trashtaste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> use my exclusive link E X P
R E S S vpn.com/trashtaste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you can get an extra
three months for free. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's Expressvpnn.com/trashtaste
back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what non-toxic
game I introduced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these gamers to today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wordle. (laughing)
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I finally, oh my God, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like a weight
lifted off my shoulders </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because for months now,
every time I go onto Twitter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like five people on my
timeline are just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> tweeting out these like fucking squares. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like these yellow and green squares. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, is this like
higher glitch or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, is this like
an invitation to a cult </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do I have to decipher this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I joined like
the fucking, (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the stone smiths or whatever
the fuck it's called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Stone Mason.
- Stone Mason that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was almost more confused </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once Garnt had actually
explained it to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was like, why are
people tweeting this out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It didn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Admittedly it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like a good, like little time waster </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's only one word a day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's like the marketing strap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno if feels like on purpose, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was like fucking five head right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because everyone gets
the same word every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you only get one word a day right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And when you tweet it out, it's
kind of like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like tweeting out
like a gold star or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like an achievement
in a video game right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, what is the
equivalent of being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so yesterday I beat
level 127 of Candy Crush </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like two minutes, get on my level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't tweet it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just do it just to
prove to all the tweets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that I see that I can do it every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I sat there and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but why would anyone tweet this out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I guessed a five
letter word correctly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just couldn't understand
it. I am I missing something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is it-
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about it is an achievement? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not attacking anyone
who has tweeted out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can do whatever fuck
you want on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There's some people who
were like, they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, pretty like big accounts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, why the you
tweeting about Wordle? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I had like two or
three people I followed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I think were like actively </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at one point were like, what
the fuck is this Wordle shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like a week later they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got in two tries baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is this Final Fantasy XIV all over again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because like, the
thing I don't understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how this trend started is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what made people want to
tweet at the first place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who sits and it's like,
y'all gotta (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, when you're
like have an app open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get like that
notification, which is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would you like to review this app? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then post on your timeline. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Share your results. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, share your results. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's ever shared the
results before Wordle existed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and what was the black magic
that Wordle put on their users </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make people want to share the results. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like when I get like a
high school on temple run, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not sharing that, 'cause
it's a fucking mobile game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Share it to your
Facebook friends is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no I don't think I will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone, who's like, yo Facebook sucks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah, no Twitter is
slowly becoming Facebook. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what boomers do,
this is what they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, look what
I got in Farmville. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like what? We're no better than them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like what are the,
it's like the equivalent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like having a newspaper
with like the crossword </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like your grandpa comes and shows you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, look at this completed crossword. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Crosswords are too hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. Crossword way harder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It went from crosswords to
like newspaper Sudoku puzzles, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it's now Wordle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause what I was surprised
the most about Wordle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was that I thought it was like an app. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like all those other ones right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then I realized it's
the fucking New York times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just the thing
that New York Times had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like, I remember Joey's searching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for like the app stores. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like no you just type it in the brand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm like, why is there
like Russian apps coming up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on my thing? Like is this-
- Wordle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah Wordle.
(imitating Russian accent) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Staff] That's why New
York times bought it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah they bought it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Big brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I remember I tweeted ages ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I don't know what Wordle is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's been so long ago
I was too afraid to ask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least, well, I mean
you weren't afraid to ask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you tweeted it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was actually afraid to
ask, I don't even wanna, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm keeping this in the draft bro, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not fucking tweeting that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, I tried my
longest like just not Google it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like refuse to give it the attention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is gonna die in a
week. I'm not gonna look up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then like, I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's something that's going
to die in a week or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't fucking know. I'll
let Twitter burn itself out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I didn't even know
what it was called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like I got this close
to like going on to Google </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like green and yellow squares </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on my Twitter timeline.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Then I gave it a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't die. Give it two weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people were still posting about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, okay, I'm
just curious, just curious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so how long have
you been doing Wordle now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - For like, for like a good
week or something. Just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every day you just log on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whenever I remember to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> normally when I see it pop up my timeline, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like fuck you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] That's the reminder.
- Fuck You. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Staff] You look at this man right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (staff howling)
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Great now our fucking staff
members are getting into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You got it in three tries? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yo David, how many tries
did you get? Three, okay fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It took me four. Damn bigger brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Take these guys for helping each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They got a single letter for free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He gave me A, that's hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah he gave me M. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I gave you M in the
right spot. Come on Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Acting like didn't help.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like these boys are cheating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is an individual game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you're not
supposed to help each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Should play a Babble Royale though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you seen that game?
- What's that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Scrabble Battle Royale. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. I've heard of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just really miss playing Scrabble. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that boomer of me to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never played a game of Scrabble. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've never played Scrabble? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] No.
- Dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like people keep saying like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> UNO is a friendshipender, Monopoli, no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Scrabble is the real friendshipender. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, your friendship is fucked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're fighting with
a dictionary in your hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's when you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your friendship is in
the dire straight, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like, oh, we got a problem here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are a lot of like
three and two letter words </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're like, this is a word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then when, like, you
know and then the argument </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always comes longer being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, if it's like a commonly used word </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not an a dictionary is it allowed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, am I allowed to use the word Yeet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you know why is
like a lot of points, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not an a dictionary though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then when the friendships just crack, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we should do it on stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think VAX and anti-VAX
is in the dictionary now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a lot of double X, double X there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a lot of points you can get on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] V and an X? God damn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone's gonna be like scrambling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for those V and X's now man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are we doing a dictionary
one or a non dictionary one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I thought dictionaries
weren't allowed in Scrabble. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You say it like it's a speed runner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a math thing.
Calculator or no calculator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dictionary run. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Scrabble dictionary run. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry I'm only a dictionary runner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno the stats for
a non dictionary one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, we should definitely do a Scrabble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game on after doc because
that, honestly like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's legitimately fun,
I'm not just saying like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not being a boomer here,
like it's legitimately fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You seem to like word games though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember you would
countdown with just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yo, this game exists, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yo, how have I never
play this game before? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like countdown
I had a lot of fun in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you got me into Wordle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all word games, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno it's just something fun about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but then again, like
recently I have been getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quite boomer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I did see your video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like, am I getting too old? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember seeing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, fuck
you Joey, fuck you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] What are you my comment section? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's 27, he's like I'm dying
guys. Shut the fuck up Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like if you are old
Joey, then what am I? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, this is how you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> these boys didn't
actually watch the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I did watch the video.
I did watch the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because I recently
got back into golf </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that is the most boomer
thing I've ever done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, I don't think
golf is a boomer thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a privilege
thing, It's a difference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a privilege boomer thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, if you are broke,
you can't be playing golf. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just facts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is true. That is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just, golf isn't a boomer thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Golf is just a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have a lot of disposable
income kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's just, yeah,
but that's the thing, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think a lot of people
mistake it as a boomer thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's played by a lot of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the older generation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's because they have
the time and the money now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also, you know, relatively speaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> golf doesn't really take
as much of a physical, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, tax on you as like say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, a rugby or a cricket, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No golf is fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like actually properly
into golf when I was younger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like to the point where I start getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like proper golf lessons
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I went to golf camp a
couple times. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] You went to golf camp? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like 10 years old, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like during like summer holidays. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] What's golf camp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally just
like, think of you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, you stay over
in like a golf club </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a couple of weeks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And every day you just get up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just learn to play golf. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was, I think like 10
years old and it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] You like, forget how to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, surprisingly, I
kind of remembered it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] 'Cause you went to,
you went to a driving range. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I went to a driving range
with Mark and Marline. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause there was one like
kind of nearby my house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was a really fucking fancy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I knew this wasn't
like the, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the downtown alley, like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking we're gonna build
this driving range here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's nothing
else around kind of thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's like, you literally
got like a buggy service </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> from the car park to the
building, if you were far away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, I feel like
there's always like levels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like how into are you
into who like golf, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like I've never, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously I didn't come
the most privileged family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the only golf clubs I've ever owned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> were like a pair of
like a set of golf clubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I bought in a car boot sale, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 50 bucks or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, so I always went to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or you know, the really
cheap driving rangers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're really cheaper golf courses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but those were still fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The ones I went into back
in Australia were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> still like obviously
made in like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like seventies and like eighties. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's still very old,
like you get like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just like this
machine that you just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> press a button and you
put a basket under it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And it just like shits
out a hundred golf balls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into a basket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you kind of, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one at a time you put it on the tee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you like, whack it off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This one we went to though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if Japanese
driving ranges like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause this is the first time I went. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like you walk in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd never seen like this many
polo shirt in one building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and well like everyone
was like slicked hair, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like really like pristine
pants and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like clearly, like I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, okay we're in like
a nicer driving range. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they like made us like make these like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> membership cards that you
didn't even have to pay for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just like, they were like,
okay, the moment you're here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to make a membership card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So then you, and then
you fill this thing up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a credit card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You put cash into it and then
you'd pay for the golf balls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> using your membership card. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I was so used to the, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the pressing the button, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then the balls sitting
out into basket thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, I was looking
for that machine, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, okay, where is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was literally just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it looked like a ATM and
you'd put the card in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and you were like, how
many balls would you like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like a hundred and it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, go to this, you
know, go to this field. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, where are the balls? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, looking around, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where the fuck are the balls? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, okay, whatever.
I'll just go to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a fucking, you get to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no tee on the green. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, there's no tee, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no machine that
shits out the balls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, okay, what do I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's just like a
little like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like golfing, not golfing,
bowling alleys, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, there's like the little tablet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have that shows the scores. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> There was just like that,
but like a tiny one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, and there's just one button </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just says start. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, okay, I press start, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking tee with the
ball on top of it comes out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from under the green.
- Are you serious? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] It just goes (mimicking machine) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I whack it immediately
the moment I whack it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the tee goes down another
ball appears in its place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Holy Fuck, I've been playing- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, this
is the most fivehead, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> why the fuck was I wasting my time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sound amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was playing golf like
a peasant this entire time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was being an idiot looking around, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like where's the golf
ball shitting machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That makes golf sound hella fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you have like a counter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that shows how many balls you have left. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you say, for example, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, you pay for a hundred balls, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, after a while,
after you swing a golf club </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a hundred times, your arms and shoulders </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> start to get a little bit sore, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you're like, oh, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe I just wanna like call it a day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after 80 balls or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So you just press a stop, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the money comes back
into your membership card </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you can just leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking now that-.
- How much is it like to do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was 2000 Yens so
about $20 for 120 balls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is, honestly not bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like I remember
playing golf as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like, it has the
image of being an odd man sport, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's like, I still
think golf is boring as fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to watch, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's one of those sports where like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just made people cry right.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's one of those sports
where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I like golf. I get golf. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't understand anyone
here enjoying watching it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The only time I'll
ever sit down willingly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to watch golf is when
I find a YouTube video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on my recommend, which
is like top 10 miracles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> during golf tournaments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think playing golf is boomer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think watching golf is boomer. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to draw the line there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to draw the line there. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] That's fair. That's fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, I mean like, I
remember I was actually like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super, super into golf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I found it like super fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I wasn't really the
most athletic kid as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, like, I was like
in the basketball team, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel like I got put
into the basketball team </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just because I was tall and
that was like the prerequisite, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I didn't really enjoy so much playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like really high intensity sports. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I just really enjoyed golf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause it was more of like just a relaxing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you just hone one skill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there was nothing more satisfying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than that moment where you
just hit the ball perfectly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right and you can tell
you hit the ball perfectly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like sometimes you hit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you hit the ball and
it slices or you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes veers to the right
and then you could just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you feel it in your hands, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause there's like a
vibration in your hand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you hit it a bit wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you hit it and you
feel like it's like hitting air, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean?
- It's like I'm hitting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's like you
hitting nothing at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never played golf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've never?
- Only mini golf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, mini golf. I feel
mini golf has its own. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We need to go play golf. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We need to go play golf. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We should go to the driving
arrange near my house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like that place was
actually like, I wanna go back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dead ass after that session, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I looked at Marky dead in the eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, where do
I go to buy a golf set? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was legit this close to
just buying a golf set. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like I remember the one moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that sold me on golf as a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I went to the driving range. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Driving range was just fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you just fucking hit a ball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it doesn't matter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just really
satisfying hitting a ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always wanted to.
- Yeah, but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like on like the actual golf course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is where you you have to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually think about what you're doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't just like blindly hit a ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember like I had
an instructor at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And so like on the driving
range and in golf in general, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so if you don't know golf,
there's like a set of golf clubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that is numbered, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the lower the number, the less- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Less sharper the incline
is of the club, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, it's less incline.
- Oh less incline. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So for example, like a two iron
goes almost straight, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's a lot harder to get the ball up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and give it like air time, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So for me, like my comfort, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my comfort zone was
like a nice seven nine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I was about to say. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the seven nine.
- [Joey] It's the seven nine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The seven nine is like the comfort. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like on the driving range, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you wanna feel like you can play golf, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you gotta have the seven nine, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you can get a decent amount of air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a seven, nine,
like almost guaranteed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a perfect 45 degrees. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but also like a decent
amount of distance as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you could like, yeah, I
can whack a fucking ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can whack a fucking ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I remember I was on this golf course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with this instructor, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so between me and the flag, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so basically the hole, there
was like this this hill, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And on the hill was
like a sand trap, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I needed to get enough
air to get over the sand trap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also onto like onto green, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I know where this is going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so in my mind, I'm
like, this is two shots, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is two shots, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I need to get over the sand trap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then another shot to get to the green. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what happens? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I pull out my trusty comfort seven nine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my good old trustee, seven nine, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm about to hit it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my golf instructor goes, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not using that seven nine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been using the seven nine
for the entire golf course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And he picks out the three iron, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he goes, use this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I go, I can't use that,
I can't get enough air. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna hit the sand trap </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he goes, no, you can
do it I believe in you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I just like, what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, no, I can't do this, this is three, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this isn't even a five
iron, this is a three iron. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He goes, no, just do it,
just trust me, just do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember like it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know being like when Neo
discovered that he was the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the Matrix fight, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I remember hitting this ball </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I couldn't believe that it just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so this was the sand
trap, the ball went here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It went just perfectly
enough over the sand trap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it perfectly landed on the green. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, what is this feeling? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, am I the chosen one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know, like I like remember that moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the rest of my life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like, that was
the most satisfying shots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever hit in golf. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And from that moment on,
I was like, even as a kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I can see
why people play golf now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The only thing that would've
topped that experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is if your golf instructor in
the we sports voice was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> nice shot.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Nice approach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, I mean, it is a
very rewarding sports. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, like all sports are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because, so like when
I was at the driving range, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause it was fucking I
don't know, five sixties, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least minimum, since I
last went to a driving range, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I was in like high
school last time I went. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So obviously I was like, I knew, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically like how to
swing and everything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was fucking slicing
that bitch like crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every single time and I'm like, man what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> why am I slicing it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And just like, it got to the point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I was like dead pan serious, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like slowly, like just fucking doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> every single movement possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Being way too serious about
this shit and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and at one point I remember I was like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I got it.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swung.
- [Connor] Locked on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I locked on, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the position right here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just have to nail this
and the moment I got it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I nodded like it
was because again it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as Garnt said, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you hit that perfect
straight perfectly angled shot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just hear the
cleanest, like whack sound. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And nothing else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you fuck up, you hear like a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a really like a fucked up sound. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the best
way I can describe it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, you know, when
you play some FPS games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get that headshot, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like a lot of like
FPSs games have this like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really satisfying sound
when you get that head shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Ding sound.
- Like golf just has that IRL, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you get that
satisfying, like perfectly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like perfect headshot on that golf ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like designed to have
that satisfying sound. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, how do you get into golf? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not like a thing that.
- Well, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I don't have a golf set or anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Marky and Marilyn does,
but a lot of those places, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like in driving range and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they give you like rentals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the only ones they
gave me was a seven iron </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> cause of course.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that just universal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like, you've
never played just this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] We'll start you
off with the seven iron. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So all they gave me was
a driver and a seven iron. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like happy Gilmore's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gotta do the runup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a good movie.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah and then you just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of just get a feel
for it after a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's, I think it's definitely
best to go with someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who, you know, knows at
least the bare minimum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Knows how to swing a golf club. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my brother played a lot of golf. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Can't remember he played like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he did like tournaments and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I never did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was always more into
like stuff that was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way more active. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Running or just head butting walls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was great, I mean
golf is like Monkey mode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it's controlled monkey mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you just, you just gotta whack- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That doesn't sound very monkey mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Stop tryna describe golf
in a way that I like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not how it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just whacking a ball. I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not monkey mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, just think of no,
no, instead of monkey mode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just as monkey mode, you know
you swing like in the wild. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just think of instead
of it instead of an FPS </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you shoot someone in the head, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like an FBS, but like the bullet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is the end of the golf stick
and the ball is the head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's such a shit analysis.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's all it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get the perfect shot, boom satisfying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't even have to
sound me on golf, I wanna try. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This episode is sponsored by Boksu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you guys smell that?
- Smell what Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh the smell of fresh
spring air all around us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But God we're inside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How can you smell the fresh spring air? </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> - How beautiful this thing looks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So Garnt, what are you holding? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a Sakura sweet cookie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at this look. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] That's so cute.
- [Connor] I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you know that Sakura season is Boksu's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most anticipated collection of the year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and if you've been waiting to try them out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now is the beast time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> As you can hear Garnt is
having the time and his life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So use our code Trashtaste15. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the link in the description now below </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to save $15 off your first order. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go get yourself a piece
of Japan's freshest season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the monthly Boksu.
- I'll have what he's having. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you guys ever been to
any of the bating cages before? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I fucking love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot harder than it looks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a lot harder than it looks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also a lot scarier than it looks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because even when you put it on like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the slowest mode or I
think a lot of machines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> throw at like 80 kilometers
an hour and that's slow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't sound too fast or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then you remember,
that's like the speed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that cars travel on some highways </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, oh,
that that's pretty fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can hit a car with a baseball bat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't hit a ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - At what cost. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, my arms will pretty fall off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Those things are fucking hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember trying to do the 120. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I out of like 20 shots,
I managed to hit one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That wasn't very good.
I was just guessing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] It's getting into the speed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's got a lot harder learning curve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than when you play in every mini game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like any LOPG right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like in like you play
on like Persona five whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you miss the first two shots. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Baseball in Persona.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can go to bating cage on Persona 5. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course you can't.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can do homework in Persona. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Why couldn't you like do
like go to batting games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how you up your charisma. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How does it up your charisma? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the more shots you get, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more charismatic you're. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're so likable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like damn you
got 19 outta 20, seesh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's more charismatic as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weird way to define charisma. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I remember
like you play on Persona </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or any mini game or fucking
probably Yakza or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah and then you missed
like the first two ball </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, okay,
I got a feel for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You start getting them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In real life you miss like the first 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, I can't
even keep up with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like my eyes still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In real life it's not even like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't even attempt to
swing after the first few. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the first few is like seeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how fast the ball actually goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and by the time you realize
it, it's behind you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, oh, okay I'm
gonna be here for a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then maybe around
like swing seven or eight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, I think I have
the courage to start swinging. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could just never swing faster enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My eyes were just were
way faster than my arms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I learned. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm British. So we don't play baseball. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Australia doesn't play baseball either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like holding a
baseball bat was just weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and trying to hit a baseball. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but we played cricket. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We, I didn't play cricket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well the Welsh and the British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did not play any.
I've never played cricket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You didn't play cricket? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I played in the infield one time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to like catch
it, I never got to bat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like everyone bats though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but like, cause we were, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we were in school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we had like an hour, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we never played it that often. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you never play
in like PE or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah we did. But I was
always in the infield. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like this team swap over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know, but we never had time to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we ran out of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we never played it
often because you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to do like every sport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we didn't cricket often. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was never good at the team
games. That's what I learned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm really bad at team
games and we never did golf </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cause that's like, how are you
gonna get kids to play golf? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not practical. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean golf wasn't like
was never a PE thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was more just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Like a extracurricular thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But we did like, I don't
know, we did like everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was your favorite sport during PE? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always liked athletics
when we did that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like running, long jump,
high jumps, stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, javelin. Javelin is
really fun, shot put was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's cause I was like a fucking animal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You seemed like a shot put. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you seem like
a shot put kinda guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why that doesn't surprise me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why does that doesn't surprise me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I as much as I've my God
damn hardest, I can like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I cannot run long distances. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No matter how much I practice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure there's some God tear runner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the comments being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you just gotta, you
gotta past through man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I gonna hit that wall,
you gotta keep going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Never stop get that pump up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gotta breathe through your nose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know like I am a sprinter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I always was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, whenever I, no matter
how many times I trained, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just reject doing long distance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I wanted to sell God damn bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah so I ended up
just doing sprinting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like to me it's like
sprinting and like throwing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and long jump, it was all
kind of explosive energy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - For me, high jump and long jump </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like the ones I excelled. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I sucked high jump. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Long jump for me was the best one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was in athletics as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was just really good at jumping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know.(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause my school was
really small so this a bunch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like I was the only
one who went to athletics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> after school, like cause
we had a local track </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that had been funded by the lottery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So right next to where I lived, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was these amazing facilities. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like amazing track, nothing
like this anywhere else near me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like cause this is just like unheard of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like an actual good track. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I used to go there
and I was the only person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in my like year who did this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was the only one who knew
how to throw like a javelin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knew to throw a shot put,
knew how to do long jump, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the correct way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you do discs and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't do discus, so we were doing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and every year we had
the sports day, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you have to do the track and field? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you had like houses, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Griffindoer and shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like your own version.
- [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I was in like the
house called scissors in well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Scissors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Scissors that wasn't rock or paper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like scissor or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And how did you decide,
who does the events, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how did you decide this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically it was just like picked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, would you
like to go to this event? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If there was someone who was
obviously the best at event, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would be like, well you're. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, for us, it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just put your hand up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, who wants to
do the hundred meter sprint? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then everyone who wants
to puts their hands up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then if you didn't wanna
do it, you didn't wanna. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if there was too many
people, how did they decide? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, everyone did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, there was no limit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, I mean, to be
fair, my school as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was also very, very small. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like we only had like, you
know, 500 people in our school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many people were in
your, your grade or year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like 60. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, so yeah it's about, same for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So there was like only two
or three people were allowed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do each event. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And for the first few years when I did it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there was no limit on
how many you could do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I was just like, I'll
just do like everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I loved sprinting,
I loved racing as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I would do like, yeah, I'll do the 100, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 200, 400 long jump, the triple
jump, javelin, shot put. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was fun, it was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there was some people in my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cause we only had like
groups of like 15 of us split </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there was like half
of them that were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna do anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I was like, oh great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There always was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, you had like a maximum of four, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like everyone did like
four or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, so then there
was one year where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I did the 100, 200 and I'd
won all of the events but one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I was like, oh, this is fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I won like six out of seven events. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the next year
they were like, no, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can only do three now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like.
- [Joey] They snarfed you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, why are snarfed me? Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That's not fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But this is the thing, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that I'm sure if I
went to any other school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where people like knew how to do like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> throw a Javelin correctly,
or like jump correctly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like this when like long jump, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone was still doing the
jump where you like just jump, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not the one where you jump into a sit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was really easy to like do better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean same with
like a high jump as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone just like did like the, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the standing scissor kick way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like I was doing the
full like fucking arch back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Torpedo John. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right and then you're like,
oh my God, this guy's a God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> How the other kids can't compete. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like actually doing the
like professional technique. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, I'm like, oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course, you're only gonna
be able to jump like a menial, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're fucking doing this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The is kick.
- Yeah, the is kick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I couldn't do that
though. I was terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was really fun though.
I really liked it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, when you're winning,
of course you like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought that would make
me popular, didn't they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well like during elementary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like dominating long jump in high. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Turns up, yeah guys. I'm here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Definitely did not make me popular. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> If anything, it just gave people more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cannon for right to be like, Ugh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your name's Joey and you
you're good jumping things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like a baby kangaroo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I never fucking heard the end of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Christ
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just felt like I just saw your soul, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just leave your eyes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like years of like torment
just came rushing back there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - One time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Very, very tense moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just won the 100 meters
and immediately after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were like, let's do the 200 meters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> They didn't think let's
space it out, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was actually naked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was lining up for the 200 meters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I really, really,
really wanted the win. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted this more than like any, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why I was
so ultra competitive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like the Olympics for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I need this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was so God nervous that
like, I was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I felt like a little drizzle
go down my leg, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was so nervous that like,
for like a brief moment, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I peed myself.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like 0.1 seconds and I was like, stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a little beep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was like a
little beep and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's never happened
before, what was that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck! Luckily I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you know, I didn't
give a that I peed myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My priority was like, no
one else saw that, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No one else saw that drizzle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But luckily I was so sweaty
from the previous event, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> still that nobody had
thought that pissed myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like shake it off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Just shake your leg.
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's get back to it boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to it, the yeah I won. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I really needed to piss after it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing)
My bladder it was so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever been that nervous, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your bladder is completely opened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I've had that before.
- Is that happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You trust me.
- I've never been in that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't know that could
happen, until it happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've done the little
like before as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had that drink, I had that before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like a really important
like piano competition. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughing)
- It happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But at least, but like the problem was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I had it a lot worse than you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] You probably
wear like nice pants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was wearing a suit.
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was wearing shorts,
that shit just came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you were already sweaty right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like in a well air conditioned room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like long pants, like in a suit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> With like all these like
really properly dressed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Asian kids next to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, Ha! Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Could you see
it? Could you see the pants? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, luckily not, but my God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was hard to use the pedal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> while my leg was also a little bit wet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, oh God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - How far did the stream get
down? Did it go all the way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like almost to my knee.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They missed this fucking
scene in your line April, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so was that been a fucking waiting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the chapter with
Connor said pisses himself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you're a kid, you get anxious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly.
- I also used to try. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I felt really bad for the
kid who had to follow after me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm like I didn't check, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was like, I'm sorry
if the seat is a little wet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] There's a wear patch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There wet patch on
that seat right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking nailed the competition though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So worth it in the end, but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So did you win the 200 meters? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did. I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was also so competitive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to the point where I dunno
if I can do this now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was running and I thought like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, I really need to stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wouldn't stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would always end up
throwing up when I stopped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
- You are that kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You are the kid who just
threw up everywhere always. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because right to me, it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, no, I need to
win, like I have to win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So like, if there was a,
like I'm at the last stretch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I still got a little left in me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, I can't stop
now, I need to throw up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So one year, this is again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was doing like six events </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've won the 100, I've won the 200 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and again, right after it,
what comes after the 200? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the 400. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's kind of like the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You sprint at the end, you
kind of run fast at the start. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well why would they not split it up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause in our school, they split it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I think they might have assumed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that different people would
be doing different events. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think they assume people
would do different things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so like, I would get max
like two minutes break. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was doing the 400, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was already like, before
I even started this race, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I was like (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was already, still
naked from the other one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, how the
am I gonna win this one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I'm in this race, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I get to the 200 meter mark, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is where you're like,
the on switch has to come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have to start sprinting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like I'm like kind
of like I'm in the middle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not really in, I got
a lot of ground to make up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was going a little too slow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I just start going crazy, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I get like to 50 meters and
I'm like, oh no. (screaming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> On the side, on the
side of the race track. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, luckily it's a grass race track, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that shit's just extra compost. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And luckily I was not in the middle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was, I was in the first lane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like 50 meters, into this sprint, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going all out and I just
have to, I just (screaming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it became a bit of laughing stock </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for the rest of that day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That would've been amazing to see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was literally just like
powering through like a machine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> then just like had to just start vomiting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was awful.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I just didn't
know my limits as a kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just didn't like, my willpower </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was just beyond my body's
ability apparently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it happened all the time
during long distance as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always threw up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah like I sucked at long distance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think mostly because I have asthma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So I could only do like
200 meters at most before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like my asthma would
like start to kick in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was rough man. Long
distances are horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it was really muddy and freezing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was always during winter,
did you do it in winter? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta be a real
masochist to enjoy long run, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like long running. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's like, why would you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially people who do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for like club activities and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, what do you do after school? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I run. Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they make all the
kids do it when you did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So like if kids, so basically
kids could opt in and out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at our school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh you could knocked out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every kid needed to do an activity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you didn't have
to like a certain like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, certain amount, but
you needed to do at least one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, there were some
years where I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna do anything today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - What! Dude from my school, it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on this day we're doing two kilometers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have do the two kilometers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have no choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had other events
for that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where like kids had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you talking about PE or sports day? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - PE.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, if it's PE then yeah,
if we were doing activity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry, Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it's PE everyone have to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to do the extra. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, cause I remember that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they would like get
really angry at the kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that were just like at walking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and they like shout at them and
be like, the fuck you doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's this like fucking army. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the SAS or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, so because like
we had at our school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we had like, I think like
four different sports days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like four different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? We had one.
- So we had the track. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Winter Olympics in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, so we had like
a track and field day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we also had like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what we called the swimming carnival, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which was we went to like
our local swimming pool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we would doing like swimming events. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We got one sports day in the year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like,
- Just track and field. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every kid looked forward to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was just basically
a day off from school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just do fun stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could just sit on the grass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then we had another sports day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where we did it on the beach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So we did like, you know, like beach flags </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know like races,
like thousand meter races </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on the beach and stuff like
that and like surfing events </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that was just like
another day where like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if kids didn't want to do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then kids didn't have to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we had a fourth
one during the winter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this was the worst one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was called, they don't have it anymore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was called the Walkathon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Walkathon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so it's think of
like a marathon, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is like 42 point
something kilometers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's that, but you can
walk it if you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was basically we
start from the school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd walk 20 kilometers across
like seven or eight beaches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that was like the area we lived in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you'd turn around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you'd walk all the
way back to the school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you'd have to do that during the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think they got rid of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because cause I think some
of like the higher grade kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> were just like calling Ubers.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would. Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like when you
reach like the halfway point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd get like a sticker,
like put on your like wrist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so like that's how you'd know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you came back to the school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you made it to the halfway point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, that was
their like foolproof way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of making sure you did the whole thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speed runners be like, I found a clip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what the senior kids would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that like they'd walk away from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, they'd do a, maybe
like the first kilometer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, they'd like walk into
a street, call an Uber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get them to drive to like a kilometer away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the halfway point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'd just like,
come out, being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, hey, I made it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they'd do it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think they got rid of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like kids were cheating, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but it was also like a
charity event for the school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like you had to like, you
know, you had to pay like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it was like a dollar
per student or whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> for like this charity.
- [Connor] Paid to walk 42 km. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pay to walk 42 kilometers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, for some kids it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh fuck yeah we just have to walk today, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't have to do class. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Hell yeah, I'll take that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you ever forget toll off in school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for stuff you did outside of school? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like as in like in the school grounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> or outside school grounds? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Outside of school.
- Like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like the area where I went to school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like really small. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like I was like, I
don't know how old I was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Must have been like 13, 14. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There was like a bunch
of like ruined castles </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I grew up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And one time I was like
climbing the wall of this castle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a teacher happened to
be walking in that park </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during the day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she just saw me,
she didn't say anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I was just climbing it,
I was having a great time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Probably wasn't the safest thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was quite high up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I came into
school the next Monday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it was on like a weekend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got blocked by the fucking teachers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They told me off and I was
like, I was so confused, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, this doesn't, is this allowed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was outside of school. What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were telling me
off for climbing this wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of school, not
even anywhere near school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like teachers are snitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think we had anything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like, the town on
that I grew up in was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was small, but it was also quite wide. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think I ever saw my
teachers outside of school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I was in
like Hove and Brighton, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so I mean, that's like a city. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I don't think people cared about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Did you guys have, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> did your schools have any
rivalries with like other schools? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were attached to another school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah we had like a
sister school as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the school I went
to was the boys school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like at the bottom of the hill, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was the girls
school, the sister school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were like, our schools
were physically attached. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they were different schools? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so you could
walk to the other school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from our school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That just sounds like
a bad time. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds like fights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whether a lot fights happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like the corridor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like where like the walls
were like different colors, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there was a weird line, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's where like, if shit went down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was always like, at this
like, it was like the DMZ, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in like North Korea.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like guard standing on the border. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing)
- It was like shit went down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the reason why this weird like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it sounds really bizarre, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we were a Welsh speaking
school and we were really small. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the one we were attached to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was a massive English speakings, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really fuck big English speaking school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause our school was
too small and like poor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to have our own like sports facilities. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So that school also
had this massive sports </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like kind of complex attached to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Swimming, pool, tennis,
like massive sports halls, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Astro turf, massive fields, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tennis courts, everything , right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They had everything like rugby pitches, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And so our school would basically share </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the facilities with them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So whenever we needed
to go to use the pool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything, we always
walked through this school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and went there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So we could walk through their school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but they couldn't walk through our school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause our school was on the edge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why would the, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just imagining like the
architect of that building, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just being like, this
is gonna be hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They just wanted to make
a fight club between kids, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause of course kids are
gonna fucking fight eachother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there was like that corridor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was two outside
gates that also connected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that were pretty big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So whenever it was like
snow or anything as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that would turn into
like the fighting zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just remember a
story of like going back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the teachers getting angry
outside of the school grounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you guys ever used
to do like PE activities </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of school?
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You'd go to other places. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like one of the ones
that we did quite often </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was cause our school was
right next to a beach. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We did a lot of like ocean kayaking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was like really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you just like two
or three boys at a time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get on a Kayak.
- [Connor] That's dangerous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was very dangerous, but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn kayak, he got kayaking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to go kayaking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You guys got to go kayaking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and sailing.
- What the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What sailing?
- Yeah, we had sailing as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had learned how to sail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm so jealous.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I got good story for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was one moment in kayaking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's such a bad story, but there was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause we were on Manley beach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and one of the beaches, cause
it's like a bay basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So surrounded by these cliffs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's a lot of
like really like pristine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like penthouses that are like
kind of overlooking the bay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> If you like kind of look up at the cliffs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There was this one time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were just kayaking along the bay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then one of the boys
was like, oye, check it out! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we look up and
there's just like a chick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> standing like in a bikini,
just like looking down at us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you know, she was
a very attractive lady. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we were, you know, we were
in 11th grade, so we were 17, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 18 stuff like that, yeah, so basically- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm about to commit misogyny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So one of the kids was like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, I know what he's gonna say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So one of the boys just starts going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> tits out for the boys,
tits out for the boys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tits out for the boys and then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds like most Australian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then a couple and then
couple of the other boys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> start joining along. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tits out for the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then before you know it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like 15 Kayaks,
like 30 boys in this bank. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just going tits out for the
boys, tits out for the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thunder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like a scene at a Mad Max. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was fucking crazy and then
of course the girl flashes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone goes, yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Did she? What!
- [Garnt] Oh my god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then teacher and of course
the teacher we had that day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was a female teacher. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> She was like, what the
fuck are you boys doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we just like bolt in our kayaks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like get away from the sea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we got absolutely rinsed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is the most teenage
Australian boys story ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This what happens when you
study in boys only school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, this is what happens
in a boys only school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tits!
- Tits! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just remember that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How Joey didn't turn
into our slash nice guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing)
I dunno how that happened. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate to admit I did join in the chant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Oh my God.
- Just from peer pressure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] So he committed misogyny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I committed misogyny, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They didn't let you
do anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, like I wouldn't
trust a kid out in the sea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm surprised how other people did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We got to go to areas in Wales </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that were like kind of
a like camps for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three, four days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were basically
like, they would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listen boys, we can do
kayaking or you can do sailing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem is you only got six sailboats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we've got, everyone else
can do kayaking, like 30 kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, oh shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though I didn't really like sailing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know anything about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, well, that's
the one that has less, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I put my hand up to do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and somehow I got chosen to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did sailing, I fucking
loved it, it was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they gave us those like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, boat plastic, like
really cheap boat plastic, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the one where you like knock
it and it sounds hollow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really coarse as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It basically like a boat
that was a shell of plastic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with a, like what's it
called, is it a hole? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's the thing that goes to the bottom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> With the rudder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sail.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just in the bottom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have no idea.
- I don't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I forgot what it's called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you just have this slab of plastic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that you put in to allow
you to sail basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when we learned
how to sail and it was great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah, it was really good, cause like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Staff] Talking about the mast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The mast. No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never sailed before in my life so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This mast was at the front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it was one way you turn it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they in the bottom
underneath the water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you slide in a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not the rudder.
- [Staff] Not the rudder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I dunno.
- It's a sailboat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you didn't do the direction with the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you did the direction
with the sail, not the- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like you'd pull on the
sail and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You pull on the sail, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you lean like, it was really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like you been
doing that badass shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you'd be leaning half the
boat would be out the water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> onto the sail, it was so fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Horizontal on waters.
- Just drifting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Staff] Is it the Keel? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Maybe I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Either way, so, and then you would like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you would be taught like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, let's say you flip your boat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Here's how you jump out the boat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jump on the piece of
plastic outside the boat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> push it down, jump back in
the boat and get it back in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So fucking cool, I loved it so much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got really good at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the head guy
was like, you know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every year or so the kid who
gets really good at sailing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I let him try the real boat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, oh shit really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, so he like out of this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really gross looking shed in the water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was one of those sheds that was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kinda there's no flow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just for the boat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He pulls out this massive
Catamaran, massive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been in this like one person boat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing could easily fit like four, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to six people on it, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, go take it out for a spin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like this looks fucking scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did he say it like the
rich uncle, loans Ferrari. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's take it out for a spin boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Felt like the sword in the stone test. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's see if you can handle this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I start taking this thing out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's going well, I'm managing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a lot harder, you have to run, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to like get across way more, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot more really full body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you've gotta really
like get underneath, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you really gotta like throw
yourself around on this thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to steer it, it's going
well, it's going well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Suddenly we get a big gust of wind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm trying my God
damn best to save this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm trying my best. I get to the side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm tryna unleash the mass
so that we can get some like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we can get the boat back down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Unfortunately the boat just keeps going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It keeps going and then it doesn't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it gets sideways completely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> From this point now
this boat is too heavy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Unlike the other boat where my body weight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could shift it back, like my
body weight can't do shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it is literally like the
sinking boat, like Titanic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It is just like I'm sitting
on the top of the boat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like at the top of the thing,
just slowly going down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Until it gets about the halfway point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it won't sink anymore, luckily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm just sitting there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he comes over disappointingly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in like the speed boat
and he's like, I see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You aren't the chosen one.
- You are not the one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like, I see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, well at least help me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> tie the rope around this
part and I took it back over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he got on the
boat and he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll show you how to drive it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like,
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I let him down. I let him down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He sailed it back and then
I was like a disappointment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was never allowed to try it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a fucking, I felt like that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a look in hindsight, I
feel that was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like that was a big step up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was alone as well with the catamaran </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can normally have
like two people on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the big one with the big net, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what it is
right, it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't like a full sized massive one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like a smaller version,
but still, it was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm so jealous. I never
got to do that in my school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we live in Brighton.
- You live in Brighton. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even kayaking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was in a lake and a
river, so it's a lot easier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a really big lake, but you wouldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> wanna do that in the ocean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's dangerous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get swept fucking away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> In this lake you were just
happy for me ask about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I don't
think there was any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like big lakes near us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we didn't really do any water sports. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the most we did was just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we had like a swimming
pool, a local swimming pool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean
there's lakes everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, I mean, we're not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like how far did you need to
drive to get to this lake? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Two, three hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You drive two, three
hours just for this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like the entirety of Wales. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like a fucking
school trip for us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was, it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like a three day
weekend school trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, you made it sound
like it was one afternoon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You made it sound like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for this one lesson in PE. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I said three or four
days, three or four days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because like the
kayaking thing for us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like down the road.
- Oh no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, so there's like areas in the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure it's funded
by the Welsh government. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, basically
every Welsh school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> gets like a weekend there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- [Joey] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So everyone gets to have turns. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So these like, they're
like really fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] That makes more sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like, yeah, there's like a, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kinda like a thing you go, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey, try a bunch of different
sports, try kayaking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> try canoeing, try sailing,
wall climbing, like everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just try to do everything,
suite what you like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And so it was really fun
and I'm glad got to do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I kept up with sailing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But unfortunately sailing
is a very luxury sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be able to do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So not like, oh yeah,
you can just go sailing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Unfortunately, it sucks really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I feel like there's
so many sports out there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I could have fell in love with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but the financial instability. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The absolute economical stayed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That like every sport
ever for everyone, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's was like me
and skiing and snowboarding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why I never was
able to get into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause my family unfortunately
could never afford </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to you going on a skiing
or snowboarding trip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's either not enough money,
not enough space or both. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- Well I'd love to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been skiing and snowboarding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like the majority of my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I would love to earn
a snowboard or skis, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but it is an absolute nightmare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to deal with transporting
it and taking it everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I also, it's pretty expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It is expensive. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know that you can ship
it from hotel to like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - God you sound like you had
such like fun school trips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You went to like America
for a school trip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's fucking crazy to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that was insane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like the first
year they did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was really expensive as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I had to like beg
my parents and they were like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause our school wasn't that rich. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I think the richest
thing that our school did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for the rugby team, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause we like excelled
in sports at our school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like the senior rugby team was allowed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go to like play rugby in Europe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt And Connor] Oh wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but like that was only like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the select like maybe like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, top 20 people who
were like good at rugby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't even remember what
we did for our school trips. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The rest of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we just went to like the local water silo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. Something boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno if this is just cause like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a really small place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I imagine that when you're in a city </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it probably feels like less inclined </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get you out of the city. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas when you're in the
countryside, there's nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So I feel like they had way more pressure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to try and get you to do something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Especially cause you know,
in at least sport in Wales, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like sports is like a massive deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a very important
part of like the culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and doing sports as seen as a very, very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you have to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doesn't matter what you do just do sports, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like it seems do what you gotta do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you know, there was
a really big incentive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for them to make us go and do sports </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and go on sports trips and
do all this kind stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the farthest we
ever went in a school trip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or anything was like
during like school camps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that we did every year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that was like maybe like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know four, five hours away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which in the grand scheme of
Australia is not far at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, yeah, I don't remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like going on like school excursions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going further than like an hour away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, the furthest I ever went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a school trip was like France. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause every school trip
goes to France for like it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well you're in Brighton
it's fucking easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - At least you fucking Europeans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got to go to other countries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was not in for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Other countries are like,
don't exist, Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, oh what's
the closest country, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Papa on Y Guinea. How far away is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like a three hour plane
ride, its like your cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your own country is like far
away from your own country. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We couldn't even, even get
to go to the other states. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's too far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> God forbid we're gonna be on a
plane for an hour and a half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> No, of course not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You probably had better
school facilities though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than we had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We get to go on a trip and they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just forget about the fact
that you have to share a chair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No, I mean, even then
it was like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like school camp, for
example, it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, I guess, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone got their own seat
on the bus or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like that was the most we got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Got your own scene on the bus.(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What privilege. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What were your, I didn't get school meals, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like were your school meals good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What did you get? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We didn't get school meals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] There was no cafeteria? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was a cafeteria. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - What did they serve at the cafeteria? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Most like luxury thing
ever was this was fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was two chicken
tenders in a bread roll. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That shit cost $4.50.
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To me you knew the kids
who were eating goods </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were who were the kids that could afford </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a ham and cheese panini. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your school had ham and cheese panini? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You got fucking panini dude? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro they gave you more than
they just called it bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That was all we, everything was bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - For us it was literally just two fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> microwave chicken tenders in a hotdog roll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then if you wanted
ketchup or mayonnaise, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it was available for
you for like 20 cents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
- But even then it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause, so like I never bought anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at our cafeteria just because I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not fucking paying 50
for Chicken tender roll. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is where child Connor
really learned inflation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is where it
really came to hit me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember I used to have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was always given the
same amount of money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> from like the young age
to spend at the cafeteria. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember like when
I started high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could get any of the meals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They weren't amazing meals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> by the end I literally
couldn't buy any of the meals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless I like had half
a meal the day before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then saved and then and then yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why did you not renegotiate
with your parents, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like mom, dad.
- Their mindset was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> well your brother managed completely fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> throughout high school with this much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So what's you're problem? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah, because I
think in my household, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like I got allowance for
doing chores like per month. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you know, it was like maybe like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, 20 bucks max per month, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Which, you know, to a 10
year old is a lot of money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But at the same time when
your school at age 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gave you fucking meat
pies for like a dollar 50. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, there's like
squeezy ketchup packets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Those were 20 cents and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dog, I'm not paying 20 cents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not paying a literal
100th of my monthly allowance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for a little fucking squirt of ketchup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I'm not doing that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys didn't have packed lunches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had to have packed lunches
for most of the days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like most of my days for me as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like packed lunches, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Because my mum was like, I'm
not giving you fucking money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all that expensive.
- Cause for me like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my allowance would like
last the entire week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I'd treat myself to
the ham and cheese panini. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was like the Friday
meal that was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - See you did it the smart way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, you know what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could buy that chicken tender roll, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I could also buy
this Yugio booster pack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was gonna say,
here's what I did, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I would get, so I'd get
two pounds a day, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which was like, I could buy one meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if I waited like a day and
like had something small. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I was like, but I actually
want video games instead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So I would go into the town,
which is like a 20 minute walk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would go to the, it's called
home bargains in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a pound land or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would buy a family bag of crisps, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 12 pack for a pound. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I would just eat that the whole week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is awful, this is pretty wild. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This the most British
thing I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You were rationing on chips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you were just on
a crisp diet as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing)
- Yeah, I was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Because right, a video game
back then was 30 pounds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So if I did this for a whole
month, I got a new game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sure my mom was wondering
where the I got this game from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but she didn't even
know that I was getting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was eating Chris. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was probably an awful
thing to do in my body, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I didn't care I was like 15. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted the video game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You see, you had so
much more of a stronger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> willpower than me because
like I could not save money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for that long.
- I couldn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had the object in mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I want the new halo game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not eating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No dude in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every time I went to
like a electronic store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, oh, the
new Mario Party is out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> How much does it cost? $80. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt And Connor] Oh! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I could save up four
months worth of allowance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get it, but my birthday
is also in seven months time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So maybe I could just like hint at it now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just wait seven months for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to actually get the game.
Which is what I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah cause for me, like when
I wanted to buy a video game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I grew up in like,
when I was in school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like the N 64 SNES era. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like games back then
was like 60 pounds a game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> For like a cartridge game.
- Wait, was it really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, it was.
- Was it like halved? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh?
- It like halved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like I remember when
like games start coming out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on discs, I'm just like, why
is it so much cheaper now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the hell and the graphics are better, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is what kind of hacks they put in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - PS2 was like me producing those things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so like back in those days, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like there was no fucking way I can afford </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a cartridge game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the only times I
was getting new games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like Christmas and birthday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Those were the two times of
the year where I got games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, I was praying
that I could, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was praying that my parents bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the right games every time man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I was like, mother I
have waited an entire year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I don't get at least three
games, I am going to rage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I turned like 16, they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we want you to have a bit of an allowance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so that you can learn
how to manage your money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, oh thanks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just thinking like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got a lot saved already though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, this is just
adding to the wealth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This is how I've become Jeff Bezos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think my parents thought the same way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but only after they found
out that I got rejected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from my McDonald's job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they were like, there's no saving you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we'll up your allowance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you don't end up being a bum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The more I think about
it, the more I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I dunno if I was always gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that kind of way with money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno, I wonder is it like I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess you have to teach
your kids you how to learn, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how to manage money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes I see videos, people are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nobody taught me how to manage money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I just spent it all when
I was like 20 and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You do this. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - By the way very, very,
very British thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What Chrisp I was eating by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Walkers. No.
- That's too expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Quavers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No think cheap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Think cheap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't look at me, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is from very British
audiences right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just gonna hit you
like a wave, discos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my fucking God! Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I completely forgot
that they even existed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't had discos since like my. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You like 12. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I was like, did
I reach double digits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the last time I had disco? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I can't fucking remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the cheap shoot chips. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were like weirdly good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But there was probably so
much like MSG and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were really tasty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But they were weirdly like super cheap, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like compared to all other chips, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but they taste really fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> - I've always had like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't know if it was
just my school in Australia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when watch like American
like high school movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And that had like the
cafeteria, like the cafeteria. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Where there was like the lunch lady </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was like, this was
like the serving of the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, kind of shit like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno why, did you
look at that and go like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I wish I had that in my school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think Americans wish they
had that in their schools. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, cause I remember like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> watching American high school movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like damn I wish my
high school was this cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like every Simpsons episode I watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like Bart was in the cafeteria, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, man that looks cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What, does every American
school have that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Behold I know not every
American school has that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just shocked
that everyone had cars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing)
That's what blue meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's like 15
year old kid and it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like, yeah, I'll
pick you up tonight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, do you mean your parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> are gonna pick you up tonight? Or. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno what was going
on in the two thousands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But like every single
thing it wasn't about like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you had a car, it was
like which car you had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, you all have cars? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like yeah oh, sorry
I'm gonna go pick you up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - When did you guys first
like learn to drive then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you learn how, how
to drive like immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you could or did you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like when I.
- Complicated story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, for me it was like
the moment you hit 16. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's complicated about it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - How did this be complicated? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I started learning how to drive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was 17, which when
you could do in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But what sucks is that because
my birthday was in July, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the end of the school year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> People who started in
September had already like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way past got their cars and were driving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait your school year ends in July. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh sorry ends
in September. Sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - September?
- No starts in September. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry starts in September

<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know if we're talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Wait, when does yours? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's January. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your school year starts in January? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It ends in December, starts in January. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whoa. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So wait, how do summer
holidays work for you then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Summer holidays is December. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then when do you
get Christmas holidays? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually it technically
starts in February. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we end school middle of December. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you celebrate Christmas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and holidays during holidays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then all of January
is summer holidays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you come back in February. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So how long do you get off them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - During summer holidays?
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like depends on the school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like usually like a month and a half. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, cause we get like
nearly three months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's pretty much
the first half of August </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is when it ends, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, well we talking university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or were we talking like secondary school? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Secondary both are the same right-ish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, for us it was all the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no in university, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember in university you get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking three months off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And those were like,
that was like before that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like school holidays for me were always, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the summer holiday was six weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was always six weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Winter holidays was two weeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we'd have like half terms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you'd get like, where
you'd get like one week off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like halfway through the term. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Spring and autumn holiday.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So all together we got like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we must got like about two
around two months of holiday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was spread out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like university
here and I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yo, what the fuck, we get
three months off for summer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> why am I even going to
education anymore man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The first time I experienced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first like summer holidays in uni, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, well see you
at university never again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember when summer
holidays started in university, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, wow, I'm just
not gonna go back to uni. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's three months, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like, you know
what you can't imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the end of summer holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah so the point was that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically kids who were born in September. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry fuck am I saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Kids who had their
birthday like in my year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who were like really close
to the start of the year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically got to have their
license and already had it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and cool as shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you were right at the end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So they were in my year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it didn't matter
if you the year above. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you weren't friends, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if I was closer in age technically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So like the people who got it first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were like the coolest ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause everyone was like,
oh can we gimme a lift now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I'll drive you there. It's like fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, so it's like for, in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys have like different stages </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in your driving license, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you have like learner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah like provisional,
- Provisional stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So when you're on your first level, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like when you first start.
- There's two levels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have, or you're learning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so when you are learning, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> can you just like drive by yourself? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Connor] No.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There needs to be
someone who supervises you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Supervises you and has,
how many years of experience? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So X amount of years driving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can't go on like the highways. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like it's only
until your provisionals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can drive by yourself, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but the problem is that normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not that you can't find someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's that you can't get a car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you need to be insured. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was what the hard part was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause insurance for like a
17 year old is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] You need to be insured. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you need to be insured. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I could just use my mom's car. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] You might have
had family insurance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like, if you are
under family insurance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> your price gets like tripled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you have a 17 year
old on your license. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah.
- It's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the reason why it was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> no one owned a car except for a few people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was cause the insurance cost </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was like triple of quadruple the car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The car was nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like my mate got a car for like
a hundred quid of some guy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the insurance was like a thousand plus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like-
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was more cost for the
insurance than the car itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But lessons were expensive as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did lessons, my brother
had already passed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know, so it was my turn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was doing it and it was going well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And then every now and then
the guy would just kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> call me up, 'cause I was
learning through a guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was how you mainly learn in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least the countryside in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was kinda flaky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He would kind of like, he
wouldn't show up sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then sometimes he would just stop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I'm about, I
wanna say two thirds away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from getting my test and he just calls up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and he is like, oh yeah,
by the way I've quit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just not doing anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not doing, I'm sorry
that I don't wanna do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instructing people, cause
the costs on the car </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> are too much and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> All right well, so I thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it can't be too hard
to find another one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> My mom just could not
find another instructor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they're all booked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause there's not many in my area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is during your
learning stage, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Normally like they get
booked up pretty quickly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause there's not that many, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause it's not very profitable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really like, doesn't make much money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's a lot of work </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's a lot of upkeep
on the car as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he did that and then I
couldn't find one for like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna say right up
until like three months </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before I was leaving for university. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I had to get back into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It'd been like a six, seven months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I couldn't find any one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Started doing it again and I
was kind of getting okay at it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was maybe like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna say like 10
lessons off doing the test. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd go to university and
then I just didn't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like I was busy having fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like, and you don't
need a car at university. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, I didn't have my license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it became something
that I was kind of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, don't really want
to do this anymore, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause it's kind of in the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really pain in the ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I have to start from zero again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and if I did do it, I thought,
oh I'll do one of those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, cause you can do
like weak intensive course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where you just drive for
like eight hours a day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you do your test
and hopefully you pass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Statistically they're
like the worst drivers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you're basically
speed running, driving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, you know, I'd gone through
all the uni, never did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And this point, like in the
UK you have to two things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a theory test and a practical test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Theory's really easy but
it only lasts two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> after you've done it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So mine had expired. So I
had to go and do it again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was in London and I
was like, oh fuck okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll go and get it, I'm
gonna actually learn a drive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I booked one of these courses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like really expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For like five days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And their like promise
was you will guaranteed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get your license by day five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And anyone who says guaranteed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> guaranteed to get a license
that's sus as fuck man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I started driving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I had this guy and who's Welsh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I was like, oh great he's Welsh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should be really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I can bribe him.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, he wasn't my,
he wasn't testing me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I was using his car </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're also allowed
to use that person's car </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the test and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, it was really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was nice, start you know,
he was like, oh you Welsh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good, good I like Welsh people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We're both in London, so it was
kind of like, oh nice, nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was really weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He would also take any opportunity
to insult women drivers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He was really weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm about to commit misogyny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every car just pass,
tits out for the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anything would happen
and he would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking woman driving it,
fucking woman driving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, it's a guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like (mumbling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, well fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really uncomfortable
at times you see things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And also he would sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause you were in the car for
like six hours, seven hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, you'd talk
about life in and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He'd bring up some things and
he'd bring up some of his, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> his views on the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That you'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (mumbling) Terrible
situation can't stand it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We're parking by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How long, where are we going? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - My dad as well, kind of
has like that weird like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he creates this like
stereotypes outta nowhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it comes to like driving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like every time I
remember there were moments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like my dad would be driving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my dad will say he doesn't have road rage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He absolutely have road rage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care what he says
because every time I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like every time he'd be on the road </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there'd just be like someone
who's like taking him off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever reason, he'd
be like, oh fucking move </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then he'd, you
know, get into the lane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looking dead and like do
the Luigi death stare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he'd be like,
oh, it's Volvo driver. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - All dads do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think every
Volvo driver is necessarily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a bad driver. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like BMW drivers, like
a massive dickheads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, well what is
your personal vinderian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> against Volvo.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember like the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the biggest stereotypes was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Asians are like bad drivers, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, I don't think
necessarily Asians are bad drivers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think Asians just drive by
the rules of their own country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is just like a fucking free for all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like I remember when
I first learned how to drive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't actually first
learn how to drive in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I believe like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, Garnt turns up
in the UK like crazy taxi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what happened is, so I
was like turning 17 that year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I could learn how to drive in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I believe in Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like you can like start
learning from like 16. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not sure if that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not sure the exact age, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I remember I could legally get lessons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to learn how to drive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was just like, right,
why don't I get head start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on learning how to drive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I start to drive in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I start learning to drive
in Thailand in Bangkok. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right.
- God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the Dark Souls
of driving. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the Dark Souls of driving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like I take a few lessons
there and I get, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get pretty confident
in driving, in Bangkok </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with Thailand rules, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you know, I can
competently handle the car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and definitely competently handle traffic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I remember I go back to UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I turn 17 and I sign
up for my first lesson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, so the instructor turns up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, we just
have a casual chat before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before we start driving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he asked me, have
you had like any experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or did you like use your
provision license or whatever? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've actually, like learned
how to drive in Thailand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I said this like with confidence, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I know how to drive a car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'd be breaking it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I know how to drive a car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've started to learn
how to drive in Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I've pretty
confident on Bangkok roads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's gonna be could you repeat that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so, you know, so I'm
pretty confident about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he was like, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So let's get this first
lesson started then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And so immediately I just
drive off and he goes stop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've immediately failed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I didn't check my mirrors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know they do this to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they just want you to do it, I understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But like that the guy had
right when I was doing this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, he couldn't just
say you did something wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> He had to be this whole
ordeal where he was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was a really good turn, for a bitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing)
It was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing could be every
single thing had to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> packaged with an insult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, that was really
good on the roundabout </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you wanted to kill someone.
- If you're a woman. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, you didn't check your
mirrors, like a woman. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He would do this all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so infuriating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I was just trying to get good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And every single time I'd
be like, how was this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, yeah, that was great, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you wanna kill someone Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, just tell me how it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - At least for you, it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> not checking your mirrors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like my uncle failed
his first driving test </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he was like, all
right get in the car, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> check all the mirrors, all
right, let's drive off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, stop you've immediately failed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You drove out the exit.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, oh all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he literally got in the
car, didn't even make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> out of the driveway and he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've instantly failed
come back tomorrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean you do it, don't they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah because like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I learned
how to drive in England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I basically had to relearn driving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like what I was taught in Thailand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause in Thailand, they
teach you like awareness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and control, like vehicle control. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But like in the UK, it's all
about here's the procedure, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Check mirror A, check mirror B. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Check your blind spots. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. Check your blind spots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get it, but like in Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like you must learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to become super sane ultra instincts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is how you drive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the best way to
take a hit from a car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If someone hits you on
the head, how you curl up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This how you take the least casually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Inflict, maximum damage on my ass hole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I did this five day thing right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Where we were going
through and I had this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was kind of a slog and I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really didn't like doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause the guy was like
not, he was not fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And also driving in London sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like going slow simulator
and stopping, waiting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> giving way to people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like just, it's not like driving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of the London like at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's completely different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm doing this and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not like driving
ends well, definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. We get to the fifth day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like so ready to like book the test? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, no. I was like, what you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, you're not ready yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not ready, I'm like, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like five days guarantee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like you're gonna
fail right now if you do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, oh, well what do we do then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, well, sits
back like he loves it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, yeah well you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could pay me in cash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'll give you some private lessons, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know and I was like, oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like is that okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, yeah it's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - According to me.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he was like, conveniently
like really expensive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was like well shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need him to say yes, so that I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they won't do it
without him saying yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you literally bribed him? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, he kind of blackmailed him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I've no choice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I can't do the
lesson without him agreeing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, oh and I was
like, well, when do we do it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I kind of wanna get
this over and done with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I gotta go do America in like a week, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to like get this done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was like, oh, well
are you free tomorrow? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, yeah, I'm free tomorrow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, all right well meet me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this car park tomorrow
and we'll do like three hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we'll see how you do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I pay him in an
extortion amount of money, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know and then we do the three hours, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like all right now you're ready. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, yeah I better have to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] of course you're ready now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, you probably just let me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drove around for the hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So isn't it legally a bribe or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So he finally does it and
the way that this works </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally in the UK, if you wanna test, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how it's in Australia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you have to wait like a month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I don't know how they do it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this company has like
an in with the government </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where basically like, if anyone cancels, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they get all those reservations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you basically have to just be ready. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they'll be like, are you
free tomorrow to do the test? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So that's what happened. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I said, I'm ready to get the test. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then like one day
later they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> come to this place at this time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the teacher will be there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, oh shit this
is fucking nerve wrecking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, we have to go to
like, for all of our tests, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to go to like
a government certified </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like road in Maritime, so this is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, we did, we did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to do it as well,
you have to do as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> D well thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I go to this building and it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the official government
building is above like a salon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's in this really
weird, like beat up room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just one room.
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like, there's like
seven other people in here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just turn off and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck, it's weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks like some government building, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like doesn't look, it's
just above like a salad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and chicken shop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I go in and they're
like, did you park the car? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So there's no car park
in this place either, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you park on the street. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, so I'm parked on a hill upwards. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so I'm on like a
brink before, like a- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're on manual, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah manual. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm parked on a hill
right before roundabout </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a really busy jewel carriageway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This is awful, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like nightmare fuel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is literally like the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'm bricking it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this guy can tell I'm freaking out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause this is a horrible start. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you let it roll back at all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like you fall down the hill, you fail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And normally like most
driving, like things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you might not even have to do this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you start from a hill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like shit, because my instructor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the decided to park here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is where I had to stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you know, I'm doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm nearly fucking,
I let go of the break </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just not moving,
I'm lucky maintaining it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I slowly start to
creep and then fucking lory </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just go (screaming) and like goes past me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm ah, like freaking out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like holding onto the
clutch like not letting it go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I don't wanna go and
I don't wanna fall down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like sweating and he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mate, calm down mate, what you doing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't worry about it and I'm
like, he's like prop London. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, yeah thanks
man I'm real calm now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Luckily I get going, it's really easy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you know and everything's going well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this guy looks like
he's falling asleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He's literally like this on the window. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I did a thing where I thought I failed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was freaking out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I thought I failed halfway through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I go through the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I passed, I did
like one minor mistake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was all I had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't know how. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because on the way to the
test, I ran a red light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did all things wrong and
everything went terribly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then yeah, weirdly at the end of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my instructor came with the
guy who was like really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He came over and he was
like, thought you failed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, why would you say that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like you know how I
knew, I thought you failed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, how? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, you know,
when the guy opens the door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before he gives the news,
it's only a bad sign. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, why would that be a bad sign? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why does that make any sense? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand, so he can run away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is he like tryna like psychoanalyze? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sound like a dick head as a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was such a dick bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got a really nice instructor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like a proud dad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, I knew you'd pass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the thing is the thing-
- My dad was my instructor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your dad was you instructor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because in Australia,
when you're on your learners, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't have to go to
lessons if you don't want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you don't have to in the UK either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like my parents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So my parents were like,
no, that's fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not gonna lessons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My dad's like, son I'll teach you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, dad, you are literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the most crazy fucking driver I've known. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because most
people, when they drive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't drive like
how they, 100% should. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, of course.
- My parents won't teach me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're probably not doing
something's right ourselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, dad, we're
in an eighties zone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm doing a hundred is this okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, and he was like, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, no, everyone else is doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They can't arrest all of us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing)
- [Connor] That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true, that's fair enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can I do this in the test? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, don't do it in the
test, but you'll be right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Driving is way more fun
when you've passed your test. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay I can kind of like relax. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, oh, this
is like, what is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> driving stress less.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually remember the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like in the seat of a car actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So in the driver's seat
of a car was actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was about like,
I think like 12 or 13. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, I remember like there was one day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I think there was
like a friend of a cousin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who was just like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like very rich. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he's they like, their family
owned like a lot of land. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so on some of this land
that they owned, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They let their kid drive around a car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like a beaten up car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a beaten up car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember going to this place once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like driving on his field. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, dude, this is badass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, you wanna go? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wanna go? And I was like me, me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 12 Years old driving a car. Am I allowed? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you even see out the front? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Am I allowed to do that?
Am I allowed to do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, yeah, it's
private land it's legal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like-
- 12 year old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> knew the concept of
private land and legal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, of course Article 1349. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's what his dad told him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I'm like I go in the driver's seat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I saw like fucking shitting myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm just like I'm in a fucking car. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Old choice, like a 12 year old driver. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - As a 12 year old in the seat of a car, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't matter if
you're like driving a Jeep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or a mini, it's like operating a goundou. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is terrifying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So I remember the first
fucking thing I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was just like, oh,
just tap the pedal a bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> As a 12 year old, I dunno
what tapped means, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I'm just like, I
go, what I think, is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought tapping, it was
going 50% of the weight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You do, you do, you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'm like, okay,
I'm going to tap this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna put it all
the way, just half the way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like immediately
- Wheels start spinning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I put it half the weight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I immediately crash into
his gates, right.(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Luckily it's like an old wooden gate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like in the middle
of fucked up nowhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately I smashed
into this gate, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I start freaking out and he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right get outta driver's seat. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Never again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, I think
that put me off driving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like for like, well obviously I was scared </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of the concept of driving
from that one experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I remember that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the first time I
ever got into the car seat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was probably around that
age as well, like 12, 13. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When we went camping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you're in a camping field, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not a lot of like, and
especially when you're in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> big camping field and
there's no one else there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just a lot of like
really empty, flat land. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So my dad was like, son, you
wanna take it for a spin? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, sure dad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I get in the seat
and in my head I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, this is gonna be easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's literally nothing
around except one tree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt And Connor] No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like any, any person will tell you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, just don't go towards the tree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just go to this entire open
area where there is nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And in my head I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just don't go over to the tree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do I do immediately
go towards the tree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did your dad not like pull the wheel? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, he did.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was like, son. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you hit it?
- No, I didn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God, dude. I wouldn't
be alive if I hit the tree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think my dad would kill me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, my dad would have
hundred percent killed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like I don't know what it was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like in my stupid 12 year old head, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the entire time I was like,
don't go towards the tree, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't go towards the tree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> My hands are like, go towards trees, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a homing missile. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like target locked on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually flipped my
friend's quad bike over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh my that's dangerous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that was dangerous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were riding quad bikes in like the mud. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, this is
the coolest fucking thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, you know, I was like 12 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he was like
don't go too fast though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like a danger kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I would just like, love going
too fast and shit like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think they also call
that an idiot. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I should won a Darwin award back day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I'm like fucking
this fucking quad bike. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I start doing like donuts
with this quad bike </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then yeah, it just flips over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I flip in it, but
I'm so small that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I like get down in the arch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, when I fall to the
side, like don't hit my head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or anything, just fall over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause, like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think like quad bike
accidents, like deaths, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> are very common. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it wasn't like super fast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just me being stupid and turning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but fault I just fell off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Dumb, dumb, dangerous, dangerous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Don't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't flip quad bikes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like, I remember like, I never, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I knew one person in my school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who owned like a quad bike </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like the
fucking cool kid, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you have like farms, everyone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of people had them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean like the only reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this guy had a quad bike
or this kid had a quad bike </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because his dad had
won the lottery, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So he was like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughing) why is it
when you get too rich </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you buy a quad bike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no practical use
for a quad bike, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just to have, isn't it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you have too much
land, you get a quad bike, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you can get around the land. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So he was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was the cool kid because he was the kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that owned a quad bike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, it was like the kid that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like you'd want to be friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you'd knew like you'd made it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when he'd invite you around his house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like, you'd hear
stories about how people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> went to this kid's house and
like I went on a quad bike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's either that one
kid that owns a quad bike </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or that one kid whose dad
works in an IT company </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and owns every game console ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone had that one friend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - My friend was both. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh really? Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - His dad was a farmer, so
he had all the quad bike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he also had all the game consoles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I always used to love going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause he had Pokemon
call on the game cube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, this is insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You can, the Pokemon are
like three. What, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we'd have a day of like quad biking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then his mom would make amazing food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I'd to play on soon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah and so I just like never
wanted to leave his house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And luckily like I
slept over to his house, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many god damn times and I
loved staying at his house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had that one friend
too. That was like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was amazing, we had so much fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I loved going to his house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was like the best child of memories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Except when I nearly died on
that quad back, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That was my own fault. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That was my own fault.
- That's fair enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But quad bikes are fun though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There was really, they're so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're pretty easy to drive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have I been on one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think I have been on one actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a stable bike. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Until it flips over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like we used to go to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I was saying
about like the kayaking thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was another place that
was kind of a similar thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had like swimming pool and all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it also had quad bikes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That you were allowed to ride, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but they put like safety
pins or something in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That limited the speed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you couldn't go above a certain speed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was painfully slow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And one of the kids
who owned the quad bike </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knew how to remove it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we were all doing laps, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Going really slow on these bikes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly is this one kid's turn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the teachers like
looked away for a second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they go back, this kid's going like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking tearing up all the like dirt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flinging it at all the teachers and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like absolutely tearing up the track </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they couldn't stop him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause he's going too fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you couldn't like get in the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And so he is going super fast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get to the ball king of his life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was so funny just watching him like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> destroy this like gland
that had been finally made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like tearing up the mud and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Destroy it all.
- So funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you guys have any experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with motorbikes or anything like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. I wish I'd love
to drive a motorbike. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been on the back
of a motorbike many times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna learn how to ride one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've thought about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But then I've also heard
of every single person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever known who
used to ride a motorbike </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it's all past tense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They used to ride a motorbike </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because most of the time they
get in horrible accidents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanna ride one. I just
wanna know how to drive one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if I'm like, I just need
to ride a motorcycle one day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was tempted to get like in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like getting like a motorbike license. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because apparently you can
get it in like one day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like super easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just have to do like a test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you pay like 60 bucks or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey and Connor] 60, 60, 60, 60. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You pay like 60 bucks for a test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you can just get it
in like a couple of hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They just have to buy a motorbike. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you like James Bond, chase, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you need to drive a motorcycle. you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna drive a moped.
(indistinct chattering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Stop you immediately like
Joey where you going man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like if you go to Thailand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you are probably going to
have to ride a motorcycle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And when I say motorcycle,
it's not like a Harley Davidson </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the Southeast Asian like
kind of like Moped motorcycles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like,
- [Joey] like a scooter right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a scooter. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought motocross is
really cool as well right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah like that kind of bike, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, but like I've been
on enough fucking crazy ass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking Moped motorbike taxi drivers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is just put me off
from ever wanting to learn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a motorbike. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And like the one time
that I tried learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to ride a motorbike,
which was one of these bikes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mind you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, of course
it was in Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I remember like,
if you want to get around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but not want to own a car, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you'd learn to drive a motorcycle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the cheap way to go about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, that's why in top gear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and the Vietnam special,
they didn't have cars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They had motorbikes, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they get stolen a lot?
- Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they get stolen a lot? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I assume I've never owned
one. So I would assume so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like I remember like the only time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've tried to learn how to ride one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had like enough scary
experience with motorbikes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've just never wanted
to learn how to ride one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember when my dad was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> come on, son you gotta
learn how to drive one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come on we're in Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You gotta learn how to
drive one eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember he like
builds this ideal up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my entire family, like build this idea up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of me having to like,
at least give it a try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of how to learn, how to ride a motorbike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember this one
time I was like, okay, fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give it a try, I'll give it a try. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like riding a bike, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like riding a bike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like a one for one recreation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of like my car experience, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I remember my
dad after building up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all this courage, we have
like my cousin's motor bike </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I could try out and
just start learning with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And my dad like brings me over to the bike </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and goes, okay, just
sit on this bike, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And what you need to do. Just try- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your dad like give you
that much confidence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like stuck you on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He stuck me on it and he's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just twisted a bit, just twist it a bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just give it a bit of a rev </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and me like a one for one thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit of a twist is 50%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt, you can't like do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can only do like 50%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so 50% means 180 degrees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I go like, okay,
I'll give a little twist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 50% power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that immediately rev forward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I immediately fall down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, the motorbike falls down on me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, alright, no, I'm
never getting on one again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just reminded of all those videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like where they, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Where they like rev the motorbikes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then motorbike comes over them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, I really wanna learn, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, like a lot
of dangerous vehicles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd love to learn how to drive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wanna learn how
to drive a speedboat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why, I've
never even been in a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like a speedboat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been in a speedboat
and it's terrifying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanna learn how to
drive one, that look so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because in Australia
or at least in Sydney, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we used to have like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we had like a fairy service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we were like in a bay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you'd also get,
what's called a water cat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> which is basically think of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a taxi.
- I think I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a water taxi, but
it's instead of a taxi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's speedboat.
- I think I know the one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you get on boat, dude
those things are fucking scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They look so fun.
- They're so fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I wanna ride a jet ski. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never rid jet ski in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna ride a jet ski.
I've heard jet skis are fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like the
college fra boy ass hole. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wanna ride one. It looks so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's do it in Thailand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's very, very easy to
get jet skis in Thailand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember I sure a sheet that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like accidents
by race or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like 100% of accident,
like some part of the U.S </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was like all white people or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was for jet ski. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 100% of jet ski accidents
for white people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, yeah, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That checks out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the second was
like skiing or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What's third golf? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've always wanted to try surfing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Surfing was one thing
I've always wanted to try. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've done surfing and-
- It seems hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course you're Australian, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought I would enjoy
it, but I weirdly didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It seems really hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really, really hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not even so much about like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, it's not like snowboarding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like the biggest
obstacle is your being scared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just like go fast or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the act of standing
up from a really like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rickety, like where the
floor isn't still right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you do that a couple of times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can't even like, get on your knees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you fucking fall over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just snap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, fuck it. I can't do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like the one time you
can actually like stand up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's actually pretty easy to control. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because just think of it
like snowboarding board </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with less friction. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's pretty easy to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the standing up part, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like fucking impossible for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then when you flip
in a surfboard, it hurts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah I can imagine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because the one I'm
always afraid of is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> what if I flip off and then
the board just smacks on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I've seen that happen to people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it looks like it really fucking hurts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Seeing them ride that wave
is just so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really wanna do it again
I've never had the opportunity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never had the opportunity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, cause we live in the England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where are we gonna find waves? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could go to Corn Wall I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The waves there are way too powerful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that was the problem as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we did it for PE at one time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because our school was right- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] That's the most
Australian thing I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh because our schooling-
- [Garnt] Surfing for PE. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause our school is
literally next to a beach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we just like walk down
five minutes down the hill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, yeah,
there's a beach right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can go surf.
- [Connor] Of course there is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but it was scary
dude for a different reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so cool, man. I
wish I could, I wish I could. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lots, of first we wanna
try, you wanna try golf? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You wanna try sailing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Surfing.
- Surfing and sailing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna try quad biking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna try them all actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I wanna try them all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we just have like
a sports festival day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for Trash Taste? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanna try to like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get all these things in one place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna try more
like extreme sports. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You tried skiing now you got
taste for the extreme, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I got a taste of
adrenaline you know that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Staff] Bungee jumping.
- Bungee jumping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm still waiting for Chris. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know who else
likes extreme sports? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Our patrons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Of course.
- [Connor] Really, do they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're just so daring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They dared enough to support the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is the most extreme sport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - To support a podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Supporting the boys.
- Getting your wallet out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Getting your wallet out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the hardest sport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thinking, yeah these
guys are worth my money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the most extreme sport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We do appreciate. We do appreciate. </SPEAKER_01>

like era has just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> made people want to just like try sport </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least for me anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah cause I think one
of the biggest things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about trying new sport is just getting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like getting the motivation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just go out of your comfort zone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just try out a new sport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It definitely helps when you have a like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> your mates around and be
like, yeah, I'll try with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I dunno if I could
do snowboarding by myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I just feel like,
- Yeah, it's hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a sad image of just like one person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just sitting in the fucking
thing going up, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, oh.
(all laughing and humming) </SPEAKER_05>
