<joey> - I really want you guys to smell the arm </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not smelling your fingers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Please, - No </garnt>
<joey> - Get that shit away from me! </joey>
<garnt> (exhales loudly) </garnt>
<joey> - Put his nose in it. </joey>
<joey> (groans) </joey>
<joey> (soft music) </joey>
<joey> What's up you salty salmon slices. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode of the Trash Taste Podcast. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm sorry, what? - What was that? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah you heard me right. - Where did you </joey>
<garnt> come up with that? </garnt>
<garnt> That's gonna be every time I host an episode </garnt>
<garnt> that's going to be my thing. </garnt>
<garnt> That's going to be the new intro. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a thing now? </garnt>
<garnt> - Shut though, man we didn't discuss this before hand. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I was thinking of that shift for like two weeks. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck? - I'm like this is gonna slap. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the best you came up with in two weeks? </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey man give me some time well I'm working on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. - Well, welcome </garnt>
<garnt> to the trash taste podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> The show where we talk trash about our tastes anatomy. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today, Joey </garnt>
<garnt> and joined as always is Garnt and Connor dope. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yo. </garnt>
<garnt> - So this episode is I guess the first special episode </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Speed off episode. </joey>
<joey> I mean if you're being linked from our main channel videos, </joey>
<garnt> hello, welcome to the podcast. - Welcome. </garnt>
<garnt> - But if you haven't seen our main channel videos </garnt>
<garnt> do we wanna explain what we did? </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey go on. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, Sure. </joey>
<joey> So basically on our main channel </joey>
<joey> we decided to do like a little fun challenge </joey>
<garnt> where as you can see </garnt>
<joey> our backdrop is a little bit burnt. </joey>
<garnt> - This is a big table </garnt>
<joey> that has a lot of potential space </joey>
<joey> to be filled out with some Weeby shit. </joey>
<joey> So what we decided to do is we decided to venture out </joey>
<joey> into the weebland itself, Akihabara in Tokyo </joey>
<joey> which is like known as like heaven for tacos essentially. </joey>
<connor> - Yes it is. I can confirm. </connor>
<connor> - And we decided to challenge ourselves to see </connor>
<connor> how many figurines or I guess anime merch </connor>
<connor> we can buy with a $500 budget </connor>
<garnt> or about 50,000 Yen if you convert it to Yen. </garnt>
<garnt> And just instead of just going out and making it </garnt>
<garnt> like a vlog kind of thing, </garnt>
<garnt> we decided to turn it into a challenge </garnt>
<garnt> where we fight each other for brets. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's make it fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's make it challenging </garnt>
<joey> and let's make, let's put some stakes on this bitch. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Let's make in a relaxing experience </joey>
<joey> with shopping into stressful hell </joey>
<joey> where you buy shit. </joey>
<joey> You don't want to meet a dumb set of criteria. </joey>
<joey> Would you like to speak-- </joey>
<joey> - Out of the money in our pocket. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) - Yeah, exactly right. </garnt>
<joey> - So essentially we gave ourselves a number of challenges. </joey>
<joey> We had some small challenges that we did </joey>
<joey> in the four enemy stores that we went to </joey>
<connor> in our main channel videos. </connor>
<connor> Again, if you want to check it out, go check it out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah you miss a lot of context </connor>
<joey> if you don't watch that video. </joey>
<joey> But if you haven't seen it </joey>
<connor> and you refuse to for some reason, </connor>
<connor> you'll still be fine to watch this podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So basically we all have scores already </garnt>
<garnt> from challenges that we went to, </garnt>
<garnt> that we did in each store </garnt>
<garnt> which is probably on screen right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - You'd know that </garnt>
<garnt> if you've watched our videos </garnt>
<garnt> but here are all our scores. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. All right it's not the final score </joey>
<joey> like any good Mario party game, right? </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter how many stars you end up with. </joey>
<joey> It's all about the final count. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right. </joey>
<joey> - It's all about the bonus stars </joey>
<joey> and this episode is essentially </joey>
<joey> where we go over the bonus stars </joey>
<garnt> as well as show each other what we got </garnt>
<garnt> because right now we don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck each other got. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - We maybe got like a few glimpses </garnt>
<connor> as we like passed each other passive aggressively </connor>
<connor> in each of the stores. </connor>
<garnt> But right now we have no idea what the other person bought. </garnt>
<garnt> So that's what we're going to find out today. </garnt>
<joey> So we have a bunch of overarching challenges, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yes. So we have some that are like pretty obvious </garnt>
<garnt> like who spent the most on a single figurine. </garnt>
<connor> What was else, </connor>
<connor> who bought a figure from the most popular series, </connor>
<connor> which you lose a point if that's the case. </connor>
<connor> - Normy award. </connor>
<joey> - We'll go over every challenge at the end </joey>
<joey> after we've finished showing everyone what we've bought. </joey>
<garnt> But for now I just wanted to ask you guys, </garnt>
<garnt> we just filmed it yesterday. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did you guys find the experience? </garnt>
<joey> I mean, I found it super fun. </joey>
<garnt> That came out like I haven't started editing the video yet </garnt>
<joey> as I'm recording this episode, </joey>
<connor> but I can already tell that video </connor>
<joey> is going to be so fucking fun to watch. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like it's just fun. </connor>
<joey> Like that's like the, any way to, </joey>
<joey> you can see them having fun in it. </joey>
<joey> Cause it was just, I mean, </joey>
<joey> it's like a kid in a candy store, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Essentially. </joey>
<joey> - Like we always go to these stores. </joey>
<joey> - It's a very expensive candy store. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> - we always go to these stores </joey>
<garnt> and being able to like film in there, with permission. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, we want to do that professionally as well. </garnt>
<connor> We didn't Lo gang pull this shit, if you know what I mean. </connor>
<joey> - We got permission because we respek the country. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. We, we got all permission from the stores </connor>
<joey> and it's just great </joey>
<joey> because you kind of just got to let loose in the store. </joey>
<joey> I mean, some of the stores that have people in there </joey>
<joey> so I was still trying to be respectful, </joey>
<joey> but you know, like Animate, </joey>
<joey> there was no one else in that store. </joey>
<joey> - No. - Just us. </joey>
<joey> - We, we got in like before the store even opened so. </joey>
<joey> - When we left the store </joey>
<connor> there was like a massive queue. </connor>
<garnt> - Of people trying to get in. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like, Oh, I feel kind of bad right now. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Felt so bad. </joey>
<joey> - Then we just come out just like </joey>
<joey> with all our crap and just being like </joey>
<joey> you guys have to lay on </joey>
<joey> (laughs) - Look at these peasants. </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah, like a lot of the stores </garnt>
<garnt> were like very happy to have us. </garnt>
<joey> I mean like Amiami made us like sign that like little thing </joey>
<joey> in that photo. - Yeah, it was crazy. </joey>
<garnt> - If you ever go to Amiami in Akihabara </garnt>
<garnt> look out for our little plaque. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. We have a trash tastes like plaque. </joey>
<connor> - Oh do you think they going to hang that up? </connor>
<joey> Is that what the (laughs). </joey>
<connor> - I assume so. - Yeah they should. </connor>
<connor> I really hope so. </connor>
<connor> But like no, but all of the stores were super freaking cool. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. - They were very supportive. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's first of all, big shout out </garnt>
<garnt> to all the stores that did give us permission to film there. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, without further ado, </garnt>
<garnt> I think we should go over what we bought </garnt>
<garnt> in each store and judge our, </garnt>
<garnt> as the name suggest, Trash Taste on figurines </garnt>
<connor> and other anime merch. </connor>
<garnt> - So let's just </garnt>
<joey> jump right into it. - Wait, </joey>
<connor> before we jump right into it. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I wanna jump right into it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't wait to jump right into it. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) - Oh my God </garnt>
<joey> let's just hold off on the jumping for a second. </joey>
<joey> I want to discuss, </joey>
<joey> so did you guys have any strategy, </joey>
<garnt> going into this game or into this challenge even? </garnt>
<garnt> - I said I did in my main channel video </garnt>
<garnt> but in retrospect I didn't. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - If I win, it was all a plan. </connor>
<garnt> If I loose, I was just having a fun time with the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I think that's... </garnt>
<joey> Okay to be 100% honest, I like had some idea </joey>
<joey> but I think it, </joey>
<joey> my strategy was just see what you guys are doing. </joey>
<joey> So if you guys are trying to go off all the challenges </joey>
<joey> and I could see you guys with paying attention, </joey>
<connor> like, okay I was going to, but if I knew that... </connor>
<connor> because I could tell some of you, you know, </connor>
<connor> weren't paying as much attention </connor>
<joey> to the challenges as others. </joey>
<joey> I was just saying. - The only challenge </joey>
<joey> that I paid in mind to </joey>
<connor> was only one that I remembered, </connor>
<joey> which was the whoever gets closest to $500. </joey>
<connor> - Which is worth two points. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah which is like two points. </connor>
<connor> I'm like I have to prioritize that </connor>
<joey> because that two points is big. </joey>
<joey> - Two points is big but, </joey>
<joey> like I remember, because I couldn't even remember </joey>
<joey> all the challenges we agreed on. </joey>
<joey> So I went to into the day being like, </joey>
<joey> okay, this one's an obvious challenge. </joey>
<connor> This one's an obvious challenge. </connor>
<connor> As I went into more stores, </connor>
<connor> I was like, I am not keeping track at all. </connor>
<connor> - I am running out of money. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what's happening. </connor>
<connor> - When I was in Animate, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, okay, I'm going to do this in this store. </connor>
<garnt> I'm going to do this and that store. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I hit the second store. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, what the fuck am I doing? </garnt>
<joey> I have-- </joey>
<joey> - I was so short-sided on like the challenges </joey>
<connor> that I had to do in that store. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - And then I was just like </connor>
<joey> fuck the other challenge. </joey>
<joey> I need to get this. </joey>
<joey> - So to put it in perspective, </joey>
<joey> we've got two challenges for every store </joey>
<joey> as you probably saw in the video. </joey>
<joey> So which is a total of eight points that we could get. </joey>
<joey> There's 11 points up for grabs </joey>
<garnt> in the overarching challenges. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yes. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I mean, if you do really well </garnt>
<connor> on the overarching challenges </connor>
<joey> it might not fucking matter. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. Like we're all already close </joey>
<garnt> from what we've already seen. </garnt>
<garnt> We're like maybe one or two points-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Eight, seven, six. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. So really close. - So that's </garnt>
<garnt> a two point discrepancy. - So right now </garnt>
<garnt> I might be losing </garnt>
<connor> but like any good Mario party game, </connor>
<connor> I can always come back right at the end. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - So, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Should we just jump right into it? </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh heartedly) </garnt>
<connor> - Let's jump right into it! </connor>
<connor> - So we start with Amiami, </connor>
<connor> oh no sorry, Animate first? </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] We start with Animate. </joey>
<joey> - Animate! </joey>
<joey> - I didn't buy much in this store. </joey>
<connor> It was the first one </connor>
<connor> I didn't want to pull the trigger yet. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. So here's the thing about Animate. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't know how much I should buy. </connor>
<connor> - We're just revealing right now </connor>
<connor> or what do we do? </connor>
<joey> I mean, who wants to go first? </joey>
<connor> I mean, okay. </connor>
<connor> Oh. Shit. Can I go first? </connor>
<connor> - You're the host. - Okay, I'll go first </connor>
<connor> because I only bought one thing at Animate. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] All right, same. </connor>
<joey> So one of my challenges was </joey>
<connor> to get a Made in Abyss Figurine. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Couldn't find it. Not just at Animate. </connor>
<connor> Any of the stores, I couldn't find it. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> So I just lost a point for that one. </joey>
<joey> But I figured, you know, what? </joey>
<joey> I'll get something like kind of cool and kind of niche. </joey>
<garnt> So I got a Chaiki Moto from Dororo. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh damn! - Oh wow, I didn't even know </garnt>
<garnt> they made for this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - I know. </garnt>
<joey> It's a ninderoid of a Chaiki Moto . </joey>
<joey> And I mean, Dororo was so fucking awesome. </joey>
<joey> Like I love Maimai Kamisama stuff, </joey>
<joey> and I love Dororo . </joey>
<connor> I was like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I like my ninderoids too so. </connor>
<connor> - You know what, not bad. </connor>
<connor> - It's really, really cute. </connor>
<joey> I mean, we'll probably figure out the pose of it somehow </joey>
<connor> - But it's the stressful thing about ninderoids. </connor>
<joey> So you just have to pick one pose </joey>
<joey> and that's... (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> We all know it's never going </joey>
<connor> to change from this pose. </connor>
<connor> - They're also so finicky as well </connor>
<joey> but once you've nailed it, </joey>
<garnt> you're like hell yeah. - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that's the only thing I got at Animate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, yeah, I got a few things at Animate. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had two challenges, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I think I got fucked </garnt>
<joey> over some of the overarching challenges </joey>
<joey> by just Animate itself. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - So let's go ahead. </joey>
<joey> So the first thing, the first challenge </joey>
<joey> was to buy a Deku figure from My Hero Academia. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So as we all know </joey>
<joey> one of the overarching challenges </joey>
<joey> was the person who buys a figure from the most </joey>
<joey> popular series gets deducted points. </joey>
<joey> So there's my deku figure. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> I was actually getting a bit worried, right? </connor>
<connor> Because there weren't many like figures </connor>
<connor> in Animate. - No, there wasn't. </connor>
<joey> Animate was more like general merch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was really varied in-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah so the only thing I could find on ninderoids. </joey>
<joey> And so my second challenge </joey>
<garnt> was to ask a store clerk, in Japanese, </garnt>
<joey> to recommend me a figure. - Figure oh sumi. </joey>
<connor> Okay, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You had to pull a sumi masen. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, what did he recommend you? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, he recommended to me Edward Elric </joey>
<garnt> from Fullmetal Alchemist. - No! </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You've totally lost it. - You've totally lost. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, whoa! Oh my God you've, </garnt>
<garnt> one, you recommend to me </garnt>
<garnt> the figure from the one series </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't seen yet, fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing heartedly) </garnt>
<garnt> - You haven't seen it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. - That's so fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - And two, you've just made me all to lose a point </garnt>
<joey> by recommending to me, I checked before, </joey>
<garnt> for the fourth, most popular anime series on mal! </garnt>
<connor> So thank you for making </connor>
<garnt> me lose the point. - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, because I see the price there. </joey>
<joey> That's 48 bucks, right? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How much did you spend on these two? </joey>
<joey> Are they both 48 bucks? </joey>
<joey> - This one says 48,88. </joey>
<joey> And this one says-- </joey>
<garnt> - That was like about 52 bucks. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, this one will be a little bit more expensive. </joey>
<connor> - You got done dirty by that man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah (laughs). </garnt>
<garnt> In the video, I was like, </garnt>
<connor> oh thank you very much for recommending to me. </connor>
<connor> And inside I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> I can't believe you've done this. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I bought one more thing, </joey>
<joey> which cracked me up, </joey>
<joey> which is an Ishtar plushie. </joey>
<garnt> It's far Ishtar. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It's kind of cute. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's kinda cute I like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, from Fate? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah from Fate. - Oh. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, what the Fuck. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> That's kinda cute. - I think that's a, </garnt>
<joey> what is it? It's called tsum. </joey>
<joey> It's like a, it's like a giant tsum tsum, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's the thing that's over here. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. That's so cute though. </joey>
<joey> - That is very cute. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's gonna look sick. </joey>
<joey> - So how much would you spend on Animate overall? </joey>
<garnt> - $120. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor exhales) - Jesus. I only spent-- </joey>
<joey> - Wait this is 30 bucks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I only spent 48. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I also spent 48 bucks </connor>
<joey> on my red Cell fan. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I was looking at that one. </garnt>
<connor> - So my two challenges were </connor>
<connor> get a female figure </connor>
<connor> and get one from a show that you watched recently. </connor>
<connor> And I watched like a few episodes, like two months ago, so. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Why didn't you get the Nezuko figure? </garnt>
<connor> I saw you eyeing the Nezuko and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> motherfucker, if I-- </connor>
<garnt> - He doesn't wanna lose the point. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I didn't wanna get the Normy award </garnt>
<connor> And I knew that demon slayers are the most normal. </connor>
<connor> Whatever the ranking say, </connor>
<connor> I would've lost the Normy award at heart. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And plus you know, I don't want to risk it. </joey>
<joey> And also I thought, you know, it's kind of a cool figure, </joey>
<joey> you know. - Yeah, it is. </joey>
<joey> If we have Nezuko </joey>
<garnt> it makes us look like fake anime fans. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just saying like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah, get the fuck out, man. </garnt>
<connor> Nezuko </connor>
<joey> is best Imouto of last year. - Whatever! Okay! </joey>
<garnt> I think Garnt has like fulfilled the prophecy </garnt>
<joey> with these two. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Literally the boomer of AniTube here. </connor>
<connor> Tell me about why Nezuko is, you know, best-- </connor>
<garnt> - I've gone like how many episodes </garnt>
<joey> and I've not talked about Iumoto here. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. - And you are taking </joey>
<garnt> this chance away from me. - Just give us some time. </garnt>
<connor> You know, Garnt's going to get there. </connor>
<joey> - I was thinking we'd just put it in the front for now. </joey>
<joey> We'll just gather them in the front for now. </joey>
<joey> - (laughing) I was very grounded. </joey>
<connor> - I, okay for the record, I hate ninderoids. </connor>
<connor> I think ninderoids are like stressful purchases. </connor>
<connor> - I love ninderoids. - and we have four </connor>
<connor> goddamn ninderoids. </connor>
<connor> Because you have to pose them, right? </connor>
<joey> And, and the whole selling point of a ninderoid, </joey>
<joey> I'm putting everybody sponsored by ninderoid ever. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> The whole selling point </joey>
<joey> of a ninderoid is that you can move it. </joey>
<joey> But tell me, everyone who wants a ninderoid, </joey>
<joey> when have you changed the pose of a ninderoid? </joey>
<joey> - I've changed it a few times. </joey>
<joey> - That's a lie. </joey>
<joey> It's a fucking lie. - I've never changed it. </joey>
<connor> - Yes, he's lying. </connor>
<joey> - I've changed it because I'm sponsored by those guys. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Thanks guys. </connor>
<connor> - It is stressful. </connor>
<connor> And then you've got to worry about the box </connor>
<connor> and the little things, and I just. </connor>
<connor> - I sometimes like, where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I look at the little parts and I'm like </connor>
<joey> I want to change it eventually. </joey>
<joey> And then I do. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, okay, I'm glad I kept watch. </joey>
<garnt> - Actually, before we go on, </garnt>
<garnt> question to you guys, </garnt>
<joey> what do you do with a figure box? </joey>
<joey> Do you bin it or do you keep it? </joey>
<joey> - I store it. </joey>
<garnt> - Shit man, I ripped that shit over. </garnt>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<connor> Even after living in Japan </connor>
<connor> where the box is like half the value. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Because yeah, the mentality for me is like </joey>
<joey> if I eventually like possibly get like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> I lose interest-- </garnt>
<connor> - I'm gonna sell this figure. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No Fuck off, you're not going to sell the figure. </connor>
<connor> - That's me, I tried. </connor>
<garnt> - Like this guy. I'm like maybe I can sell this JoJo merch. </garnt>
<joey> You don't know, fuck! </joey>
<joey> You'll never gonna sell that JoJo merch. </joey>
<garnt> - All right, but here's the other thing I do, right? </garnt>
<garnt> What helped me at my last place </garnt>
<connor> is that it makes moving house so much easier </connor>
<connor> if you keep the box. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, it's true. </joey>
<joey> - Because you'd like, I usually, </joey>
<connor> what I do at least with figurines, right? </connor>
<connor> Is like, I throw out like the plastic like mould, </connor>
<connor> but I keep the box. - Yeah, I don't even do that. </connor>
<joey> - I throw the plastic mould. - It just takes up </joey>
<garnt> so much space. </garnt>
<joey> - But the thing is, if you chuck out the plastic mould </joey>
<connor> and you flatten the box, </connor>
<connor> then when you like move house </connor>
<connor> you can just open the box up again </connor>
<connor> glad wrap it in, </connor>
<connor> and then boom. - I'm just too lazy for that. </connor>
<joey> I just put it in the cupboard. - You save so much time </joey>
<joey> and money and like possibly </joey>
<joey> like the risk of like ruining a figurine when you move. </joey>
<joey> And like that saved me so much trouble </joey>
<joey> when I moved to my current house. </joey>
<joey> So that's why I hold onto it. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right. - Okay. </joey>
<joey> I said it's for repurposing. </joey>
<connor> It's like, it's not. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Solid purchases there overall. </joey>
<joey> I think just makes a good taste. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think, they're gonna look great. </garnt>
<joey> - The next store-- </joey>
<garnt> - My favorite anime, Fullmetal Alchemist. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I recommend you guys, watch that. </joey>
<joey> - Your favorite character from your favorite anime. </joey>
<garnt> (heartedly laughing) - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the next store we went to was Astop. </garnt>
<garnt> - I spent so much money here. </garnt>
<joey> - Actually, okay. what were you... </joey>
<joey> Before we get to Astop, </joey>
<garnt> what was you guys' strategy with Astop? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. Astop is probably the store </joey>
<garnt> that I go to the most just casually. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think for all of us it's the same </garnt>
<joey> So I knew I really had to spend time </joey>
<joey> just like looking around. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because there were so many figurines at Astop </joey>
<joey> that I legitimately have never seen anywhere else. </joey>
<joey> Even though they're technically secondhand. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I'm like, okay, I'm going to aim for those. </garnt>
<joey> And I think I got pretty decent solution. </joey>
<joey> - Because for me, Astop was the most daunting shop, right? </joey>
<joey> Because, okay, so in my challenge </joey>
<joey> I had to squat 10 times </joey>
<connor> before entering the store. - That's not a challenge. </connor>
<joey> - That was easy to do. </joey>
<joey> And my second challenge was an auto lose </joey>
<joey> beacause I had to buy the most expensive figure </joey>
<joey> which we found out was like 1,000 bucks. </joey>
<joey> So I knew I was going to lose that. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, I was going into Astop </joey>
<joey> just not trying to complete any challenge </joey>
<garnt> but just trying to like buy figures that I like. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's not a certain. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Follow your heart. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I kind of went fucking mental in Astop. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I filled up my piece of paper. </connor>
<garnt> - No! Are you serious? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yes, same here. </connor>
<garnt> Okay. So like, because like with Astop </garnt>
<joey> there are so many figures </joey>
<joey> and so many display cases </joey>
<joey> that you don't remember </joey>
<joey> which figure you saw where. </joey>
<joey> So my strategy was just </joey>
<joey> if I see a figure I like </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna write it down </joey>
<joey> and maybe I'll cross it out later. </joey>
<joey> I fucked myself over so much in there </joey>
<garnt> because I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember seeing you like halfway through. </garnt>
<garnt> And I filled up my entire sheet </garnt>
<joey> and you didn't even have a piece of paper. </joey>
<joey> - I was still looking for like stuff. </joey>
<joey> - So I was just going, okay, </joey>
<joey> that one, okay write it down, write that. </joey>
<joey> And then I got to the end </joey>
<garnt> and then I couldn't remember which figure was which. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> So I was trying-- - Yes, I heard that. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, is it this one? </garnt>
<connor> I think, it is maybe that one. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So it was like basically trying to choose </garnt>
<connor> between my children. </connor>
<garnt> So I'm like, what the fuck am I crossing out right now? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I have no fucking clue. </garnt>
<joey> - Wow. Okay, because yeah, like for me, like Astop </joey>
<connor> I knew if I wasn't careful at Astop </connor>
<joey> I was going to go absolutely ham </joey>
<joey> as I usually do just like casually. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, okay, there are still two stores left. </joey>
<joey> We're not even halfway through this challenge </joey>
<garnt> so I have to like limit myself </garnt>
<garnt> as much as possible at Astop. </garnt>
<garnt> So I only bought three things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - At Astop. How many did you get? </joey>
<garnt> - I can't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> Like five, six. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, you'll see. </connor>
<joey> Do you want to go first then? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'll go first. </joey>
<joey> - And then me and you can take in turns </joey>
<connor> showing one off each. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I decided to like kind of go for like smallest ones. </joey>
<joey> So my two challenges was the first one was really easy. </joey>
<connor> I had to go up to the store clerk </connor>
<connor> and ask if they had Boku No Pico merch </connor>
<connor> which they said they didn't. </connor>
<connor> Thank God. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Did they know what it was. </connor>
<connor> - The guy was in English speaking stuff. </connor>
<joey> So he's like, ''Is that the one </joey>
<joey> ''where the two guys fucking?'' </joey>
<joey> (all laughing heartedly) </joey>
<joey> You'll see it in the video. </joey>
<joey> But the other challenge was really easy. </joey>
<joey> It was just pick a figurine </joey>
<connor> that either myself Garnt or Connor likes. </connor>
<connor> So obviously I went with the one that I liked. </connor>
<connor> - That's bullshit by the way. </connor>
<connor> - So mine is still in glad wrap right here </connor>
<connor> so I've got to unwrap this shit. </connor>
<connor> But I obviously </connor>
<joey> got my goddamn Waifu. - Oh my God, </joey>
<joey> is it fucking Monogatari? Jesus. </joey>
<garnt> - Of course it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look if I'm going to be on this show casually </garnt>
<garnt> like all the freaking time </garnt>
<garnt> of course I needed to get my wife Shinobu, </garnt>
<joey> but I actually don't even have this one at home so. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess, I'm just gonna go next now </garnt>
<joey> because of course I followed my heart as well. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God you've got Monogatari as well? </connor>
<garnt> - Hell yeah! - Hell yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh God. No my wife! </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, I knew Joey would get a Shinobu figure </garnt>
<garnt> becaause I saw so many boxes that were just purely Shinobu </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, get that shit out of me. </garnt>
<garnt> Get that shit out of my face man. </garnt>
<connor> - You might need to like hold it up to the camera </connor>
<connor> because they might not be seen. </connor>
<connor> There're even boxes in the way actually. </connor>
<garnt> - So I mean like what I tried to do at Astop was, </garnt>
<garnt> at the beginning I just tried to note down </garnt>
<garnt> as many figures as I could for under 20 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like anything over 20 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> was like kind of risking it in terms of-- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean especially if you're buying </joey>
<joey> like seven figurines on Astop. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> So this one's, I don't have this figure. </garnt>
<joey> Because it's short hair Senjougahara. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's cute. </joey>
<joey> Dude I personally find the short hair Senjougahara's </joey>
<joey> figurine so much nicer than the long haired one. </joey>
<garnt> - There was so many good Senjougahara figurines. </garnt>
<garnt> So it like hurts me that I had to buy the cheapest one. </garnt>
<connor> - All right boys. </connor>
<garnt> You wanna see what I bought then? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - This is a... </connor>
<connor> I think it was a 900 Yen sold out online figure. </connor>
<joey> - You didn't even get like the good sold online one. </joey>
<connor> - It was the cheapest sold online figure </connor>
<connor> because you know, if you're going to buy garbage </connor>
<connor> why care about which terrible item it is? </connor>
<connor> It was 900 Yen I think. </connor>
<connor> And it was the cheapest sold online figure. </connor>
<connor> . [Joey] Oh damn okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Was this for a challenge? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Remember? I had to shout </connor>
<connor> I freaking love SAO. </connor>
<garnt> - While buying an SAO figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - I will say that shout wasn't a shout at all. </garnt>
<connor> - In Japanese culture that was like full shout. </connor>
<garnt> - That was just, okay, ''I freaking love SAO'' </garnt>
<joey> - No! It was louder than that. </joey>
<garnt> - It was just like, ''I freaking love SAO.'' </garnt>
<joey> It was like a gradual like building volume. </joey>
<connor> - Let's get this boy out of here. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, the other two though that I bought </connor>
<connor> I think is super freaking cool </connor>
<joey> because they're two figures </joey>
<connor> that I personally really wanted but also </connor>
<joey> it's just like really-- - Sorry it's making noise </joey>
<garnt> over here. </garnt>
<garnt> What did you say over there Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's get the shit out of here. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it goes without saying, </joey>
<connor> don't listen to the audio only of this. </connor>
<connor> It's going to sound probably horrible. </connor>
<joey> - Hey guys, just opening a box over here, I mean. </joey>
<garnt> - No. This is box opening ASM guys. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay but let me show you the other two I got, okay. </joey>
<joey> This second one I got is Shonen Jump. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh, that's so cool. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay that's pretty fucking cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Right? Like I'd never seen this before </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, </garnt>
<connor> does this count as a figurine? </connor>
<connor> Probably does. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It's a piece of you know, solid kind of-- </connor>
<joey> - I love Shonen Jump </joey>
<joey> and that's gonna look so cool </joey>
<joey> on like the shelf or something like that. </joey>
<garnt> - I think if we had a coolest item award </garnt>
<joey> Because I didn't know </joey>
<joey> if we could get a coolest item over here. </joey>
<joey> - Because we have to all agree. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. But I think we can all agree </garnt>
<joey> this one of the coolest figurines. </joey>
<joey> And the other one I got is also pretty cool. </joey>
<connor> It's Puck from Berserk. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh that's cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Look at how tiny this guy is. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] How much was that? </garnt>
<joey> - This was 980 Yen. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh wow. Because every Berserk figure I saw </garnt>
<joey> was so expensive. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like there's a few figures in the store that I found. </joey>
<joey> It's like Nanachi, </joey>
<joey> the little Nanachi figure. </joey>
<garnt> Nanachi was like 250 bucks. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah no, the Made in Abyss stuff </joey>
<garnt> is so expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, because it's so hard to find. </garnt>
<garnt> - So even I got that Made in Abyss thing at Astop </garnt>
<joey> I probably still wouldn't have been able to do it </joey>
<joey> because I'm not going to spend $250 on a Nanachi figure. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, Angel Beats! </garnt>
<garnt> - So I got Yuri from Angel Beats. </garnt>
<joey> She was, I can't remember how much </joey>
<joey> but it was between 10 and 20 bucks. </joey>
<joey> - That's so cute. - There's one figure </joey>
<joey> that I didn't get </joey>
<garnt> I of course put Sagiri down. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I of course put Sagiri down </garnt>
<garnt> and you see my video </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm like trying to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> which figure is which </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like just crossing our figures. </garnt>
<garnt> The realization when I had crossed </garnt>
<garnt> out Sagiri was just like my heart fucking sank, man. </garnt>
<garnt> My heart sank and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no I crossed off sagiri. </garnt>
<garnt> How could I. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing). </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Don't don't look at what I'm unboxing. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, this is essentially all I bought at Astop. </joey>
<joey> I think I spent... </joey>
<joey> I didn't even spend $100 at Astop </joey>
<garnt> I think because I spent 9,940 Yen at Astop </garnt>
<garnt> because this Shonen Jump one was 5,000 Yen </garnt>
<joey> which is kind of expensive but not too bad. </joey>
<garnt> I mean I just tried to get Cindereys. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - You got another Ishtar piece? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a double Ishtar, </garnt>
<garnt> two Ishtar. - Oh my God </garnt>
<garnt> I think I even forgot her. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's like Medudine </joey>
<joey> or something like that. - She's cute. </joey>
<garnt> - It's probably written on the box. </garnt>
<connor> I don't want to say I've bought the single best figure </connor>
<garnt> - But are you gonna tell. - But what can you say? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Look at this $30 Mike Wazowski gem. </connor>
<connor> - That's actually so cool. </connor>
<connor> I actually love that. - That's actually like </connor>
<joey> no joke, that's a good figure, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I know, cause I saw Mike Wazowski like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I heard you shout it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like, Mike, what are you doing here? </garnt>
<joey> - So I have, it was a $30 purchase </joey>
<joey> and I'm just want to make you guys laugh here. </joey>
<joey> I just wanna-- - Can, I see that. </joey>
<garnt> I actually love this. - That's a good figure. </garnt>
<joey> It's well made. - I love this dude. </joey>
<joey> - Let me put this up here. - I love how like </joey>
<garnt> the base is the Monsters Inc logo. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes! So good. - That's so cool. </joey>
<connor> - I bought it for a troll </connor>
<connor> but I actually thought it's not bad for 30 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - No that's actually, </joey>
<joey> I think our audience can appreciate that. </joey>
<joey> That's so cool. </joey>
<joey> I kind of want it. I love that. </joey>
<joey> (humming a tune) </joey>
<connor> - Well that's Toy Story, right? </connor>
<garnt> - No, that's not-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you have any more figures coming up? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have plenty of more figures. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I'm all out </joey>
<joey> so I'm just going to watch you guys. </joey>
<garnt> - You guys keep talking. </garnt>
<joey> - Hell yeah! Megumin my Waifu. </joey>
<connor> - She was cheap, I think she was like 19 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - Some Megumin figurines, </joey>
<joey> - It's a pretty big figure. </joey>
<connor> The form factor of this box, it's pretty deceiving. </connor>
<joey> - That's one thing I have noticed about Megumin figurines. </joey>
<joey> Some of them are like way cheaper than what they should be. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's hard to tell the difference </connor>
<connor> between an $80 Megumin figure and a $20 Megumin figure. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - It's like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> with some of the popular characters </garnt>
<garnt> there's like so many different prices </garnt>
<garnt> with some of the popular characters. </garnt>
<joey> Because I think I was about to buy, </joey>
<joey> I was going to buy darkness as well. </joey>
<garnt> So I thought Joey was going to buy Megumin. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was too - I thought about it </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm like, I don't need to </garnt>
<garnt> and I reckon one of your guys is gonna buy her. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hold on. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Has nobody bought any JoJo figures. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh wow. It's funny you asked. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) - Thank God! </garnt>
<joey> - I would just like to preface that </joey>
<joey> that was not a scripted bid. </joey>
<garnt> That was totally just coincidence. </garnt>
<joey> - No, because we were just showing figures </joey>
<garnt> and I remember thinking that I say in the video, okay, </garnt>
<joey> Connor is gonna buy JoJo figures. </joey>
<joey> I don't need to buy any JoJo figures. </joey>
<joey> So if he didn't buy any, I would have been like </joey>
<joey> how did we go an entire fucking trip </joey>
<garnt> to Akihabara without buying any JoJo figures. </garnt>
<connor> - I bought multiple JoJo figures actually </connor>
<garnt> because of course I did. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, good. On brand. </connor>
<connor> - So this is the, </connor>
<joey> a figure that I've actually never seen before. </joey>
<garnt> This is the-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh I saw that. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, Joey's destroying-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm just destroying my set right now. </joey>
<connor> - This is the crazy diamond JoJo figure </connor>
<connor> and it's the one of the special colored editions </connor>
<connor> actually, I think cause there's a normal colored version </connor>
<connor> and I've never seen this figure before </connor>
<connor> and I've never seen it listed anywhere or anything </connor>
<connor> but there was two of them in the store funny enough. </connor>
<connor> And it was only like 19 bucks. </connor>
<connor> For 19 bucks that's a really nice figure </connor>
<connor> and if you've seen JoJo figures </connor>
<connor> - Some of them look absolutely-- </connor>
<connor> - They charge a lot more for a lot less. </connor>
<connor> And it's tragic that like a 20 bucks figure </connor>
<connor> for the special colored edition is like way better </connor>
<joey> than I paid 120 bucks for-- </joey>
<connor> - Also like the thing with JoJo figures </connor>
<connor> it's like a double-edged sword </connor>
<joey> it's that like some of them just look like absolute ass. </joey>
<connor> - Some of them do not look like the character </connor>
<joey> - Not at all. </joey>
<joey> - And it's kind of tragic </joey>
<joey> because it's like one of the most influential </joey>
<garnt> and popular series in Japan </garnt>
<joey> and they do them dirty </joey>
<joey> but it's a good figure. </joey>
<joey> I mean, that's a beautiful figure, right boys? </joey>
<joey> We can agree on that. </joey>
<joey> - That is a beautiful figure. </joey>
<joey> - All right boys should I show my next figure that I bought? </joey>
<joey> I bought a lot at Astop. </joey>
<garnt> I think I bought 10. </garnt>
<connor> This is. </connor>
<garnt> - Dude. I was going to buy that! </garnt>
<garnt> - I knew he was </garnt>
<garnt> because before we left the store, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know if we got this on camera. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think we did. </garnt>
<connor> But Joey was like, I'm was going to buy this figure </connor>
<connor> and he pointed to the booth where I got this figure </connor>
<connor> and he was like, </connor>
<connor> ''Oh it must have been in a different booth.'' </connor>
<connor> And I was thinking, I fucking bought that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the moment I like, I looked over, </joey>
<connor> it was like a comic. </connor>
<joey> I was like, I looked over and it was just gone </joey>
<joey> and in my head I'm just like, someone bought it. </joey>
<garnt> - It is like -- </garnt>
<connor> - How much did that cost? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] It was like 30 bucks. - It was 30 bucks . </garnt>
<garnt> Look at how cool that is for 30 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It is so good. - It is not standing up </garnt>
<connor> I'm realizing now. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I wonder if the cape... </connor>
<garnt> - Oh the cape. </garnt>
<garnt> - Guys for 30 bucks. - I know. </garnt>
<joey> - That's pretty fucking good. - It's fucking steal. </joey>
<connor> - And like how often do you see Akira figurines? </connor>
<connor> - Never. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's pretty cool. - For 30 bucks </connor>
<connor> that's fucking steal I think. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Absolutely. That's very cool. </connor>
<connor> Oh, now it's standing up? </connor>
<joey> I guess now it's just-- </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - You got one? </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah I got one. </connor>
<connor> This is my last figure. </connor>
<connor> I of course I wanted to fill this channel </connor>
<connor> with some degeneracy. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Of course. - Oh what the fuck </connor>
<connor> did you buy. </connor>
<joey> - I think I know what you've bought. </joey>
<joey> - Just the question is </joey>
<joey> how much was I willing to spend on it? </joey>
<garnt> And (laughing) this figure-- </garnt>
<garnt> - What did you get. What's in the box. </garnt>
<connor> Oh no I just had a breakdown. </connor>
<connor> Are you kidding me? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yes! </connor>
<garnt> - Rias really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> Do you wanna know how much I spent on this figure? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I wanna hear it. </joey>
<garnt> - I think I walked past it </garnt>
<joey> and I think I remember it being way over my budget. </joey>
<garnt> - How much? </garnt>
<garnt> - This was $170. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt, what the fuck! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Holy Shit. - That's kinda hot though. </connor>
<garnt> - When I saw it I was like, I've got to get this. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, you know that meme when you just like, </garnt>
<garnt> ''How to help me budget this correctly.'' </garnt>
<garnt> When I was going through the sheet </garnt>
<garnt> I was like crossing off figures and Sydney was like </garnt>
<garnt> just get rid of the fucking High School DxD figure. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I'm not getting rid of the High School DxD figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - She stays Sydney, you leave! </garnt>
<garnt> - I walked past this figurine in my video. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like I would get this </joey>
<connor> if it wasn't $170 </connor>
<connor> because I didn't want to go overboard. </connor>
<joey> But the moment I saw it, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> one of these fuckers is gonna buy it. </joey>
<connor> - That feel when I realized </connor>
<joey> that I don't have the most expensive figure now. </joey>
<joey> (groans) </joey>
<joey> Breaks my heart. </joey>
<joey> All right, should we see what I got? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - A piece of wing, another wing. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] let me put that together. </joey>
<connor> - Oh this is in two parts. Okay </connor>
<garnt> - So I was trying to put that together </garnt>
<garnt> underneath the table. It was pretty hard. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh it's magnetic. </joey>
<joey> Okay. Yeah, because you have to do this. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah. What is this? </joey>
<garnt> Oh shit. Okay. - This is two in one figures. </garnt>
<connor> Is this the dragon from Slime </connor>
<connor> - It is indeed. And it comes with more parts? </connor>
<joey> - Holy shit I didn't realize </joey>
<connor> that Slime will be representing this much </connor>
<joey> because honestly like I didn't put too much thoughts </joey>
<garnt> into what I was trying to buy. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] There we go. </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit this came with so many parts. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm so glad you got Rimuru. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, that's so cool. - So this was actually-- </connor>
<connor> Wait till we build it </connor>
<connor> but like this was a two in one figure. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if that counts me buying two figures </connor>
<connor> or one. </connor>
<connor> I paid one, but it's two figures. </connor>
<connor> - I mean that's technically one right? </connor>
<joey> - No because they're not actually joined. </joey>
<joey> They were both sold together. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - So I guess how much I paid for these two. </joey>
<garnt> - 20 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - A little low bro. </garnt>
<garnt> I pay 30 bucks for the both of them. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay wow. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I originally had a Meruem figure </garnt>
<connor> and a Rimuru figure </connor>
<connor> which is 35 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - Was it just Rimumu on its own? </connor>
<connor> - No. It was like a bundle. </connor>
<connor> - With the dragon? </connor>
<connor> - No, It was just Rimuru on its own with Meruem. </connor>
<connor> And then I decided to go against </connor>
<garnt> that just to go for Meruem so-- </garnt>
<joey> - Well I'm glad that we don't have a single </joey>
<joey> like character that's like overlaps. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I'm surprised because I thought-- </garnt>
<joey> I thought at this point </joey>
<garnt> we would at least have like some dups of some characters </garnt>
<joey> but we've miraculously somehow gotten around that. </joey>
<connor> - Why is this head not going in? </connor>
<garnt> What the fuck! </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - This wing is not going in either. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> But yeah. - Then he sold me </connor>
<connor> a faulty thing. </connor>
<connor> I'm joking, he was very nice to me. </connor>
<connor> - So is that everything you bought Connor? </connor>
<connor> - No, there's way more. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh my God. - Do you wanna </garnt>
<joey> try to assemble this while the next? </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, give those. </garnt>
<connor> - Get a look at that poor head. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God (laughs) look at that. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh no man! </garnt>
<garnt> - My figure gone? I spent money on that! </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I thought. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's falling apart. - I knew none of you </garnt>
<garnt> are going to get a Slime figure. </garnt>
<garnt> So I thought, you know, I'll get it. </garnt>
<connor> Cause I thought also it's super blue </connor>
<connor> I thought that would look sick on the podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - So like how much did you spend on all these figures? </garnt>
<connor> We'll find out later </connor>
<garnt> because this is the store I spent the most stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought because when I finished going through the store </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that I had at least bought the most figures </garnt>
<joey> in the store </joey>
<joey> because I saw Joey's whole </joey>
<joey> and I was like, I got this one. </joey>
<joey> I didn't realize how many figures you bought. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. You're watching my next figure then?. </connor>
<joey> - Sure. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yes. Let's go. </connor>
<connor> Rohan Kishibe. - Kishibe Rohan. </connor>
<connor> - 17 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What? </connor>
<connor> - 17 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] And that face is not bad. </joey>
<joey> - That's a damn... </joey>
<joey> No that is like one of the more accurate JoJo figures </joey>
<joey> that I've seen. </joey>
<joey> - For Araki's figure as well. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. That is a nice figure. </connor>
<connor> - Dude look at that like swaying head. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah dude, look at this boy, 17 bucks. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a good fucking deal. </garnt>
<connor> I can't get this fucking head on that. </connor>
<garnt> - Hold on, give it. - We can get it to work. </garnt>
<garnt> - His head just does not want to come on </garnt>
<connor> - I have three more </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Three more! </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> Give, give me the next one. </garnt>
<joey> I'll start unpacking it for you. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, Under the table. </joey>
<joey> So I'm not gonna look at what it is </joey>
<connor> I'm just going to start unpacking it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God how the fuck do you do this. </connor>
<connor> - I know, right? It's so hard. </connor>
<garnt> Okay. Go for it. </garnt>
<connor> - We should give it to our producer. </connor>
<connor> Meilyne to, to put together. Right? </connor>
<connor> Meilyne, would you like to put together the figure for us? </connor>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, go on. </connor>
<joey> Give it, give it to Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - Thanks Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - Help me Meilyne. - All right. </joey>
<connor> So my next figure, if you will. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yes I saw that one. </joey>
<garnt> - That was the Levi one you were eyeing up. </garnt>
<connor> - Levi, sitting on a couch </connor>
<joey> just doing Levi things like I just thought-- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Like what's he holding? </joey>
<connor> - Like a handkerchief. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, okay. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Just Levi's sitting on a couch. </connor>
<connor> I thought it would look so like nice on the set </connor>
<connor> and also it's best boy Levi, like. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course - Look at it. </joey>
<joey> It's a beautiful figure. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's actually really nice like small-- </joey>
<joey> - It's an expensive figure though. </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - How much was it? </joey>
<joey> 70 bucks. </joey>
<joey> - Whoa! </joey>
<connor> But I had to cause like, it's Levi sitting down. </connor>
<connor> I mean, come on you guys. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - So was that the most expensive figure </garnt>
<garnt> you boy at Astop then? </garnt>
<connor> - At Astop, yes. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - But not overall. - Not overall. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. I don't think it matters because there's this. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah - I didn't get to that. </joey>
<joey> - I think I've won. - I got close to that </joey>
<joey> but you know. </joey>
<connor> So that's, Levi's sitting on it. </connor>
<connor> I just think it's so cute. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. It's just that I feel-- </joey>
<joey> - I love it when figurines have like interesting bases. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like it just makes it seem so much more alive. </garnt>
<garnt> I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> All right. We're still going with Connor, </garnt>
<joey> there's more. - Connor and I </joey>
<joey> it's just like giving him a handjob under the table. </joey>
<joey> That's like it's just, go break it. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Next up. - Boys and boys. </garnt>
<joey> - Boy, My God Gendo, Jesus. - Dude that's cool! </joey>
<joey> - That's cool. </joey>
<connor> - How much do you think this is worth? </connor>
<joey> - I wanna say $15. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Five bucks. </joey>
<garnt> - What! Are you serious? </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you guys not see this? </garnt>
<garnt> - No because like I said the thing about-- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, that is sexy. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah so that's a bundle with that </connor>
<connor> so that goes next to it.. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we've got the whole Slime bundle there. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah we do. Oh yeah shit! </connor>
<garnt> - I got this for five bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought you never see like, I love it </garnt>
<joey> when they make figures of characters that aren't the mains. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Because they're always like </joey>
<garnt> really rare, they're normally super expensive </garnt>
<connor> but the fact that this was 5 bucks </connor>
<garnt> I just think that's awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because they were like 1,000,000,000 Asuka figures </garnt>
<connor> 1,000,000,000 Rei figures </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. Every single, like Evangelion like robot. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> Is this the last one. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is indeed. </garnt>
<connor> - Man, you are like-- </connor>
<garnt> - I think I might've won the most figures. </garnt>
<connor> - I think you might have. - I think he might have. </connor>
<garnt> - You might have won single handedly </garnt>
<joey> with just this store. </joey>
<garnt> - No I think you've bought more figures in this store </garnt>
<joey> than I have overall. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think so too. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay don't look. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay I won't look. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I should've gone more ham at Astop. </joey>
<connor> - Because I was surprised with deals at Astop. </connor>
<joey> - There was deals at Astop. </joey>
<connor> Are you ready boys? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - For the last figure, </connor>
<connor> let me get these out of the way </connor>
<garnt> I feel like they may be having a.... </garnt>
<garnt> This is my last figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ooh, Eren. </garnt>
<connor> - It comes with a little swords you can put in. </connor>
<connor> I just thought it was a cool figure. </connor>
<connor> I think it was like 30, 40 bucks. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you guys wanna have a look at that? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That was my final figure at Astop. </joey>
<joey> I think I got quite the fucking whole. </joey>
<joey> - I think you did. - You did. </joey>
<connor> - Jesus Christ! </connor>
<joey> I mean, I just can't get over this Rias figurine. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </connor>
<joey> That is some, one of the nicest figures. </joey>
<joey> I was eyeing this. - [Garnt] Isn't it. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm just like do I commit to the podcast </joey>
<joey> or do I just buy this for myself? </joey>
<garnt> - No, that figure fucked me over for the rest of the day. </garnt>
<garnt> But you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> It was worth damn it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was worth it. </garnt>
<joey> That was like-- </joey>
<joey> - Look now, from now on after this episode </joey>
<joey> you get to fucking stare </joey>
<joey> at this beautiful thing in the background </joey>
<connor> every single thing. - Why are we getting </connor>
<connor> demonetized every episode? We've got this-- </connor>
<joey> - Is it because of a Rias' bare </joey>
<joey> like dump truck ass right here. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. Demonetization, what was that? </garnt>
<joey> - So with that giant whole ass away... </joey>
<garnt> My God! </garnt>
<garnt> So let's go with the third-- </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, how much did you spend at Astop? </joey>
<joey> I mean spent less than $100 at Astop. </joey>
<connor> My most expensive thing was the Jump thing right here </connor>
<connor> which was 50 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - That's cool a shit though. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] It is cool a shit. </joey>
<joey> - I spent 220 bucks. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God, shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to check how much exactly I spent-- </garnt>
<joey> - Because one of the challenges was whoever spends the most </joey>
<joey> at a single store gets a point. </joey>
<garnt> - What was... </garnt>
<joey> Actually, we can figure that out ourselves. </joey>
<joey> I also spent 220 bucks at Astop. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh! </garnt>
<joey> - It's going to go down to the tiny numerals next. </joey>
<joey> But the third store we went to was K-Books. </joey>
<joey> K-Books, much like a lot of stores </joey>
<joey> in the large of Kaikan building. </joey>
<joey> They sell figurines </joey>
<joey> but they also sell a bunch of like other merch </joey>
<joey> like figurines, plushies, just little knickknacks </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that so. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I don't remember... </joey>
<garnt> Oh no I do remember exactly what I bought. </garnt>
<joey> I bought two things. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. So let's talk about strategy first. </garnt>
<garnt> So what was your guys' strategy going into K-Books </garnt>
<connor> - This is the point where I started considering </connor>
<connor> how much money I have left. </connor>
<connor> Like Astop it was like spend spend. </connor>
<connor> Because I felt like I was too behind at Animate. </connor>
<connor> So I went ham in Astop </connor>
<joey> and then this is when I was like, </joey>
<joey> okay maybe I should start like being careful when I buy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, I was the complete opposite. </joey>
<garnt> At this point I had more than half of my budget left. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh my God - Oh shit I get. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I was going to go like big bucks boy on K-Books </garnt>
<connor> and the final Amiami store. </connor>
<connor> - So what did you buy? </connor>
<garnt> - So I got two. </garnt>
<garnt> So one of my challenges </garnt>
<garnt> was to get an Astolfo figurine. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why super specificly </garnt>
<garnt> but luckily I found one Astolfo figurine. </garnt>
<garnt> Didn't even come in box. </garnt>
<joey> - This motherfucker. - Oh Goddamnit! </joey>
<connor> Because what happened right? Was-- </connor>
<connor> - There was two. </connor>
<connor> He just hit the one that you didn't find. </connor>
<connor> - Because we were walking past it </connor>
<connor> and I saw the Astolfo figure </connor>
<joey> and I was just like putting loads of other figures </joey>
<joey> on top of that. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So I was like, Connor, look at this </joey>
<garnt> and I didn't see the second one so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah there was another one like right near it. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I like waited ahead </garnt>
<garnt> and I watched him as he was going through it </garnt>
<connor> and he actually found another one. </connor>
<connor> But the one that you buried, he didn't find. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I didn't know. </joey>
<joey> This is the only one I've found and I'm like, thank God. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh dammnit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he always got me with that conspiracy. </garnt>
<garnt> But then the second one I got... </garnt>
<garnt> Oh the second challenge was </garnt>
<joey> to find a Cardcaptor Sukara figurine. </joey>
<connor> Unfortunately I couldn't find one </connor>
<connor> but I know that if I went to K-Books </connor>
<connor> like six months ago, like the new Sukara </connor>
<garnt> was still like hot and fresh in everyone's minds. </garnt>
<garnt> I knew I would have found one </garnt>
<garnt> but, so I gave up on that. </garnt>
<garnt> So instead I spent big boy dollars </garnt>
<garnt> and got this really cool Yuojo Senki figurine. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] That's so cool. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I'm not a huge fan of Tanya personally </garnt>
<garnt> but this is a fucking cool figurine. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's an awesome figurine. - How much was that? </garnt>
<joey> This was $132. </joey>
<joey> - Ooh okay. </joey>
<joey> - With an interchangeable head though. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Great! Can't wait to change the heads every day. </connor>
<joey> - Every episode we changing the head. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. Don't say that, </joey>
<connor> we'll have to do it. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - We're gonna have to come here. </joey>
<joey> But that's pretty much the only two things I bought. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because at this point </garnt>
<joey> I was just trying to stay alive. </joey>
<garnt> Astop really fucked me over. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh way yeah, because spent how much at Astop </garnt>
<connor> And then you also spent a shit ton at Animate. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So I think I budgeted it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, I think I could only spend around 70 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> or something or maybe less in each store. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had to complete the challenges. </garnt>
<garnt> So the first challenge </garnt>
<garnt> was just getting a figure from a Shonen series. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Another Mike I can't take it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I already knew I'd lost at this point. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't really... </garnt>
<joey> But what surprised me </joey>
<joey> because I wasn't really familiar with a K-Books </joey>
<joey> so I didn't know what kind of merchandise they had. </joey>
<joey> They did not have a lot of Shonen figures. </joey>
<joey> - No - That's all. </joey>
<joey> - Right? It was between this one and a Luffy one </joey>
<joey> and I just went for the cheapest one because I needed to-- </joey>
<joey> - You wanted the challenge done. </joey>
<joey> - I wanted the challenge done. </joey>
<garnt> Second thing was to buy something Lewd, all right. </garnt>
<connor> - That was not difficult </connor>
<connor> as there was a gigantic hentai section. </connor>
<garnt> There were like like Hanbok like, </garnt>
<joey> I think like half of the store was just like 18 plus. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm like, this is big Rei mode. </joey>
<joey> What lewd thing can I buy </joey>
<joey> that's really cheap and can keep me on budget. </joey>
<joey> So I brought Dojuinshi. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Oh who did you get? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. - Jean Outta </garnt>
<joey> - Of course. </joey>
<joey> - I just like I was more focused </joey>
<joey> on finding a cover which wouldn't get us easily like, </joey>
<joey> which just wouldn't get this video off the, </joey>
<joey> what am I talking about? </joey>
<joey> Demonetized or age restricted. </joey>
<joey> - That's big brain YouTuber boy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. But I did buy one more. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - But I just checked it before we started recording. </joey>
<garnt> I don't think I can share it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe you can just show a blured picture </garnt>
<joey> and we can all get a reaction to it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Yeah. maybe mood on, </joey>
<joey> just put like a huge black screen </joey>
<joey> over whatever Garnt brings out. </joey>
<garnt> So I bought a Dakimakura. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - A what? - Wow, where are we gonna </garnt>
<garnt> put that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought we could just hang it up on the wall. </garnt>
<joey> That was like the intent. </joey>
<joey> We're not going to be able to use this. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Because I was like I need to buy a Dakimakura. </connor>
<joey> - ''I need to buy a Dakimakura!'' </joey>
<connor> - Yes I do. </connor>
<connor> - Right. What did you get? </connor>
<connor> - So I bought the cheapest one I could find. </connor>
<garnt> And like it was in the section there weren't many </garnt>
<garnt> like the Dakimakuras weren't all lewd. </garnt>
<connor> You know, there was some lewds, </connor>
<garnt> there was some one </garnt>
<connor> and they were all like covered up. </connor>
<connor> - Where are you going with this? </connor>
<connor> - So I couldn't tell how Lewd </connor>
<joey> the Dakimakuras were I just chose the cheapest one. </joey>
<connor> - Oh Jesus. - Oh wow. Oh no. </connor>
<joey> - We're not going to be able to use this. </joey>
<joey> - Black all of that out. </joey>
<joey> - They sell that? - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - This wasn't, this wasn't even in the hentai section. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Can I ask? </joey>
<joey> Because he got the cheapest one. </joey>
<garnt> How much was that? </garnt>
<garnt> - 40 bucks. </garnt>
<joey> - What! 40 bucks - That's the cheapest one? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah that's the cheapest one. </connor>
<garnt> Right I bought Like a sens one at home </garnt>
<garnt> that was Akatena. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't ask me why. </garnt>
<joey> So my two challenges were </joey>
<joey> buy JoJo figure and do the pose. </joey>
<joey> And I was really lucky </joey>
<joey> that there was any one JoJo figure </joey>
<joey> which I'll show you shortly. </joey>
<joey> The other one was Buy a Wall Scroll. </joey>
<joey> Now there was a bunch of cheap wall scrolls </joey>
<joey> like 400, 500 </joey>
<joey> but I thought I should probably get one from a show </joey>
<joey> that I actually like liked. </joey>
<connor> So I spent 10 bucks on Katanagatari. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, hell yeah. - My God. </connor>
<joey> I love, Katanagatari is one of my favorite shows. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] It's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's totally underrated, not underrated. </garnt>
<garnt> - So many people haven't seen it as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone who has seen the show says it's fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it is. </garnt>
<joey> - And if you haven't seen it, it's like-- </joey>
<joey> - It's Nishio Ishin of course it's gonna be good. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a Quentin Tarantino anime </joey>
<garnt> I feel like it's so fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> - People who haven't seen it </garnt>
<joey> are just like, which season of Monogatari is this? </joey>
<connor> (all laugh heartedly) </connor>
<connor> It's nothing to do with the Monogatari series. </connor>
<connor> - It's amazing. Please watch it. </connor>
<garnt> And I mean she's Waifu material. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah definitely. </garnt>
<joey> - So that was 10 bucks I mean. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that's bringing me back memories up constantly </joey>
<joey> - I know when I've been </joey>
<joey> to this show. - Makes me wanna </joey>
<joey> watch it again. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know where we're going to put this. </joey>
<joey> I'll just put right it here. </joey>
<garnt> Also I got a JoJo figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which one though? - Which one? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I remember </garnt>
<garnt> when you got the challenge and you were </garnt>
<garnt> like, buy a JoJo figure. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, this motherfucker. </garnt>
<garnt> You got so lucky with the challenges. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did. - The only reason </garnt>
<joey> why you got four points </joey>
<joey> is because all of them was so easy for you. </joey>
<connor> - Except okay. </connor>
<connor> And the last door, we shall talk about that. </connor>
<connor> That was a little annoying somehow. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, so I got the Giorno Giovanna Golden Experience. </garnt>
<connor> - Ooh! </connor>
<connor> - It's actually like it's, </connor>
<connor> okay I'm not gonna lie, </connor>
<joey> His face doesn't look like 10 out of 10 on it </joey>
<connor> but that's what you get with JoJo figures. </connor>
<garnt> But at least we got another JoJo figure. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh nice. </joey>
<connor> So I'm the one who did all the hard work. </connor>
<joey> - So what's that, three now? </joey>
<joey> It's Rohan, Giorno and Diamond. </joey>
<connor> - This was 66 bucks though. </connor>
<connor> And that's like-- </connor>
<connor> - Can I see that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And to be honest with you </connor>
<connor> 66 bucks is kind of like cheap for JoJo figure normally. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - The more I look at this face </joey>
<connor> the more hilarious it gets. </connor>
<connor> Just like look into his face. </connor>
<joey> - It's kinda how I would say. - It' kinda funny. </joey>
<garnt> - We'll take a picture of this and show it on the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not how I would describe as manga accurate </garnt>
<connor> but it's, I mean, more like Kendall, </connor>
<connor> but whatever I'm not gonna (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> That's all I bought at K-Books. </garnt>
<joey> I was just doing my challenges. </joey>
<joey> - Okay so we each bought two things each? </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, I bought three. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I was just like-- </joey>
<connor> - I just wanted to get my challenges done. </connor>
<connor> - I got my challenges done </connor>
<connor> and I was like I'm just on the mission </connor>
<garnt> to demonetize this channel. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> That was my mission. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't worry you will do that naturally. </garnt>
<connor> - I was worrying because like I went into K-Books </connor>
<connor> and I mean I was thinking like </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna buy a $200 figure. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - K-Books quickly ruined that plan </joey>
<joey> because of the challenges. </joey>
<joey> So I spent 77 bucks on just my challenge. </joey>
<joey> And then obviously I realized when I got to Amiami </joey>
<joey> which we're gonna do right now </joey>
<joey> I had challenges that I had to do as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So we should talk about Amiami. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay, so let's talk about Amiami. </garnt>
<garnt> - So for me, Amiami was just, I was just trying to survive. </garnt>
<garnt> I was, I think I figured out </garnt>
<connor> I had like I think $60 or $50. </connor>
<garnt> - 60 bucks left? - [Joey] What! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just, at this point, </garnt>
<garnt> just praying and hoping. </garnt>
<garnt> Like-- </garnt>
<connor> - But you wasted fucking $40 on a fucking pillowcase. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like why would you do that? </garnt>
<connor> - Don't judge me, okay? </connor>
<joey> - It wasn't even a part of the challenge. </joey>
<connor> - I know. I just wanted a Dakimakura, okay? </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like a guy </garnt>
<garnt> who like gambles all this money away </garnt>
<garnt> and says I just don't understand </garnt>
<connor> why I got the money all the time, man. It sucks </connor>
<garnt> - Well because like, I knew this would be </garnt>
<garnt> my only opportunity to buy a Dakimakura. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course. - Why did you </connor>
<garnt> want to buy one so badly? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he's fucking part of Trash Taste, that's why. </garnt>
<connor> - Look it's called Trash Taste for a reason. </connor>
<connor> - Fine. All right. Sue me. </connor>
<connor> We had a lot of blank space </connor>
<connor> in the background where we could hang one up. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, Dakimakura? </connor>
<garnt> I think that's a good purchase. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I bought one wasted $40. </garnt>
<garnt> Can't even use it. </garnt>
<joey> Fucking brilliant. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - We can't even hang it up. </joey>
<connor> It's just going to be a black box in the video. </connor>
<connor> - I've got one at my house. </connor>
<joey> I've got a pillow. The Dakimakura pillow so. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I've got one of Shoujo hanging on me wall so. </joey>
<connor> But with me, for Amiami </connor>
<joey> this is where I spent the most amount of money </joey>
<joey> because I had almost like, </joey>
<joey> I think I had like 2/3 of my budget still left </joey>
<joey> because I knew I'd been into Amiami before, </joey>
<connor> not the one in Kaikan that we went to </connor>
<connor> but there's another one in Akihabara as well. </connor>
<connor> - And you can spend a lot of money in there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I spent a lot of money there </connor>
<connor> and I know they have </connor>
<connor> some really expensive figurines, </connor>
<connor> but they have a huge selection as well. </connor>
<connor> So I knew I was going to find something hopefully good. </connor>
<joey> I mean that's before this Rias showed up and ruin my plans </joey>
<joey> but my two challenges I believe was </joey>
<joey> by a plushie, a character plushie. </joey>
<joey> And the other one </joey>
<joey> I don't remember what it was. </joey>
<garnt> But I got a plushie. I actually got two plushies. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I needed to, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> spend my money and get close to $500 as possible. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - So I got Moogle and Chocobo. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Because I love Final Fantasy </joey>
<joey> and Final Fantasy Seven remake recently just came out </joey>
<joey> and I love the fuck out of it. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] That's cute as fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah so give out JLPG some love as well. </joey>
<joey> So I got that and the most expensive figurine </joey>
<connor> that I got overall. </connor>
<connor> - Oh more expensive than anyone? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - This is the most expensive overall. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you buy this purposely to like finish-- </garnt>
<joey> - I bought this purposely to get as close </joey>
<garnt> to $500 as possible. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh okay. </garnt>
<connor> - So this was not part of the challenge. </connor>
<connor> I got a Tokisaki Kurumi from Date A Live. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh nice. - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean again, this is kind of going to be like Rias </garnt>
<garnt> in the sense that like, possibly demonetize. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh that's hot. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I know Tokisaki figurines </garnt>
<garnt> can for some reason, so expensive. </garnt>
<joey> I mean she's a really popular Date A Live character. </joey>
<connor> - How much was it then? - This was $141. </connor>
<connor> Not as expensive as the Rias, </connor>
<connor> I've already lost that challenge but. </connor>
<connor> - I may have overheard or </connor>
<joey> saw Joey when he was buying that one. </joey>
<joey> And I thought all I gotta do is beat 1300. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I literally just went over 1300 </joey>
<connor> on a more expensive figure which I'll reveal soon. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. Because, was that everything you bought? </garnt>
<joey> - And that's everything I bought. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. Because for me, Amiami was a stressful experience. </garnt>
<joey> Not because of the store itself. </joey>
<joey> The store itself is great, </joey>
<joey> but because I saw my challenges, </joey>
<joey> which was one, find an Evangelion figurine. </joey>
<joey> That was a lot harder </joey>
<joey> than I initially gave it credit for. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Because I missed the entire figure section </joey>
<joey> right at the back. </joey>
<joey> So I was just walking around </joey>
<joey> and there was one figure I found which was $200. </joey>
<joey> No, actually no way that I could buy that figure. </joey>
<joey> And I found another figure, which was 50 bucks. </joey>
<joey> No, 50 to 70 bucks. </joey>
<joey> But that was the tiny little budget that I had. </joey>
<garnt> - You really fucked yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I really fucked myself. </garnt>
<garnt> - You hate to see it. </garnt>
<garnt> This girl me fucked so badly. </garnt>
<connor> - Hey, I mean, she's a succubus. </connor>
<garnt> ( laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - What can you say? </garnt>
<garnt> - But luckily I found an Asuka pop figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no! Why did you do a pop figure? </garnt>
<garnt> - No! Why God. Why would you buy a pop figure man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it was the cheapest okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I think this is going to be awarded </joey>
<joey> for the most normy. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> This thing right here. </joey>
<joey> No offense, if you like pop vinyls </joey>
<joey> but we-- </joey>
<connor> - No offense. If you do like Pop vinyls. </connor>
<joey> Like we say, no offense. </joey>
<joey> They're fucking ugly dude. </joey>
<joey> - I thought they'd be nice. </joey>
<connor> - I fucking hate pop figures. Oh Jesus. </connor>
<garnt> How much did you spend on this? </garnt>
<garnt> - 14 bucks. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay not bad. </connor>
<connor> - You know what it's like? </connor>
<connor> It's like, you come to Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> You have all these amazing figures. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - You go for fucking </connor>
<connor> pop figures. </connor>
<connor> It's like going into like Germany an being like </connor>
<connor> I want hotdogs, from the can please. </connor>
<connor> I want not none of that stuff. </connor>
<joey> - It's like going to Germany and being like, </joey>
<connor> can I have an Asahi? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It's like, what the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> - No fine. I-- </garnt>
<garnt> - All right... I'll give it for the challenge. </garnt>
<joey> It was for the challenge, because there're like </joey>
<joey> like this Amiami had a lot of good figures. </joey>
<joey> That I really, really wanted to buy. </joey>
<joey> I just needed to go for the cheapest one. </joey>
<joey> And then the second one </joey>
<joey> which I had no idea how to complete was </joey>
<joey> buy a furry and like 100% non-humanoid figure. </joey>
<joey> And I was like </joey>
<joey> the only thing I could fkn think of was Chopper </joey>
<joey> from One Piece. </joey>
<joey> Did not have any Chopper figures. </joey>
<joey> So I was like I've probably lost this. </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, wait a minute. </joey>
<garnt> There's there's probably one thing I could twist </garnt>
<garnt> and that's Eevee figure. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, that counts. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like, okay if I can't go the chopper route </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I can go to the Pokemon route. </garnt>
<connor> - How the are fuck have they spelled Eevee on this box? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] EIEVUI. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's with that? Why do they spell it like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know because I guess </garnt>
<garnt> that's how they pronounce it in Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't think they realize </garnt>
<joey> that there's a way easy spelling of Eevee </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay that's cute. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay you know, that counts. </garnt>
<garnt> Because when you pulled that out </garnt>
<garnt> I thought you were going to get one of these. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I didn't think </garnt>
<joey> those kinda does a figure, right? </joey>
<joey> But I'm like Eevee's furry is non-humanoid figure. </joey>
<joey> Shut the fuck up I am getting that point. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - No okay that counts. </joey>
<joey> - Because there was between like Eevee </joey>
<joey> and Miu too and I was like Eevee's cute. </joey>
<joey> So yeah what were the challenges that you had Connor? </joey>
<connor> - I had, buy three anime mugs or glasses </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> We painfully asked </connor>
<connor> because they were no sets or anything. </connor>
<connor> It was like they were all like pretty expensive as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh you had to buy them separately. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah , and then it was also </connor>
<connor> buy a figure that you think is trash. </connor>
<garnt> - So wait, how much budget did you have left at this point? </garnt>
<connor> - 140 something. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, so you like balanced it out pretty well </joey>
<joey> between the four stores? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah because I basically spent nothing at Animate </connor>
<connor> I spent 70 bucks at K-Books. </connor>
<joey> So I kind of like did pretty good at budgeting by accident. </joey>
<joey> I hadn't planned anything. </joey>
<joey> I think not having challenges </joey>
<joey> that fuck me over was helpful. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that was definitely helpful. </joey>
<joey> - The figure that I thought it was trash </joey>
<connor> was just this shitty Sunrio one. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I thought you were gonna go like ironic trash, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No, it was like 220 Yen as well </joey>
<joey> which might be the cheapest figure as well. </joey>
<joey> - It's is probably the cheapest figure. </joey>
<garnt> - I just... </garnt>
<joey> Who the is the Sanrio character. </joey>
<joey> Does anyone know it? - Oh I think I know it. </joey>
<joey> - You know it? I know like the. </joey>
<joey> - Pochacco </joey>
<joey> - I know Tamagu one, the egg one. </joey>
<garnt> - I love Tamagu. </garnt>
<joey> - Gudetama? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And obviously Hello Kitty </joey>
<joey> but I don't know. What the fuck. Okay, whatever. </joey>
<joey> And the funny mugs I bought from, </joey>
<joey> I don't know where they're from. </joey>
<joey> Do you wanna open them, I guess? </joey>
<joey> - Sure. </joey>
<joey> - That was 100 Yen luckily </joey>
<joey> But every other mug was like 1,000 Yen. </joey>
<joey> I managed to find two for 600 Yen. </joey>
<connor> So we have more mugs now for the podcast I guess. </connor>
<joey> We'll drink from those possibly </joey>
<joey> maybe never I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - These are like tightly packed </garnt>
<garnt> There's the mugs. </garnt>
<connor> So I did the challenges. Cool. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like so annoyed </connor>
<garnt> because the there was a Froppy figure. </garnt>
<garnt> The one with like the cool comic book text. </garnt>
<garnt> - I sold that one. </garnt>
<garnt> I had just enough budget to get that </garnt>
<garnt> if it wasn't for this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> So I had to completely change my mind. </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying this stuff is bad </joey>
<joey> but it ruined my plan, just saying. </joey>
<connor> So I had to go with a different... </connor>
<garnt> I mean ,I guess you get what you pay for, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I'm gonna say like </garnt>
<garnt> it was 100 Yen for a reason you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - What series is this? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> - I have no idea. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh no, it's all characters on the back </garnt>
<garnt> which I didn't see. </garnt>
<connor> - And then these are from some Otome game. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah they look like Otome games </garnt>
<connor> - I don't watch or play any Otome games. </connor>
<connor> I know they're huge here in Japan but. </connor>
<joey> - I mean for a female demographic </joey>
<connor> - I would just prefer Yaoi. </connor>
<connor> Just straight up Yaoi. </connor>
<connor> Don't like try and-- </connor>
<joey> - If you had come out with a Yaoi like mug </joey>
<joey> I think you would have one like coolest. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) - Maybe. The final figure </connor>
<connor> and most expensive figure that I bought. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, oh C.C? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh C2! </garnt>
<connor> - C.C, C2, whatever. </connor>
<connor> Same thing, 2C. </connor>
<joey> It's her like on the like pedestal. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's cool. </joey>
<joey> That's a dump truck I've ever seen. </joey>
<garnt> - Ooh. - That's an ass. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's who you see in the figure. </garnt>
<garnt> I should get it out </garnt>
<garnt> so you guys can fully appreciate this figure </garnt>
<garnt> but yes that was-- - How much was that? </garnt>
<connor> - That was 130 bucks, honestly worth every penny </connor>
<joey> - I guess while they're opening these figurines up </joey>
<joey> I guess I just want to ask you guys, </joey>
<joey> like how was the challenge like overall? </joey>
<joey> Like do you have a good feeling? </joey>
<joey> - I have more stuff by the way. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you have more stuff. </joey>
<joey> - I have more stuff. - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Which is probably... </connor>
<connor> - Do you want to open this while I. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. - We should also </connor>
<connor> preface as well that </connor>
<connor> there is like consequences for the final scores </connor>
<connor> and everything. </connor>
<connor> Basically, whoever has the lowest score at the end </connor>
<connor> like including the points that we got </connor>
<connor> in our individual videos </connor>
<connor> as well as the points that we're going to add up </connor>
<connor> at the end of this episode </connor>
<connor> has to do some kind of punishment </connor>
<connor> in a traditional really sadistic Japanese way. </connor>
<connor> We're basically gonna be consuming something </connor>
<connor> that we personally don't really want to consume </connor>
<connor> with these two because they're absolute pussies. </connor>
<connor> They're going to have to eat one packet of nokdu </connor>
<connor> which is like Japanese fermented soybeans. </connor>
<connor> - It's disgusting. </connor>
<garnt> - I love it. - It smells horrible, okay? </garnt>
<joey> - I love it. </joey>
<garnt> Thank you very much I grew up with it. </garnt>
<garnt> So obviously I'm not going to eat that if I lose. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna have to eat the spicy noodles </garnt>
<garnt> that I ate in my JoJo quiz video </garnt>
<garnt> which you can go check out on my channel. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. But we're going to find that out </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the episode </garnt>
<garnt> once we've calculated all the scores </garnt>
<garnt> but I guess in the meantime as well </garnt>
<garnt> let us know down in the comments below so far, </garnt>
<joey> what is the favorite figurine that you sourced. </joey>
<garnt> - It's my one I know it. </garnt>
<joey> - Most likely it's going to be this one. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like so happy I bought that now </joey>
<joey> because I bought it on pure instinct, right? </joey>
<joey> I wasn't trying to win the game. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't have any strategy in mind. </garnt>
<connor> - You were horny on maine </connor>
<garnt> I was just horny on maine </garnt>
<garnt> and I just wanted everyone to see it. </garnt>
<joey> I love as well </joey>
<joey> how the base is like buried </joey>
<joey> so you can like walk up at it. </joey>
<garnt> - Damn! That's a good figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn that is a beautiful. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Ooh, look at that butt dude. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at that competition man. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Just saying so - Who has the bigger </connor>
<joey> dump truck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Now I know Garnt </joey>
<joey> is gonna shit himself now </joey>
<connor> but the rest of my purchases </connor>
<connor> were to get that even 500 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - So I just bought like a fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know what this is. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is that? </garnt>
<connor> It goes on a doorknob I think, or something. </connor>
<garnt> I don't really know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like an arrow-man. </garnt>
<connor> Let me open this. </connor>
<garnt> - A towel of some. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of Ani Tore. </garnt>
<connor> - It was 100 Yen. A towel. </connor>
<joey> - What is this show? </joey>
<joey> - That's the POV anime </joey>
<garnt> where like the cute girls like workout. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah oh shit. I remember. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so bad. I love it. </joey>
<connor> - I got some scroll from some shirts. </connor>
<joey> - Wow, you've really like weighed like cold stuff overall. </joey>
<joey> - Did someone have like a challenge </joey>
<garnt> where you have to buy a wall scroll? </garnt>
<connor> - It was from a different... </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Trading cards for 210 Yen. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like what trading cards? </garnt>
<connor> - What is this? </connor>
<joey> Oh, wait, you can put something in here. </joey>
<joey> - It's probably for like tickets maybe, </joey>
<joey> something like that. </joey>
<joey> Train tickets, maybe concert tickets. </joey>
<connor> It's you know, if you want like to know </connor>
<connor> who is a weaboo you just put this on them. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a tracking, you know. </connor>
<connor> That's everything that I bought </connor>
<garnt> and it came out to an even 500 exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, are you serious? </garnt>
<connor> - Bang on 500. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh fuck! </garnt>
<connor> - I did this footage in my video </connor>
<connor> which you guys should see. </connor>
<connor> I went to the cashier and I went 10 Yen over. </connor>
<connor> So I asked the guy, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> no take all this stuff out </connor>
<connor> I'm going back. </connor>
<connor> ( Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> And they were all so confused </connor>
<connor> they were like, ''what's he trying to say?'' </connor>
<connor> I'm like, get rid of the stuff I got to go back. </connor>
<joey> So I went and found exactly what it was. </joey>
<joey> Did the math on the spot </joey>
<joey> went through my camera footage </joey>
<joey> to find out what I spent at each store. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Until exactly 500 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - I was like, I don't think there's anyone </joey>
<joey> that's going to get close to $500, like at all. </joey>
<joey> So I was like if I can get as close as I can to 500 </joey>
<joey> then I think I probably won. </joey>
<garnt> So I think my overall price came to 49,840 Yen. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was 160 Yen off. </garnt>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<garnt> - Because for me, I was, after Astop </garnt>
<garnt> I had just stopped calculating stuff and that. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) - You had given up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I was like, I'm probably going to go bust. </garnt>
<joey> I'm probably going to go bust and lose the entire thing. </joey>
<joey> But no, mine actually came out to 47,152 Yen. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, we all got really close. </joey>
<joey> - Which is like $470. </joey>
<joey> That's how... </joey>
<joey> We should probably explain </joey>
<joey> that we are calculating it by dollars </joey>
<joey> by just dividing by 100 from the--. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because that's roughly what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So I guess </garnt>
<joey> for the first challenge of can get closest to $500, </joey>
<connor> those two points are going to go to Connor. </connor>
<connor> - Hell yes, that means I'm in the lead now. </connor>
<garnt> - Holy fuck those two points. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn I was so confident that I was like, </garnt>
<connor> I thought like old both of you </connor>
<connor> were get to get like kind of what I got </connor>
<connor> so I'm like, no dude, I'm 160 Yen away. </connor>
<joey> I got this. </joey>
<connor> - Joey seemed so confident when we were filming </connor>
<joey> that I thought he must have done </joey>
<garnt> the exact same thing as me and got like exact. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No! </garnt>
<garnt> - No because this fucker, he was like, </garnt>
<connor> I thought he'd planned everything, right? </connor>
<connor> - Same . </connor>
<connor> - I talked to him off screen-- </connor>
<connor> - He turned up smiling and everything. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, he's like, </connor>
<connor> I got my strategy for each store </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I have got none. </connor>
<connor> - I did not. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - No, I was just bluffing you guys. </joey>
<connor> Obviously like a good game of poker </connor>
<joey> You've gotta be overconfident. </joey>
<connor> - Whatever, you bluffed me into being exact with my money. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't have done that if I didn't know </connor>
<connor> that you might've been exact. </connor>
<joey> - Goddammnit! Because I didn't think </joey>
<joey> you were going to like buy all this small shit </joey>
<connor> to like get exact. </connor>
<connor> - I wanted to get those two points. </connor>
<joey> I don't want to eat fucking nokdu Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Nor do I. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, well then, that was huge. </joey>
<connor> So let's go over the next couple of challenges. </connor>
<joey> I think there's 10 left. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - 10 left. </garnt>
<garnt> - So the second one is the most expensive figure. </garnt>
<joey> - Obviously that goes to Garnt </joey>
<connor> and this does all that. </connor>
<connor> - That was 160? </connor>
<garnt> - 16700 Yen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow so 170 bucks basically. </garnt>
<connor> And yours was 140? </connor>
<joey> - Mine was 141. </joey>
<connor> - And the mine was 137. </connor>
<connor> So Garnt gets to the point for that I guess. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Next one is the cheapest figurine </joey>
<connor> I got that 220 Yen figure. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Did anyone beat that? </joey>
<joey> - No mine was Puck, which is 980. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Ooh. Mine was, I think I can't even fucking remember. </garnt>
<joey> It was 1,000 bucks, I noted it down. </joey>
<connor> - 1,000 bucks! </connor>
<garnt> - No, it was 1,000 Yen. </garnt>
<garnt> - So even even if I didn't buy that </garnt>
<joey> I still had the Evangelion. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah you still would have won with-- </joey>
<connor> - So yeah, you still would have won </connor>
<joey> even if it was anime figure. - So, okay, damn, </joey>
<joey> I feel pretty good right now, all right. </joey>
<joey> - Okay.The lowest rated series on MAL </joey>
<connor> - Okay, you wanna go first? - Which one is yours. </connor>
<connor> - What's my number? It was like Otome brave </connor>
<joey> which I think is that Mug </joey>
<joey> and it was like 2,375. </joey>
<joey> - Oh damn! - Okay what's yours. </joey>
<joey> - Mine was (laughs), Rias. </joey>
<garnt> - Really! That's the lowest? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God - Yeah, it was like </joey>
<garnt> 1,744 on MAL. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. Well, give me the point </garnt>
<garnt> because mine wasn't Berserk, which is 5,687. </garnt>
<garnt> - No way, no. </garnt>
<joey> - Because it's the anime not the manga. </joey>
<garnt> Hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the hell. Goddamn. - It's the garbage anime </garnt>
<connor> not the manga. </connor>
<garnt> I'm sure if I looked at what that fucking towel was </garnt>
<joey> the scores might be a little different. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know what it is. </joey>
<connor> So I guess that's not fair. </connor>
<joey> - Point to me baby. Let's go. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So the next was </joey>
<connor> the most figures bought. </connor>
<joey> - In one store. </joey>
<garnt> - No overall. Did we do store and? </garnt>
<connor> - No we just did overall. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, well, I only bought seven. </joey>
<connor> - I have 14. </connor>
<garnt> - 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I think you bought some more figures in Astop. </garnt>
<garnt> - I filled up the thing </garnt>
<connor> and I bought everything that I filled up in those-- </connor>
<connor> - You bought more figurines at Astop </connor>
<joey> than I did overall. </joey>
<connor> - And I'm not gonna lie, right you have a good selection </connor>
<connor> but I think my selection is pretty fucking strong as well. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, no, all three of our selections </joey>
<connor> are really strong </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - I don't know about Garnt. </connor>
<connor> I mean this figure is great but the rest. </connor>
<connor> Look at, his selection is strong? </connor>
<connor> Get out of here Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, next one. </connor>
<joey> Most spent on one series. </joey>
<joey> All of mine were separate </joey>
<joey> so I'm just going to go off the base </joey>
<joey> that this is(masked over by Connor) </joey>
<connor> - I totally forgot about this one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what could it be? - It's probably JoJo, right? </connor>
<connor> - Wait it could have been JoJo </connor>
<connor> but it wouldn't have been... </connor>
<joey> I spent a lot on like Attack on Titan and JoJo </joey>
<joey> but I didn't get anything near 160 overall. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - She's just solo carrying these challenges for me now. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the thing, right? </garnt>
<connor> Is that we may challenges that we'll reward you </connor>
<joey> for being frugal with your money </joey>
<joey> and buying little things </joey>
<joey> but also would reward you if you bought, </joey>
<garnt> if you did the gamble that paid off the most, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the gamble. </garnt>
<connor> - Because you had to guess, right? </connor>
<connor> Because I was thinking in my head, </connor>
<garnt> would Joey buy a $200 figure? </garnt>
<connor> I think he could. - I was going to. </connor>
<connor> - I thought both of you couldn't </connor>
<garnt> and I was like, maybe I should just give </garnt>
<garnt> up on that challenge, right? </garnt>
<connor> And just focus on everything else. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck. - Yeah because like, </connor>
<connor> when I saw her, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I just want to buy her </connor>
<connor> because she was like a really unique figure. </connor>
<connor> I saw tits and I thought I'd just. </connor>
<connor> I saw titties and I didn't think </connor>
<garnt> and before I knew it I was writing down the number. </garnt>
<connor> - His wife was right there as well </connor>
<connor> but it didn't matter. </connor>
<garnt> - It was funny because out of every figure I bought </garnt>
<joey> this one was the one that I didn't think about the most. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I'm getting this figure. </joey>
<joey> I'm not even going to think about it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] My god. </joey>
<garnt> The most spent on a non-figure. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh for me it would be </joey>
<joey> I guess the squashy, which is 2,800 Yen. </joey>
<connor> - Mine was 1,100. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. Mine was a Dakimakura. </connor>
<connor> - Shit he spent 40 bucks on it. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I guess it paid off. - [Joey] Fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> - If being at degenerates fucking saved me in this game </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so fucking happy. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Goddamnit. - Okay. All right. </connor>
<garnt> What's the next. </garnt>
<joey> - Next one is most spent in one store. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay how much did you spend exactly in Astop. </garnt>
<joey> - I spent $197. </joey>
<garnt> - What did you spend? </garnt>
<garnt> - 22,380 Yen. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck I spent 22,190. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, come on. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. Here we go. </joey>
<garnt> Closest to 69 (laughs) closest to $69. </garnt>
<garnt> This was the meme one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know at all about this one. </garnt>
<joey> For me it was the Shonen Jump thing </joey>
<joey> which was 4,980 Yen. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. Mine was mine was the Edward Elric one. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah - Which was 5,299. </connor>
<connor> - All right, I win $66 baby. </connor>
<joey> on the Giorno Giovanna one funny enough. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh shit. </garnt>
<joey> - So the one that I had no choice to buy </joey>
<connor> got me another point so, sweet. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God I'm gonna fucking lose. </joey>
<connor> Okay, normy awards </connor>
<garnt> so whoever has my highest rank on Mal loses the point. </garnt>
<connor> - I think I lose this, right? </connor>
<joey> - What did you get? </joey>
<garnt> - Attack on Titan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that higher than Fullmetal Alchemist. </garnt>
<garnt> - Attack on Titan is number two I think </garnt>
<connor> if I looked correctly. </connor>
<garnt> - Ooh I thought I lost. </garnt>
<connor> - Number one is Death Note. </connor>
<joey> - Okay I'm definitely saved </joey>
<connor> because mine was </connor>
<joey> the Monogatari which is 56 - Yeah, most popular </joey>
<joey> according to myanime list </joey>
<connor> is Death Note, Shingeki no Kyojin SoldaT online </connor>
<connor> then Fullmetal Alchemist by the way. </connor>
<garnt> - How did I not lose that one. </garnt>
<connor> Because I saw by boy Levi. </connor>
<connor> Where is he? ,.Where is it? </connor>
<connor> Look at how beautiful he is, okay, I could not. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - So I lose a point. </connor>
<connor> So Connor loses a point. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. Final one, </joey>
<joey> buying a hentai figure. </joey>
<joey> Okay, So I-- </joey>
<joey> - I mean that's zero points for me, baby. </joey>
<connor> - I'm gonna argue this. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Okay here's why. </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize this </connor>
<garnt> but you can replace Rias's tits to be uncensored. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you serious? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I didn't know what that was </garnt>
<garnt> until I opened it up. </garnt>
<garnt> Those are just nipples. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know, </garnt>
<garnt> they came with interchangeable nipples. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. Wait, how do you take those off? </connor>
<joey> It's not the thing that-- - We're going to find that out </joey>
<connor> after the, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I think - Oh, so they're </connor>
<connor> attached to the head. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I would like to argue </connor>
<joey> that you bind the Dakimakura already counts </joey>
<garnt> as like a hentai thing. </garnt>
<joey> - But that wasn't a figure </joey>
<garnt> but I think that uncensored nipples </garnt>
<garnt> counts as a hentai figure because we can't show it-- </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, but is it though? </garnt>
<connor> Cause it's High School DxD. </connor>
<connor> It's not technically hentai. </connor>
<connor> - I mean-- </connor>
<connor> - If there's tits out though is it a hentai figure. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I would like to argue that </joey>
<garnt> if it's something we can't show on this podcast </garnt>
<joey> then I think it counts. - Of which I have two now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly fucking degenerate grading. </joey>
<connor> - Then I think I get a point. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, we'll give Garnt the point </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't a hentai figure so. </garnt>
<garnt> - No that's just a cultural figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man I'm so fucking glad I bought this figure now. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, this single figurine clutched you the victory like. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Okay. And the total scores were </joey>
<joey> Connor with 12 points, Garnt with 12 points </joey>
<joey> and I got seven points. </joey>
<connor> - I would have won this </connor>
<connor> if I didn't buy the Attack on Titan figures by the way. </connor>
<joey> - I would have won this if I was actually smart. </joey>
<joey> - I probably would have lost this </joey>
<garnt> if I didn't buy this one single figure. </garnt>
<connor> - So it was also your downfall </connor>
<garnt> but it also got you all the points in all this. </garnt>
<joey> - It got you more positives than negatives this thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Because, God, when we were like </garnt>
<garnt> going through all these challenges </garnt>
<garnt> because we had completely forgotten the overall challenges </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, wait a minute. </garnt>
<garnt> I think this one figure could be a lot of these challenges. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like. </garnt>
<connor> - I totally forgot we put hentai figure in there. </connor>
<connor> I would have bought a shitty one if I remembered </connor>
<garnt> - Because like, it would have been hard because-- </garnt>
<connor> - There's not many hentai figures. </connor>
<connor> - No ,because all of the hentai figures </connor>
<garnt> were like 100s of dollars. </garnt>
<connor> They're very expensive. - Yeah they normally are, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, you know </garnt>
<connor> it's a very cultured island-- </connor>
<joey> - I just like to point out </joey>
<joey> that over all of these like overall challenges </joey>
<joey> I only got a 1 point. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - You hate to see it. - And that was the fact </garnt>
<joey> that Puck is the lowest rated out of everything here. </joey>
<joey> - I think the thing is, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that he went all out with that, </joey>
<joey> I was a bit more conservative, </joey>
<joey> spread my money out you know. </joey>
<joey> And then you kind of. </joey>
<garnt> - I just bought shit that I like. </garnt>
<joey> - You went mid-range. </joey>
<joey> You were like I'll keep buying kind of expensive things </joey>
<connor> but not really. </connor>
<connor> - I was just like, I like this shit, </connor>
<joey> I'll just buy it. </joey>
<garnt> - This is what happens </garnt>
<garnt> when you try to strategize and just. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs). </garnt>
<joey> - I will at least like the credit </joey>
<garnt> of probably getting the coolest one. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] No. - That's cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] You can have that point Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I'll have that point. - You can have that fake point </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm still not going to win. </garnt>
<connor> I'll take the pity points, fuck you. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love this figure. </connor>
<connor> This is such a nice figure, holy shit. </connor>
<joey> - Well, since I lost I guess </joey>
<joey> I have to eat a horrible thing. </joey>
<connor> I think our producer Meilyne brought something </connor>
<joey> which I am not looking forward to eating. </joey>
<connor> - Well that already. </connor>
<connor> I can't even smell it </connor>
<connor> but I can picture what it smells like. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I've opened it. - Thank you Meilyne </connor>
<connor> our amazing producer. </connor>
<joey> - All right. Well my challenge has arrived. </joey>
<garnt> Hey, it's Tai. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - So what is this? </garnt>
<joey> - It's pickled mud fish. </joey>
<garnt> - So apparently according to our producer </garnt>
<garnt> this smells awful-- </garnt>
<joey> - And apparently is just as bad </joey>
<joey> if not worse than a surstromming </joey>
<garnt> which is like pickled </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's like merkel or something. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like Swedish thing that all YouTubers eat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. Do you want, you wanna open it up </garnt>
<garnt> and give it a smell there Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'll give it a sniff. </joey>
<connor> - What's it kinda like. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God I just saw that man go to heaven. </connor>
<connor> I saw that man go to heaven. </connor>
<connor> - That smells like actual like poop. </connor>
<garnt> - You went to heaven there. </garnt>
<joey> - Smell it. - I can smell it </joey>
<garnt> from here man. </garnt>
<joey> - Smell it, like put his nose in it. </joey>
<joey> (grunts) </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Oh what the fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - This looks really bad. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] It looks and smells poop. </joey>
<connor> - It's like vomit, bro. </connor>
<connor> You're not going to be able to beat that down. </connor>
<garnt> - I've smelled this before. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Of course you have, it's Tai </connor>
<connor> - Oh jeez it's fucking stinking up the office. </connor>
<connor> Fucking eat it quick </connor>
<connor> - Okay. I mean we have no utensils </connor>
<garnt> so I'm just gonna have to get in there. </garnt>
<joey> - Can you eat that? - I think I've eaten that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. - You have eaten it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's like really salted fish, right? </joey>
<garnt> So it's going to be super salty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh God, what the fuck! </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just going to grab like a piece of it </joey>
<joey> if you don't mind. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God, wait, just show it on camera show. </garnt>
<garnt> Show that piece on camera. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt are we gonna sensor that? </garnt>
<joey> Like Jesus! </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> It's smells from here. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. Careful with the bugs. </joey>
<joey> - Is that enough? </joey>
<garnt> - Just don't get on the microphone please. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bon a petite. </garnt>
<garnt> (soft electric music) </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] How is it? </joey>
<joey> - Tastes like I'm eating dirt. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Oh God that's (grunts) </garnt>
<garnt> That's so salty. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just salted fish, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's so salty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why I'm leaking my fingers. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing heartedly) </garnt>
<garnt> - Ooh, get me some more of that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Get this man some water. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh,it's getting worse. </joey>
<joey> - Because what kills you is the fucking after taste. </joey>
<joey> The first few bites aren't that bad </joey>
<joey> but the more you chew it </joey>
<garnt> the more like the flavors come out </garnt>
<garnt> and then the after taste just it hits you </garnt>
<garnt> and your breath is gonna stink for like a fucking week. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> I got it down. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. Well done. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God this fucking stinks now like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey guys. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> How are you. </garnt>
<joey> - You should wash it down with the durian. </joey>
<joey> I think that would be a good idea. </joey>
<garnt> The thing is you did lose pretty badly on this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh I can still smell it. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe your durian will help. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey coughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Do you wanna smell my finger? </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Sticky fingers. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh stinky fingers more like it. </connor>
<joey> Oh Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - Stinky oh oh. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, it's actually getting worse. </connor>
<connor> - Oh that smells viral. </connor>
<connor> I can still smell it what the fuck. </connor>
<connor> I don't think, </connor>
<garnt> like I have eaten a lot of weird foods in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> This is easily the grossest thing I've ever had. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I feel sorry for you Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Do you smell it over there? </connor>
<connor> Oh Jesus it's concentrated </connor>
<garnt> it's like a fucking-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the smell is getting stronger. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah we're in the fallout zone </connor>
<connor> here like, my God! </connor>
<joey> - It's like a nuclear blast. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like fine if I hold my nose </joey>
<joey> because like, I don't like smell the thing </joey>
<connor> but the moment I get it out, </connor>
<joey> oh, I could smell my own breath </joey>
<joey> and it's fucking viral. </joey>
<connor> - Next time next week when we do the podcast </connor>
<connor> Joey we'll still be smelling it. </connor>
<joey> - Well I really just hope </joey>
<joey> this doesn't give me like an illness </joey>
<connor> because we're like going on a trip tomorrow. </connor>
<connor> - Offending all Tai people right now. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I mean like I hope I don't get like food poisoning </garnt>
<joey> because like, we're going on a vacation tomorrow. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah - And I don't want to be sick. </joey>
<joey> Oh God, this mic is gonna fucking stink </joey>
<connor> I'm sorry. - It's awful. </connor>
<joey> - We're gonna have to like spray this mic here. </joey>
<joey> - We can open the windows </joey>
<connor> when we finish this episode, like Jesus. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey exhales deeply) </garnt>
<garnt> - So now that the challenge is over </garnt>
<garnt> what are you guys' closing thoughts? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm glad I didn't literal eat shit. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs heartedly) </connor>
<garnt> I mean, you know, the ultimate goal was; </garnt>
<garnt> to one, not lose and become like this man </garnt>
<garnt> who's going through like the five stages of grief </garnt>
<joey> with his face. </joey>
<joey> - I'm definitely at the last stage. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we got to decorate the office. </joey>
<joey> I think by a miracle </joey>
<garnt> we got like some pretty good variation. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I honestly would love </garnt>
<garnt> to do something like this again in future </garnt>
<joey> with another challenge where we can each go and film </joey>
<joey> our own parts-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm surprised that out of all the things that we bought </joey>
<joey> not a single person bought the same thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because that was the thing </garnt>
<joey> I was most worried about, right? </joey>
<garnt> When I, you know, pitched the challenge </garnt>
<connor> the thing I was worried about was like </connor>
<garnt> what if we all just go for the same fucking figures. </garnt>
<connor> - 10 Dekus, I would like three of your finest Dekus. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Because yeah, I had a lot of fun </garnt>
<joey> filming in the stores </joey>
<joey> and I would love to do something like this again. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if you guys enjoyed seeing the aftermath </joey>
<garnt> of all our different individual challenges </garnt>
<garnt> and how we like approached it and everything. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I think it's street rolls. </connor>
<garnt> I think we had fun with every step of this process. </garnt>
<joey> So I really hope that was reflected in the video. </joey>
<joey> - I got to ask you though? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Because this is </joey>
<garnt> your first time doing like a video filming </garnt>
<garnt> in public you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. - I'm used </garnt>
<garnt> to embarrassing myself in public. </garnt>
<garnt> Like how was it? I got to know </garnt>
<connor> - It was hard. </connor>
<joey> It was so hard. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] We saw you struggling at the beginning. </joey>
<joey> - Like I was out of Animate when I was filming my intro. </joey>
<joey> I don't even know if you're gonna see that </joey>
<joey> because I'm I'm thinking about filming </joey>
<joey> like a separate intro anyway. </joey>
<joey> But I was just like tripping over my words. </joey>
<joey> I had no idea. </joey>
<joey> Like give me a script, great. </joey>
<joey> I can read off the script. </joey>
<joey> If I just have to talk </joey>
<joey> about my thoughts without any scripts. </joey>
<joey> And like, a podcast is different in my mind </joey>
<joey> because I have people to bounce off. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> Because when I'm looking at a camera </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, Hey guys, there, I'm here outside of an Animate, </garnt>
<joey> and I'm like, Oh shit man. </joey>
<joey> - It's like someone trying to speak English </joey>
<joey> for the first time. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's definitely a skill you learn I think. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I mean I was awkward as fuck </connor>
<garnt> I remember the first time I filmed. </garnt>
<joey> And I hated it. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think I got used to it </joey>
<joey> when I just, hit Astop. </joey>
<garnt> Animates, I was still like getting my feet on the ground. </garnt>
<joey> With Astop I was just, I think it was </joey>
<joey> thanks to just the place as well </joey>
<joey> because I wasn't thinking about what challenges there were </joey>
<connor> I was just thinking </connor>
<connor> about getting as many fucking figures as I could. </connor>
<connor> - I did, I got a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah you certainly fulfilled that. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it was a lot of fun </joey>
<joey> I think as well like a great environment </joey>
<garnt> like when you get permission to film in a place </garnt>
<garnt> and you just go wild. - Yeah absolutely </garnt>
<connor> because the original plan for this video </connor>
<connor> was just to like MacGyver our way through. </connor>
<connor> - Go pro or underover. </connor>
<connor> - Under the chin guards. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That would have not been that great. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. But I mean, I haven't edited the video yet </garnt>
<garnt> but I think it's going to be pretty entertaining. </garnt>
<joey> And you guys can let us know as well </joey>
<joey> like, how you guys found those videos </joey>
<joey> how you found this episode. </joey>
<joey> Hopefully you guys enjoyed </joey>
<joey> watching me eat literal shit on camera. </joey>
<connor> This is easily the worst fucking thing I've ever had. </connor>
<connor> I can still fucking taste it. </connor>
<connor> I really want you guys to smell my finger. </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm not smelling your finger Joey </connor>
<connor> - Please. - No! </connor>
<garnt> - Can you do it at least for the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. Come on, I smelled that shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Get that shit away from me! </connor>
<connor> (exhales loudly) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I definitely </connor>
<garnt> even though this was it like a logistical nightmare planning </garnt>
<garnt> speaking about logistics from episode one, </garnt>
<garnt> this was like an actual logistical nightmare planning </garnt>
<joey> all day. </joey>
<joey> So we had to like bounce stores </joey>
<joey> and it was short notice and everything. </joey>
<joey> Like, I would definitely be up for doing something </joey>
<joey> where it's like three angles again </joey>
<connor> and it's a challenge that we conclude on the podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Because like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not sure if you've seen the video </garnt>
<garnt> but by the time we got to Amiami </garnt>
<garnt> I was exhausted. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it was kind of like that feeling </garnt>
<garnt> when you've just spent an entire day at a con working </garnt>
<connor> and you're like I've got to do one more panel. </connor>
<connor> - It was just a con in general. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - And fuck it, Oh we've got to have dinner? </connor>
<connor> Oh shit I wanna sleep. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Like I remember post-filming </garnt>
<connor> I just went home and collapsed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, same. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't leave my bed. </connor>
<garnt> - I think we walked like 10 kilometers that day. </garnt>
<garnt> I checked my like, stamps. </garnt>
<connor> - Typical Tokyo day. </connor>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<joey> - You've done a lot of walking when you come to Japan? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah but I think-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so what was the favorite thing you guys bought then? </garnt>
<joey> - That's a good question. </joey>
<garnt> - Easy for you. </garnt>
<connor> - Instinctively I want to say like, I mean yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's a good fucking figure. </connor>
<connor> - It's a solid figure </connor>
<connor> but I think the most interesting figure </connor>
<connor> and like coolest one that I'm glad I bought </connor>
<joey> was maybe the Akira one. </joey>
<joey> which I thought was just so fun, </joey>
<connor> or the Levi one. </connor>
<connor> Mike Wazowski though. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> That's such a good figure. </garnt>
<connor> - Like all ironicly that's a good figure. </connor>
<connor> - That's fucking good figure. - Yeah </connor>
<garnt> - And also the 500, </garnt>
<garnt> I've forgot the name of the character for Shinley's dad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gendo </garnt>
<connor> - Gendo figure, fine yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That's a good deal. </joey>
<garnt> - I think my favorite was definitely the Jump. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh that's so sick. </connor>
<joey> - Because it's so unique. - I love unique figures </joey>
<joey> because they have so many figures that look alike. </joey>
<joey> - And who doesn't like Jump. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That it's just going to look good. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Okay what's the worst figure you think </connor>
<connor> each of us bought. </connor>
<connor> - The worst figure? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I'm gonna have to agree. </joey>
<connor> - This thing, what the hell? </connor>
<joey> (joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I don't know actually, </joey>
<joey> I liked all the figurines I bought. </joey>
<connor> Maybe that's why it lost. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - What's the worst figurine you think I bought? </connor>
<garnt> - The worst one you bought? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you bought so many I can't remember. </garnt>
<joey> - That's pretty bad. - It's probably that one. </joey>
<joey> - You've not gotten the monogatari one. </joey>
<joey> That's kinda-- </joey>
<joey> - Excuse you. </joey>
<joey> That's kinda Trash Taste if I do say so. </joey>
<connor> - Do you want to smell my finger. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing heartedly) </joey>
<garnt> - Smell my finger. </garnt>
<garnt> I have a registered weapon now right here. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and there's not much to say really. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like we've </garnt>
<connor> adequately roasted each other's purchases. </connor>
<garnt> - And I guess I wanted to give a shout out </garnt>
<connor> to all the stores we visited. </connor>
<connor> - Oh Yeah - Absolutely. </connor>
<connor> - Because, okay, so disclaimer, </connor>
<connor> we might've shit on like some of the things we bought </connor>
<connor> but the stores were fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah really competent as well. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, if we showed on those figure </joey>
<joey> this isn't representative to </joey>
<joey> what they had at the store. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, because some of them were just </joey>
<joey> we needed to buy stuff just to fulfill the challenge. </joey>
<joey> I wish I could have bought something </joey>
<joey> but a pop figure for Asuka. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> The Amiami has so many good figures, okay? </joey>
<garnt> The Amiami have so many good figures </garnt>
<garnt> but I had to settle for this. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. All the stores were fantastic </joey>
<joey> and again, like thank you guys </joey>
<joey> for like giving us permission on such short notice as well </joey>
<joey> because we're a bunch of really loud YouTubers </joey>

<joey> were right next to each other as well </joey>
<connor> so if you go, there's no reason not to go like all of them. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. They were all like what, </joey>
<garnt> Less than 10 minutes walking distance from one another. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt sorry I duped you. </joey>
<garnt> - I've completely forgotten </garnt>

<garnt> because I don't want you speaking anymore </garnt>
<garnt> than you two need to. </garnt>
<connor> - Can I say one thing before you do the outro? </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - It's a callback to previous episode </connor>
<connor> I imagine that's what Joey's finger smelled like </connor>
<connor> after he rated School Days a 10. </connor>
<connor> (garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I'm not over that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey guys, before we sign off </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanted to give a quick shout out to today's sponsors. </garnt>
<garnt> Now this is a very long name </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm going to have to read it out. </garnt>
<garnt> It's sponsored by Animationism, </garnt>
<garnt> a project by Japan Media Arts Festivals Oversea Promotion </garnt>
<garnt> initiated by the Agency for Cultural Affairs of Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Man, that was a mouthful. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a serious mouthful if you ask. </garnt>
<joey> But if you guys don't know what they are </joey>
<joey> they have a lot of interviews with Japanese creators </joey>
<joey> and also with a lot of Japanese Anime studios as well </joey>
<joey> and a whole lot more. </joey>
<garnt> - Anyway, they're having a free anime screening </garnt>
<garnt> this weekend online </garnt>
<garnt> which you can check out in the description below. </garnt>
<joey> - So for those of you who want to know </joey>
<joey> the name of the three anime films </joey>
<joey> it is Colorful Ninja Iromaki. </joey>
<joey> The second one is Matasaburo on the wind. </joey>
<joey> And the third one is simply titled Rebecca. </joey>
<garnt> - So basically these are three films </garnt>
<garnt> from the Young Animate Training Projects. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you've ever watched something like Death Billiards </garnt>
<garnt> or the original Mi Mi Mi. </garnt>
<garnt> Those are films that came from this project </garnt>
<garnt> so by watching them you can support the anime industry </garnt>
<garnt> and that's fucking awesome in my opinion. </garnt>
<joey> - So if you are interested </joey>
<joey> in the art of Japanese culture and animation then make sure </joey>
<joey> to go down to the links in the description below. </joey>
<joey> And thank you once again for sponsoring today's episode. </joey>

<joey> - It actually smells like Satan empteid his trash </joey>
<connor> into my mouth. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't lose </connor>
<connor> I'm happy I got a good figure. </connor>
<garnt> - I am still surprised that when we and Connor, drawn </garnt>

<joey> is actually not a figure. </joey>
<joey> Just saying like, I mean, then I would win. </joey>
<joey> - Look I already lost, all right. </joey>
<connor> - Look I wanted to get the top. </connor>
<joey> He's already dead. </joey>
<joey> (soft soul music) </joey>
