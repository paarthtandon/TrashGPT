<joey> I look completely different oh yeah I </joey>
<joey> just wanted to point that out I know we </joey>
<joey> like brushed over that but uh yeah </joey>
<joey> friendship with Joey the anime man has </joey>
<connor> ended I'm Joss the mongolad now yeah you </connor>
<connor> look like the hacker character in the </connor>
<connor> movie that doesn't want to explain how </connor>
<connor> the hacking works </connor>
<connor> am I going like crazy or is like the </connor>
<connor> internet gotten like the worst in like </connor>
<connor> the past five years am I crazy I don't </connor>
<connor> think you're crazy at all I feel like </connor>
<connor> it's gotten significantly worse no no no </connor>
<connor> the whole internet but the way as in </connor>
<connor> like the level of like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up [ __ ] yeah maybe that was </connor>
<connor> messed there was a lot of messed up </connor>
<connor> stuff like you know five six years ago </connor>
<connor> whatever but like I feel like now it's </connor>
<joey> all just out there I feel like it's just </joey>
<joey> so it's so interesting how it's like </joey>
<joey> almost like an opposite effect that's </joey>
<connor> happening like for somehow for some </connor>
<connor> reason even though the internet or the </connor>
<connor> internet culture and people on the </connor>
<connor> internet in the past five six years have </connor>
<connor> gotten more PC than ever before and yet </connor>
<connor> like almost counterintuitively there's </connor>
<joey> more [ __ ] up [ __ ] that has like come </joey>
<joey> out onto the surface as well I think </joey>
<connor> that's why I'm like retaliation yeah I </connor>
<joey> don't know yeah you see the more because </joey>
<joey> like like I've seen I I see [ __ ] now on </joey>
<connor> like regular Twitter and Instagram that </connor>
<joey> you know you'd only ever find on like </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] B board yeah it's weird man </connor>
<connor> because you're just like I'm I'm I weird </connor>
<joey> for for being like middle ground on </joey>
<joey> everything like I feel like I have very </joey>
<joey> normal opinions yeah but the more I'm </joey>
<connor> online I'm like am I am I not normal do </connor>
<joey> I have not normal opinions yeah like </joey>
<connor> what is a normal yeah yeah just like </connor>
<connor> being I feel like being fair I'm like I </connor>
<connor> don't really have heavy opinions on well </connor>
<joey> I see other people I'm like oh my God </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah I mean Common Sense has </joey>
<joey> definitely become less common artificial </joey>
<joey> it's weird I mean I don't know what's </joey>
<garnt> common sense anymore yeah it does feel </garnt>
<garnt> like is is this the point where you know </garnt>
<garnt> the where the older generation starts </garnt>
<garnt> talking about [ __ ] talking the newer </garnt>
<garnt> generation you know what I mean like </garnt>
<joey> these damn kids </joey>
<connor> did you ever think like you do this is I </connor>
<connor> I think it's the opposite I I think it's </connor>
<connor> because the internet in general has </connor>
<connor> become more accessible to every age </connor>
<connor> group that are seeing all of this </connor>
<connor> because before it was just it was just </connor>
<joey> like 20 year olds who who gave enough </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] to go on yeah like social media </connor>
<joey> yeah and I felt that it was a very </joey>
<joey> exciting time and everyone was like </joey>
<joey> really into it and you know and new </joey>
<joey> websites the new hipster Miniclip was </joey>
<joey> still thriving you know </joey>
<connor> Farmville was still going strong </connor>
<garnt> um Mafia City uh I'm just gonna keep </garnt>
<garnt> naming good old days I feel like now </garnt>
<connor> because it's become so normalized and </connor>
<garnt> everyone uses it yeah like do you </garnt>
<garnt> remember do you remember a point where </garnt>
<joey> it felt like there was a separation </joey>
<joey> between what you did on the internet and </joey>
<joey> what happened in real life oh absolutely </joey>
<joey> and I feel like when that barrier kind </joey>
<joey> of like kind of like got broken where </joey>
<joey> you felt like what happened in the </joey>
<connor> internet was like was pertaining to like </connor>
<connor> your active your your at your how can I </connor>
<connor> say this because like isn't that is real </connor>
<joey> life but it didn't feel so like </joey>
<connor> suffocating yeah you know it didn't feel </connor>
<joey> like it didn't feel like you had a yeah </joey>
<joey> had a tangible effects on your you know </joey>
<joey> on your day-to-day life but now it feels </joey>
<garnt> like whatever's going on in the internet </garnt>
<garnt> whatever's going on in the world has </garnt>
<garnt> this tangible effect to this tangible uh </garnt>
<garnt> the tangible effect on what's going on </garnt>
<joey> in you know what you're doing you </joey>
<joey> literally just explained the plot to </joey>
<joey> serial experiments Lane like oh yeah </joey>
<connor> what's the time you think it is I'm </connor>
<connor> curious if you have the same opinion on </connor>
<joey> this would you what you said the time </joey>
<garnt> when it felt like that became the time </garnt>
<joey> when it fell I became like I feel it </joey>
<joey> depends on how long you've been on the </joey>
<joey> internet right like yeah did you ever do </joey>
<joey> like Myspace uh no I came right after </joey>
<joey> myself </joey>
<joey> I had Bieber I did that was very popular </joey>
<joey> in League yeah okay yeah would you would </joey>
<joey> you say like so like the bibo in Myspace </joey>
<joey> here right it's like roughly the same </joey>
<joey> time I would say yeah right like when </joey>
<joey> you were on bibo and when people on </joey>
<joey> MySpace were on MySpace did you see that </joey>
<joey> as like this is me like completely </joey>
<connor> terrible is a game right yeah it's it's </connor>
<connor> like how I go into Sims and I make </connor>
<joey> myself look attractive I think yeah </joey>
<joey> because like that's how I kind of traded </joey>
<connor> Myspace </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it's it's like I I think </garnt>
<connor> I think what really uh the first time I </connor>
<connor> really thought of social media as a game </connor>
<connor> was actually uh so Charlie Brooker do </connor>
<connor> you know Charlie Brooker he wrote Black </connor>
<connor> Mirror yeah so like a few years ago or </connor>
<connor> maybe even a decade ago I can't remember </connor>
<connor> how old this video is he did like a top </connor>
<connor> 50 most influential games of like all </connor>
<connor> time and uh like number one was Twitter </connor>
<connor> like that like and and I was just like </connor>
<connor> what are you talking about Charlie </connor>
<joey> Brooker because before that he talked </joey>
<connor> about you know games like that's not a </connor>
<joey> game Last of Us [ __ ] Tetris you know </joey>
<connor> all these games and none and he was just </connor>
<connor> like well think about it you play as an </connor>
<connor> avatar on an online platform where you </connor>
<connor> gain points for interacting with the </connor>
<joey> game and I'm just like yeah I mean he's </joey>
<joey> kind he's very right he's like social </joey>
<joey> media at this point is a game and we are </joey>
<joey> all for like </joey>
<joey> the game now is our job you know it it </joey>
<joey> is our job because we're falling right </joey>
<joey> into the system we are we are part of </joey>
<joey> the system guys we can't criticize the </joey>
<joey> system because we are the system we are </joey>
<joey> the system we are part of the system but </joey>
<connor> that that is definitely how social media </connor>
<connor> has become and I mean like in a way like </connor>
<connor> I see especially like YouTube and stuff </connor>
<connor> as like a kind of like a game I mean </connor>
<connor> it's been it's been gamified to [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> post a video of this game you post a </connor>
<connor> video and it even puts you on a </connor>
<garnt> Leaderboard on like how well he has </garnt>
<garnt> performed in like in the past 10 uploads </garnt>
<connor> you've done but but the game the the </connor>
<connor> stakes to it or whatever you give it </connor>
<connor> yeah like a game is it's the same with </connor>
<joey> anything right like it you know [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> jumping whatever whatever it is it's the </connor>
<connor> game only in zero days the the game only </connor>
<joey> means whatever you you assign to it yeah </joey>
<connor> right so if you with the videos right if </connor>
<connor> you're making these videos for the </connor>
<joey> purpose of of cracking that one out of </joey>
<connor> ten then yeah if you're making the video </connor>
<connor> because you want to make a video and I </connor>
<joey> think it would though it's a game yeah </joey>
<joey> like when you get to that point it's </joey>
<joey> like like you're kind of testing the </joey>
<joey> limits on what you can call a game right </joey>
<connor> like you know is the stock market a game </connor>
<connor> Yeah well yeah some people will say yes </connor>
<connor> your life some people say yes some </connor>
<connor> people say no it's it's roulette with </connor>
<connor> extra steps </connor>
<joey> it's really it's we're all like with </joey>
<joey> massive repercussions let's rule out </joey>
<joey> where there's a really really boring </joey>
<garnt> option that will probably pay you back </garnt>
<garnt> or you can spin the wheel yeah spin the </garnt>
<connor> wheel spin the wheel good coin </connor>
<connor> come on </connor>
<connor> it's like deal or no deal but it's </connor>
<connor> actually serious yeah I felt like the I </connor>
<connor> don't know when the internet started to </connor>
<joey> become very very real if you will yeah </joey>
<joey> uh but it definitely jacked up to 100 at </joey>
<joey> 2016. I think that was when it </joey>
<joey> definitely like what 2016. schedule </joey>
<joey> election huh first presidential uh </joey>
<joey> Trump's presidential election I feel </joey>
<joey> like that's when it just went boom </joey>
<connor> that's when like the two the split went </connor>
<joey> like crazy I felt like the the left </joey>
<connor> leading internet right-wing internet </connor>
<joey> just went really full-on I think it </joey>
<joey> might fall I think it might be earlier </joey>
<joey> and it's just </joey>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube Rewind started becoming [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> okay </connor>
<joey> I don't know because it was that like 24 </joey>
<joey> 2014. okay oh yeah yeah okay </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just thinking yeah </garnt>
<connor> as in when everything on the internet </connor>
<connor> stopped being universally loved yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah basically when we started like </garnt>
<garnt> being segmented I guess I I just like </garnt>
<connor> I'm just going I just tried to verbalize </connor>
<connor> how I felt I'm just like kind of feels </connor>
<connor> around the same time that I stopped </connor>
<connor> giving a [ __ ] about YouTube Rewind yeah </connor>
<connor> so that kind of feels like it was 2014 </connor>
<joey> 2013 maybe something like that very like </joey>
<joey> very early on when I stopped when the </joey>
<joey> when the internet stopped being like one </joey>
<joey> conglomeration and just because and you </joey>
<garnt> see things happening and you just didn't </garnt>
<garnt> recognize who this person was who that </garnt>
<garnt> person was people stopped getting along </garnt>
<garnt> uh and you know factions and groups </garnt>
<connor> started to form and uh yeah but that's </connor>
<connor> why I took something like the the </connor>
<joey> presidential election which is like the </joey>
<joey> most uh televised horse race in </joey>
<joey> existence yeah it's like it's so you </joey>
<joey> know other countries we don't you know </joey>
<joey> the UK it's like yeah we have this whole </joey>
<joey> thing about who the new prime minister </joey>
<joey> is going to be but yeah we don't nearly </joey>
<connor> like make it as exciting you know as </connor>
<joey> America does America's so good </joey>
<connor> I felt like it was the perfect event </connor>
<connor> that was so polarizing and so well </connor>
<connor> telegraphed with so much information in </connor>
<connor> so many parties putting stuff into it I </connor>
<connor> think regardless of your opinion on it </connor>
<connor> yeah and who you voted for I'll give a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] I'm just saying you can't ignore </joey>
<joey> the fact that this was a thing that just </joey>
<connor> really took the internet and just </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] ran I think it's also around the </joey>
<joey> time roughly when like a lot of social </joey>
<joey> media sites were like just where that </joey>
<connor> kind of discussion was just becoming </connor>
<connor> more open like that was roughly around </connor>
<connor> the time where like Twitter increased </connor>
<connor> their like character limit yes people </connor>
<connor> were like so people you know could only </connor>
<joey> tweet about like Yay Obama won and that </joey>
<joey> was it and now it was like let me write </joey>
<joey> a full [ __ ] novel about how I feel </joey>
<connor> about this presidential election and </connor>
<connor> then you know this is when they also </connor>
<joey> after that is when the platform started </joey>
<joey> having to correct misinformation yeah </joey>
<joey> and that further caused more of a device </joey>
<joey> yeah and then now there's just </joey>
<joey> definitely different platforms for </joey>
<connor> different opposing views so now you </connor>
<connor> don't even get you don't even get to </connor>
<garnt> hear the other side yeah I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> what was so prevalent about just not </garnt>
<garnt> just the presidential election but just </garnt>
<garnt> that year in general was that it felt </garnt>
<garnt> like that was the real turning point for </garnt>
<garnt> where social media kind of felt just </garnt>
<garnt> like a TV show it was like a part of </garnt>
<connor> entertainment right where the the </connor>
<connor> presidential uh election is the most is </connor>
<connor> the best rated TV show of all time I'd </connor>
<garnt> probably say yeah everyone Tunes in to </garnt>
<garnt> watch the next episode yeah I mean like </garnt>
<garnt> I mean it even had Like A build-up </garnt>
<garnt> season though which was uh brexit right </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> we had like the mid-season is that the </joey>
<garnt> pilot episode that was the mid-season </garnt>
<garnt> twist right we had the mid-season twist </garnt>
<garnt> and we're like guys this show can't get </garnt>
<garnt> any better there's no possible way they </garnt>
<joey> can surprise me but jokes on you you'll </joey>
<connor> never expect what comes next okay just </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] look right look at the how </connor>
<connor> they decide the nominee for the </connor>
<connor> presidential thing look at that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's laid out like Who Wants To Be A </connor>
<joey> Millionaire yeah they're in the </joey>
<connor> semi-circle with all this amazing </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] TV show s Britain's Got Talent </connor>
<connor> background and they all take turns a </connor>
<connor> massive audience and [ __ ] what is this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah like what who gives you let </connor>
<connor> the party pick and then we'll [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> decide who wins this this whole thing is </connor>
<garnt> so reality TV show-ass yeah it's so </garnt>
<garnt> bizarre like when you sit down and </garnt>
<garnt> you're like what am I watching like this </garnt>
<garnt> is this is [ __ ] up yeah like okay </garnt>
<garnt> here's a question do you think that </garnt>
<garnt> people cared about politics as much </garnt>
<garnt> before and we were just like too </garnt>
<garnt> ignorant because we were like too young </garnt>
<garnt> at the time or do you think people care </garnt>
<garnt> more now because of the prevalence of </garnt>
<garnt> social media and just so many people </garnt>
<garnt> verbalizing their opinions </garnt>
<joey> I don't think it has to do with the </joey>
<joey> amount of people caring I think it just </joey>
<joey> has to do with how much we are just </joey>
<connor> exposed to it now yeah so I I think one </connor>
<connor> of the main things here is that you have </connor>
<connor> to bear in mind as well that I think </connor>
<connor> like with with the internet this is just </connor>
<connor> giving everyone the platform yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> so like before if you're one of the if </connor>
<connor> you wanted to get support as a </connor>
<connor> politician you had to go on like a TV </connor>
<joey> show and then say something right yeah </joey>
<joey> or if you're in Japan you blare out of a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] megaphone in the Stream </connor>
<connor> annoyingly so like now it's like okay so </connor>
<connor> you have like the kind of Perfect Storm </connor>
<connor> of like </connor>
<connor> now there's more ways to to discuss </connor>
<connor> everyone's on the internet not even 40 </connor>
<connor> 50 year olds are on the internet so </connor>
<connor> they're willing to listen to you yeah </connor>
<connor> combine that with the fact that it's </connor>
<connor> become really easy to give politics a </connor>
<joey> kind of tribalism with nothing to do </joey>
<joey> with it right so the whole vaccination </joey>
<joey> thing or whatever and all that nonsense </joey>
<joey> nonsense but the whole argument around </joey>
<joey> it yeah yeah it very quickly stopped </joey>
<joey> becoming about the science and more just </joey>
<joey> about like which horse are you backing </joey>
<joey> yeah so I feel like now it's became </joey>
<joey> political it's gotten really easy to </joey>
<joey> just assign identities to certain </joey>
<joey> political views yeah and this is how </joey>
<joey> politicians have realized that they can </joey>
<joey> push their agenda is by just giving it </joey>
<joey> like are you a real American then you'll </joey>
<joey> believe in this right it's like how </joey>
<joey> about you just if you push it used to be </joey>
<connor> before I felt like it was just about </connor>
<connor> more so it was like this is the policy </connor>
<connor> this is what we're going to do and now </connor>
<connor> it's like all right we have to give </connor>
<connor> everything a meaning you're either with </connor>
<connor> us or you're not here's here's the </connor>
<connor> meaning between it and all that kind of </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] I could explain this better if I </connor>
<connor> was more eloquent with my words but </connor>
<joey> unfortunately that isn't the case I mean </joey>
<connor> I mean they did that subtly with the </connor>
<connor> holobola crisis right that was the exact </connor>
<joey> same thing like it suddenly became like </joey>
<joey> are you with us or are you not with us </joey>
<joey> do you care about these people then you </joey>
<joey> should be with me it's like but it's got </joey>
<connor> nothing to do with it in one case sorry </connor>
<connor> whatever the Ebola stuff like what what </connor>
<joey> do you mean well like it very quickly </joey>
<connor> became like especially in America became </connor>
<connor> like a political drive right for like </connor>
<connor> the campaigns and whatnot and it's just </connor>
<connor> like well oh that's it yeah oh I don't </connor>
<connor> remember it absolutely did and then when </connor>
<connor> the actual election finished </connor>
<joey> everyone stop talking about it because </joey>
<joey> it's as if it had nothing to do with the </joey>
<garnt> American elections yeah because I think </garnt>
<garnt> it's just it's much easier instead of </garnt>
<joey> proving yourself right to prove the </joey>
<joey> other person wrong oh yeah by proving </joey>
<joey> the other person wrong you're in a sense </joey>
<joey> proving yourself right even though </joey>
<joey> that's not how it works at all you know </joey>
<connor> like when did uh </connor>
<connor> when did like Ben Shapiro start owning </connor>
<connor> people with facts and Logics all right </connor>
<connor> because I feel like that's when it </connor>
<connor> started you know at the same time I </connor>
<connor> believe yeah yeah when it was when it </connor>
<connor> wasn't about being involved in politics </connor>
<garnt> it was just like you know you start off </garnt>
<garnt> watching someone else just like owning </garnt>
<garnt> other people when they're like </garnt>
<garnt> logistical like logical arguments </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you know it became part of </garnt>
<connor> entertainment it was like the what's </connor>
<garnt> this guy the proved me wrong guy oh um </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I like that as well just like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] exploded out of nowhere too yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's weird how seeing the seeing </garnt>
<garnt> these waves come up first it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> you know you have the group that proves </garnt>
<connor> the other group wrong and then and then </connor>
<connor> after a while people get bored of that </connor>
<connor> and then it's like people proving that </connor>
<connor> group wrong and it's just it's just like </connor>
<garnt> it's it's a constant you know it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a constant ping pong [ __ ] yeah as </garnt>
<garnt> well you know there's it's information </garnt>
<connor> on a lot of things there's always way </connor>
<connor> more nuanced than people want to to get </connor>
<connor> into right so a lot of the time if you </connor>
<connor> just take one correct argument or one </connor>
<connor> correct fact about a flawed argument </connor>
<garnt> right you can just run with that and </garnt>
<garnt> push that and say like look this is this </garnt>
<garnt> is right even though in in context it </garnt>
<garnt> might be incorrect but you can just keep </garnt>
<garnt> running with something that that you </garnt>
<garnt> know that you you can power and it's </garnt>
<garnt> safe to do so yeah and even then even if </garnt>
<garnt> you're wrong it doesn't matter because </garnt>
<garnt> as we've learned is that if you're a </garnt>
<garnt> narcissist and you're willing to not </garnt>
<garnt> give a [ __ ] if people are trying to </garnt>
<garnt> cancel you yeah uh people have really </garnt>
<garnt> people have learned that canceling only </garnt>
<garnt> does [ __ ] if you give a [ __ ] yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> and people are being rewarded in Mass uh </garnt>
<connor> you know and a lot of those people like </connor>
<connor> that who uh even though they get [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> wrong as long as they don't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> and they just make something new or </connor>
<connor> don't mention it and just continue on it </connor>
<connor> doesn't matter you get what you want you </connor>
<connor> get your platform you can continue you </connor>
<connor> can get new followers oh you lost you </connor>
<connor> lost a few hundred followers oh you'll </connor>
<garnt> get a new thousand who cares yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly it's like negative it's there's </garnt>
<garnt> never been more of a time when I've </garnt>
<garnt> realized that you know bad was it like </garnt>
<garnt> bad press or bad like there is no such </garnt>
<connor> thing as bad bad press bad press yeah </connor>
<connor> it's as bad as you you give a [ __ ] and </connor>
<connor> yeah the thing is as well as a lot of </connor>
<connor> people have realized a lot of you see </connor>
<connor> this on YouTubers aren't influencers </connor>
<connor> it's as bad as you let it seem it is as </connor>
<connor> well so if you're like you know that's </connor>
<connor> that's why a lot of the scandals around </connor>
<connor> the presidential election that happened </connor>
<connor> in 2016. a lot of them because if the </connor>
<connor> guy who you're supporting is like it's </connor>
<connor> not a big deal yeah then maybe you'll be </connor>
<connor> like oh it's not it's not a big deal </connor>
<connor> yeah I guess not yeah yeah yeah you know </connor>
<connor> like there's kind of there is a kind of </connor>
<connor> uh it's as bad as they let it seem right </connor>
<connor> yeah if you address it'd be like I don't </connor>
<connor> give a [ __ ] or you don't even bother to </connor>
<garnt> address it then you know yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean I think I think you're right </garnt>
<garnt> in a sense and I I feel like even more </garnt>
<garnt> so was when it was like when Trump got </garnt>
<garnt> elected like you know regardless of your </garnt>
<joey> opinion you know of him as a president </joey>
<joey> or me as an outsider who is you know not </joey>
<joey> any part of American politics it was </joey>
<joey> almost like watching a character in a </joey>
<joey> show you know like like see like going </joey>
<garnt> on your Twitter timeline and seeing some </garnt>
<joey> of the stuff that he's cartoon villain </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah like remember like the whole </joey>
<joey> conf [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that shows like I don't care what where </joey>
<connor> you lie in the political Spectrum I </connor>
<joey> think we can all unanimously agree that </joey>
<connor> called fifth was [ __ ] hilarious </connor>
<joey> and yeah it kind of like well I don't </joey>
<joey> know what the right word is but I kind </joey>
<joey> of like cartoonified [ __ ] yeah kind of </joey>
<joey> like cartoonified your you know your </joey>
<joey> real life and you know the world events </joey>
<joey> even though even though there is you </joey>
<joey> know even though these were real </joey>
<joey> prevalent issues and he's had a real </joey>
<joey> cartoon about it these had these had a </joey>
<joey> real tangible effect on the world and I </joey>
<joey> feel like especially a lot of the </joey>
<connor> younger generation who you know who have </connor>
<connor> grown up in the age of the internet </connor>
<connor> um that's that's kind of like the </connor>
<connor> environment they've grown into you know </connor>
<connor> where where everything when it's seen </connor>
<garnt> through a phone or through you know </garnt>
<garnt> through uh with through a tablet they </garnt>
<connor> just like it's like suddenly not real </connor>
<connor> yeah because we're like we were like </connor>
<connor> what 20 plus when all this started </connor>
<connor> happening oh no yeah 20 uh yeah maybe </connor>
<garnt> just nine I was like 19. but like I've I </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't imagine going from like 12 to </garnt>
<joey> like 18. yeah and this has been your </joey>
<connor> like entire memory yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> like it's really pissing off yeah crazy </joey>
<connor> and you know we know we talk about it on </connor>
<connor> the podcast or political views or our </connor>
<garnt> political opinions because I I the most </garnt>
<garnt> part I don't give a [ __ ] what you </garnt>
<garnt> believe in yeah yeah exactly I have my </garnt>
<garnt> own opinions but I'm also not I'm not </garnt>
<joey> like I don't think I'm some kind of </joey>
<garnt> benevolent man who knows all yeah right </garnt>
<joey> I know that I have probably have come to </joey>
<joey> conclusions on things with through </joey>
<joey> flawed like uh thinking methodology </joey>
<connor> whatever the [ __ ] you say just because </connor>
<connor> of how I've been raised right and you've </connor>
<connor> been raised whatever way you have and if </connor>
<connor> you disagree with me on things I don't </connor>
<connor> give a [ __ ] how you came back religion </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna judge you I feel like one </connor>
<connor> of the biggest problems that's come out </connor>
<connor> of all this is that everyone's calling </connor>
<connor> each other stupid for believing in </connor>
<connor> something and I'm like I'm sure you have </connor>
<connor> a reason if we if we just spoke to each </connor>
<connor> other normally and didn't polarize each </connor>
<joey> other all the [ __ ] time just you know </joey>
<joey> agree to disagree right it's like we're </joey>
<joey> not here to [ __ ] like you know dangle </joey>
<joey> a [ __ ] carrot in front of your face </joey>
<joey> being like believe us because we we hold </joey>
<connor> the truth and it's like no no one does </connor>
<connor> it sucks as well because obviously with </connor>
<connor> the whole chronovirus stuff and that all </connor>
<connor> got politicized of course yeah of course </connor>
<connor> it did that unfortunately came at the </connor>
<connor> cost of people's lives yeah and you know </connor>
<connor> the people who felt they were right felt </connor>
<connor> so strongly they were right because they </connor>
<connor> thought that you know they're like yeah </connor>
<connor> we have to protect people and yeah </connor>
<connor> that's fair enough but it's it's kind of </connor>
<connor> difficult to convince people when you're </connor>
<garnt> calling them stupid yes it's been shown </garnt>
<garnt> that it doesn't work no no no I mean I </garnt>
<connor> think another big massive thing with the </connor>
<connor> age of the Internet is just like the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] overload of information right </connor>
<connor> where where it's like I remember a point </connor>
<connor> where you you know read something in a </connor>
<connor> book or read a newspaper or something </connor>
<connor> and you know you you'd kind of like </connor>
<garnt> educate yourself but it feels like there </garnt>
<garnt> is just so much information right now </garnt>
<garnt> that I don't even know what information </garnt>
<garnt> is the right information to educate </garnt>
<joey> myself right right so what are the times </joey>
<joey> yeah so many times I look at something </joey>
<joey> online and I think like oh man this is </joey>
<connor> kind of interesting piece of information </connor>
<joey> a couple of hours later I found out it's </joey>
<joey> total [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> sometimes you even you hear about a </garnt>
<garnt> story or an event and you're like [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> man that [ __ ] it's like crazy like </joey>
<joey> yeah I get told by like five or six </joey>
<joey> different people being like have you </joey>
<joey> seen this thing and I'm like well [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> if there's five or six people around me </connor>
<connor> that I know yeah and I understand yeah </connor>
<joey> who's telling me that this is happening </joey>
<joey> then it must be true and I'm like turns </joey>
<connor> out nope all [ __ ] when you were a </connor>
<connor> kid right did you think that people were </connor>
<connor> stupid </connor>
<connor> like you think that you're like too </connor>
<connor> smart in what context just in general </connor>
<connor> like as a kid I was one of those little </connor>
<connor> kids that just thought like in school I </connor>
<connor> think I half the reason I was angry half </connor>
<connor> the time right so I thought like this is </connor>
<connor> so dumb I'm smarter than all this </connor>
<connor> right I can't even remember I just </connor>
<joey> wanted to play video games I didn't </joey>
<joey> really oh [ __ ] I didn't feel that </joey>
<connor> strongly about things and so I I I was </connor>
<connor> like I thought as a kid I just thought I </connor>
<joey> was smarter than people around me right </joey>
<joey> yeah right I think everyone had that </joey>
<connor> phase though right right but I think </connor>
<joey> people don't grow out some people don't </joey>
<joey> grow up some people grow don't grow out </joey>
<joey> of it obviously yeah because it's really </joey>
<connor> interesting because I was just scrolling </connor>
<connor> on Reddit yeah God forbid and I I saw </connor>
<connor> this and it was like a post where I was </connor>
<connor> like I think everyone else is dumb and </connor>
<connor> it's infuriating having to talk to </connor>
<connor> people right yeah and then it was really </connor>
<connor> interesting seeing how people were </connor>
<connor> trying to reply to this and kind of like </connor>
<connor> break it down and ultimately and I I </connor>
<connor> think this is really good and I think </connor>
<connor> that everyone should keep this in mind </connor>
<connor> because I feel that </connor>
<connor> we judge people based on how they speak </connor>
<connor> not how their level of intelligence is </connor>
<connor> yeah right and I feel like this </connor>
<connor> definitely happens on the podcast I've </connor>
<connor> seen it in the comment section where we </connor>
<connor> might have a bad take or we might badly </connor>
<connor> explain something yeah and everyone's </connor>
<connor> like well Connor's dumb or Jerry's dumb </connor>
<connor> God's damn he couldn't explain this yeah </connor>
<connor> he's like it's it's so hard to grasp we </connor>
<connor> only can interact with people based on </connor>
<joey> the things they say right not how they </joey>
<joey> think because you're probably thinking </joey>
<connor> about things way deeper than you could </connor>
<joey> ever explain oh yeah about it right and </joey>
<connor> it's so hard to get that out of your </connor>
<connor> head when someone's talking to you </connor>
<connor> because you you have to you only have </connor>
<garnt> that to work I mean it's a skill and </garnt>
<connor> that's why like I have trouble properly </connor>
<connor> expressing myself unless it's written </connor>
<connor> down yeah which is why I script right </connor>
<joey> right because we can't do on the podcast </joey>
<joey> unfortunately but like uh and we can't </joey>
<garnt> like edit it either so like that's why </garnt>
<garnt> like I I know for a fact that I express </garnt>
<garnt> myself best in like text form or like </garnt>
<connor> written form but but also on the podcast </connor>
<connor> I think you're quite eloquent with the </connor>
<garnt> way you word things </garnt>
<joey> there has been several points well I </joey>
<joey> look at myself arguing an argument and </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like I'm a [ __ ] clown I </garnt>
<joey> deserve to be [ __ ] loud </joey>
<connor> trash takes comments it's been like it's </connor>
<garnt> a normal thing where they'll be like I </garnt>
<garnt> get what Connor's saying but he </garnt>
<connor> explained it badly yeah </connor>
<garnt> I'm extremely guilty of that I I do that </garnt>
<connor> a lot and there are a lot of things that </connor>
<joey> I try to explain but in the moment it's </joey>
<connor> just hard to get the worst because we </connor>
<connor> don't come into this it's not a debate </connor>
<connor> we don't script this [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> I get what you mean but you probably </joey>
<joey> should have double checked this like the </joey>
<connor> whole uh the [ __ ] the food illness </connor>
<connor> thing it's like yeah if you give me 20 </connor>
<connor> minutes in a room alone I could probably </connor>
<connor> prepare a decent argument yeah however I </connor>
<joey> don't yeah yeah but if it gave me time </joey>
<joey> to put it in an essay form oh I'm sure I </joey>
<joey> could tell you this is how real life is </joey>
<joey> and it's weird because I feel like when </joey>
<joey> I watch people as well speak and again </joey>
<joey> this is this is going back to how just </joey>
<joey> general life again this this ties into </joey>
<garnt> the previous topics with the online </garnt>
<garnt> right how we respond to people who have </garnt>
<garnt> or it might be uh have bad opinions on </garnt>
<garnt> things we observe to be bad opinions </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's so hard in this current </garnt>
<connor> climate online to just give people the </connor>
<garnt> benefit of the doubt and just be like I </garnt>
<connor> think you mean well and I don't think </connor>
<connor> like this this opinion you have that </connor>
<connor> could be hurting people I don't think </connor>
<connor> you genuinely want to hurt people yeah </connor>
<connor> it could be like you just have a bat you </connor>
<connor> just you have been misinformed and you </connor>
<connor> believe it yeah you genuinely think this </connor>
<joey> is helping people that's that's the </joey>
<joey> problem though is that like I feel you </joey>
<connor> know a lot of social media like Twitter </connor>
<connor> Reddit stuff like that is like 99 </connor>
<garnt> emotionally driven yeah right because of </garnt>
<garnt> just Humanity yeah that too but also you </garnt>
<joey> know a lot a lot of people like to think </joey>
<joey> that like oh I see this massive post on </joey>
<connor> you know massive comment replying to a </connor>
<connor> certain [ __ ] take on Reddit right and </connor>
<connor> they think like oh judging from the </connor>
<connor> length of this whole thing this must be </connor>
<connor> a very well thought well written </connor>
<connor> argument 90 of the time no it's it's </connor>
<joey> emotionally just it's emotional drivel </joey>
<joey> but that's unfortunately how the nature </joey>
<connor> of a lot of these internet arguments </connor>
<connor> yeah work right it's so depressing you </connor>
<connor> just like even when you go on the Reddit </connor>
<garnt> I'm like look at it and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> someone will say something that's being </garnt>
<connor> correct and it'll just immediately turn </connor>
<connor> into like argument yeah yeah it's like I </connor>
<connor> was like what why do you want to do this </connor>
<joey> don't you </joey>
<garnt> it's like no one's [ __ ] citing their </garnt>
<joey> sources in these kinds of comment </joey>
<garnt> sections it's all it's all emotional </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean like that's I mean that's </garnt>
<garnt> just how humans are like always and yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's why like that's why I don't </garnt>
<garnt> normally try to get involved on like a </garnt>
<garnt> platform like Twitter because like I do </garnt>
<garnt> you think anyone's ever changed their </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] mind from like a single tweet or </garnt>
<garnt> like or like a Twitter discussion I </garnt>
<joey> don't I can't see it happening I'd love </joey>
<joey> to meet someone who's like you know I </joey>
<connor> thought about this thing but then I saw </connor>
<connor> you know uh XXX Noob killer XX tweet </connor>
<connor> that I'd be like yeah you know what </connor>
<joey> you're right bro </joey>
<joey> opinion changed yeah just like that yeah </joey>
<connor> I've seen I've seen threads that maybe </connor>
<connor> you know we'll you know we'll just agree </connor>
<connor> to disagree you know the threads that </connor>
<connor> you you open up that like show all </connor>
<garnt> replies and you just keep scrolling down </garnt>
<connor> and it just never ends I see people </connor>
<connor> civilized on the internet and always </connor>
<connor> being real respectful each other is when </connor>
<connor> they're talking about porn yeah that's </connor>
<connor> the only time yes people do people are </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] polite to each other when </connor>
<connor> they're talking about porn and they're </connor>
<joey> so helpful and everyone's so helpful </joey>
<connor> about it but the moment it's anything </connor>
<connor> else it's like it they just stop going </connor>
<joey> at the throat it's the image of like all </joey>
<connor> the board members </connor>
<joey> I think that's a very good example right </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<connor> yeah it's like it's literally yeah very </connor>
<joey> civil right yeah I just love as well the </joey>
<joey> ones that like you know going back to </joey>
<joey> the whole like agreeing to disagree </joey>
<joey> thing like I've seen so many Twitter </joey>
<joey> replies of like how one side of the the </joey>
<joey> argument tries to you know start that </joey>
<joey> whole conclusion up being like you know </joey>
<joey> what let's agree to disagree but ninety </joey>
<joey> percent of the time the other party's </joey>
<joey> like no no no no no no no no yeah we're </joey>
<joey> not ending it here I'm not gonna agree </joey>
<connor> with disagree [ __ ] you how dare you you </connor>
<connor> you know this that people feel for some </connor>
<connor> reason feel safe discussing their </connor>
<connor> opinions about uh Paul and hentai </connor>
<connor> whatever because on some of these </connor>
<connor> Discord servers yeah where they talk </connor>
<connor> about Hentai people use their real </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pictures as their profile </connor>
<connor> pictures that's how safe they feel </connor>
<garnt> talking what the [ __ ] that's the that's </garnt>
<joey> the real safe space </joey>

<joey> is it that like the porn community on </joey>
<joey> Twitter is like some of the like </joey>
<garnt> chillest people the porn community in </garnt>
<joey> any Community yeah the chillest people </joey>
<joey> isn't it [ __ ] up that like a PornHub </joey>
<joey> comment section is more chill than like </joey>
<connor> a YouTube comment section I feel like </connor>
<connor> because you it's to have to interact in </connor>
<joey> a community you have to have a level of </joey>
<joey> self-awareness I think oh yeah yeah so I </joey>
<joey> think that's where it comes from it's </joey>
<joey> like yours are so self-aware that you </joey>
<connor> just don't give a [ __ ] anymore and </connor>
<garnt> that's when you're most designed yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah well basically it's it's a massive </garnt>
<garnt> barrier of Entry just to sign up an </garnt>
<connor> account to a porn site right that's a </connor>
<garnt> level that I just haven't been able to </garnt>
<garnt> take </garnt>
<joey> I just don't want to give my my Gmail </joey>
<joey> I just want to be at that morning where </joey>
<joey> I'm like I wake up in the morning like </joey>
<joey> making a pornography right the most </joey>
<joey> trash taste segue ever by the way can I </joey>
<joey> say that that we've gone from like very </joey>
<connor> serious topics to signing up to a pawn </connor>
<connor> okay I don't know </connor>
<connor> what kind of person is like I need to </connor>
<connor> just have my say in this I gotta have my </connor>
<garnt> I gotta make it known I feel like </garnt>
<joey> there's steps because I've never signed </joey>
<joey> up for a PornHub account yeah and I have </joey>
<connor> for like hentai sites right right yeah </connor>
<joey> because I have Yeah because sometimes </joey>
<joey> you find like a like a lit hentai like I </joey>
<garnt> want to remember this because I'm going </garnt>
<connor> to forget the name </connor>
<connor> as a free-to-play user of the the porn </connor>
<garnt> Universe I will say that he's the most </garnt>
<connor> annoying thing is trying to find a video </connor>
<garnt> that I did enjoy yeah because because </garnt>
<garnt> the problem is you know after you do the </garnt>
<garnt> deed you just you're not interested in </garnt>
<garnt> it anymore so you're like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] need this anymore and then you </garnt>
<garnt> just like it just goes out the recesses </garnt>
<garnt> of your mind and like [ __ ] a week </garnt>
<garnt> later you're like yo what was that </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] A-Class hentai there is a </connor>
<connor> sobering moment when you're trying to </connor>
<connor> type in the keywords to find the thing </connor>
<joey> yeah and you're like I'm disgusting </joey>
<joey> and you're just scrolling through these </joey>
<connor> videos trying to find it you're like no </connor>
<joey> no there's something wrong with me I've </joey>
<joey> gone to a point where I've like </joey>
<joey> anonymously gone into forums and asked </joey>
<joey> what's your profile pic I'm not telling </joey>
<connor> you do you know what Anonymous it's got </connor>
<joey> to be Joey I want it to be yeah yeah no </joey>
<connor> one would ever expect the Joey to use </connor>
<connor> his actual profile picture on the Forum </connor>
<joey> that's true but now everyone's going to </joey>
<joey> use yeah </joey>
<connor> but it's like I was yeah because I was </connor>
<connor> like I didn't know anyone at the time </connor>
<connor> right and I was in the exact same </connor>
<joey> situation where I was like I just saw </joey>
<joey> this thing but it was on incognito </joey>
<joey> no I don't remember what it was called </joey>
<joey> all I remember is like what the girl oh </joey>
<connor> my God if you could log in do you know </connor>
<connor> the login information did you still use </connor>
<joey> this account no not anymore I don't even </joey>
<connor> think the website exists anymore yeah </connor>
<garnt> that is the one problem with incognito </garnt>
<connor> mode is that it doesn't give you a </connor>
<garnt> search history yeah or a like or like a </garnt>
<joey> history like the moment the post not </joey>
<joey> Clarity hits and you close that window </joey>
<joey> you're like [ __ ] why did I do that I </joey>
<garnt> can't I can't go back now oh my God so </garnt>
<joey> yeah I was like one time I remember it I </joey>
<joey> was like I remember what the girl looked </joey>
<joey> like and I remember like a certain scene </joey>
<joey> so I was just like hey I'm looking for </joey>
<joey> this one series </joey>

<joey> recommendations but we've got something </joey>
<connor> you recommendations that's pretty close </connor>

<joey> depends because </joey>
<joey> hentai and stuff it's different yeah </joey>

<joey> compel me to want to pay </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't want to give my [ __ ] my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] credit cards </joey>
<connor> see that feels like such a you know when </connor>

<garnt> running for a political position and </garnt>
<connor> then it was found out they were spending </connor>
<connor> like like five grand a month on </connor>
<connor> pornography or something and I was like </connor>
<connor> I was like that's impressive yeah it's </connor>
<connor> to find ways to spend five grand that is </connor>
<joey> impressive you're definitely not </joey>
<garnt> watching all of it that's for sure yeah </garnt>
<joey> because how could you I don't think one </joey>
<garnt> person is capable of watching that much </garnt>
<garnt> porn how many many uh how many like how </garnt>
<joey> yeah how many only fans was these like </joey>
<joey> sub two all right yeah </joey>
<connor> we spoke about this right because we </connor>
<connor> spoke about that that one YouTuber who </connor>
<connor> had a porn addiction yes yes yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah I don't remember who it </joey>
<connor> was I do remember yeah that sounds </connor>
<connor> familiar it's like the most Chad </connor>
<connor> YouTuber apology not apology videos yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it was like he was never accused of </connor>
<joey> anything he just came out he's like guys </joey>
<joey> I have a porn addiction it's wrath I was </joey>
<joey> like yeah well it was like literally </joey>
<joey> ruining his life right yeah well it's </joey>
<joey> one of those things that I can always </joey>
<joey> die I always [ __ ] say it's one of </joey>
<garnt> those things I gotta stop saying that </garnt>
<garnt> Connor this is a message you stop saying </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of those questions it's </garnt>
<connor> literally my question for you I </connor>
<connor> it's one of those uh </connor>
<connor> that people talk about and oh sorry </connor>
<connor> people do not talk about it now yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and it it's one of those things </connor>
<joey> people don't want to give credit to it </joey>
<joey> or talk about it because it's just </joey>
<joey> really embarrassing oh yeah of course </joey>
<connor> there was your credit to how </connor>
<joey> debilitating it can be to have that </joey>
<connor> if you have it man I hope you can get </connor>
<connor> help I hope you can get out of it no </connor>
<garnt> shame to you man </garnt>
<garnt> it's because it's something that's just </garnt>
<joey> like it doesn't seem like on the </joey>
<joey> Forefront of things you should be </joey>
<joey> worried about you know like like you </joey>
<joey> know you can easily it's it's easy to be </joey>
<connor> able to justify to yourself oh yeah a </connor>
<connor> gambling addiction of course that's bad </connor>
<connor> you know like an active ruins your life </connor>
<joey> or like an alcohol addiction right I'm </joey>
<joey> just kind of destroying my body I'm </joey>
<joey> destroying all my relationships around </joey>
<garnt> me like a porn addiction because like </garnt>
<garnt> porn is so secretive anywhere you don't </garnt>
<joey> you don't really have anyone to talk to </joey>
<garnt> it about it's not it's not an immediate </garnt>
<garnt> threat I think is the thing because like </garnt>
<garnt> you know you hear about it's like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> of course I watch porn I'm an adult it's </garnt>
<connor> everyone does it it's fine you know </connor>
<joey> everyone most people are normal living </joey>
<connor> normal lives you know while watching and </connor>
<joey> then you know you go down the rabbit </joey>
<joey> hole deep enough and you realize oh it's </joey>
<joey> actually [ __ ] like we're just as bad </joey>
<garnt> at which point do you like accept that </garnt>
<garnt> it is an addiction and not just like a </garnt>
<garnt> recreational activity that everyone does </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> is it the hours spent consuming that </connor>
<connor> medium or is it the money spent </connor>
<connor> consuming that medium or is it both I </connor>
<joey> don't know is it when you can't think of </joey>
<connor> anything other than Paul because no no </connor>
<connor> one wants to help people who are </connor>
<garnt> addicted to porn because I don't think </garnt>
<connor> it's like a a thing yeah because they're </connor>
<garnt> like just just stop watching it oh </garnt>
<garnt> just stop jacking off just close your </garnt>
<joey> eyes </joey>
<joey> so put your dick away it's easy </joey>
<joey> like to me like I guess I don't know </joey>
<joey> what the actual definition of addiction </joey>
<joey> is but I guess when you should start </joey>
<joey> being worried about it is when it has </joey>
<joey> like I guess like a a tangible effect on </joey>
<joey> maybe your life yeah or in some way </joey>
<joey> shape from people like like affecting </joey>
<joey> negatively yeah yeah that's it a </joey>
<joey> tangible negative effect on your life or </joey>
<joey> an aspect of your life but then again </joey>
<joey> like when does it become a negative </joey>
<garnt> effect and when does it because just </garnt>
<garnt> become like oh yeah I just had a weak </garnt>
<garnt> binge drinking with the boys because we </garnt>
<garnt> were like partying a week you know like </garnt>
<garnt> like at which point does it become a </garnt>
<garnt> negative effect I don't know I guess </garnt>
<joey> that's the hard thing about it I think </joey>
<joey> it's when it's I think in my opinion I </joey>
<connor> think it's when it's like it's </connor>
<connor> consistently for a long period of time </connor>
<connor> and it's consistently just adding on to </connor>
<connor> a negative effect I think that's when it </connor>
<connor> becomes like a problematic addiction </connor>
<connor> because like you can like as you said </connor>
<connor> like you could have like a week being </connor>
<garnt> range of like drinking from morning till </garnt>
<connor> night with your boys right yeah but </connor>
<connor> you're most likely not going to be </connor>
<connor> drinking for a while after that right </connor>
<connor> like that I wouldn't count that as an </connor>
<connor> addiction like that's like a short-term </connor>
<connor> like binge that's just destroying your </connor>
<connor> body yeah that's just that's just </connor>
<connor> destroying your body having a good time </connor>
<connor> with the boys right but like you know </connor>
<connor> when it's like a constant amount every </connor>
<connor> day or you know for a long period of </connor>
<connor> time consistently yeah and it's just </connor>
<garnt> getting worse and worse and worse and </garnt>
<connor> worse I think that's when it's like yeah </connor>
<joey> okay you should probably seek help kind </joey>
<garnt> of thing that in my opinion I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> it's when you sign up to a PornHub </garnt>
<joey> account it's when you you're like you </joey>
<connor> know what I need people to know how I </connor>
<joey> feel about that [ __ ] scene like that </joey>
<connor> that's so good I need upvotes on my </connor>
<garnt> PornHub </garnt>
<garnt> that's the one thing I don't understand </garnt>
<garnt> I understand like I I the thing about </garnt>
<garnt> PornHub comments is that I understand </garnt>
<joey> people asking about like say [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Call of Duty's tactics or like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> how to get past this level uh rather </connor>
<connor> than people actually yeah rather than </connor>
<connor> people actually commenting on the pawn </connor>
<connor> itself like to me for some reason reason </connor>
<connor> like I don't know why you would ever </connor>
<joey> comment on like a porno right as like </joey>
<joey> because you're either like watching it </joey>
<joey> and you're actively involved or like </joey>
<joey> I've never gotten to a point where I'm </joey>
<joey> watching this I'm just like I want to </joey>
<joey> verbalize what I think what do people </joey>
<joey> think about this what I think about this </joey>
<joey> you know my favorites are the ones that </joey>
<joey> are just like just so simple like so so </joey>
<joey> innocent being like Oh man 1823 what a </joey>
<joey> hot scene I was like </joey>
<joey> yeah I guess so like come on thank you </joey>
<connor> for sharing that </connor>
<connor> um I wish I was that open I wish I was </connor>
<joey> there yeah yeah maybe one day maybe one </joey>
<joey> day </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] that Sydney's been tweeting you </garnt>
<garnt> know like I need to [ __ ] calm her </garnt>
<joey> down something yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't be surprised if she had a </joey>
<garnt> PornHub account yeah at this point I </garnt>
<connor> think it's just Twitter </connor>
<connor> she's gone beyond because she's gone </connor>
<joey> beyond man there's like why be anonymous </joey>
<joey> when I can be known oh God Jesus anyway </joey>
<garnt> have you guys been up to anything this </garnt>
<joey> past week that's not been depressing or </joey>
<joey> um I look completely different oh yeah I </joey>
<joey> just wanted to point that out like </joey>
<joey> I know we like brushed over that but uh </joey>
<joey> yeah it's uh friendship with Joey the </joey>
<connor> anime man has ended I'm Joss the manga </connor>
<connor> lad now </connor>
<joey> this is the the comments just like so I </joey>
<connor> got my ears pierced yeah that's one big </connor>
<joey> thing and then just yesterday I got my </joey>
<joey> hair cut yes so now I look completely </joey>
<connor> different yeah you look like the the </connor>
<connor> hacker character in the movie that </connor>
<connor> doesn't want to explain how hacking </connor>
<connor> works </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry they just kind of like piss </connor>
<joey> everyone off yeah but but they always </joey>
<connor> need him yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> I look like that guy now but like I just </connor>
<joey> loved uh so you know because I had like </joey>
<connor> the every time like I feel this is very </connor>
<connor> much like a YouTube thing but like even </connor>
<connor> if like you slightly change how you look </connor>
<connor> yeah or you know slightly do something </connor>
<connor> different right it's like to some people </connor>
<joey> it's like what the [ __ ] it's like the </joey>
<connor> end of the world type of thing right </connor>
<connor> yeah I think this is YouTube comments </connor>
<connor> work on the first thing they think they </connor>
<connor> can comment about they comment yeah so </connor>
<joey> it's always the appearance because you </joey>
<joey> see that first yeah and it's like every </joey>
<connor> time I get like my hair cut or like I </connor>
<connor> shave or you know I guess in this case </connor>
<connor> you know drastically change quite a bit </connor>
<connor> just my favorite things is just like </connor>
<connor> seeing the reception to it regardless of </connor>
<connor> if it's positive or negative like you </connor>
<connor> know to all the people who said like Hey </connor>
<connor> Joe you look good I appreciate that </connor>
<connor> that's [ __ ] dope thank you but my </connor>
<connor> favorites are the ones that of people </connor>
<connor> just like losing their minds in a </connor>
<connor> negative sense like like a family member </connor>
<connor> just yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> so the one I saw on it's always </garnt>
<garnt> Instagram that are the best ones okay </garnt>
<garnt> um but like when I when I got uh when I </garnt>

<garnt> length hair now you have like shorter </garnt>
<joey> hair uh to be fair this is the shortest </joey>
<joey> I think I've ever had it yeah and it's </joey>

<joey> good the bad one it feels good yeah but </joey>
<garnt> it's like obviously how easy it is it to </garnt>

<connor> enough in my own abilities to ever </connor>
<connor> change my own style somebody else has to </connor>
<connor> do it for me right right then I'm like </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> and then I stick with it yeah like to to </connor>
<garnt> me every every time I have changed my </garnt>
<connor> hairstyle in my life it's been someone </connor>
<connor> else recommending me a hairstyle to </connor>
<connor> change it to and I'm just like I don't </connor>
<connor> know if I like this I don't know if I </connor>

<garnt> thing here is [ __ ] stupid I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know what's up I don't know what I was </garnt>
<connor> thinking I've decided my hairstyle based </connor>
<connor> on what requires no gel or wax I just </connor>
<connor> hate putting [ __ ] in my hair yeah so I </connor>
<connor> just like whatever I can do when I roll </connor>
<garnt> out of bed is the one I'm going for so </garnt>
<garnt> envious yeah I I need I need I know it's </garnt>
<connor> not like perfectionists hand sculpting </connor>
<joey> the perfect I mean but I mean before </joey>
<connor> today's episode like majority of </connor>
<connor> episodes it's just my Bed Head yeah wait </connor>
<connor> I don't do anything with it it's so </connor>
<connor> funny though people asking like what </connor>
<joey> shampoo conditioner do you use I was </joey>
<joey> like uh Head and Shoulders </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] Dove like it's nothing special </joey>
<joey> yeah I don't know it's like for me it's </joey>
<joey> like like I'm given like this you know </joey>
<connor> job right like like youtubing and just </connor>
<connor> like being on social media where it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> this isn't gonna [ __ ] affect yeah </garnt>
<connor> like you know my videos right like it </connor>
<garnt> doesn't affect my job yeah it's just a </garnt>
<connor> matter of like personal preference so in </connor>
<connor> my head it's like why if I'm given this </connor>
<connor> opportunity where I can kind of </connor>
<connor> experiment with how I look and it not </connor>
<connor> really affect my job you know maybe it </connor>
<connor> might even affect it positively for some </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> why wouldn't I try it it's like you know </connor>
<connor> because like with my hair for instance </connor>
<joey> it's like if you hate this hair just </joey>
<joey> wait a month it'll go back to normal </joey>
<joey> it's gonna go back to the length you're </joey>
<joey> comfortable with it's fine but it's like </joey>
<garnt> you know why would I not give it a good </garnt>
<joey> but also I feel like a lot of that is </joey>
<connor> just people not being used to a look or </connor>
<joey> a new yeah of course because I I </joey>
<connor> remember like like I remember when I </connor>
<connor> first started growing out like a stubble </connor>
<connor> and everyone's like oh you look weird as </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] and even I did I thought man I look </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] weird I look [ __ ] weird as </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] with just a stubble because I've </connor>
<connor> never had a stubble or I've never like </connor>
<connor> grown out a stubble in my life even </connor>
<connor> though I've always known I could and I </connor>
<connor> remember like I was like working on uh </connor>
<connor> my latest Vlog and I was looking at you </connor>
<connor> know I was looking at my uh my trash </connor>
<garnt> taste video where I talk about trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste and then uh I was looking at the </garnt>
<garnt> previous Vlog I did before I was </garnt>
<garnt> recording this one and it was the BBC </garnt>
<garnt> video that I did without a stubble and I </garnt>
<garnt> was like man I look [ __ ] weird like </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> now I think I look weird without a </garnt>
<garnt> stubble and I look back at all trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste episodes and I'm like man I look </garnt>
<joey> really weird I don't know dude like when </joey>
<joey> you like go back to like episode one of </joey>
<garnt> trash days and I'm in a [ __ ] ponytail </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God I completely fine if I look at </garnt>
<joey> that and I'm like you look homeless I'm </joey>
<joey> so glad I don't look like this anymore </joey>
<joey> but back then everyone was like yeah the </joey>
<joey> Jesus here dude it looks [ __ ] sick </joey>
<joey> and back then I was like yeah yeah you </joey>
<joey> know what it kind of looks sick not </joey>
<joey> gonna lie but now I'm just like no it </joey>
<joey> like it it really got to the point where </joey>
<joey> like I knew it was gross when like even </joey>
<joey> Aki's mom who is like the most like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] accepting like kind like nervous </joey>
<joey> is a bad thing about anything just one </joey>
<joey> day was like I think you should cut your </joey>
<connor> hair </connor>
<joey> I was like if you're saying that maybe I </joey>
<joey> should yeah I think maybe I should the </joey>
<joey> mom not my own yeah I feel like I feel </joey>
<joey> like I needed to hear that though </joey>
<joey> because like that's probably how dire I </joey>
<connor> looked because like now now I know what </connor>
<connor> she means I look back and then I'm like </connor>
<connor> yeah you know what if I if I saw a guy </connor>
<connor> like that who I cared about I'd probably </connor>
<connor> tell him to cut his hair too yeah </connor>
<connor> because it's kind of gross but it's like </connor>
<connor> yeah I don't know it's like even with </connor>
<connor> the piercings as well it's like it was </connor>
<connor> surprising how a lot of people are like </connor>
<joey> Oh I thought your ears were already </joey>
<joey> pissed yeah and it was like yeah now </joey>
<garnt> that you say I don't know why I know </garnt>
<joey> it's never been that way but like you </joey>
<joey> had to have like that energy where you </joey>
<joey> had your ears pierced yeah you did you </joey>
<joey> did really because like when you said </joey>
<joey> you want your ears pierced I was like </joey>
<joey> didn't you already have your ears </joey>
<joey> pierced or am I just like dreaming that </joey>
<connor> up yeah everyone said that I was like </connor>
<joey> really it is weird how much like just </joey>
<connor> changing a little bit of your facial </connor>
<connor> features can change to perception yeah </connor>
<connor> when I was growing out my beard a little </connor>
<connor> bit I looked like [ __ ] Willem Dafoe </connor>
<garnt> from the lighthouse and I was like I </garnt>
<garnt> kind of digged it though but also at the </garnt>
<connor> same time it was really [ __ ] annoying </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah having it long actually you </garnt>
<garnt> actually reminded me of Linus Tech tips </garnt>
<joey> more than anything really yeah I don't </joey>
<joey> know why you just like I don't wanna </joey>
<garnt> wear sandals and socks side by side </garnt>
<connor> he is not a drip you know like I don't </connor>
<garnt> want to be comparedness I think he looks </garnt>
<garnt> good with a bit I I just like he wasn't </garnt>
<connor> willing to fight it was like it was like </connor>
<connor> Linus Tech tips with a beard energy that </connor>
<joey> I got for me I don't know I I take that </joey>
<connor> one moment I think it's very different </connor>
<connor> one I thought it is </connor>
<connor> I hear you it's like a 12 inch [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> what's is that like the biggest change </connor>
<garnt> you've ever done aside from like getting </garnt>
<garnt> your hair dyed and everything like that </garnt>
<joey> are you very much I think you turning </joey>
<joey> silver was the biggest change right that </joey>
<connor> was weird yeah well I look at that a lot </connor>
<connor> of weird I liked it when it was half </connor>
<joey> blonde half Brown kind of yeah dirty </joey>
<joey> blonde like when the silver was fading </joey>
<connor> right yeah I like that I liked it </connor>
<connor> towards the end yeah I like that like </connor>
<connor> segment but then uh it's like I don't </connor>
<connor> want to have to do it again also she </connor>
<connor> probably shouldn't be dyeing my hair </connor>
<connor> when I haven't got much left to it so </connor>
<connor> apparently that's a myth is it really </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah I don't know my hairdresser </joey>
<connor> was saying yes but she got stakes in it </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> well no yeah but </joey>
<connor> that's true but also she was saying that </connor>
<connor> like unless you're like directly </connor>
<connor> applying the bleach onto the scalp which </connor>
<connor> yeah a hairdresser shouldn't be doing to </connor>
<connor> begin with it doesn't affect true I mean </connor>
<joey> I don't know either way I I'm I'm yeah I </joey>
<joey> know what you're cautious about I've </joey>
<connor> gone out of that phase as well I feel </connor>
<connor> like I need to dye my hair I feel like </connor>
<connor> I'm just in them I'm in the Boomer stage </connor>
<connor> now but I'm like </connor>
<joey> it'll do whatever it wants and I will </joey>
<garnt> just deal with it it does feel like </garnt>
<garnt> regardless of age it does feel like a </garnt>
<joey> stage that every YouTuber goes through </joey>
<joey> yeah right it's like oh it's the died </joey>
<garnt> it's it's either they go through a bold </garnt>
<joey> stage or they dye their hair but it's </joey>
<joey> it's the it's the I'm a YouTuber with a </joey>
<joey> little bit of clouds </joey>
<joey> that is kind of like a YouTuber midlife </joey>
<garnt> crisis right away oh people are starting </garnt>
<garnt> to look at me maybe I should spice </garnt>
<connor> things up I never really wanted to dye </connor>
<joey> my hair it was like I think I was what </joey>
<joey> made you want to I think I was kind of </joey>
<joey> interested in it I was like I've never </joey>
<connor> tried it yeah I thought it could be </connor>
<connor> interesting and then when um uh </connor>
<connor> childhood who dyes your hair right yeah </connor>
<connor> she was just kind of like yeah let's </connor>
<connor> just do it I was like I mean I think I </connor>
<garnt> was in that phase I was like yeah [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it everything in my life is changing why </garnt>
<garnt> not yeah so I tried it and I remember I </garnt>
<connor> didn't like it initially I thought okay </connor>
<connor> and then it got to blonde and I thought </connor>
<connor> huh weirdly looks okay yeah I didn't </connor>
<connor> mind blonde yeah but then also </connor>
<joey> it did make me look a bit weird I don't </joey>
<connor> think the silver looked weird on you to </connor>
<connor> be honest I think out of out of all the </connor>
<garnt> I think that compared to like a red or </garnt>
<garnt> like a blue you know or like a you know </garnt>
<joey> like a standard like I am a YouTuber </joey>
<connor> YouTube gamer color like yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> compared to that I think </connor>
<connor> a ninja yeah yeah oh yeah ninja if you </connor>
<connor> had like ninja if you had ninja hair I </connor>
<connor> would have been like strong blue are you </connor>
<connor> a twitch streamer </connor>
<connor> I mean I've done like what five or six </connor>
<connor> different colors now yeah I've done like </connor>
<garnt> red blue green pink purple and now I </garnt>
<joey> have this like grayish completely </joey>
<garnt> rainbow yeah I have yeah you just wake </garnt>
<joey> up day one day you're just like I want </joey>
<garnt> to try something different today the </garnt>
<connor> starburst color am I doing today yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly but that's a that's a again </connor>
<garnt> that's an easy way to date my videos </garnt>
<connor> right like if I if like I know exactly </connor>
<garnt> what era this video is from just based </garnt>
<connor> on what color my hair yeah yeah so it's </connor>
<connor> kind of cool but yeah I don't know it's </connor>
<joey> like uh like if you don't like this </joey>
<garnt> that's totally fine uh you'll get used </garnt>
<garnt> to it within like a month you'll get </garnt>
<connor> used to it as well as with everyone yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah I'm not even used to it right now I </joey>
<connor> woke up this morning I was like like who </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] that I'm just praying I'm </connor>
<joey> like God please I hope I don't have a </joey>
<connor> weird shaped head when I get bored that </connor>
<joey> was the one thing I was worried about </joey>
<joey> just like it really shapes out my face I </joey>
<connor> don't know how how do you how do you </connor>
<connor> know what your the shape of your head is </connor>
<joey> you won't know yeah you don't know yeah </joey>
<joey> until you get to like this length and </joey>
<joey> you're like oh my head is [ __ ] weird </joey>
<connor> I feel like we should have found out a </connor>
<connor> way to figure out the shape of your head </connor>
<connor> without having to shave it all off </connor>
<connor> science come on we must have figured </connor>
<joey> something out right just like it scans </joey>
<garnt> which is the Contour of your head yeah </garnt>
<joey> I'm sure there's like a [ __ ] filter </joey>
<connor> or something yeah </connor>
<connor> the filters always look so [ __ ] they </connor>
<connor> always looks so cartoonishly bought like </connor>
<connor> like like like smoother more wait no </connor>
<joey> ball puzzle looks like this yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> like they just take this bald yeah </garnt>
<connor> Johnny Sins yeah yeah dude they all look </connor>
<joey> like that and it's like no Johnny Sins </joey>
<joey> doesn't even look like a real ball </joey>
<joey> person no he doesn't </joey>
<connor> what a man the king of balls many jobs </connor>
<garnt> um yeah aside from aside from Joey </garnt>
<joey> gang's haircut uh I I watched another </joey>
<joey> anime this uh this past week I watched </joey>
<joey> Jujutsu kaisen zero oh in in this in </joey>
<joey> cinemas how was it it was </joey>
<joey> say it say it God it was okay yeah not </joey>
<garnt> made I liked it I thought it was good it </garnt>
<joey> was good it was good it was it was did </joey>
<garnt> you watch it in four XD what's 4xd where </garnt>
<connor> they like spit on you and shake the </connor>
<garnt> chair and stuff no I didn't know that </garnt>
<connor> was enough did they have that for you </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> I I like the animation it was pretty uh </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if watching demon slay has </garnt>
<joey> just spoiled me in terms like Shonen </joey>
<joey> animations </joey>
<connor> I went into like the the not with like </connor>
<connor> the expectations that it was going to be </connor>
<connor> Demon Slayer move and train level uh but </connor>
<connor> I did come in knowing that that was the </connor>
<garnt> last shown in anime film that I had </garnt>
<garnt> watched in theaters </garnt>
<garnt> um and I came out being just mildly </garnt>
<garnt> amused and just impressed by some </garnt>
<garnt> animation points but at the end of the </garnt>
<joey> day it was like the most seven out of </joey>
<joey> ten yeah it was the story good </joey>
<joey> people in the cinema next to me were </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] bowling their eyes oh yeah of </connor>
<joey> course and I I was like yeah you good </joey>
<connor> literally everyone in the cinema is when </connor>
<connor> I watched movie and train was just like </connor>
<joey> just light sobbing from every corner of </joey>
<garnt> the room and I'm just like okay oh now </garnt>
<connor> this one next to me was like full on </connor>
<connor> balling and I was like </connor>
<garnt> are you okay </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like to to me Mugen train </garnt>
<connor> the thing that made Mugen train special </connor>
<connor> for a Shonen anime film was that it </connor>
<connor> actually felt Canon you know it actually </connor>
<connor> felt like it had a real tangible effect </connor>
<connor> on the story whereas I know that juicy </connor>
<connor> Kaizen zero is technically Canon because </connor>
<connor> it's technically supposed to be a </connor>
<connor> prequel but also it's like starring like </connor>
<connor> a main character that we hadn't seen </connor>
<connor> before </connor>
<joey> um and no it is Canon it's pretty cool </joey>
<connor> no it is it is it is it is Canon but it </connor>
<joey> didn't feel like anything I watched in </joey>
<garnt> the movie had any effect to like </garnt>
<garnt> anything I watched in the TV series a </garnt>
<connor> little bit a little bit very minimal </connor>
<garnt> though like mainly suit with the bad guy </garnt>
<garnt> right mainly to do with the bad guy and </garnt>
<garnt> then </garnt>
<connor> I find I like I found out spoilers from </connor>
<connor> the people I was watching it with and I </connor>
<connor> was like oh okay so </connor>
<connor> I'm not I'm not gonna tell me I'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna I'm not I'm not gonna spoil </connor>
<connor> um but but it had like it didn't really </connor>
<connor> have that much of an effect kind of felt </connor>
<garnt> like a side story if anything rather </garnt>
<garnt> than actually having a proper like I </garnt>
<garnt> should care about all the things going </garnt>
<garnt> on and I think that's my problem with a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of Shonen anime movies is that </garnt>
<garnt> there's zero reason for me to care about </garnt>
<connor> anything going on we spoke about this </connor>
<joey> like last time we spoke about movies </joey>
<joey> literally every one piece movie well </joey>
<connor> yeah you know it's a good experience but </connor>
<connor> it's a bit odd because it's like it's </connor>
<connor> just I think it's been number one of the </connor>
<connor> box office in Japan for 10 weeks now </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah of course yeah it's just like </connor>
<joey> these things are just running printers </joey>
<connor> after Mugen train this is like every </connor>
<joey> industry is just like Eagle Vision on </joey>
<joey> Cinemas now it's just like that's that's </joey>
<garnt> where the money is yeah I mean it feels </garnt>
<garnt> like the the industry is definitely </garnt>
<garnt> gearing up more towards movies because </garnt>
<joey> like yeah I mean Kevin's feel was like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] insane as well for that like </joey>
<joey> three month process of like all those </joey>
<garnt> yeah because like because like when I </garnt>
<garnt> got invited to see Jujutsu kaisen um I </garnt>
<joey> thought I oh it's a bit late isn't it is </joey>
<joey> is it still going to be in cinemas uh </joey>
<joey> because I missed out on seeing Dune </joey>
<joey> because that was only in cinemas for </joey>
<joey> like a month and a half or yeah maybe </joey>
<joey> even less in Japanese Cinemas but like </joey>
<garnt> with anime movies it just seems like it </garnt>
<joey> just never goes out dude move game train </joey>
<joey> was in cinemas for a year yeah like what </joey>
<garnt> a year like how how is it a year later </garnt>
<garnt> people are still seeing it in cinemas </garnt>
<connor> and they're still making money of this </connor>
<connor> show I mean that's I guess that's why </connor>
<connor> it's like the top grossing anime movie </connor>
<connor> of all time but like my time scale for </connor>
<connor> how long movies are in cinemas are like </connor>
<garnt> completely [ __ ] destroyed by anime </garnt>
<garnt> movies because they just never seem to </garnt>
<garnt> they never seem to go out they never </garnt>
<garnt> seem to they always seem to be in there </garnt>
<joey> how long has Jesus Christ have been in </joey>
<joey> cinemas for now oh it didn't come out in </joey>
<joey> it came out uh Christmas Eve oh [ __ ] so </joey>
<joey> it's almost three months yeah almost </joey>
<garnt> three months and it doesn't seem like </garnt>
<garnt> it's even close yeah to uh it doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> seem like it's easy because they have </garnt>
<connor> showings in four XD mxd whatever yeah </connor>
<garnt> they have uh 3D and they've told the </garnt>
<connor> utmost and there's like in this a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> ton goings yeah yeah like when I was </garnt>
<garnt> stuck in uh Hokkaido uh because the </garnt>
<garnt> airport has A Cinema there I was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I'll see what's playing </garnt>
<garnt> um literally every literally it was </garnt>
<garnt> Jujutsu Kyson zero for every single </garnt>
<garnt> place they didn't have any other stuff </garnt>
<garnt> no they did wait was it was it just one </garnt>
<garnt> screen was it multiple screens uh I </garnt>
<garnt> believe it was two screens oh yeah okay </garnt>
<garnt> that makes sense yeah because then like </garnt>
<garnt> in a there's a ton of Cinemas all around </garnt>
<garnt> Tokyo that have like 20 plus screens or </garnt>
<garnt> something ridiculous yeah and you can </garnt>
<connor> watch there's tons of foreign films so </connor>
<joey> many of them and you can want to use </joey>
<joey> Kaizen on seven of them yeah I watched </joey>
<connor> uh </connor>
<connor> operation mint speed that's what it's </connor>
<garnt> called the one with uh </garnt>
<connor> Colin first that's all that sounds like </connor>
<garnt> a real movie never heard of that at all </garnt>
<garnt> it's about like a World War II operation </garnt>
<connor> where they like made a uh fake person </connor>
<connor> but they got a real dead body and gave </connor>
<connor> it fake documents and then washed it up </connor>
<joey> in Spain was that like based off a true </joey>
<connor> story yeah it really happened oh wow </connor>
<connor> really cool really cool really really </connor>
<joey> cool story basically like they wanted to </joey>
<connor> make uh Germany think that the UK was </connor>
<connor> going to attack someone they weren't and </connor>
<joey> so the way they did it was by floating a </joey>
<joey> body to Spain with fake documents on it </joey>
<joey> and then Spain leaked it to Germany and </joey>
<joey> then Germany thought it was real damn </joey>
<joey> stuff because they made this person like </joey>
<joey> look so convincing that they were a real </joey>
<joey> person so he does </joey>
<connor> it's a really cool story but the movie </connor>
<connor> was [ __ ] oh okay is it a comedy is it </connor>
<joey> drama but the problem I I guess oh there </joey>
<connor> wasn't sure it was a very I was just </connor>
<joey> like comedy five or six </joey>
<joey> I don't know it's like it's like it's </joey>
<connor> focuses on like the personal drama </connor>
<connor> amongst the people who are doing the </connor>
<connor> operation yeah and so it's kind of like </connor>
<connor> it's like I love triangle and [ __ ] and </connor>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<connor> what this is </connor>
<connor> what do we I mean I I I don't know the </connor>
<connor> notebook of World War Two yeah yeah it </connor>
<connor> was just kind of like all right well the </connor>
<joey> the the thing is so interesting itself </joey>
<joey> at the whole story but obviously there's </joey>
<joey> not much known about it so they </joey>
<joey> obviously had to make it build it up </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah and so it's kind of like I </garnt>
<joey> mean the column foot's great he's always </joey>
<garnt> great yeah but it was just kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> all right just me yeah or like like </garnt>
<garnt> going back to what you said about yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was [ __ ] like I was having this </garnt>
<garnt> thought the other day because like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm getting so bored of the word mid </garnt>
<garnt> right because like it just seems like I </garnt>
<garnt> like I tweeted out a tweet about like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] Demon Slayer and the animation </garnt>
<garnt> and somehow that was like one of the </garnt>
<connor> most toxic Twitter tweets you talked </connor>
<connor> about demons animation why would you </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah that's what happened to me God </garnt>
<garnt> why would you do that I just said Demon </garnt>
<connor> Slayer had good animation about that </connor>
<connor> that was it oh it was it it was just </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah Demon Slayer I watched </connor>
<joey> season two and I'm like okay maybe it </joey>
<joey> did deserve best animation my [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> God my like I had I literally had to </joey>
<joey> mute that thread that thread compared to </joey>
<joey> everything else going on in the world </joey>
<garnt> that was the thread that I had to mute </garnt>
<joey> in the past week I'm like gagging just </joey>
<connor> thinking about that comments four clowns </connor>
<connor> right like it does have the best </connor>
<joey> animation it's not even like a contest </joey>
<connor> so people say there's other things about </connor>
<connor> no it's not is the story the best no but </connor>
<connor> like people are equating the fact they </connor>
<connor> don't like the show or they don't like </connor>
<connor> how much attention it's getting yeah </connor>
<connor> being like it doesn't deserve the best </connor>
<connor> animation listen it does it like it just </connor>
<connor> flat out does yeah it does that mean </connor>
<connor> that it's it's a good show no no it </connor>
<connor> doesn't is it a mid Shonen series like </connor>
<connor> story-wise yes yes it is but it but but </connor>
<joey> the but the animation is [ __ ] gotcha </joey>
<connor> wow </connor>
<joey> listen I I [ __ ] love Demon Slayer </joey>
<connor> right but it's the same reason why I </connor>
<connor> watch porn I like I like what's going on </connor>
<joey> the screen I don't like the plot I like </joey>
<connor> that I love Demon Slayer but it's like </connor>
<connor> the most like I love demons </connor>
<connor> you heard it here first I I [ __ ] I </connor>
<connor> was so high watching it bro yeah but to </connor>
<connor> sit here and be like it's a complex </connor>
<joey> storytelling it's not it's a super </joey>
<garnt> simple Shonen I I think what does mid </garnt>
<connor> mean to you what is what does mid mean </connor>
<garnt> to you what it means to me is that you </garnt>
<garnt> can watch it and there are many aspects </garnt>
<garnt> of it that you enjoy but there's also a </garnt>
<joey> lot of aspects about it that just don't </joey>
<connor> grip you like there's a lot about it </connor>
<joey> like Jesus Tyson no to me no because </joey>
<garnt> because I was I was having this thinking </garnt>
<connor> the story is made yeah yeah like you </connor>
<garnt> know like as an overall show it's good I </garnt>
<garnt> I think the story is you know slightly </garnt>
<garnt> above me I think it's a solid story it </garnt>
<connor> does everything slightly above </connor>
<joey> this is such a [ __ ] mean that's like </joey>
<garnt> saying like that's slightly above [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> because like the Train movie I'm gonna </connor>
<joey> say it was boring as [ __ ] I was bored </joey>
<joey> out of my mind watching that the whole </joey>
<joey> way no okay that was bitter it was good </joey>
<joey> but like the first first 60 the first </joey>
<joey> like 70 of that movie I was actually </joey>
<connor> like resident sleeper bro I was sleeping </connor>
<garnt> I I agree I I think I think people </garnt>
<garnt> forget that like because everyone only </garnt>
<garnt> thinks about the last fight and like the </garnt>
<garnt> last 30 minutes of that movie because </garnt>
<garnt> the last 30 minutes were [ __ ] great </garnt>
<garnt> they were [ __ ] amazing uh the actual </garnt>
<garnt> part when they were on the train was to </garnt>
<garnt> me pretty pretty boring as [ __ ] it was </garnt>
<joey> it was very hard where they're like </joey>
<joey> going to the dreams I was just like </joey>
<joey> snooze yeah yeah like literally snooze </joey>
<garnt> literally snooze yeah I don't know it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's yeah yeah but like to me like I had </garnt>
<garnt> this realization that to me like </garnt>
<garnt> something [ __ ] like when I say oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was pretty [ __ ] it was like it's a </garnt>
<garnt> five out of ten to me that's [ __ ] right </garnt>
<garnt> whereas you know like I don't know why </garnt>
<joey> is a five out of 10 [ __ ] to you I don't </joey>
<garnt> know why that's to me that board is on </garnt>
<garnt> like average yeah when was the last five </garnt>
<connor> out of ten thing you can tell you you </connor>
<joey> can tell yourself that five out of ten </joey>
<connor> in your head means that but it doesn't </connor>
<joey> five out of ten means right because </joey>
<joey> you're never gonna give anything a one </joey>
<connor> unless you really hate it right you'll </connor>
<joey> never you never have 100. see because in </joey>
<joey> my head like I'm operating on like the </joey>
<joey> the my anime list rating score right so </joey>
<garnt> when's the last time you in your mind </garnt>
<garnt> gave something a five out of ten you </garnt>
<garnt> could be watched red whatever right okay </garnt>
<connor> because right seven out of ten means </connor>
<connor> that you didn't hate it but you were </connor>
<connor> happy like you had an experience that </connor>
<connor> you were happy with yeah did it blow you </connor>
<connor> away no five out of ten means you're not </connor>
<connor> sure if you wasted your time and that </connor>
<connor> that's why it feels weird giving things </connor>
<connor> that you're like it's mid a five out of </connor>
<garnt> ten like I think a one out of ten isn't </garnt>
<garnt> even wasting your time because at that </garnt>
<garnt> point at that point yeah at that point </garnt>
<joey> you watch a one out and you're like this </joey>
<joey> is just entertaining this is this is so </joey>
<joey> it's just so bad that this is so like </joey>
<connor> like you watch exam you watch berserk </connor>
<connor> 2016 you're like okay I this is </connor>
<garnt> obviously like [ __ ] terrible but I'm </garnt>
<connor> having a good time watching this just to </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] on it so let's say like to me it's </connor>
<connor> like five is at the Middle where it's </connor>
<connor> like all right if you do nothing nothing </connor>
<connor> good and nothing bad you get a five </connor>
<joey> right it's the most basically no to me </joey>
<joey> to me a five out of ten when it comes to </joey>
<joey> anime so me a five out of ten is like I </joey>
<joey> finished watching it I feel nothing </joey>
<joey> about it and I forget about it in a </joey>
<connor> couple weeks if I want to send for me is </connor>
<connor> like have I wasted my time I'm not sure </connor>
<garnt> yes no no no five out of ten to me is </garnt>
<garnt> have I wasted my time yes this this was </garnt>
<joey> a waste of time it was right I I didn't </joey>
<joey> but it wasn't horrible </joey>
<joey> four to me is like I'm going to forget </joey>
<joey> about this but all I'm going to remember </joey>
<joey> about this show is that it was a waste </joey>
<garnt> of my time no no because here's here's </garnt>
<garnt> how here's how I think why when when we </garnt>
<garnt> say what the average when when we say </garnt>
<joey> about the middle of the ground what the </joey>
<joey> average score is most people will say </joey>
<joey> seven even though logically you think </joey>
<joey> it's four five okay so if it's a five </joey>
<joey> it's probably like the lowest that you </joey>
<joey> will ever finish a show because to me if </joey>
<joey> it's a three or four I'd probably watch </joey>
<connor> one or two episodes and I didn't even </connor>
<connor> finish it because there's nothing in </connor>
<connor> that to grab my attention five is just </connor>
<connor> like there was enough for me to finish </connor>
<connor> it and then I regret finishing it </connor>
<connor> because yeah because there was nothing </connor>
<garnt> in there that made me want to like </garnt>
<garnt> remember it or left an impact on me but </garnt>
<joey> the five out of tens are like in my </joey>
<joey> opinion they're the worst shows because </joey>
<joey> you just they're just thrown into this </joey>
<joey> pile of like oh yeah that existed out of </joey>
<connor> ten I give it like a seven okay because </connor>
<connor> it's like because because no no I </connor>
<connor> wouldn't I wouldn't consider that it's </connor>
<connor> slightly it's okay it's okay see to me </connor>
<connor> right when I hear it when you say seven </connor>
<connor> seven is like you were happy and had fun </connor>
<connor> watching it but the moment it's over you </connor>
<connor> don't feel compelled by the show at all </connor>
<connor> there's nothing that makes it like </connor>
<connor> really stick in your memory it's like </connor>
<connor> it's a good experience and you don't </connor>
<connor> regret it but nothing after the fact </connor>
<joey> makes you want to effectively think but </joey>
<joey> that's that's the thing it's like with </joey>
<joey> juicycin like I I finished it yeah and </joey>
<joey> it's like I had a you know pretty good </joey>
<joey> time watching it I was like okay yeah </joey>
<joey> this is this is good but like when it </joey>
<joey> was finished I was like am I compelled </joey>
<joey> to go read the Manga or like continue it </joey>
<joey> on not exactly like to me my hero </joey>
<joey> Academia is the exact same thing where </joey>
<joey> it's like season one it's like yeah it </joey>
<joey> was great yeah it was cool you know I </joey>
<joey> can see why people enjoyed it I had a </joey>
<joey> pretty good time with it am I compelled </joey>
<connor> to continue on with it personally no </connor>
<connor> what would you give the did you watch </connor>
<joey> any demonstrated season yet have you </joey>
<connor> watched it yeah yeah what would you give </connor>
<joey> it I personally even though I said the </joey>
<joey> story is not the best I still think it's </joey>
<garnt> I would give it an 8.5 to 9. um and </garnt>
<garnt> that's the the reason I say that </garnt>
<connor> agreement the Demon Slayer council is </connor>
<garnt> stronger yeah it was amazing because I </garnt>
<garnt> don't agree that the story is mid </garnt>
<garnt> because a lot of people say the story of </garnt>
<joey> Demon Slayer is mid and to me like demon </joey>
<joey> slayer's story it in it's as simple as </joey>
<joey> it needs to be right yeah I feel like </joey>
<joey> it's as simple as it needs to be to make </joey>
<joey> the rest of the good parts Shine the </joey>
<joey> problem with demon slay is like when you </joey>
<joey> have an arc like Mugen train and there </joey>
<joey> are like fights that aren't that don't </joey>
<joey> stand out as much it's like really </joey>
<joey> really apparent like just that the story </joey>
<connor> and the characters don't carry the show </connor>
<connor> as much but with season two because the </connor>
<connor> because half the season was just a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] full-on action fast you're like </connor>
<connor> you're like [ __ ] it out this is like a </connor>
<connor> Nissan 9 out of 10. and like that's </connor>
<connor> that's that's the point where okay I </connor>
<connor> don't really care about the story that </connor>
<garnt> much if the action just [ __ ] and </garnt>
<connor> slaps this hard yeah </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean you know what I </connor>
<joey> mean how dare you today </joey>
<joey> wow I don't think we've ever talked </joey>
<garnt> about that on the podcast </garnt>
<joey> I'm too afraid </joey>
<connor> because I've been on the other side </connor>
<garnt> quite recently can you cancel about </garnt>
<joey> talking about the animation </joey>
<joey> I'm just trying to think of like a five </joey>
<joey> out of ten this is the problem with </joey>
<joey> trying to remember a 5 out of 10 anime </joey>
<joey> show is that uh I don't remember that's </joey>
<joey> why there are five out of ten you know </joey>
<garnt> like the moment what about manga because </garnt>
<connor> you read more manga because I can </connor>
<connor> remember most five out of 10 shows it's </connor>
<garnt> literally like I go to the list of music </garnt>
<garnt> I finished I'm just like a lot of these </garnt>
<joey> are literally five out of ten even five </joey>
<joey> out of ten manga I'm like I don't I just </joey>
<joey> don't remember them and that's the </joey>
<joey> problem is like it's so hard to talk </joey>
<joey> about these kinds of like mediocre </joey>
<joey> middle of the ground shows it's because </joey>
<joey> like unless I recently re-watch it again </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna remember it I'm like oh </joey>
<joey> yeah it's probably something along those </joey>
<joey> lines but I could wouldn't be able to </joey>
<joey> like you know concretely tell you like </joey>
<joey> this is the reason why it's a five out </joey>
<joey> of ten it's just so like impactless that </joey>
<joey> it's just like oh I didn't even know </joey>
<garnt> that existed yeah you know I do feel bad </garnt>
<garnt> if you feel like you've wasted a time </garnt>
<garnt> watching a show no </garnt>
<garnt> um you know you don't no I feel like </garnt>
<joey> when you start caring that much about </joey>
<joey> the the media you're the media wise </joey>
<connor> something the media </connor>
<connor> you know stuff you're consuming I feel </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you almost ruin a lot of it for yourself </connor>
<connor> like stuff that you might have enjoyed </connor>
<connor> you just think you're worried too much </connor>
<joey> about if you're enjoying it the whole </joey>
<joey> time oh that's kind of where I got to </joey>
<joey> unfortunately with that like it's like I </joey>
<joey> it got to the point where I was so </joey>
<joey> selective on what I was watching to make </joey>
<joey> sure that everything I was watching was </joey>
<joey> worth my time that if I ran into </joey>
<joey> something that I was like well I just </joey>
<joey> wasted an hour because of watching these </joey>
<connor> first three episodes right I've I don't </connor>
<connor> know if this is like a I haven't </connor>
<connor> consciously chosen to do this but I've </connor>
<joey> stopped it's scrolling or looking for </joey>
<joey> shows yeah it's just kind of whatever </joey>
<connor> appears in front whatever whatever is </connor>
<connor> recommended whatever is put in my head </connor>
<joey> or I think that's the best way to </joey>
<connor> consume and honestly I've been having a </connor>
<garnt> great time I I feel like I honestly wish </garnt>
<connor> I honestly wish I could do that yeah you </connor>
<connor> have to watch anime well no it's not </connor>
<connor> even anime it's like pretty much every </connor>
<connor> form of media and it's not even about me </connor>
<connor> like being like a [ __ ] snob wanting </connor>
<connor> to like consume the best [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> um it's literally I started really </connor>
<connor> caring about it when I just didn't have </connor>
<connor> the time to do everything I wanted to do </connor>
<connor> right so like nowadays like even even if </connor>
<garnt> it's just like picking a game I want it </garnt>
<garnt> to be a game I could properly get into </garnt>
<connor> like I don't I don't know we are stuck </connor>
<connor> in this cycle of constantly worrying if </connor>
<joey> the game is good enough for your time </joey>
<joey> and then you know you'll never start </joey>
<connor> yeah you never [ __ ] play anything </connor>
<joey> exactly yeah yeah I mean that's what I </joey>
<connor> feel games are way more of a Time sync </connor>
<joey> than an anime </joey>
<joey> only on average yeah I mean I mean it </joey>
<garnt> depends but like to me getting into a </garnt>
<garnt> game getting like properly absorbed into </garnt>
<garnt> a game is just like it's one of the most </garnt>
<garnt> magical experiences and I [ __ ] love </garnt>
<garnt> it when I just get absorbed into a video </garnt>
<garnt> game world it's the same way that I get </garnt>
<garnt> absorbed into an anime or absorbed into </garnt>
<garnt> a manga or something like that </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely and like to me I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> like because my time is so precious to </garnt>
<garnt> me right now I'm it it sucks that I I </garnt>
<garnt> like constantly have to like have this </garnt>
<garnt> little part of my head that's just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh could you be watching something </garnt>
<garnt> better that you'd enjoy maybe a little </garnt>
<garnt> bit more no are you really in the mood </garnt>
<connor> for this I don't know optimize your </connor>
<garnt> schedule in every way right yeah so I </garnt>
<connor> feel like the stuff that you consume </connor>
<connor> should be the one thing where you're </connor>
<connor> like no pressure like whatever you watch </connor>
<connor> whatever you play doesn't matter if it </connor>
<connor> wasn't the game of the year doesn't </connor>
<connor> matter if it wasn't the movie of the </connor>
<connor> year yeah just watch whatever comes up </connor>
<connor> to have an opinion on it like I watch </connor>
<connor> that uh don't look up </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> and it went on for like an hour longer </joey>
<joey> than it needed to right right and like </joey>
<joey> yeah there were some funny moments of it </joey>
<joey> there were some bits that I chuckled but </joey>
<joey> overall I just felt like I I wasted all </joey>
<joey> my time yeah but I was like I'm glad I </joey>
<joey> watched this because it gave me even </joey>
<joey> though I I came out disliking the movie </joey>
<connor> for some reason that made me happy I was </connor>
<connor> like yeah that was [ __ ] and it was fun </connor>
<connor> getting to talk to other people who also </connor>
<connor> thought it was [ __ ] I don't know I just </connor>
<joey> liked it I think as well it's because </joey>
<joey> like even even if you do consume </joey>
<connor> something that is [ __ ] within that like </connor>
<connor> specific medium like it just broadens </connor>
<connor> your horizon more on the medium and like </connor>
<connor> it adds to the knowledge pool of like oh </connor>
<connor> now that I've consumed something on the </connor>
<connor> other side of the spectrum now I'm I'm a </connor>
<connor> little bit more knowledgeable about what </connor>
<connor> makes the good [ __ ] good right yeah I'm </connor>
<joey> definitely like that with music where </joey>
<joey> I'm like if it's on [ __ ] Spotify I'm </joey>
<connor> just listening to it like I I watched um </connor>
<garnt> as well I watched our Spider-Man movie </garnt>
<connor> the new one oh yeah yeah and like yeah </connor>
<garnt> it was great but I because it was just </garnt>
<garnt> great and I had a good time my emotions </garnt>
<joey> are way stronger about don't look up </joey>
<joey> right really I hated it right yeah </joey>
<joey> I watched I watched no way home and I </joey>
<joey> had a great time but at the end of the </joey>
<garnt> day I've already like forgotten about it </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't I don't care and it was it </garnt>
<garnt> was good but it was just that was a </garnt>
<garnt> movie I [ __ ] loved that was I liked </garnt>
<garnt> it a lot but I just I'm I after I'm done </garnt>
<connor> with it I'm like that was everything I </connor>
<connor> expected it to be right and I had fun </connor>
<joey> but I don't feel strongly about it I </joey>
<joey> think that's the thing though it's like </joey>
<joey> the the problem is like I think The </joey>
<connor> Sweet Spot of like you being able to </connor>
<connor> like really gush out about something is </connor>
<connor> like when it's on two or the two ends of </connor>
<connor> the spectrum right where it's either </connor>
<connor> like so [ __ ] incredible like 10 out </connor>
<connor> of 10 Masterpiece where you can just </connor>
<joey> gush about your love for it forever and </joey>
<joey> then there's the other side where it's </joey>
<joey> like let me tell you about how </joey>
<joey> absolutely atrocious this [ __ ] is yeah </joey>
<connor> dude I watched um uh could you Google </connor>
<connor> this for me Ashley it's uh Robert </connor>

<connor> anxiety simulation okay it's so good </connor>

<connor> equivalent of the YouTuber getting the </connor>
<connor> hair dye it's like guys I want an image </connor>
<connor> change I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do </connor>
<connor> a bunch of weird [ __ ] now right sure </connor>
<joey> because they've all gone on like </joey>

<connor> three-parter yeah yeah it's a three-part </connor>
<joey> it's a trillion no no it's two parts </joey>
<connor> four parts right two yeah is that a two </connor>
<connor> four two yeah </connor>
<connor> uh yeah two volume one and two yeah no </connor>
<joey> no no not of nymphomaniac like of that </joey>
<connor> Universe oh no I was the one with the </connor>
<connor> Shia LaBeouf movies of two yeah it's a </connor>
<connor> universe there's like it's like a </connor>
<connor> Trilogy of Las ventre movies and </connor>
<connor> nymphomaniac I think is the third one </connor>
<connor> something like that it is right it is a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] weird movie it's weird </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable and it yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> Osborne trans like known some really </connor>
<connor> disturbing movies yeah probably I've </connor>
<connor> seen all the last one Trail movies and </connor>
<joey> nymphomaniacs easily the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> weirdest one and I was like oh Charlotte </joey>
<connor> boss says like you just go what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you just go from Even Stevens like shut </connor>
<connor> up CIS and it's like oh gosh oh god oh </connor>
<joey> good I didn't I didn't I didn't wish to </joey>
<joey> see Charlotte Buff's butthole in five </joey>
<connor> different scenes but there it is I guess </connor>
<joey> I didn't mean to watch this movie it </joey>
<joey> came on the TV yeah what did you how did </joey>
<connor> you see it it was on TV I was on TV uh I </connor>
<joey> was in a hotel and like isn't it like an </joey>
<garnt> x-rated movie like Bulgaria but it was </garnt>
<garnt> on TV or something can you watched it I </garnt>
<connor> I know I watched it I watched it in a </connor>
<garnt> European country and it was on TV at </garnt>
<connor> like 2 A.M and I couldn't sleep and I </connor>
<garnt> was just I remember just thinking like </garnt>
<connor> what the [ __ ] must have felt like a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] fever dream yeah </joey>
<joey> that yeah anything loves Montreal means </joey>
<joey> is a [ __ ] Fever Tree that's weird man </joey>
<garnt> how'd you find how do you guys think </garnt>
<garnt> like trash TV fits into everything would </garnt>
<joey> you call trashy like which what rating </joey>
<joey> would you give like Kitchen Nightmares </joey>
<garnt> or something like that or uh 90 Day </garnt>
<joey> Fiance I think it just depends because </joey>
<joey> like people it depends if you grow up on </joey>
<connor> it or not </connor>
<connor> all right like like during like you know </connor>
<connor> were you were you surrounded of Gordon </connor>
<joey> Ramsay yeah yeah I'm in I'm invested in </joey>
<joey> that character I like it I know that </joey>
<connor> most of it especially in Kitchen </connor>
<connor> Nightmares are all faked aren't you [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> but also that's the thing it depends on </joey>
<joey> like if you were like raised in a family </joey>
<connor> where like it was like a family event to </connor>
<connor> be like yeah oh it's Wednesday night </connor>
<connor> let's watch Kitchen Nightmares you know </connor>
<connor> that kind of thing right like I didn't </connor>
<connor> grow up in a family like that so like to </connor>
<connor> me like I didn't grow up with trash TV </connor>
<joey> at all so yeah we never watched it </joey>
<joey> together yeah so when I watched like </joey>
<joey> YouTube yeah oh okay okay so like </joey>
<connor> because like the first time I knew about </connor>
<garnt> a kitchen nightmare was like through </garnt>
<joey> like YouTube clips or like any TLC show </joey>
<joey> right I was like what the [ __ ] is this </joey>
<garnt> you know yeah just because like I knew </garnt>
<connor> Kitchen Nightmares uh because that was </connor>
<connor> like literally when I first saw Gordon </connor>
<connor> Ramsay as well it was it was the British </connor>
<connor> Kitchen Nightmares as well which was </connor>
<connor> like you compare British Kitchen </connor>
<connor> Nightmares to American Kitchen </connor>
<joey> Nightmares and it's like [ __ ] night </joey>
<joey> and day like not only the editing but </joey>
<joey> just how like toned down Gordon Ramsay </joey>
<joey> is as well turned down in the British </joey>
<joey> one yeah he's so he's like he it it's </joey>
<joey> it's different right because it feels </joey>
<joey> like in the American one it feels like </joey>
<connor> they actually get like the formula huh </connor>
<connor> it is a Formula but you know it feels </connor>
<connor> like they get like the worst of the </connor>
<connor> worst [ __ ] chefs and restaurant like </connor>
<connor> actual clowns yeah uh to to like present </connor>
<joey> their District Gordon Ramsay and it's </joey>
<joey> almost like cartoonish in a way and yeah </joey>
<joey> you look at the British one and it feels </joey>
<joey> like it's just like like chefs who </joey>
<joey> actually give a [ __ ] about their food </joey>
<joey> who actually just like just need some </joey>
<joey> advice who needs some advice a lot of </joey>
<joey> the times Gordon Ramsay is like giving </joey>
<joey> them like genuine advice and maybe </joey>
<joey> they're too headstrong or maybe they're </joey>
<joey> too like you know Pride for to really </joey>
<joey> listen to his advice whereas you know in </joey>
<joey> America it actually feels more like this </joey>
<joey> is this is not even reality TV anymore </joey>
<garnt> this looks so cartoony and feels so over </garnt>
<joey> the top that you just don't even take it </joey>
<joey> I just feel that way about like 99 of </joey>
<connor> American trash TV yeah you know which </connor>
<connor> one the one I hate the most I I hate it </connor>
<connor> because I I used to also watch it a lot </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] porn stars oh yeah what's </garnt>
<garnt> that one you you know it it's the one oh </garnt>
<connor> you know porn it's it's the it's the one </connor>
<connor> it's set in Vegas right it's like the </connor>
<connor> one with the bald guy and someone comes </connor>
<connor> in he's like I've got a I've got this </connor>
<connor> thing worth 20 million dollars and he's </connor>
<joey> like I'll give you 10 bucks for it yeah </joey>
<joey> a whole oh yeah I thought you said porn </joey>
<connor> stars </connor>
<garnt> horn Stars </garnt>
<connor> I thought it was like we wanted porn </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah no no no no no no I thought he </connor>
<garnt> was a [ __ ] show about little porn </garnt>
<connor> stars I was like what is this a reality </connor>
<joey> TV show porn stars and there's also </joey>
<joey> hardcore porn as well which is the other </joey>
<connor> one that was like a spin-off to that </connor>
<connor> there was like a British version of it </connor>
<connor> as well which is just like what was it </connor>
<garnt> called porn in it </garnt>
<garnt> car boot Sailors or something like that </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> yeah it was like that show is just </connor>
<joey> because it's so good it's so obviously </joey>
<joey> fake but also at the same time you're </joey>
<joey> like it's just cool just seeing weird </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] brought in I've driven past uh the </joey>
<connor> porn stars </connor>
<joey> they just filmed b-roll outside of it </joey>
<joey> and it's just like because it's in the </joey>
<connor> most ghetto part of Vegas it's so scary </connor>
<connor> and then like you know there'll be this </connor>
<connor> this guy comes in he'll be like I have </connor>
<connor> this uh mummified corpse that's been </connor>
<connor> sitting in my Grandma's Attic in Nevada </connor>
<connor> you're like great he's like oh you know </connor>
<connor> I know an expert I'm going to bring him </connor>
<connor> down and 10 seconds later the experts </connor>
<connor> there he's like well it is a mummified </connor>
<connor> corpse uh it's worth about fifty </connor>
<connor> thousand dollars and then he goes it's </connor>
<connor> I'll give you 20 bucks for it yeah </connor>
<joey> it's just so dumb the whole formula [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and then they just walk out angrily it's </joey>
<joey> like you're missing out on a great deal </joey>
<garnt> man yeah I mean what I did what I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> understand my porn stars it's like when </garnt>
<connor> they started studying I guess </connor>
<connor> introducing story lines like well I have </connor>
<connor> B plots yeah there would be like B-Line </connor>
<garnt> plus with their family that would get </garnt>
<connor> resolved in episode </connor>
<connor> that was so big in the UK the American </connor>
<connor> one played in the on UK television so </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] great yeah it was so popular it </joey>
<joey> was ridiculous yeah I just like yeah </joey>
<connor> thinking back on it I used yeah that was </connor>
<joey> the one actually trash TV that came on </joey>
<joey> Australian TV all the time and my dad </joey>
<connor> was obsessed I just loved it because </connor>
<connor> they were just they would literally be a </connor>
<connor> pile of [ __ ] in this room and these guys </connor>
<connor> were like so about 50 bucks sell that </connor>
<connor> for 20 bucks like where are you gonna </connor>
<connor> sell this to this is a used bed sheet </connor>
<connor> like that's five bucks right there it's </connor>
<connor> like no it's not you're not selling </connor>
<joey> whatever what if though it's like all </joey>
<joey> connected like like the trash TV </joey>
<joey> Universe where like they trash TV like </joey>
<connor> like in Storage Wars they like they take </connor>
<connor> all the [ __ ] and then they go to the </connor>
<connor> porn stars </connor>
<connor> of course there'll be these ones these </connor>
<connor> fake ones will be like this guy has a a </connor>
<connor> lot full of perfect Rarity Charizards </connor>
<connor> yeah perfect grain it's like well </connor>
<connor> obviously we can sell those but other </connor>
<connor> times there's just Lots or something </connor>
<connor> where it's just all [ __ ] and you're like </connor>
<connor> even if you could make a profit selling </connor>
<connor> this surely the amount of time to get </connor>
<connor> rid of all of this [ __ ] and sell it is </connor>
<connor> just not worth it no like yeah you could </connor>
<connor> sell this the pack of double a batteries </connor>
<connor> for 10 bucks if you really wanted to but </connor>
<connor> why would you like where are you going </connor>
<connor> to sell this to yeah like are you </connor>
<garnt> shipping it surely that has to be taken </garnt>
<garnt> into account this is this is the only </garnt>
<garnt> country where I see that working you </garnt>
<garnt> know where you where you can actually </garnt>
<connor> sell the stuff and people will buy it </connor>
<connor> they do have storage Lots in Japan I </connor>
<connor> don't think they sell them do they when </connor>
<connor> they when they no I don't I'm pretty </connor>
<joey> sure they actually use storage for </joey>
<connor> storage purposes but the store is not I </connor>
<joey> think when if somebody doesn't collect </joey>
<connor> it I think they just get rid of all the </connor>
<joey> stuff yeah they just don't think they </joey>
<connor> sell them to the public which would be </connor>
<garnt> shame because we the Japan Storage Wars </garnt>
<garnt> version </garnt>
<connor> like I think I know more American </connor>
<connor> reality TV shows and I know British </connor>
<joey> reality TV shows I can't think of like </joey>
<joey> we have naked </joey>
<joey> attractions </joey>
<joey> when I went back to the UK like that was </joey>
<garnt> on that was still on TV it was still </garnt>
<connor> airing on Channel Master you know the </connor>
<connor> ones that actually the one I the what </connor>
<joey> this reality TV show where you feel bad </joey>
<joey> watching it but even if it's I don't </joey>
<joey> know how much of it's fake like you know </joey>
<joey> the debt collectors won oh yeah that's </joey>
<garnt> the one where I'm always like even if </garnt>
<garnt> this is fake should we really which </garnt>
<garnt> one's better watch storylines it's like </garnt>
<connor> uh there's a bunch in the UK we [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> love debt collecting shows in the UK for </connor>
<connor> some reason we love watching debt </connor>
<connor> collectors as long as we're not on the </connor>
<connor> bike yeah so what's the premise </connor>
<joey> so Jeremy over here is gonna go over to </joey>
<connor> his house and collect this let's see </connor>
<connor> what happens in the British one it's </connor>
<connor> just like some guy goes to the house hey </connor>
<connor> we've come here to get the stuff and </connor>
<connor> then like [ __ ] off mate no you're not </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] getting my dick [ __ ] right off </connor>
<joey> and they're like they've got a high high </joey>
<joey> magistrates Court notice to collect this </joey>
<joey> stuff if they don't they'll start </joey>
<joey> collecting things off the property and </joey>
<joey> then they and then the police turn up </joey>
<joey> and then it's just it should [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> because it's like oh these poor people </joey>
<joey> who've had some horrible circumstance </joey>
<joey> and then we're just we're just shoving </joey>
<connor> cameras in their face while their </connor>
<connor> Apartments being ransacked and so yeah </connor>
<connor> and they're selling the stuff off yeah </connor>
<joey> but wouldn't everyone pay their debts if </joey>
<connor> they could but is it called uh can't pay </connor>
<garnt> we'll take it away that's it what a </garnt>
<joey> stupid thing I have never heard of that </joey>
<connor> name it's on channel five okay I'm gonna </connor>
<garnt> send you later I don't think I've ever </garnt>
<connor> watched a single program I guarantee if </connor>
<joey> you watch one you'll get hooked it's </joey>
<garnt> it's changed </garnt>
<joey> channel it's just the trash Channel </joey>
<connor> like it's it's so addictive watching </connor>
<connor> this stuff like to me like John I don't </connor>
<connor> know why you just can't help yourself to </connor>
<connor> me like channel four is where a lot of </connor>
<connor> like the trash TV goes um even though I </connor>
<connor> can't like think of anything oh Channel </connor>
<connor> 4 is good stuff too though yeah but </connor>
<connor> channel four which I think Channel 4 is </connor>
<connor> like actually one of like the best the </connor>
<connor> best channels it has like the widest </connor>
<connor> range it seems like to be the most </connor>
<connor> experimental as well BBC is just like </connor>
<connor> very standard here's your like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> Doctor Who The Voice here's the voice </connor>
<joey> ITV is just like here's here's X Factor </joey>
<joey> once again that's a reality TV show </joey>
<joey> actually yeah I completely forgot that's </joey>
<garnt> just like reality TV show just like </garnt>
<connor> times a hundred though right but no no </connor>
<connor> one cares about singing reality like is </connor>
<connor> X Factor still going huh does anyone is </connor>
<connor> still happening oh yeah I'm sure I'm </connor>
<garnt> pretty sure does anyone give a [ __ ] love </garnt>
<connor> Island as well love Island that's is </connor>
<garnt> that is that ITV I feel like that's ITV </garnt>
<connor> yeah so you got like I I feel that's </connor>
<connor> really popular in America as well the </connor>
<garnt> British one yeah it's really popular </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it is oh the Great British Bake Off </garnt>
<garnt> as well I completely forgot that can't </garnt>
<connor> be called Bake Off in the U.S </connor>
<connor> really they can't uh one of the the US </connor>
<joey> brands has </joey>
<joey> um the trademark only Easy Bake uh one </joey>
<garnt> of them has the the trademark to take </garnt>
<connor> off so they it's called something else </connor>
<connor> in America and they've had to lock off </connor>
<garnt> something and they've had to actually in </garnt>
<connor> the Netflix I think on Netflix they've </connor>
<connor> had to like animate over certain parts </connor>
<connor> of the show where like the trophy </connor>
<connor> they've had to like they they did a they </connor>
<connor> did see CGI where they trade changed </connor>
<connor> what the trophy said wow oh it's called </connor>
<joey> the Great American baking show yeah the </joey>
<joey> Great American baking show yeah because </joey>
<joey> they didn't have the rights for the wood </joey>
<joey> Bake Off oh wow because for some reason </joey>
<joey> a company owns the right for the wood </joey>
<joey> bake off which is weird </joey>
<connor> um so yeah they changed it so that is </connor>
<connor> popular in the US but it's called </connor>
<connor> technically something different the </connor>
<joey> baking show the Great British baking </joey>
<joey> show just just doesn't roll off the </joey>
<joey> tongue's word </joey>
<joey> I know right I know does Australia have </joey>
<joey> any reality TV shows uh I mean we got </joey>
<joey> like Australian Idol and like The Voice </joey>
<joey> Australia and like all that [ __ ] um how </joey>
<garnt> did the voice get popular I like like at </garnt>
<garnt> which one inside did we decide we need </garnt>
<garnt> more than one singing reality TV show </garnt>
<joey> when was X Factor just not enough I </joey>
<joey> think it's because like shows like X </joey>
<joey> Factor in like American an idol where </joey>
<connor> like uh a lot of the times there was </connor>
<connor> like contestant of like are they like </connor>
<connor> judging them on their actual singing or </connor>
<joey> are they judging them on their </joey>
<connor> performance so people were like we want </connor>
<connor> to know if they can actually sing and </connor>
<connor> looks don't matter you know like that </connor>
<joey> whole like [ __ ] like you know </joey>
<connor> inclusive thing yeah how they treat you </connor>
<connor> the audience is idiots and feed you </connor>
<joey> these garbage storylines yeah I also </joey>
<joey> just get confused about like the judges </joey>
<garnt> X Factor has like or Britain's Got </garnt>
<garnt> Talent has like [ __ ] ruined so many </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] songs for me just because of </garnt>
<joey> like they use it at like the emotional </joey>
<joey> the emotional Point like if I hear Like </joey>
<joey> You Raise Me Up one more [ __ ] time </joey>
<connor> it's always You Raise Me Up right yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's like The X Factor waited they </connor>
<connor> didn't didn't win Susan Boyle right yeah </connor>
<joey> went no she came second right </joey>
<joey> did Susan Boyle win </joey>
<connor> so it's like that that is like the peak </connor>
<connor> yeah of how TV manipulates yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that as to just wanna you know they'll </connor>
<connor> give you an underdog and they've got a </connor>
<connor> sad story oh no I've never had a </connor>
<connor> boyfriend no oh no you know and the show </connor>
<connor> doesn't give a [ __ ] they haven't had a </connor>
<connor> boyfriend but they're like look audience </connor>
<garnt> care care about this care about this </garnt>
<connor> they do all the time uh as well with </connor>
<garnt> like military stuff yeah yeah they're </garnt>
<connor> like you know they'll they'll you know </connor>
<connor> they'll be someone who wants to compete </connor>
<connor> who maybe like served in uh Afghanistan </connor>
<connor> or something and instead of just being </connor>
<connor> like hey this is the town it's like no </connor>
<connor> you're the guy who went to Afghanistan </connor>
<connor> your whole identity is about going to </connor>
<connor> Afghanistan and you and you're doing </connor>
<connor> this for your troops back in Afghanistan </connor>
<connor> because they're One Last Wish to see you </connor>
<connor> perform that's what they do that's what </connor>
<connor> they do there I was watching the thing </connor>
<connor> with um Chris in the hotel room </connor>
<connor> and it was a British got uh Prince Got </connor>
<connor> Talent person who um was performing </connor>
<garnt> magic and they served in the military </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah and it was just insulting </garnt>
<garnt> how they almost just shoved it down your </garnt>
<connor> throat it's like this is the guy's only </connor>
<connor> re reality as a human being is that he </connor>
<connor> served in a war and it's like God can we </connor>
<connor> not just be people do we have to just </connor>
<connor> like ha do we do we have to just shove </connor>
<joey> down these things how about you follow </joey>
<connor> the name of your show and just be like </connor>
<joey> do you have a talent yes or no but this </joey>
<connor> is not about that but how is your story </connor>
<connor> compelling yeah you're in this magic </connor>
<connor> show this guy's doing these tricks and </connor>
<connor> stuff and you know not not to to not to </connor>
<connor> minimize it but it was almost beat for </connor>
<connor> beat predictable and there's just </connor>
<connor> so there's this one trick where he was </connor>
<connor> doing and he was like oh look at the the </connor>
<connor> clock and and tell me the time and so </connor>
<connor> right before the the point of this trick </connor>
<connor> goes I was like Chris to Chris I was </connor>
<connor> like because Chris is watching it yeah </connor>
<connor> and I was like I bet it's the time where </connor>
<connor> one of his friends died or something in </connor>
<connor> the war yeah no she you not two seconds </connor>
<connor> later he's like that's the time when my </connor>
<connor> friend passed oh my God and it's like </connor>
<connor> okay don't get me wrong I want to say </connor>
<connor> that like that is obviously horrific and </connor>
<connor> stuff but yeah the fact that they're </connor>
<joey> using this as like bait for almost like </joey>
<joey> even trivial trivialized okay because if </joey>
<joey> it doesn't feel real it does like the </joey>
<garnt> impact is gone because it feels so </garnt>
<joey> manufacturing it's just like they might </joey>
<joey> as well have just put up a cue card to </joey>
<connor> be like now cry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's like I bike again I want to make </garnt>
<garnt> sure I'm not diminishing it or like you </garnt>
<garnt> know trying to minimize minimize it or </garnt>
<joey> make it seem like it's not on the guy </joey>
<joey> it's on the producer yeah probably heard </joey>
<connor> this story or something they're like yo </connor>
<connor> play that up play that people want to </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] cry yeah because like because </garnt>
<garnt> like it's been proven plenty of times </garnt>
<connor> that the the auditions that we see </connor>
<connor> televised in front of a live audience </connor>
<connor> isn't actually like the first audition </connor>
<connor> they go through like several stages with </connor>
<connor> the producers I guarantee he was doing </connor>
<connor> that magic trick and like one of The </connor>
<connor> Producers like just like heavily </connor>
<connor> suggested yo you should </connor>
<connor> speculation but uh I like in my mind I'm </connor>
<garnt> just like I feel like one of one of the </garnt>
<garnt> producers just went you know I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> you should uh kind of like try to </garnt>
<garnt> integrate that storyline into your magic </garnt>
<connor> trick somehow you know there's </connor>
<connor> definitely kind of stuff that those you </connor>
<connor> know producers are we do like we've seen </connor>
<joey> you know if you have a look at the </joey>
<joey> people have released the contracts and </joey>
<joey> stuff yeah they're pretty predatory </joey>
<joey> contracts oh yeah like a lot of the time </joey>
<joey> I think I can't remember which one it </joey>
<joey> was either one of these shows one of the </joey>
<joey> British ones is like they were by </joey>
<connor> signing the contract they owned </connor>
<connor> everything that you would make that you </connor>
<joey> would self-publish online or something I </joey>
<joey> think it was American Idol one of them </joey>
<connor> was like yeah so if you went to even </connor>
<connor> audition and you posted content online </connor>
<connor> if they wanted to they could turn around </connor>
<connor> and be like hey that's all we we that's </connor>
<connor> ours bro yeah that's just [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<joey> I think it might have been I think it </joey>
<garnt> was like because I saw the YouTube video </garnt>
<joey> about it yeah </joey>
<joey> um also Susan Boyle didn't mean she lost </joey>
<joey> out to like diversity that's right the </joey>
<connor> people we did I remember I remember this </connor>
<connor> oh it's like a big big like because I </connor>
<connor> think everyone at the time I remember </connor>
<connor> when this was happening when I was </connor>
<connor> younger and everyone was like oh Susan </connor>
<connor> Ball's gonna win so like yeah it was a </connor>
<connor> big effort to like make it so that she </connor>
<connor> didn't win or like yeah right opinion </connor>
<garnt> this is when people gave a [ __ ] about </garnt>
<garnt> reality TV yeah now now life is the </garnt>
<garnt> reality TV we don't need this [ __ ] we oh </garnt>
<garnt> my God just log on to our [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> Twitter and uh you you get to see </garnt>
<joey> reality TV where's where's Susan Boyle </joey>
<joey> now hopefully doing well for herself but </joey>
<garnt> no one's talking about her I I would </garnt>
<garnt> like to go on the go back to the times </garnt>
<joey> when we could just [ __ ] on reality TV </joey>

<connor> have you ever thought about </connor>
<joey> going on a show like that or that's a </joey>
<joey> great question Julie yeah no economy is </joey>
<joey> like okay I saw a guy on YouTube uh I </joey>
<connor> think I showed you guys he went on the </connor>
<connor> show playing a character and then like </connor>
<connor> just making fun of the whole process and </connor>
<connor> like with secret camera and stuff </connor>
<connor> showing it oh really yeah but then I </connor>
<joey> think the show took everything down oh </joey>
<joey> yeah but it was just saying the contract </joey>
<connor> he had to sign the contract yeah but a </connor>
<connor> part of his thought I wonder if I made </connor>
<connor> up a storyline and I really committed to </connor>
<connor> it how easy would it be to get on TV </connor>
<connor> yeah I think it would be pretty easy </connor>
<garnt> which comedian did this a British one </garnt>
<connor> did it didn't he did he </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't I wouldn't put it past </connor>
<connor> British communities which one was it </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] he made up like a storyline about I </connor>
<connor> think it was um oh which comedian was it </connor>
<connor> was it </connor>
<connor> oh British comedian who went on </connor>
<connor> Britain's Got Talent and it was there </connor>
<connor> was like I don't want to say the </connor>
<joey> storyline in case I'm wrong </joey>
<joey> uh he saw chaponda </joey>
<connor> sure give us that yeah uh British </connor>
<connor> comedian he did like he made it so that </connor>
<joey> like his I think his backstory is like a </joey>
<connor> holocaust Survivor or something really </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah something like that or </connor>
<connor> something like Jewish or something I </connor>
<garnt> remember it was like that while he's </garnt>
<garnt> searching I'll guess I'll get I'll add </garnt>
<garnt> on to the conversation but yeah like I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why people would want to go </garnt>
<garnt> in reality TV shows now when you can </garnt>
<garnt> just post yourself up on YouTube I feel </garnt>
<connor> like that need to like have your five </connor>
<connor> seconds of Fame it's kind of like that </connor>
<connor> need is like kind of Disappearing </connor>
<connor> because at any moment in time you post a </connor>
<garnt> tick tock you can get like a few million </garnt>
<connor> views I like at a complete chance right </connor>
<connor> well reality TV is figure this out </connor>
<joey> that's why they often recruit people on </joey>
<joey> social media yeah they go on social </joey>
<joey> media and like DM them like Hey we're </joey>
<connor> from this Prince got town would you be </connor>
<joey> interesting auditioning we can guarantee </joey>
<connor> you to go to like the second judges or </connor>
<joey> something sneak him off yes well yeah </joey>
<garnt> have you have you not watched like clips </garnt>
<garnt> of the talent shows recently I haven't </garnt>
<garnt> actually it feels less like a talent </garnt>
<garnt> show and more like hey because there's </garnt>
<garnt> people who are like from all over the </garnt>
<connor> world like American and Canadian it just </connor>
<connor> seems like they're just getting anyone </connor>
<connor> who does anything interesting right to </connor>
<connor> come on and who has a compelling story </connor>
<connor> supposedly yeah it's more like they're </connor>
<connor> less so a talent shower of the people </connor>
<joey> and more a talent show to just amused </joey>
<joey> people where they just get acts from </joey>
<joey> across the world yeah yeah and then just </joey>
<garnt> Loosely tie together a story it's the </garnt>
<garnt> real YouTube Rewind now since YouTube </garnt>
<connor> Rewind isn't a thing anymore </connor>
<joey> the talented people rewind yeah I'll </joey>
<garnt> have to find it after okay but what was </garnt>
<garnt> the story then what was so he made up </garnt>
<garnt> that he was a holocaust victim can I </garnt>
<connor> have your phone I can try and Google it </connor>
<garnt> I can't remember oh here we go yeah Lee </garnt>
<connor> Nelson yeah it was by channel four </connor>
<connor> what who's this one look at your </connor>
<connor> thumbnail </connor>
<connor> oh my god wow I don't think he made up a </connor>
<connor> fake storyline about being a rabbi and </connor>
<connor> something and then whatnot and channel 4 </connor>
<connor> posted it was part of like balls of </connor>
<garnt> steel balls of steel yeah oh I remember </garnt>
<garnt> balls of steel I didn't know I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> even know that was still going on it's </garnt>
<connor> not this is from a while back oh okay </connor>
<garnt> remember he made up some story about </garnt>
<connor> being a Hebrew </connor>
<connor> um Rabbi and playing a bunch of generic </connor>
<connor> sympathy cards yeah and yeah and it was </connor>
<connor> really easy for him to get on yeah and </connor>
<garnt> then I think he got to the live show I </garnt>
<garnt> can't remember what happened exactly I </garnt>
<garnt> think he then came out or something yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was yeah but it was just like showing </garnt>
<garnt> how easy it is to fake stuff yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> like I like because I haven't watched </garnt>
<garnt> much reality TV show not like much like </garnt>
<joey> of these talent shows I should say uh as </joey>
<joey> much as I used to because before like it </joey>
<joey> felt like everyone was talking about it </joey>
<joey> especially when you live it was like </joey>
<joey> inescapable yeah everyone was talking </joey>
<joey> about oh he's going to win Britain's or </joey>
<joey> Talent OR X Factor now he just feels </joey>
<joey> like I don't I don't know if it's if </joey>
<garnt> it's just my Social Circle has changed </garnt>
<garnt> or if the viewership has genuinely just </garnt>
<garnt> had a sharp drop off well like I rarely </garnt>
<garnt> hear anyone talking about these big </garnt>
<joey> talent shows anymore no one cares </joey>
<joey> because no one really like the the </joey>
<joey> demographic of watching TV now is just </joey>
<connor> completely shifting TV is just </connor>
<connor> background noise now yeah that's it no </connor>
<connor> one actually gives a [ __ ] about what's </connor>
<connor> going on TV yeah like I feel you know </connor>

<garnt> this on the podcast because I can't </garnt>
<garnt> remember if I have or not uh but it </garnt>
<garnt> feels like YouTube in a sense has like </garnt>
<connor> Because the Internet moves so fast </connor>
<connor> YouTube has become the new TV and it's </connor>
<connor> almost like Tick Tock that's become the </connor>
<connor> new YouTube in a sense where Tick Tock </connor>
