<garnt> haircuts I've noticed actually I haven't </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> I desperately needed that yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> frankly but gentlemen I had the worst </garnt>
<garnt> taxi ride of my life oh we're just gonna </garnt>
<joey> get straight into it never left I you </joey>
<garnt> know I was um okay so I'll lay the scene </garnt>
<garnt> for you right so I have a shoot at 1 30 </garnt>
<garnt> p.m okay right so I got to be there a </garnt>
<garnt> little bit early right I'm trying to get </garnt>
<garnt> there one one fifteen but I'm like you </garnt>
<garnt> know if I get there one five one ten </garnt>
<garnt> I'll just get a coffee somewhere nearby </garnt>
<garnt> yeah out so I I schedule my taxi right </garnt>
<garnt> uh schedule if I'm super British </garnt>
<garnt> schedule so I schedule it right so that </garnt>
<garnt> I can get there at latest 1 15. yeah </garnt>
<garnt> give me a 15 minute buff up trying to be </garnt>
<garnt> professional trying to be great so I </garnt>
<garnt> call this taxi right and it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> like a Japanese kind of uber version app </connor>
<garnt> and it normally takes at most 15 minutes </garnt>
<joey> so I schedule a taxi or whatever it is </joey>
<garnt> the point is that I'm like buffering on </garnt>
<joey> buffers right so I call the cab at 12 </joey>
<joey> 30. it's a 20 minute Journey so I have </joey>
<joey> plenty of time if it's like the maximum </joey>
<joey> I I might even get there completely far </joey>
<joey> too early right so I I get the app and </joey>
<garnt> it's and I I call the taxi and Boom at </garnt>
<garnt> 12 30 I have a taxi driver who's </garnt>
<garnt> arriving in 15 minutes yeah that's a 20 </garnt>
<garnt> minute Journey so the taxi should arrive </garnt>
<garnt> at 12 45 and then I'll get there at 105. </garnt>
<garnt> right a little bit early but fine it's </garnt>
<garnt> fine okay </garnt>
<garnt> so I have 15 minutes so I go and I go </garnt>
<garnt> and brush my teeth I go and start </garnt>
<garnt> getting ready and I go and check my </garnt>
<garnt> phone 10 minutes later and he hasn't </garnt>
<joey> moved it's still 15 minutes away and I </joey>
<joey> can see that he's beginning he's been </joey>
<joey> going up and down this one road and I'm </joey>
<joey> like I'm sure it's nothing I'm sure I'm </joey>
<joey> sure it's fine </joey>
<joey> listen I'm sure I'm sure you know he </joey>
<joey> just got a little lost on this one road </joey>
<joey> it's a main road you know maybe you just </joey>
<joey> couldn't get off it right it's no big </joey>
<joey> deal sure I should have canceled right </joey>
<joey> then and there I most certainly should </joey>
<connor> have and I so regret it right I had the </connor>
<connor> thought in my head I'm sure this is </connor>
<connor> nothing right and I should have listened </connor>
<connor> to myself and realized this was a sign </connor>
<connor> of things to come so to to get to my my </connor>
<connor> where I am there's a series of like </connor>
<garnt> one-way roads that are a bit confusing </garnt>
<garnt> and they they have to enter at this </garnt>
<garnt> certain point if they don't enter at a </garnt>
<garnt> certain point it's like it adds five to </garnt>
<garnt> ten minutes of [ __ ] to try and get </garnt>
<garnt> back to where I am right yeah so he's </garnt>
<garnt> coming up to it and I'm waiting outside </garnt>
<garnt> and if he gets if he gets this turn you </garnt>
<garnt> can comes to me I'm ready to go of </garnt>
<garnt> course he [ __ ] misses it just goes </garnt>
<garnt> right past it even though the navigation </garnt>
<connor> tells him where to go and I'm like </connor>
<joey> whatever it's fine okay it's almost like </joey>
<joey> GPS's were invented for a reason I know </joey>
<connor> I know I know there are a lot too far </connor>
<joey> there are a lot of times tribes in Japan </joey>
<garnt> who take GPS as a suggestion yeah um so </garnt>
<joey> it's whatever it's happened before I'm </joey>
<joey> not a bit it's not a big deal yeah a </joey>
<garnt> circle around he'll come but it adds </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes right yeah so again so </garnt>
<garnt> we're all he's already 10 minutes later </garnt>
<garnt> than he's supposed to be and now it's </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes so what he should have been </garnt>
<garnt> here 15 minutes now it's 30. so and now </garnt>
<garnt> just about be on time </garnt>
<garnt> so he he finally gets here and you know </garnt>
<garnt> I I understand sometimes they can't find </garnt>
<garnt> the exact location where you tell them </garnt>
<garnt> to pick you up from [ __ ] didn't </garnt>
<garnt> even try he was like three blocks away </garnt>
<garnt> and then press the I'm here button so </garnt>
<garnt> then I had five minutes to get to him </garnt>
<garnt> otherwise it starts it cancels it or </garnt>
<garnt> charges me money yeah yeah so I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] so I'm rushing to get to </garnt>
<garnt> him and then I finally get to the car </garnt>
<garnt> with like one minute remaining on this </garnt>
<garnt> timer otherwise my journey gets canceled </garnt>
<garnt> and I get charged money yeah and he's </garnt>
<joey> not even in the [ __ ] car </joey>
<garnt> he's a gun somewhere </garnt>
<joey> walking around like where where is this </joey>
<garnt> guy yeah so I'm just sitting there and </garnt>
<garnt> then finally he comes and I he obviously </garnt>
<garnt> realized that he [ __ ] up so he was </garnt>
<garnt> around looking for me </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever whatever </joey>
<garnt> okay it's a bit weird a little </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable and I've got a shoot to be </garnt>
<joey> to and I I this is a very precisely </joey>
<joey> timed thing that I can't miss yeah we </joey>
<joey> have one hour and everyone's waiting on </joey>
<garnt> me it's and like the venue that we're </garnt>
<garnt> filming at is gonna open at three so we </garnt>
<garnt> only have that one hour window to film </garnt>
<garnt> sure so </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like whatever it's fine I'll be on </garnt>
<garnt> time this is weird and so I get in the </garnt>
<connor> car </connor>
<connor> and this is when I started to get </connor>
<connor> worried </connor>
<connor> he kind of just sits in the in the </connor>
<connor> driver's seat for about 30 seconds </connor>
<garnt> and he goes oh where are you going </garnt>
<connor> I was like what okay what are you where </connor>
<garnt> am I going I'm like it's on the app and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like I pull out my phone I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> it's on the app when I ordered you on </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and this guy wasn't a normal </garnt>
<garnt> taxi driver because he didn't have in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan if you're a taxi driver there's </garnt>
<garnt> got to be a bunch of identification yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff on the window to kind of let </garnt>
<garnt> you know who who's driving you and what </garnt>
<garnt> company they work for in case you have a </garnt>
<garnt> complaint or something you didn't have </garnt>
<garnt> any of that so it was clearly a private </garnt>
<garnt> hire only right so this guy only works </garnt>
<garnt> through this app and maybe he's new or </garnt>
<connor> something or I don't know and I'm like </connor>
<connor> whatever it's fine yeah I'm like well </connor>
<connor> yeah look at the app I said use the </connor>
<joey> navigation on the App please and you're </joey>
<joey> telling him how to do his job where do </joey>
<connor> we go to be fair a lot of the taxi </connor>
<garnt> drivers like to clarify that you put the </garnt>
<garnt> right address yeah yeah because I've had </garnt>
<joey> it where I've put it in wrong yeah and </joey>
<joey> I'll correct him and I'll be like oh </joey>
<joey> actually no it's here yeah this didn't </joey>
<joey> seem like that but it wasn't like that </joey>
<joey> at all yeah so I'm like I'm like show </joey>
<joey> them the fun I'm like oh this navigation </joey>
<joey> please use this one right so he grabs my </joey>
<joey> phone even though he has it on an iPad </joey>
<garnt> right here that is much bigger than my </garnt>
<garnt> phone it starts basically zooming in on </garnt>
<garnt> where I told him to go right and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> telling him I'm like oh oh no no that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's not going to help you because I'm </garnt>
<garnt> in like a it's in like a really weird </garnt>
<garnt> Alleyway yeah it's like it's not going </garnt>
<garnt> to help you and so he's looking at it </garnt>
<connor> frantically zooming in and he's like </connor>
<connor> yeah I don't know where this is I'm like </connor>
<joey> well that's why you listen to the air </joey>
<joey> that's why there's a GPS telling you </joey>
<connor> where to go I know you know again I'm </connor>
<connor> being polite about it I'm like all right </connor>
<garnt> this is whatever and be quite quiet I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just telling her I just kept telling him </garnt>
<garnt> like please use the app yeah please use </garnt>
<garnt> the app navigation and and so and then </garnt>
<garnt> he's he's trying to read the address on </garnt>
<garnt> the thing and it's because it's in </garnt>
<garnt> English I'm like I I tell him the </garnt>
<garnt> address yeah and so now he starts </garnt>
<garnt> putting it in and I'm like again I </garnt>
<garnt> remind him like you can just use the app </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just use the app like it's right </garnt>
<garnt> like it tells you where to go and you </garnt>
<garnt> put the address in but put it in wrong </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God I'm like no that's wrong </garnt>
<garnt> that's not where I'm going </garnt>
<garnt> this is the address I'm sorry I'm trying </garnt>
<garnt> to like kind of like talk him through </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah and he finally gets the </garnt>
<garnt> address right and then he puts it in on </garnt>
<garnt> his iPhone and I it was really odd </garnt>
<garnt> because I was trying to speak to him in </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese but he clearly didn't speak </garnt>
<garnt> much Japanese either okay uh he I think </garnt>
<garnt> he was Chinese right because I heard his </garnt>
<garnt> like iPhone telling him his stuff it was </garnt>
<garnt> really confusing right um and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> whatever well I mean we're both trying </garnt>
<garnt> to figure out a halfway language here to </garnt>
<garnt> communicate first </garnt>
<garnt> um and so </garnt>
<garnt> he finally finally starts the car and </garnt>
<garnt> he's put the navigation in and now I'm </garnt>
<garnt> going to be just on time if things go </garnt>
<garnt> right right yeah but he's been taking so </garnt>
<garnt> long to get started in this car that a </garnt>
<garnt> giant truck has parked in front of us </garnt>
<garnt> and there's a car behind us and this guy </garnt>
<garnt> is clearly not confident enough to get </garnt>
<garnt> out of this parallel park situation </garnt>
<garnt> um so he just kind of sits there for </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes okay I'm getting to the </garnt>
<garnt> point where I'll drive [ __ ] it just give </garnt>
<garnt> me I'll get it I'll do it so waiting for </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes yeah to get out for to wait </garnt>
<garnt> for one of these guys to move like he </garnt>
<garnt> could have if he wanted to he wanted to </garnt>
<connor> be like faster about it he could have </connor>
<connor> asked the guy in front to move up a </connor>
<connor> little bit but I think he was a bit </connor>
<connor> nervous I seemed really nervous about </connor>
<connor> the whole thing </connor>
<connor> um and so finally the car behind us </connor>
<connor> moves </connor>
<connor> and now he has to reverse and for some </connor>
<connor> reason this is like a hard task he can't </connor>
<connor> reverse the car </connor>
<garnt> it's just not happening and I'm sitting </garnt>
<garnt> there awkwardly listening this beep beep </garnt>
<garnt> and we're just not moving okay he's like </garnt>
<garnt> looking behind </garnt>
<garnt> looking behind look at the screen </garnt>
<garnt> looking behind for about the most </garnt>
<garnt> awkward two minutes of my life right but </garnt>
<garnt> he keeps looking behind and not moving </garnt>
<garnt> right and then he goes ah </garnt>
<garnt> restarts the car I'm like what is that </garnt>
<garnt> what's happening what is happening did </garnt>
<joey> he literally just do a turn and off and </joey>
<connor> on again </connor>
<garnt> he restarts the car right and then now </garnt>
<garnt> we reverse and I'm like okay this is </garnt>
<garnt> weird so we start driving and the </garnt>
<garnt> shooting I would run about 30 seconds </garnt>
<garnt> and he's fiddling with something on the </garnt>
<garnt> iPad </garnt>
<garnt> he's looking at this iPad non-stop all </garnt>
<garnt> right and suddenly get a notification on </garnt>
<garnt> my phone your ride has ended </garnt>
<garnt> what's that what did it just give up I </garnt>
<garnt> think he accidentally pressed end right </garnt>
<garnt> right and now I'm like what happens now </garnt>
<garnt> because he just started driving right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and now I'm like uh uh uh and so he </garnt>
<joey> starts driving and I'm trying to figure </joey>
<joey> out what the [ __ ] do I do like I'm yeah </joey>
<joey> I'm like I don't know if I'm gonna be </joey>
<joey> late where's he going yeah yeah I'm like </joey>
<connor> does he need so he has to he has the </connor>
<connor> navigation in his phone right but I'm </connor>
<garnt> like I'm like worried now he ended the </garnt>
<garnt> ride on Uber right yeah basically so I'm </garnt>
<connor> like what what happens now like I didn't </connor>
<garnt> know what to do and I was trying to </garnt>
<garnt> figure out what I said </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and so I I was thinking like man </garnt>
<garnt> what should I do should I just like let </garnt>
<garnt> him keep driving or should I should I </garnt>
<garnt> ask him to stop at some point like </garnt>
<garnt> because because they've already been </garnt>
<garnt> charged yeah like the full amount of the </garnt>
<joey> trip is like it's prepaid right yeah so </joey>
<joey> I've already been charged for it so he </joey>
<garnt> has to take you there yeah but he on his </garnt>
<garnt> thing it'll say that like he didn't take </garnt>
<garnt> me there so it's really like I'm I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just unsure what to do because I'm </garnt>
<garnt> pretty sure I'm not gonna be able to get </garnt>
<garnt> a refund yeah so I'm kind of like okay </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it I'm sure he'll get me there and </garnt>
<garnt> this won't be a problem yeah I should </garnt>
<garnt> have got the [ __ ] out of the car right </garnt>
<garnt> so right to leave my house there is like </garnt>
<garnt> you can go straight and it'll turn </garnt>
<garnt> around and there's a or there's a right </garnt>
<garnt> turn you can do oh sorry a left turn you </garnt>
<garnt> can do right away yeah and he has to </garnt>
<garnt> just go straight right and of course </garnt>
<garnt> just immediately turns and I'm like no </garnt>
<garnt> no even though the sat nav is telling </garnt>
<garnt> him to just go straight he just ignores </garnt>
<garnt> it right and I'm like oh no oh no this </garnt>
<garnt> is going to keep happening isn't it and </garnt>
<garnt> I [ __ ] you not every single turn he </garnt>
<garnt> ignored okay every single one and then </garnt>
<garnt> the writers were pulling out of my place </garnt>
<garnt> to go onto a main road he nearly hits a </garnt>
<garnt> car like straight up like this car's </garnt>
<garnt> going really fast and he's just going </garnt>
<garnt> into traffic and I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a genuine like a fearing for my life </garnt>
<garnt> now this guy can't listen to the sat nav </garnt>
<garnt> he seems to be [ __ ] up everything </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and can't reverse can't reverse </garnt>
<garnt> nearly driving into traffic and he he </garnt>
<garnt> refuses refuses to listen to his own </garnt>
<garnt> navigation okay and it is stressing me </garnt>
<garnt> out because now I'm I see that every </garnt>
<garnt> single turn he misses two minutes adds </garnt>
<garnt> up right right four minutes five minutes </garnt>
<garnt> ten minutes he there was one point where </garnt>
<garnt> he just had to keep going straight and </garnt>
<connor> he just decided to turn and then </connor>
<connor> realized he [ __ ] up and added on five </connor>
<joey> minutes trying to do a U-turn and I'm </joey>
<joey> like I'm gonna die like what what why </joey>
<joey> though like I don't know did he think it </joey>
<connor> was like oh I'll take this foreign </connor>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> and it seemed as if he would only take </garnt>
<garnt> turns </garnt>
<garnt> from what I noticed if they were like </garnt>
<garnt> clean corner turns right like if he had </garnt>
<garnt> to go into traffic to do wide turns yeah </garnt>
<garnt> he wouldn't take it he would ignore it </garnt>
<connor> right and I was like </connor>
<connor> should you does he have a driver's </connor>
<connor> license yeah yeah kind of sounding like </connor>
<connor> he doesn't have a driver's license </connor>
<joey> running through my mind right and so </joey>
<garnt> he's like zoolanders like I can only </garnt>
<connor> turn </connor>
<garnt> it's like it's literally like Zoolander </garnt>
<joey> he would only do the like the if you're </joey>
<joey> in America like the right turns yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah he wouldn't do any turns that were </garnt>
<garnt> wide and kind of into traffic yeah I was </garnt>
<garnt> just making me like I'm like oh my God </garnt>
<garnt> this guy is like so instead of just </garnt>
<garnt> going straight to my destination on a </garnt>
<garnt> map he's doing like this right only </garnt>
<garnt> doing like back alleys and small turns </garnt>
<garnt> right and at one point he's he he </garnt>
<garnt> realizes right that the the ride has </garnt>
<garnt> been ended right and so he keeps </garnt>
<garnt> fiddling with the iPad looking at it but </garnt>
<garnt> he's driving the whole time and it's on </garnt>
<garnt> his chair on the passenger seat so it's </garnt>
<garnt> not like he's looking looking at </garnt>
<garnt> something on the dashboard like this </garnt>
<garnt> he's like this </garnt>
<connor> oh my God and and at multiple points we </connor>
<connor> were like in full-on moving traffic and </connor>
<connor> he was like </connor>
<connor> yeah and you know I politely asked him I </connor>
<garnt> was like hey um can you look at the road </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because I was like this is Beth </garnt>
<garnt> like at one point yeah we were it was </garnt>
<garnt> like the traffic had backed up so we </garnt>
<garnt> were like we weren't near the lights we </garnt>
<garnt> were in the middle of the road there was </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of traffic and all the cars </garnt>
<garnt> started going and for about five seconds </garnt>
<garnt> he was still looking at the iPad now to </garnt>
<garnt> be like excuse me excuse me you've got </garnt>
<garnt> to go yeah and he was like oh oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> sorry sorry sorry it was this whole </garnt>
<connor> awkward mess where he just everything he </connor>
<connor> could have possibly done wrong he did </connor>
<joey> wrong everything everything and this is </joey>
<joey> and this was supposed to be a taxi ride </joey>
<joey> that went for how long it was a 20 </joey>
<connor> minute ride yeah and the taxi ride </connor>
<joey> itself not including all the [ __ ] we had </joey>
<joey> before yeah it ended up being 15 minutes </joey>
<joey> so from 20 minutes to 50 minutes because </joey>
<joey> he just kept taking all the wrong turns </joey>
<garnt> right yeah and we and just walked there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah honestly honestly and at the </garnt>
<garnt> end of it I was just like dreading that </garnt>
<garnt> he was gonna be like hey the ride ended </garnt>
<garnt> are we gonna have to fix this yeah and I </garnt>
<garnt> was just like the whole time I was like </garnt>
<garnt> please please just let me out of this </garnt>
<garnt> taxi you don't keep me in here and </garnt>
<garnt> talking to me I was just terrified that </garnt>
<garnt> I was gonna have to like have a </garnt>
<garnt> confrontation with him right about it </garnt>
<garnt> because I just didn't want to obviously </garnt>
<garnt> he's had [ __ ] to do yeah and luckily we </garnt>
<garnt> finally got there and he was the one </garnt>
<garnt> time he was going to listen to the </garnt>
<garnt> navigation was when it was actually </garnt>
<garnt> going to be less efficient for my </garnt>
<garnt> journey and I was like no no just just </garnt>
<garnt> keep going straight keep going straight </garnt>
<garnt> please please please and it's right as </garnt>
<garnt> we were getting to the end and thank God </garnt>
<garnt> he listened and he let me out and that </garnt>
<garnt> was the end of it but oh my God I was so </garnt>
<garnt> stressed because I was late to my shoot </garnt>
<garnt> by 20 minutes yeah and I had to like </garnt>
<joey> just fumble my way into it and get </joey>
<joey> started right away right yeah bro damn </joey>
<garnt> Nightmare and I hate I hate rating </garnt>
<garnt> people poorly on these apps because I </garnt>
<garnt> because you know I'm like maybe it's </garnt>
<garnt> just a one-off maybe it is right maybe </garnt>
<garnt> this didn't sound like it was a one no </garnt>
<garnt> but it sounded like this guy yeah I mean </garnt>
<connor> afterwards I was like no I can't I can't </connor>
<connor> there's no excuse in my mind that can </connor>
<connor> justify how much this guy [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> everything out I mean if he told me he </joey>
<joey> was an alien who just landed on those </joey>
<connor> yesterday I would believe it </connor>
<joey> and so the whole ride in the day I was </joey>
<joey> just trying to figure out like what was </joey>
<connor> that dude's deal </connor>
<joey> what was up with this I mean I've you </joey>
<garnt> know I've been in a couple of Taxi rides </garnt>
<joey> where you know it's usually because you </joey>
<joey> know yeah yeah yeah you know Japanese </joey>
<joey> taxi is usually like an older gentleman </joey>
<garnt> you know who is like very much like </garnt>
<joey> anti-technology and he's like no no no </joey>
<garnt> I've lived in this area for 60 years I </garnt>
<connor> know the road's better than any sack </connor>
<garnt> yeah and then you know they clearly miss </garnt>
<connor> a very simple turn yeah but like that </connor>
<connor> didn't seem like that yeah it seemed </connor>
<connor> like he'd I don't know if he just moved </connor>
<garnt> here recently or something and he wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> familiar with the roads and maybe he was </garnt>
<garnt> scared of using them and it might have </garnt>
<connor> just started but either way I knew I </connor>
<garnt> mean you shouldn't be driving taxes if </garnt>
<garnt> you're scared of the road no there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's a minimum requirement to a job </garnt>
<garnt> of just being a taxi driver even if it </garnt>
<garnt> is kind of like I don't know because </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like the app is kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like uber but I don't know what their </garnt>
<connor> requirements for [ __ ] uh clearly none </connor>
<joey> yeah I know I know that it's you know </joey>
<joey> becoming a taxi driver in Japan is not </joey>
<joey> hard but I mean it's not hard already </joey>
<joey> anywhere </joey>
<joey> um you live long enough </joey>
<garnt> we're gonna see </garnt>
<connor> I don't know you know not to blame the </connor>
<garnt> foreigners </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I felt bad for the guy because </garnt>
<garnt> he clearly seemed like he was </garnt>
<garnt> overwhelmed and I know I hate piling on </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] people who already look like </garnt>
<garnt> they're not handling stuff well yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> at the same time it's like there's a </garnt>
<garnt> limit yeah there's a limit to what I </garnt>
<connor> think is like you should not be doing </connor>
<garnt> this yeah like you and also your life is </garnt>
<garnt> in your his hands yeah the moment he </garnt>
<garnt> nearly crashed is when I was kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like all right this is too much now yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like this is like I I I I you just </garnt>
<garnt> you're actively like a danger yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> not only are you awful at this job from </garnt>
<connor> like an efficiency standpoint you are </connor>
<joey> actively like harmful like damn we </joey>
<joey> haven't been back in Japan for a while </joey>
<joey> and it seems like you've already gone </joey>
<connor> into some like [ __ ] yeah yeah I mean </connor>
<connor> you know because sometimes uh in Japan </connor>
<connor> like more often not public transport is </connor>
<garnt> quicker but depending on where you live </garnt>
<garnt> and how the roots are sometimes you </garnt>
<garnt> might have to change like three or four </garnt>
<garnt> times for a 30 minute Journey yeah of </garnt>
<garnt> course and the taxi will be one ride 15 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes boom you're right there yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so a lot of the time like I'll just </garnt>
<connor> do that because like I don't want to </connor>
<joey> have to deal with it especially if it's </joey>
<joey> like you know 15-20 minutes away right </joey>
<connor> most of the time if you go via app </connor>
<connor> that's when you like don't [ __ ] up you </connor>
<connor> know because you can time it perfectly </connor>
<connor> yeah because the driver always follows </connor>
<connor> the app you know it's it's for the most </connor>
<garnt> part for the most part you know a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the times it's very common if you get in </garnt>
<garnt> the taxi in Japan they'll and you've </garnt>
<garnt> ordered it on an app they'll be a firm </garnt>
<garnt> they'll be like are you going here and </garnt>
<garnt> you say yeah and then they'll be like </garnt>
<garnt> cool and they they'll they I get this </garnt>
<garnt> ass quite a lot they'll be like do you </garnt>
<garnt> want me to use the navigation in the app </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah yes please yeah I put it in for </garnt>
<garnt> a reason </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's been like no no no I I trust </joey>
<connor> yours Yeah because sometimes the app </connor>
<connor> doesn't like include highways and </connor>
<garnt> highways and tolls and so they have to </garnt>
<joey> manually add the toll costs onto the </joey>
<joey> price that you didn't see right so </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff </joey>
<garnt> that you might not know if you're not in </garnt>
<garnt> living in Japan using taxis often yeah </garnt>
<garnt> the taxis have some form of etiquette </garnt>
<connor> and you mean it's it's a bit different </connor>
<connor> from like New York and other places in </connor>
<joey> the world yeah but I feel if you're </joey>
<garnt> visiting and stuff you know the the </garnt>
<garnt> train system is 99.9 full proof so oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah the trip might be a little bit </garnt>
<joey> you know longer and more tedious </joey>
<connor> especially if you need to like change </connor>
<joey> train stations on the way but for the </joey>
<connor> most part it's fairly simple yeah if you </connor>
<connor> need to get somewhere fast and from a </connor>
<connor> location there's not a train station </connor>
<garnt> taxis are like often very of course yeah </garnt>
<garnt> well I I feel like if you know if if you </garnt>
<connor> don't know how to like talk to a lot of </connor>
<connor> taxi drivers I actually feel like trains </connor>
<connor> for sure for sure yeah because taxi </connor>
<connor> drivers will ask you like a lot if it's </connor>
<garnt> not like a train station or if it's not </garnt>
<garnt> like a major Monumental that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> the one thing I hate about catching a </garnt>
<garnt> taxi in Japan it's like when whenever </garnt>
<garnt> it's like I missed like I mean you know </garnt>
<garnt> I missed the last train yeah taxi home </garnt>
<garnt> right and then you know I tell them like </garnt>
<garnt> where I need to go and he puts it in the </garnt>
<garnt> sat nav and then he's like </garnt>
<joey> um so do you want me to go down like </joey>
<joey> this specific route and I'm like I don't </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] know I get that as well because </garnt>
<garnt> like sometimes I get a taxi and they're </garnt>
<garnt> like um I'm thinking about going this </garnt>
<connor> way do you know if I can do that or not </connor>
<garnt> I'm like I'm not the [ __ ] taxi driver </garnt>
<connor> I don't know my way I always just say </connor>
<connor> please use whatever navigation tool you </connor>
<garnt> have I I tell them my simple trick is I </garnt>
<garnt> just tell them go the shortest drought </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah I'm like I don't care just </garnt>
<joey> just take me home I need to be home </joey>
<joey> right because sometimes if it's not on </joey>
<joey> an app and you just call a taxi they </joey>
<garnt> don't put it in the SAT like the </garnt>
<joey> navigation but they'll ask you like </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] 20 questions and be like can I </garnt>
<joey> go this way I'm like it's two in the </joey>
<joey> morning I'm shit-faced I don't know </joey>
<joey> where I am I just want to be home just </joey>
<connor> take me home unless it's like a very </connor>
<garnt> well-known Monument or a place I </garnt>
<garnt> normally always just say hey can you put </garnt>
<garnt> in the address and then they'll pull up </garnt>
<garnt> the SAT and everything yeah </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> and then just read it out to them that's </joey>
<joey> pretty useful I have uh I have a </joey>
<joey> similarly like kind of funny story uh </joey>
<joey> that happened just the other night um so </joey>
<joey> you know we just got back from a tour </joey>
<joey> which we'll obviously talk about later </joey>
<garnt> in the show yeah but um you know I </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to like catch up with some </garnt>
<garnt> friends because I haven't seen them in a </garnt>
<garnt> while right and we're doing a meet-up uh </garnt>
<garnt> in Syria and uh this is like you know </garnt>
<garnt> there's a couple of izakayas that me and </garnt>
<garnt> my group of friends like going to you </garnt>
<garnt> know just for a big group meet up </garnt>
<garnt> because it's you know it's especially </garnt>
<joey> like on like a Friday night or whatever </joey>
<joey> most isakizen is in inches yeah </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> I know of a couple of like you know kind </garnt>
<garnt> of hidden spots that usually are quite </garnt>
<garnt> free even on weekends so we went there </garnt>
<garnt> and you know we were just like drinking </garnt>
<garnt> chatting away and we were the only ones </garnt>
<garnt> there to begin with right and we were </garnt>
<garnt> like oh this is great we got the whole </garnt>
<garnt> place to ourselves </garnt>
<garnt> um and then just like I don't know maybe </garnt>
<garnt> two three hours into the night uh this </garnt>
<garnt> huge group of people just start walking </garnt>
<garnt> like I want to say like 50 to 100 people </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus just like all like you know yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like five people at a time and that's 10 </garnt>
<garnt> people and then it's five people and </garnt>
<garnt> then before you know it this entire </garnt>
<garnt> place is packed with people just like </garnt>
<garnt> standing around drinking and stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> um you know but it's like whatever we </garnt>
<garnt> got the we got our seats we're having </garnt>
<joey> fun it's all good yeah and then about 20 </joey>
<joey> minutes in I just kind of like noticed </joey>
<joey> I'm like man it's really quiet </joey>
<joey> why is it so quiet and I'm looking </joey>
<joey> around and it's still full of people but </joey>
<joey> it's like really quiet yeah almost to </joey>
<joey> the point where we're the only ones </joey>
<joey> talking and then in the corner of the </joey>
<joey> bar I see the sign in Japanese that says </joey>
<joey> buy yearly meet and drink Meetup for the </joey>
<joey> Deaf </joey>
<joey> and I noticed every single person in </joey>
<joey> this bar other than us is talking in </joey>
<garnt> Sign Language oh wow and I'm like that's </garnt>
<joey> why it's so quiet because literally no </joey>
<joey> one is talking and everyone is just </joey>
<joey> saying it that's awesome and and it's so </joey>
<joey> bad but like the first thing in my mind </joey>
<joey> that I thought of was well I hope we're </joey>
<joey> not being too loud </joey>
<garnt> that's the only thing you don't have to </garnt>
<joey> worry about now well it's like </joey>
<joey> immediately like oh [ __ ] oh wait no we </joey>
<joey> good but it was really cool because it's </joey>
<joey> like you know I I knew a couple of </joey>
<joey> people in school who were like deaf and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that but like I'd never seen </joey>
<joey> that many deaf people in a social </joey>
<joey> setting like a little on a bar right and </joey>
<garnt> everyone's like signing to each other </garnt>
<garnt> and there are people on like uh video </garnt>
<garnt> calls to each other and they're signing </garnt>
<garnt> to each other and I'm like this is </garnt>
<garnt> really freaking cool but it's also </garnt>
<garnt> really weird because it's so packed and </garnt>
<garnt> yet it's so quiet yeah and you all you </garnt>
<garnt> hear is just like the rustle of like </garnt>
<garnt> clothes moving around and stuff if it's </garnt>
<garnt> not talking </garnt>
<garnt> um but so yeah that was a that was a </garnt>
<garnt> really interesting time I guess I guess </garnt>
<garnt> now you know if you come to Tokyo you go </garnt>
<joey> to shibia there's a buy yearly meeting </joey>
<garnt> for the deaf apparently so uh I like how </garnt>
<garnt> you got like the one day the buy the one </garnt>
<joey> day the one day out of the two days yeah </joey>
<joey> where it's just a bunch of deaf people </joey>
<joey> who are like should we go drinking </joey>
<joey> yellow drinking yeah it was really cool </joey>

<garnt> December 22nd so act fast back to the </garnt>
<garnt> video yeah I mean I've been out like a </garnt>
<garnt> like a bunch since coming back to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and like I definitely noticed one one </garnt>
<garnt> thing I've noticed now is that before </garnt>
<garnt> now that because before everyone knew </garnt>
<garnt> you were living in the country right </garnt>
<garnt> every everyone knew you were living in </garnt>
<garnt> the country because the borders were </garnt>
<garnt> closed but now that the borders are open </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen like a total mentality change </garnt>
<garnt> right because now now before when I go </garnt>
<garnt> to a restaurant everyone's like oh you </garnt>
<garnt> know where'd you live how long have you </garnt>
<garnt> been living here now people are like </garnt>
<garnt> panicking because they're like is it a </garnt>
<garnt> is it a tourist or is it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese they're speaking to me back in </garnt>
<garnt> English now they're like all right well </garnt>
<garnt> that's a white guy yeah I think I went I </garnt>
<garnt> went to this restaurant the other day </garnt>
<garnt> with Sydney and they literally asked us </garnt>
<joey> oh God uh are you visiting and we're </joey>
<joey> like no we live there and they're all </joey>
<joey> like oh it's a Japanese menu okay for </joey>
<garnt> you because you know some places don't </garnt>
<garnt> have an English menu yeah we said yeah </garnt>
<joey> we've lived here before Japanese menu </joey>
<joey> fine </joey>
<joey> um so we go sit down they give us the </joey>
<joey> English menu anyway even though we said </joey>
<joey> I've had that having me so many times </joey>
<joey> like the waitress comes up to me and </joey>
<joey> just like oh English is okay and I reply </joey>
<joey> back in Japanese you know being like no </joey>
<joey> no Japanese is fine yeah I live around </joey>
<joey> here and it's just like oh okay comes </joey>
<joey> back and she's like he's the Englishman </joey>
<joey> just in case I'm like [ __ ] I </joey>
<joey> just talked to you in Japanese I'm good </joey>
<joey> I can read it </joey>
<joey> getting our bags and this guy goes I'm </joey>
<connor> gonna bother you guys but I'm a big fan </connor>
<joey> appreciate that yeah no just like I'm </joey>
<connor> sure you you two have noticed as well </connor>
<connor> but just like oh bro yeah exponentially </connor>
<joey> just more people yeah I mean we did this </joey>
<connor> uh I did this irol stream with Chris and </connor>
<joey> Pete and uh yeah it was uh insane we had </joey>
<connor> so many more stream snipers oh yeah it </connor>
<joey> was insane I did I did notice an </joey>
<joey> interesting thing though where at least </joey>
<garnt> with me uh I immediately know if someone </garnt>
<garnt> is a fan of like the anime man or if </garnt>
<joey> someone is a fan of trash taste yeah </joey>
<garnt> because I know they're a fan of trash </garnt>
<joey> taste because they come up to me and </joey>
<joey> they go are you Joey </joey>
<joey> but if they're a fan of me they go are </joey>
<joey> you the anime man and then that's where </joey>
<garnt> I'm like okay I know exactly like which </garnt>
<joey> mode to switch to anyone want to talk </joey>
<garnt> about and stuff because I had that exact </garnt>
<garnt> same experience like maybe 10 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> apart like one day because my parents </garnt>
<garnt> were visiting </garnt>
<garnt> um and you know I go recognized a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> because I was out and about and yeah </garnt>
<garnt> just like 10 minutes apart there was one </garnt>
<garnt> dude who was like are you the anime man </garnt>
<garnt> never heard of trash taste never heard </garnt>
<garnt> anything about trash [ __ ] just knows me </garnt>
<garnt> at the end ten minutes later American </garnt>
<joey> dude stops me and goes yo Joey what's up </joey>
<joey> man I just missed out on the trash taste </joey>
<joey> toy and I'm like yeah it's it's really </joey>
<garnt> interesting kind of like the the dynamic </garnt>
<joey> between like the I guess the two fan </joey>
<garnt> bases if that makes sense </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah I mean I mean I can tell as </garnt>
<garnt> well because it's like the gig up or the </garnt>
<garnt> guns you know how do they refer to me </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes they just they just mistake me </garnt>
<connor> for Joey which happens a lot there he </connor>
<connor> goes I love the other Asian guy in trash </connor>
<garnt> taste I was like which one </garnt>
<joey> which one were you referring to are you </joey>
<connor> talking about the full Asian guy </connor>
<garnt> I was like all right </garnt>
<garnt> it's cool though because I felt like a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of the bars and restaurants feels </garnt>
<garnt> like they kind of returning to normal </garnt>
<garnt> almost yeah yeah it's like it's like </garnt>
<garnt> nice the world is healing there has </garnt>
<garnt> literally been like a switch I've </garnt>
<garnt> noticed that with like all these </garnt>
<garnt> restaurants and bars yeah yeah just it's </garnt>
<joey> so much more alive now yeah and they're </joey>
<garnt> so much more like down for foreigners to </garnt>
<garnt> come in yeah yeah it's crazy how night </garnt>
<connor> and day it swapped it's like they're </connor>
<garnt> actually prepared you know for you know </garnt>
<joey> for more foreigners to come in well </joey>
<joey> because I'm sure as a business owner </joey>
<garnt> you're probably just like frothing for </garnt>
<garnt> the foreigners to come back yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> like you know there's only so many times </garnt>
<garnt> I mean some of them are probably just </garnt>
<garnt> like oh God here they come again but </garnt>
<garnt> others are just like oh thank God we can </garnt>
<garnt> actually get customers in now yeah not </garnt>
<garnt> have to rely on the same three local </garnt>
<joey> people that come back every week right </joey>
<connor> yeah it's been nice and now my favorite </connor>
<connor> thing now is seeing all the tick tocks </connor>
<garnt> of like this crazy thing I found in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan it's like a really it's a really </garnt>
<joey> like well-documented tourist thing yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah believe it it's like all right this </connor>
<joey> is the craziest idea this is the </joey>
<joey> craziest Cafe that I found in Shinjuku </joey>
<joey> and it's like all the same place </joey>
<joey> I'm not trying to be like talking dirty </joey>
<garnt> it's just funny it's just funny I I find </garnt>
<garnt> it fun as well because I I get </garnt>
<garnt> recommended those tick tocks sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> as well where it's just like this is how </garnt>
<garnt> life in Japan works and it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> vending machines keep the [ __ ] drinks </garnt>

<garnt> there's like eight amazing things that </garnt>
<joey> made Japan so convenient yeah I remember </joey>

<connor> we had 23 shows we started from uh we </connor>
<connor> did one tester show in L.A then flew to </connor>
<connor> Minneapolis and got on the tour bus yeah </connor>
<connor> which was so much cooler than I think </connor>
<garnt> any of us expected oh it was so cool I I </garnt>
<garnt> you know I thought I was kind of like </garnt>
<connor> dreading the tour bus and you know we've </connor>
<connor> got a lot of questions about like what </connor>
<connor> is that I'm scared for the tour yeah </connor>
<connor> because I'm just like expecting yeah I'm </connor>
<connor> going to be leaving with this with these </connor>
<joey> guys and much of strangers for like 40 </joey>
<joey> days I don't know how I feel about that </joey>
<joey> but it was actually like really really </joey>
<joey> nice really really comfortable and a lot </joey>
<joey> of fun as well yeah </joey>
<joey> um because it kind of felt like after </joey>
<garnt> the road trip special which is now out </garnt>
<garnt> thankfully like I was I was dreading </garnt>
<garnt> that it was going to be 41 days of just </garnt>
<garnt> that experience </garnt>
<garnt> I'm literally gonna kill one of the boys </garnt>
<garnt> stuck in this space but like the tour </garnt>
<garnt> bus actually gave you like quite a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of space and quite a lot of like time to </garnt>
<joey> do I think it definitely helped that the </joey>
<joey> majority of the traveling that happened </joey>
<joey> on the bus was happening while we were </joey>
<joey> asleep yeah so it was like traveling </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it was like Fast </garnt>
<garnt> traveling in RPG it's great because </garnt>
<garnt> people were asking us oh how's how's the </garnt>
<garnt> drive been how's the roads been and we </garnt>
<garnt> were like literally uh we we blink in </garnt>
<connor> one place and we wake up in another yeah </connor>
<connor> the only roads I think we any of us saw </connor>
<connor> we were like the roads between </connor>
<garnt> um I think Colorado and uh I guess Vegas </garnt>
<connor> and all that stuff and a lot of Nevada </connor>
<connor> that was the only part I think we were </connor>
<joey> awake while we were traveling yeah and </joey>
<joey> even then it was like what an hour or </joey>
<connor> two in the morning yeah you don't </connor>
<connor> actually spend a lot of time on the bus </connor>
<connor> as you think so the normal day would be </connor>
<garnt> you know you wake up you've arrived at </garnt>
<garnt> the new place you pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> immediately get off the bus so your bed </garnt>
<garnt> is like a capsule hotel but stacked and </garnt>
<garnt> there's 12 of you yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and then you get off the bus shower </garnt>
<garnt> then you go get lunch then maybe you </garnt>
<garnt> wait around then do sound check at three </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you'd have to wait for like an hour </garnt>
<garnt> or two then we do the Q a before the </garnt>
<garnt> show at six yeah and we wait and then I </garnt>
<garnt> finished at seven wait one hour eight </garnt>
<garnt> and then we finish the show around 10 10 </garnt>
<garnt> 30. we maybe have a celebration on the </garnt>
<garnt> bus yeah we're drinking talking until </garnt>
<connor> like two and then we go to bed and the </connor>
<connor> bus moves yeah that's kind of every </connor>
<garnt> single day </garnt>
<garnt> that was basically our schedule uh our </garnt>
<connor> life was just living on a bus or in a </connor>
<connor> green room and I'd like I don't know </connor>
<garnt> about you guys like a lot of people were </garnt>
<garnt> like scared about would I get good sleep </garnt>
<garnt> on the bus I got [ __ ] fantastic sleep </garnt>
<joey> I got better sleep on the bus than I did </joey>
<garnt> in some hotels it was a nice role for me </garnt>
<garnt> some days I did some days I didn't it </garnt>
<garnt> was mainly like because I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> about you guys but I realized that </garnt>
<garnt> sleeping on a moving vessel while I </garnt>
<garnt> needed to pee was </garnt>
<garnt> I had to go pee like at least two three </garnt>
<garnt> times a night and normally normally I </garnt>
<joey> don't ever have to pee when I'm sleeping </joey>
<garnt> right right so this was like oh my God </garnt>
<garnt> I'm getting so stressed out that's how </garnt>
<garnt> old men feel I felt like I was I was </garnt>
<garnt> rapidly aging yeah um but some nights I </garnt>
<garnt> would get amazing sleep because the bus </garnt>
<garnt> kind of rocks you like like it's the </garnt>
<garnt> engine hum is so loud and also there's </garnt>
<joey> AC in the sleeping like quarters yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah there's a giant AC unit that is so </joey>
<joey> loud and ventilation system yeah and </joey>
<connor> then so you cannot hear anything from </connor>
<joey> anyone else's bunk </joey>
<joey> um so it was surprised like because </joey>
<joey> because I remember the first time we got </joey>
<garnt> on this bus and we saw how close of a </garnt>
<garnt> proximity all the beds were to each </garnt>
<garnt> other yeah I was like oh I don't think </garnt>
<garnt> there's gonna be any privacy like I'm </garnt>
<garnt> gonna be able to hear everyone [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> stuff nothing it's literally like in you </joey>
<garnt> know when you fall asleep </garnt>
<garnt> it was perfect because even though the </garnt>
<garnt> AC in like the engine were really loud </garnt>
<garnt> they acted at like the perfect white </garnt>
<garnt> noise like if if you've ever like slept </garnt>
<garnt> with like a white noise like filter or </garnt>
<garnt> something in the background that's kind </garnt>
<garnt> of what it felt like where you couldn't </garnt>
<garnt> hear anyone snoring you can hear anyone </garnt>
<garnt> like rustle around or anything like that </garnt>
<garnt> you just heard a constant white noise </garnt>
<garnt> that was constant throughout the night </garnt>
<garnt> and then I sleep great on moving </garnt>
<garnt> vehicles I don't know about you guys but </garnt>
<garnt> when the bus I slept better when the bus </garnt>
<garnt> was in motion than when the bus was like </garnt>
<garnt> still although I must say our bus driver </garnt>
<joey> did get a little wacky crazy at some of </joey>
<garnt> the locations like there were some turns </garnt>
<garnt> where he did where I almost fell out he </garnt>
<joey> only fell out yeah I had to like hold on </joey>
<joey> to being like Jesus [ __ ] crazy and </joey>
<connor> then obviously when you get into the </connor>
<garnt> cities because you're stopping and </garnt>
<garnt> starting so much good traffic because </garnt>
<garnt> the highways are just you're going yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but the cities are stopping and starting </garnt>
<joey> so you're like you know your body's sort </joey>
<garnt> of coming out of the Sleep Cycle anyway </garnt>
<garnt> and then you're kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the time yeah yeah so like to </garnt>
<garnt> explain this bus it was it we call it a </garnt>
<garnt> bus it's more like a coach you know what </garnt>
<garnt> I mean because when I say when I say bus </garnt>
<garnt> I think like double decker bus no it was </garnt>
<garnt> like a like a single Decker like coach </garnt>
<garnt> kind of thing and then you go into the </garnt>
<garnt> you go into the coach and then the first </garnt>
<garnt> thing you see is like this living room </garnt>
<garnt> area where you've got like a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> you got like sofas on either side </garnt>
<connor> there's a table in the kitchen and stuff </connor>
<connor> like that </connor>
<connor> um three TVs scattered all yeah three TV </connor>
<connor> scattered around permanently playing </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] SpongeBob or some [ __ ] whatever </connor>
<connor> was on American TV </connor>
<connor> um and then you go into the next room </connor>
<connor> and there are 12 bunk beds and there are </connor>
<connor> like three three stacks three layers </connor>
<garnt> basically three layers so there's the </garnt>
<garnt> bottom layer there's the middle layer </garnt>
<garnt> and there's a top layer and according to </garnt>
<garnt> like most people you get the best sleep </garnt>
<garnt> on the middle layer right so me and </garnt>
<garnt> Connor chose the middle layer Joey chose </garnt>
<garnt> the top layer yeah which kind of scared </garnt>
<garnt> me because if you fall out of that bed </garnt>
<joey> I mean you know I only chose the top </joey>
<joey> bunk because I'm a child at heart and I </joey>
<joey> was like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> but no like you know I I still got </joey>
<garnt> really good sleep on the top it was fine </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and then there's one extra </garnt>
<garnt> room in the back which was meant to be </garnt>
<garnt> for the talent room but that just that </garnt>
<joey> just turned into let's just put all our </joey>
<garnt> shits into this one room yeah and it was </garnt>
<joey> like unusable yeah I guess in like a </joey>
<joey> normal tour yeah like the the talent </joey>
<joey> have their own like private quarters if </joey>
<connor> there's like one Talent apparently some </connor>
<garnt> of the two buses have the like a room </garnt>
<garnt> that's like a bedroom as well oh okay </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah right I mean that would </joey>
<connor> be cool </connor>
<garnt> yeah and and you know for the most part </garnt>
<garnt> like we didn't really utilize that room </garnt>
<garnt> and it kind of just became like a </garnt>
<garnt> storage space just yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean you know when when Aaron uh </garnt>
<garnt> who helped organize the store shout out </garnt>
<garnt> to Aaron by the way um you know was like </garnt>
<garnt> you know by the end of this tour these </garnt>
<garnt> guys who you think are strange just </garnt>
<garnt> right now who are going to be with you </garnt>
<garnt> on this bus they're going to end up </garnt>
<garnt> being like family yeah and like you know </garnt>
<garnt> I always thought when I heard that from </garnt>
<garnt> like multiple people uh you know who've </garnt>
<garnt> done tours before I just thought it was </garnt>
<garnt> like you know just some kind of like you </garnt>
<garnt> know it's not excuse type of thing but </garnt>
<garnt> you know just like I think that maybe </garnt>
<garnt> not everyone can relate to that type of </garnt>
<garnt> thing right but like I don't know I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know about you boys but like by </garnt>
<garnt> the end of the tour it was like a family </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right and we got really close to </garnt>
<garnt> the the stuff that we had and we were </garnt>
<joey> always just like hanging out with them </joey>
<joey> in that front section and so we were </joey>
<joey> like we don't have to use this bathroom </joey>
<joey> let's just go hang out with everyone </joey>
<connor> else obviously you want to hang out </connor>
<connor> there real yeah they're always hanging </connor>
<garnt> out with everyone this was a good time </garnt>
<garnt> so there's actually there was actually </garnt>
<garnt> more people than I thought they were </garnt>
<garnt> going to be living on the bus with us </garnt>
<garnt> like prior to the tour because we only </garnt>
<garnt> knew probably we were gonna have like </garnt>
<garnt> some Geeks uh Geeks plus staff members </garnt>
<garnt> and some people from the tour company </garnt>
<garnt> that we worked with I was thinking okay </garnt>
<garnt> that's gonna be like a manager someone </garnt>
<garnt> like stagehands I like didn't take into </garnt>
<garnt> account just how much staff is needed to </garnt>
<garnt> run a tour because there's like there's </garnt>
<garnt> like multiple merch people and there's </garnt>
<garnt> like managers and everything like that </garnt>
<garnt> and there's our staff as well on top of </garnt>
<garnt> that and you know there's the technical </garnt>
<garnt> people as well there were like so many </garnt>
<garnt> people on this tour bus with us and I </garnt>
<garnt> thought [ __ ] this is this is gonna be a </garnt>
<garnt> lot for 41 days but like it was such a </garnt>
<garnt> nice experience because luckily everyone </garnt>
<garnt> was chill and we'd pretty much got along </garnt>
<garnt> with everyone yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and it was just I don't know you guys </garnt>
<garnt> you guys said it kind of felt like a </garnt>
<joey> holiday in some cases yeah it did I I </joey>
<joey> definitely treat it as a holiday well </joey>
<connor> yeah because like we I normally work way </connor>
<garnt> more than that so only doing like a </garnt>
<garnt> two-hour show and then having the rest </garnt>
<garnt> of the day where I can't really do </garnt>
<joey> anything it's kind of like oh okay </joey>
<joey> because like you know there were some </joey>
<joey> days where like we had to stop by kind </joey>
<garnt> of halfway between two places because uh </garnt>
<garnt> legally our bus driver could only drive </garnt>
<garnt> a certain amount of hours per day so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there were some days where we would </garnt>
<connor> stop buying just like the middle of </connor>
<connor> nowhere get a day hotel and then just </connor>
<connor> you know go and explore type of thing </connor>
<connor> and in my head I'm like okay before the </connor>
<garnt> a toll I planned out these days of like </garnt>
<garnt> on the days that were at the hotel yeah </garnt>
<garnt> we could get like our own room and I </garnt>
<garnt> could like you know yeah </garnt>
<garnt> catch up to work and stuff like that but </garnt>
<joey> then when it actually happened I was </joey>
<joey> like no I think I'd rather just go out </joey>
<joey> with everyone and like actually go see </joey>
<joey> this part of the country that yeah let's </joey>
<joey> be real probably not going to go back to </joey>
<joey> yeah like when am I ever gonna go back </joey>
<garnt> to Biloxi Mississippi yeah you know so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] I've had a great time there </garnt>
<connor> actually I had a great [ __ ] time </connor>
<joey> there yeah yeah that was great I I </joey>
<connor> actually really enjoyed the days off </connor>
<connor> yeah definitely appreciate how much work </connor>
<garnt> goes into doing these you know when you </garnt>
<garnt> go to a venue and you watch a show with </garnt>
<garnt> like with a thousand people or something </garnt>
<garnt> yeah maybe you realize just how many </garnt>
<garnt> moving Parts </garnt>
<garnt> you know a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> um were like damn why don't they come </garnt>
<garnt> into my place or whatever it's like well </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's very [ __ ] difficult to </garnt>
<garnt> organize a tour yeah and it kind of </garnt>
<garnt> sucks a lot of people like why the US </garnt>
<garnt> um well the US isn't a very unique place </garnt>
<garnt> where it is actually like built for </garnt>
<garnt> tours yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um you know a lot of the time when </garnt>
<garnt> you're moving merch across borders and </garnt>
<garnt> that's how a lot of these shows I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> realize this either a lot of these </garnt>
<joey> concerts only make like most of their </joey>
<joey> profits through the merch yeah like </joey>
<joey> ticket sales you don't actually get that </joey>
<joey> much money because a lot of the cot like </joey>
<joey> the venue's expensive everything else is </joey>
<joey> expensive all the staff like yeah you as </joey>
<garnt> the like talent and the the kind of </garnt>
<garnt> agency or whatever you don't make much </garnt>
<garnt> money from the tickets yeah and the US </garnt>
<garnt> is in a prime position where you can </garnt>
<connor> actually drive around all the same </connor>
<connor> country where all the same like rules </connor>
<garnt> with selling merch it's all the laws </garnt>
<garnt> because I think we learned a lot just </garnt>
<garnt> from doing this us all because there </garnt>
<garnt> were a lot of complaints being like oh </garnt>
<garnt> they they've had they hate the entire </garnt>
<garnt> world because everyone just goes to the </garnt>
<garnt> us so we did one show in Canada and I </garnt>
<garnt> think like the only time we got like </garnt>
<garnt> negative feedback from our show yeah was </garnt>
<garnt> from that one show in Canada and that </garnt>
<garnt> was to do with there was like we we had </garnt>
<garnt> the show in Canada and uh we didn't </garnt>
<garnt> realize that there were different laws </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of bringing merch across the </garnt>
<garnt> border different law of hiring staff </garnt>
<garnt> members because all staff members need </garnt>
<garnt> to be hired locally and there was a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of logistical things that just weren't </garnt>
<garnt> within like our Radars when we sorted </garnt>
<connor> out we didn't know that we didn't know </connor>
<garnt> that but obviously the tool company knew </garnt>
<garnt> that but obviously still you know trying </garnt>
<garnt> to get like the merch shipments to </garnt>
<garnt> arrive on time I didn't realize this was </garnt>
<garnt> a problem but yeah that that's a whole </garnt>
<garnt> thing yeah that's that needs to be taken </garnt>
<garnt> care of so yeah a lot of the times </garnt>
<garnt> you're kind of hoping that all the </garnt>
<garnt> moving pieces should work sometimes they </garnt>
<garnt> don't and it's like what do we do yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we ended up like shipping 12 boxes </garnt>
<garnt> of merch to our Canada show and one </garnt>
<garnt> arrived and then we had one day to get </garnt>
<garnt> as much merch made locally in Canada as </garnt>
<garnt> we could unfortunately it wasn't as much </garnt>
<garnt> merch as we had in our us shows but </garnt>
<garnt> that's kind of like the things that </garnt>
<garnt> people don't think about and don't know </garnt>
<garnt> about because you know when uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> if you do a tour in multiple countries </garnt>
<garnt> every country has their own laws every </garnt>
<garnt> country has their own taxes it's not </garnt>
<garnt> just getting people from One venue to </garnt>
<joey> another you know it's uh what we're </joey>
<joey> trying to say is hate the game not the </joey>
<connor> player obviously it can be done these </connor>
<connor> people do it but it's just it's it's </connor>
<joey> harder it is our first tour the US makes </joey>
<connor> a lot of sense yeah this was also our </connor>
<joey> first tour as well so we had so many </joey>
<joey> things that I guess we just didn't know </joey>
<joey> until it happened I mean thankfully I'd </joey>
<joey> like to say that the tour was a massive </joey>
<garnt> success I didn't see any negative </garnt>
<garnt> reviews no I'm so glad because like we </garnt>
<garnt> we one of the biggest things I was </garnt>
<garnt> worried about pre-tool was that we'd </garnt>
<garnt> start doing like shows and people would </garnt>
<garnt> like you know I've seen feedback before </garnt>
<garnt> of like you know people that have gone </garnt>
<garnt> on tours and you know I've seen the </garnt>
<garnt> feedback of just like oh it wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> really worth the money I spent all this </garnt>
<garnt> money seeing it just wasn't really worth </garnt>
<garnt> it and I'm like thankfully it felt like </garnt>
<garnt> everyone had a good time and we put on a </garnt>
<garnt> good show that we brought to like </garnt>
<garnt> different places and I was just like </garnt>
<garnt> after I think it was like after the </garnt>
<garnt> first show that I actually had like </garnt>
<garnt> faith in our show I guess because well </garnt>
<garnt> we had the outline of the show and we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't actually we'd never rehearsed and </garnt>
<garnt> we didn't really know how it was going </garnt>
<garnt> to go until the rehearsals which was two </garnt>
<garnt> days before yeah our actual show yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and like our show relied so much on like </garnt>
<connor> crowd interaction and having a rehearsal </connor>
<connor> in front of like five people versus like </connor>
<garnt> the thousand people that we had in our </garnt>
<connor> actual show was like night and day in </connor>
<garnt> terms of like Vibe and chemistry and </garnt>
<joey> stuff like that </joey>
<joey> um so I was going through rehearsals I </joey>
<garnt> was like I think we have a good show but </garnt>
<joey> I'm not sure I think as well it was it </joey>
<garnt> was tough for us because you know we do </garnt>
<garnt> stuff in front of a camera right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and doing stuff in front of the camera </garnt>
<garnt> like this or like the videos that we do </garnt>
<garnt> personally is very different to putting </garnt>
<garnt> on a show on stage right and you know </garnt>
<joey> some people will be like oh but you guys </joey>
<joey> are used to you know doing panels at </joey>
<joey> conventions and stuff like that it's a </joey>
<joey> very different feel yeah you know a </joey>
<joey> panel is a million times easier than </joey>
<joey> what what we were what we had to do on </joey>
<garnt> on stage I was [ __ ] knackered after </garnt>
<joey> everything oh yeah I I was I like it </joey>
<joey> drained me yeah so much and that and </joey>
<joey> that's because like we actually try to </joey>
<garnt> make it a show rather than just make it </garnt>
<joey> you know trash podcast on stage it's </joey>
<connor> really cool getting to see you guys like </connor>
<connor> from the first show like the 10th show </connor>
<connor> how much you guys quickly improved yeah </connor>
<garnt> being on stage it was really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> sick yeah it was awesome yeah I I think </garnt>
<garnt> by like the like halfway point we all </garnt>
<garnt> had like a rhythm and yeah yeah we knew </garnt>
<garnt> how to like bounce off each other what </garnt>
<garnt> worked well with the crowd but didn't </garnt>
<joey> work so well with the crowds I also </joey>
<joey> noticed we had like just without even </joey>
<garnt> discussing it necessarily we had like </garnt>
<garnt> certain jokes that we knew the kind of </garnt>
<garnt> Rhythm too yeah and like where to place </garnt>
<garnt> it and like because it was always you </garnt>
<garnt> know you you do the the show and then </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of noticed oh okay this joke </garnt>
<garnt> kind of hit maybe I can try it again in </garnt>
<garnt> the next show and then without thinking </garnt>
<garnt> like I knew exactly when say like Conor </garnt>
<garnt> o'gart were going to say specific jokes </garnt>
<garnt> and you exactly kind of the feeling </garnt>
<garnt> Rhythm to go with it right yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like you know God would do like the one </garnt>
<garnt> piece's real thing at the beginning yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which always popped off right and I </garnt>
<connor> always knew to sing can we get much </connor>
<garnt> higher you know so it was just kind of </garnt>
<connor> like it was is this weird thing of it </connor>
<garnt> started off as very much like a an </garnt>
<garnt> impromptu ad-lib-filled script like you </garnt>
<garnt> know non-scripted show yeah but then I </garnt>
<joey> feel by the end of it it kind of turned </joey>
<joey> into like almost a scripted show in a </joey>
<garnt> weird way it was like like we had </garnt>
<joey> segments that we didn't know what was </joey>
<joey> going to happen and segments that was </joey>
<joey> kind of like scripted yeah that we kind </joey>
<garnt> of knew how to like transition between </garnt>
<garnt> segments and stuff like that definitely </garnt>
<garnt> and play off the audience and stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> um but like having said that you know I </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say that every show did have a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of like Variety in in them </garnt>
<garnt> um and we kind of did that by Design and </garnt>
<garnt> it was very very interesting to see how </garnt>
<garnt> what what the different vibe in each </garnt>
<joey> city was we definitely learned a lot </joey>
<joey> about I guess like the diversity of </joey>
<garnt> crowds in the U.S I I think what I what </garnt>
<garnt> I enjoyed most about the shows was </garnt>
<garnt> actually like our show was our way to </garnt>
<garnt> learn about that particular area and we </garnt>
<garnt> got we I learned a lot that you couldn't </garnt>
<garnt> just get by Googling yeah what are the </garnt>
<garnt> top five like uh what are the top top </garnt>
<garnt> five most famous things about this one </garnt>
<connor> area right it was really really </connor>
<garnt> interesting to see what certain states </garnt>
<garnt> and cities were really passionate about </garnt>
<garnt> yeah they weren't um yeah that was fun </garnt>
<garnt> because a lot of the times it was very </garnt>
<garnt> surprising yeah and you know a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the times you've got questions because </garnt>
<garnt> we did a q a before every show uh and </garnt>
<garnt> people would always ask you know did the </garnt>
<garnt> tour change your opinion on the US at </garnt>
<garnt> all and I heard you always answer yes </garnt>
<garnt> and no yeah because yes some things did </garnt>
<garnt> change but it doubled down like 10 other </garnt>
<garnt> things oh God yeah we kept having like </garnt>
<joey> an argument about like we were like is </joey>
<garnt> the us more diverse than they they claim </garnt>
<joey> or is it because right oh yeah I think </joey>
<connor> the US is more diverse than say the UK </connor>
<connor> compared to Australia I was like you're </connor>
<garnt> full of [ __ ] like that's nice I I didn't </garnt>
<connor> say that I I said it felt like like </connor>
<connor> going from uh West Coast to East Coast I </connor>
<garnt> felt like going from like say LA to New </garnt>
<garnt> York to me felt more different than </garnt>
<garnt> going to London to Sydney I I and I </garnt>
<garnt> still believe </garnt>
<joey> why is that offensive because it's like </joey>
<connor> not even close why not Australians are a </connor>
<garnt> different breed of people yeah they're </garnt>
<joey> like I don't think so I don't think so I </joey>
<joey> would understand the comparison between </joey>
<joey> say like Australia and New Zealand uh </joey>
<joey> that that's a little more understandable </joey>
<connor> but like Australia and England vote are </connor>
<connor> different we're different </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I think I think culturally culturally </garnt>
<joey> yeah you know I think Australians and </joey>
<garnt> Brits have a lot in common oh of course </garnt>
<garnt> we have like a very similar sense of </garnt>
<connor> humor we have a very similar I I I agree </connor>
<connor> there's comparisons there what do you </connor>
<connor> think of the differences then between </connor>
<garnt> the west coast and the East Coast Vibes </garnt>
<garnt> um I think like I think the vibe in east </garnt>
<garnt> coast is like totally different from </garnt>
<garnt> west coast East Coast they like talk </garnt>
<garnt> faster they are much more direct with </garnt>
<garnt> the way they like speak and I I agree </garnt>
<garnt> with that you know like West Coast are </garnt>
<garnt> like way more chilled they're a bit more </garnt>
<garnt> flowery with their language and their </garnt>
<garnt> words whereas you know with East Coast </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like you know they talk way </garnt>
<garnt> faster and things move faster in the </garnt>
<garnt> east coast than the West Coast you know </garnt>
<garnt> I think I I you know I because when I </garnt>
<garnt> went to Sydney for example when I went </garnt>
<garnt> to Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> um I was like damn this kind of feels </garnt>
<garnt> like London with good weather you know I </garnt>
<connor> I was looking you know that changes the </connor>
<connor> game though that that's that that's </connor>
<connor> everything the weather is everything no </connor>
<garnt> no you no I remember the exact words you </garnt>
<connor> said you were like wow you you know you </connor>
<garnt> hung out in Sydney for like three days </garnt>
<garnt> and you were like this is like the UK </garnt>
<joey> except if everyone was happy yeah I was </joey>
<connor> like yeah that's like going to other </connor>
<connor> European countries like it's like the UK </connor>
<garnt> but different language it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like oh no no no no I I think I think I </garnt>
<garnt> think you know different countries in </garnt>
<garnt> Europe are [ __ ] totally different in </garnt>
<garnt> terms of like Vibes and cultures and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that I was just saying I </garnt>
<garnt> think the UK and like UK and Australia </garnt>
<garnt> have a lot similar culturally I mean </garnt>
<connor> you're comparing London and Sydney which </connor>
<garnt> are two cities the UK is very diverse </garnt>
<connor> throughout and you know you can't </connor>
<connor> compare Scotland to like London yeah </connor>
<joey> okay I would say there's a bigger </joey>
<joey> difference between like Dublin and </joey>
<connor> London you know yeah like Dublin feels </connor>
<connor> like a different country than yeah okay </connor>
<garnt> okay but okay London let's say England </garnt>
<garnt> then let's say England because England </garnt>
<garnt> to me is London and then everywhere else </garnt>
<connor> London has like have you gone to the </connor>
<connor> north I I have been to the North Korea </connor>
<connor> okay okay where have you got what's the </connor>
<connor> most how far north yeah how far north of </connor>
<garnt> Liverpool </garnt>
<garnt> is Liverpool not North it's Livermore is </garnt>
<connor> Northern come on North but it's not it's </connor>
<garnt> not North North it's not Yorkshire it's </garnt>
<connor> not [ __ ] because I've been to </connor>
<connor> Liverpool many times bro I've been to </connor>
<connor> Grimsby once it did not feel like </connor>
<connor> Liverpool right I don't know I I think </connor>
<garnt> that I I think it's hard to you can </garnt>
<garnt> judge cities a lot easier especially </garnt>
<garnt> like London and Sydney because yeah well </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney was kind of built like London in </garnt>
<garnt> a sense yeah there are sections of </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney that look very similar to Saint </garnt>
<garnt> fine in London but I think if you're </garnt>
<connor> comparing the culture of the country </connor>
<connor> like as Australia to the England it's </connor>
<connor> very different it's so different it's </connor>
<connor> night and day do you think so yeah why'd </connor>
<garnt> you okay what do you think what do you </garnt>
<garnt> think is like so different about it then </garnt>
<connor> because uh Jen joining okay this is now </connor>
<garnt> yeah now you have to ask what is a </garnt>
<garnt> culture let's do this again well what </garnt>
<garnt> makes up the culture constitutes </garnt>
<joey> so like are we talking just the people </joey>
<joey> are we talking because like you know if </joey>
<joey> you're talking how they have their own </joey>
<joey> dialect essentially they talk very </joey>
<joey> differently they're Australia has its </joey>
<joey> own language yeah yeah they have you </joey>
<joey> know they have uh its own native </joey>
<joey> population which is totally different as </joey>
<joey> well which plays an impact they don't </joey>
<garnt> play the same Sports a lot of the times </garnt>
<garnt> as us they've AFL and they play some of </garnt>
<garnt> them like cricket and rugby but you know </garnt>
<garnt> they do play other sports yes yeah um </garnt>
<connor> they have Sun that's a big one </connor>
<garnt> we have good beaches that changes the </garnt>
<garnt> game quite frankly okay okay what okay </garnt>
<connor> here's I think animals they're </connor>
<connor> completely different Landscapes </connor>
<garnt> you can say that with a place like </garnt>
<garnt> America you know you go to [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> Florida you have [ __ ] Gators you go </joey>
<joey> to Colorado it's in its own thing but </joey>
<garnt> that's the thing right it's still the </garnt>
<garnt> same country </garnt>
<garnt> there's native populations in America </garnt>
<garnt> obviously as well and it depends a lot I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know it feels weird because no </garnt>
<garnt> matter where you go right and no matter </garnt>
<joey> how much local differences okay they </joey>
<joey> never quite lose that kind of </joey>
<joey> american-ness that they they always have </joey>
<joey> whereas like certain traits that I think </joey>
<joey> Americans often have right I think that </joey>
<joey> just never really so you always even </joey>
<joey> though you're in Seattle you're in </joey>
<joey> Florida it always feels like America is </joey>
<joey> that that feeling never really goes no </joey>
<joey> matter which at least from the mainland </joey>
<joey> I've never been to Hawaii or I mean </joey>
<joey> Hawaii they've been to Alaska I don't </joey>
<joey> know how that feels but yeah it always </joey>
<garnt> still feels America like it can never </garnt>
<garnt> quite shake that that kind of The Vibes </garnt>
<garnt> that Americans have in a weird way yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I'm I mean I'm I'm saying I do think you </garnt>
<garnt> know there is some kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> american-ness in the feeling and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> like that but I'm saying like there is a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of like I go into different parts of </garnt>
<garnt> America it's like there was a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> like differences there was like there </garnt>
<garnt> was like some similarities but I've </garnt>
<garnt> never felt like such such a dichotomy of </garnt>
<garnt> like different mentalities and different </garnt>
<garnt> ways of thinking in the same country </garnt>
<garnt> before like well as I was saying the </garnt>
<garnt> reason I I brought up the UK and </garnt>
<garnt> Australia is that to me I it feels like </garnt>
<garnt> you know UK are like I'm gonna say </garnt>
<garnt> England okay because I'm mostly talking </garnt>
<garnt> about England yeah English people and </garnt>
<garnt> Australian people feel like they're cut </garnt>
<garnt> from the same cloth but they just have </garnt>
<garnt> different starting like parameters you </garnt>
<garnt> know but I feel like we're we're kind of </garnt>
<garnt> cut from the same cloth I you know you a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of English people get along well </garnt>
<garnt> with Australians I mean we're [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> same brain cell and [ __ ] like that even </garnt>
<garnt> though we grew up like halfway across </garnt>
<garnt> the world from each other you know what </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I feel like culturally we have </garnt>
<garnt> like the same sense of humor a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the times we kind of think it's very </garnt>
<garnt> similar we have like you know we have </garnt>
<garnt> our different cultures that depend on </garnt>
<garnt> you know where we are in the world and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that and like the </garnt>
<garnt> wildlife and the geography and all that </garnt>
<garnt> stuff but I feel like at its core we you </garnt>
<connor> know we think a lot of the same ways </connor>
<connor> whereas in America you go to like </connor>
<connor> different stages like there is such a </connor>
<garnt> big difference going from a red state to </garnt>
<garnt> a blue State it's like you you feel like </garnt>
<connor> I agree with that and obviously a lot of </connor>
<connor> a lot of Americans will be watching this </connor>
<garnt> they're like yo I don't want to be </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] grouped in with like Nebraska oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I don't want to be grouped in with </garnt>
<garnt> Florida yeah and that happens a lot so a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of Americans are always real really </garnt>
<garnt> feel patriotic a lot of the time about </garnt>
<garnt> their state or where they are yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and I agree yeah there are a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> differences but again like I said it's </garnt>
<connor> still feel like you never feel like </connor>
<connor> you've left America in a sense and like </connor>
<connor> I I very much feel like I'm not in the </connor>
<connor> UK when I'm when I'm in Australia when I </connor>
<connor> was there it definitely didn't feel like </connor>
<garnt> it at all to me right I don't know I </garnt>
<garnt> know I was like walking around like </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney and I saw like pubs and I saw </garnt>
<garnt> like chippies and like chicken shops I </garnt>
<garnt> was like [ __ ] I feel like I'm in London </garnt>
<garnt> right now I kind of feel like I'm at </garnt>
<connor> home right now I don't know again like I </connor>
<garnt> said earlier it's hard to compare cities </garnt>
<garnt> right because the cities more often than </garnt>
<connor> not like I I you get more Australian the </connor>
<connor> more you leave a city right yeah that's </connor>
<joey> true that's true I mean you know when I </joey>
<connor> went outside of London for the first </connor>
<connor> time you know like towards like small </connor>
<connor> country yeah yeah like you know Chris </connor>
<garnt> took me to like Salisbury and like you </garnt>
<garnt> know other places like that I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like this is definitely not like this is </garnt>
<garnt> just like as British as I get [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> gets but like you know I get yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to the cities for sure but </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't know there's still I feel </garnt>
<garnt> just like fundamentally so much more of </garnt>
<garnt> a bigger difference just because of the </garnt>
<garnt> you know the the years that have passed </garnt>
<garnt> especially and the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> geographically we're so far apart but </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah even like you know I I get it </garnt>
<garnt> with like in America for example like </garnt>
<garnt> there is definitely more of a diversity </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of like the surface level with </garnt>
<garnt> the people like you know and not even </garnt>
<garnt> talking about like an accent wise right </garnt>
<garnt> like you know obviously the moment </garnt>
<garnt> someone opens their mouth for the most </garnt>
<garnt> part you know roughly whereabouts </garnt>
<garnt> they're from all right but like I still </garnt>
<garnt> feel like yeah it's kind of said like </garnt>
<garnt> they're still at the end of the day </garnt>
<garnt> regardless of if I was in Mississippi or </garnt>
<garnt> Seattle I'm like it's still it's </garnt>
<garnt> American they're still Americans and and </garnt>
<joey> maybe it's because yeah and maybe it's </joey>
<garnt> because there's this like what do you </garnt>
<connor> think that thing is then I don't know I </connor>
<joey> think it says um you know I realized </joey>
<joey> from doing this tour and speaking to way </joey>
<joey> more Americans than I ever have in my </joey>
<joey> life is that Americans are like super </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] nice and they're really </joey>
<joey> hospitable hospitable for sure yeah </joey>
<joey> they're always really nice and then </joey>
<joey> occasionally they might just say </joey>
<joey> something or something gets brought up </joey>
<garnt> and then you know like if for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason politics is ever mentioned they </garnt>
<garnt> say something like oh </garnt>
<garnt> okay yeah well we disagree on this yeah </garnt>
<garnt> well I keep my mouth shut I never ring </garnt>
<garnt> it up but I notice some people like you </garnt>
<garnt> cannot like okay between like super left </garnt>
<connor> people and super right people initially </connor>
<connor> on the like if you're just talking you </connor>
<connor> cannot tell the difference between it's </connor>
<connor> just like with something gets said oh my </connor>
<garnt> God does it come out very fast there's </garnt>
<joey> like a rhythm to the conversation that I </joey>
<joey> think is very uniquely American and I </joey>
<joey> don't know exactly how I can describe it </joey>
<connor> yeah I don't know if it's because I'm </connor>
<joey> not American yeah I can't see it but </joey>
<joey> yeah everyone feels super nice super </joey>
<joey> welcoming and then if if for some reason </joey>
<joey> something's ever brought up that is </joey>
<joey> political even remotely so it flips to </joey>
<joey> the American that you see on the TV </joey>
<joey> right you know what I mean where you </joey>
<connor> have these these very strong opinionated </connor>
<connor> people who are very open and then you're </connor>
<connor> like ah okay this is the America you see </connor>
<connor> on the TV which is why in a way it kind </connor>
<connor> of made me appreciate America more in </connor>
<connor> the sense that I don't think it's all </connor>
<connor> doom and gloom where because I'm on TV </connor>
<garnt> bro </garnt>
<connor> they make America look god-awful yeah </connor>
<garnt> they are doing you dirty and America </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't themself because they know </garnt>
<garnt> that's the that's what gets clicks yeah </garnt>
<connor> of course um and so on on TV and from </connor>
<connor> movies and all the stuff you get the </connor>
<connor> impression that Americans are [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> insane and just to some extent in </connor>
<connor> Florida they are yeah yeah it is the </connor>
<connor> case but like I think most people in </connor>
<connor> America are super chill super nice </connor>
<connor> really awesome to talk to just don't </connor>
<garnt> bring up politics yeah ever it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> funny because we actually funnily enough </garnt>
<garnt> we went you know everyone's just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> how many like how many more things you </garnt>
<garnt> have to [ __ ] on about America and we we </garnt>
<garnt> found a lot don't worry about that but </garnt>
<garnt> we also found things we liked about </garnt>
<garnt> America as well yeah because I I just </garnt>
<garnt> liked how you always knew where you </garnt>
<garnt> stood with an American you know because </garnt>
<garnt> I grew up in I grew up in British </garnt>
<garnt> culture where everything's behind like </garnt>
<garnt> 10 layers of [ __ ] sarcasm or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that is someone being </garnt>
<garnt> passive aggressive or not you have to go </garnt>
<garnt> through like 10 lays to figure it out </garnt>
<garnt> like I get sent an email right a </garnt>
<garnt> business email he didn't he used regards </garnt>
<joey> instead of kind regards is this is is he </joey>
<garnt> like am I on it like a [ __ ] he's an </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] did I do something wrong to piss </garnt>
<joey> him off or did he forget I don't know </joey>
<joey> with an American you always know where </joey>
<joey> you stand you know because they'll their </joey>
<joey> email will start with dear [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> corrects that they just tell you exactly </garnt>
<garnt> how they're feeling you don't have to </garnt>
<garnt> like hide behind like so much </garnt>
<connor> bullshittery conversation is always nice </connor>
<garnt> I always had a great time you know as </garnt>
<garnt> much as I hate tapping uh it was great </garnt>
<joey> for getting rid of change that I didn't </joey>
<joey> want oh yeah I would just round out I'm </joey>
<garnt> like this is awesome hold up wait this </garnt>
<garnt> is a scam uh yeah tipping was a joke at </garnt>
<garnt> times oh yeah so it is somewhat </garnt>
<garnt> convenient I understand why some </garnt>
<garnt> Americans are so attached to it but also </garnt>
<garnt> never ever let that [ __ ] leave America </garnt>
<garnt> please get that out of my country yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um uh and there's some other stuff that </garnt>
<connor> was nice just people were always </connor>
<garnt> Pleasant yeah </garnt>
<joey> um but that was the thing right it's </joey>
<garnt> like I don't know when it comes to like </garnt>
<garnt> the hospital boldness of like the </garnt>
<garnt> average American like for sure like I </garnt>
<garnt> think we all discovered it's like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> Americans for the most part very </garnt>
<garnt> welcoming you know when when they mean </garnt>
<garnt> to be welcoming and they're very </garnt>
<garnt> hospitable and they want to make sure </garnt>
<garnt> that you're having the best time that </garnt>
<garnt> you can in their country yeah right but </garnt>
<garnt> then at the same time I'm just like </garnt>
<joey> is that the average American or is that </joey>
<joey> just the average trash taste fan yeah </joey>
<joey> you know that was a part of me where I'm </joey>
<connor> just like we spoke to a lot of people </connor>
<garnt> outside of uh trash taste fans obviously </garnt>
<garnt> because we had a lot of days where we </garnt>
<garnt> were just not doing shows yeah and also </garnt>
<garnt> we were just talking to people normally </garnt>
<garnt> it was always a good time I know </garnt>
<garnt> definitely I don't think I had any bad </garnt>
<connor> experiences </connor>
<garnt> um but I'm white though so I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> I mean yeah I had a like I had got a bit </garnt>
<garnt> of an experience in Detroit </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean I I was like wait so when </garnt>
<garnt> you go to the tour you had a show in </garnt>
<joey> Detroit and you know I've heard I had </joey>
<garnt> heard about Detroit's reputation and </garnt>
<joey> everything like that before yes uh so I </joey>
<garnt> came out like Garnet so uh there was </garnt>
<garnt> this like anime shop there was like one </garnt>
<garnt> block away so I was like what's the </garnt>
<joey> worst thing that could happen if I just </joey>
<joey> go to this in Detroit to go to an anime </joey>
<garnt> shop no no no there was just one that </garnt>
<garnt> was just like a block away from our like </garnt>
<garnt> uh from venue from the venue and I was </garnt>
<garnt> like there's nothing we got like three </garnt>
<garnt> hours to kill yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um I was like well why not check it out </garnt>
<garnt> why not check out the anime shop just to </garnt>
<connor> see what the the Detroit scene is like </connor>
<connor> right we walk out and I'm with my uh </connor>
<connor> with uh our producer at the time and I'm </connor>
<connor> walking around it's actually like a </connor>
<garnt> really bougie area we had like really </garnt>
<garnt> nice coffee shops really nice it wasn't </garnt>
<connor> as bad yeah from what I'd heard from </connor>
<garnt> Detroit it sounds like yeah also yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like the delicious room was quite nice </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it was nice the streets were clean </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like damn this is not the </garnt>
<garnt> image image of Detroit that I thought it </garnt>
<connor> was gonna be obviously I know there are </connor>
<garnt> some areas that are obviously of course </garnt>
<garnt> but it was it was it was like a nice </garnt>
<garnt> boujee area and I remember talk like </garnt>
<garnt> turning to my producer being like wow </garnt>
<garnt> Detroit's not what I thought he was </garnt>
<garnt> going to be at it at all this is like a </garnt>
<garnt> really nice looking area this is really </garnt>
<garnt> bougie </garnt>
<garnt> um as soon as I finish the sentence I </garnt>
<garnt> walk around the corner </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's this guy walking up </garnt>
<garnt> towards us he sees me and he goes you </garnt>
<garnt> don't belong here get out and I was just </garnt>
<garnt> like uh is he talking to me I just I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if he's talking to me maybe </garnt>
<garnt> it's just a crazy guy let's just go into </garnt>
<garnt> the store so we quickly like Shuffle </garnt>

<garnt> just gonna go in and just uh find solace </garnt>
<joey> in the [ __ ] anime story I would have </joey>
<garnt> been so scary yeah [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and then I was like okay there's this </garnt>
<garnt> there's </garnt>
<connor> there it is okay there it is not good </connor>
<joey> but that was the only time anything ever </joey>
<joey> happened right to any of us yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> I got I I definitely if there's one </joey>
<joey> thing I learned on this tour is how to </joey>
<joey> talk to homeless people and get out of </joey>
<garnt> those situations because there were many </garnt>
<garnt> times throughout the tour where you know </garnt>
<garnt> after the show you know we were just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like be hanging outside of the </garnt>
<garnt> bus you know just like talking and </garnt>
<garnt> chatting getting some fresh air and </garnt>
<garnt> stuff like that and then you know </garnt>
<garnt> usually it's like midnight or like one </garnt>
<garnt> in the morning yeah and you know because </garnt>
<garnt> we're for the most part parked in front </garnt>
<garnt> of a venue it's like you know right on </garnt>
<garnt> the side stream right yeah and of course </garnt>
<garnt> you know with uh most American towns </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of homeless people you </garnt>
<garnt> know walking around at night yeah and oh </garnt>
<garnt> my God I probably maybe con it was in </garnt>
<garnt> contact with like I want to say like 50 </garnt>
<garnt> all together on this tour yeah homeless </garnt>
<garnt> people every single tour there was at </garnt>
<garnt> least one or two homelessness who walk </garnt>
<garnt> up to us and I used I used the diet I </garnt>
<garnt> was gonna say I I understand why this </garnt>
<garnt> has this technique now the first one in </garnt>
<garnt> in Minnesota dude walks up you know </garnt>
<garnt> asking for change or whatever it was I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know he was like slurring his </garnt>
<garnt> words and I just I hit him with the </garnt>
<garnt> sorry sorry man yeah anyway sorry he </garnt>
<garnt> just like grumbled and was just like oh </garnt>
<joey> at least you're nice about it </joey>
<joey> and I was like oh my </joey>
<garnt> oh my God yeah because I feel like okay </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of like americanness right </garnt>
<garnt> there is like an inbred skill in like </garnt>
<garnt> every Americanization </garnt>
<garnt> we drove through Alabama once and it </garnt>
<garnt> just changed me man it changed like </garnt>
<garnt> every American has this like ingrained </garnt>
<garnt> skill yeah to </garnt>
<garnt> um to de-escalate with homeless people </garnt>
<garnt> yes I'm I and I saw it like I remember </garnt>
<garnt> we were outside like the Texas venue and </garnt>
<garnt> like this this homeless guy comes up and </garnt>
<garnt> it was me you and Aaron uh and I </garnt>
<garnt> remember do you remember the homeless </garnt>
<garnt> guy I was like yo this there was Jay-Z </garnt>
<garnt> performing here and and and and like </garnt>
<garnt> Aaron was like a full-on conversation </garnt>
<garnt> with him and I'm thinking like he asked </garnt>
<garnt> like he asked us like for crack and </garnt>
<garnt> stuff like yeah and I was just like I I </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what I'm doing I'm not </garnt>
<joey> going to say [ __ ] can't now which is </joey>
<garnt> completely silent yeah we were just </garnt>
<connor> completely slowing and Aaron just like </connor>
<joey> dealt with it like a [ __ ] bro he was </joey>
<connor> just like nah sorry bro yeah sorry yeah </connor>
<connor> I mean I think a lot of the times they </connor>
<connor> get homes people get demonized too much </connor>
<garnt> right at the end of the day they're the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] people who you know for whatever </garnt>
<joey> reason would like didn't life didn't go </joey>
<garnt> their way yeah I think you know just </garnt>
<connor> showing a bit of compassion they </connor>
<joey> appreciate that oh no of course like if </joey>
<joey> there's if there's one thing I've </joey>
<joey> learned it's like the the worst I guess </joey>
<garnt> reaction you can get from a homeless </garnt>
<garnt> person is ignoring them yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> because if you ignore them then that's </garnt>
<garnt> when they get pissed off right because </garnt>
<garnt> if you deal with it just like calmly and </garnt>
<connor> just you know candidly just being sorry </connor>
<connor> man you're a human right no human wants </connor>
<joey> to feel ignored sorry man have a good </joey>
<garnt> night just stuff like that they're good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but like I I notice it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> very different in America versus like </garnt>
<joey> the rest of the world for example </joey>
<garnt> because oh yeah in most places in the </garnt>
<joey> world you do ignore you know that's </joey>
<joey> that's kind of like that's kind of like </joey>
<joey> what you're taught to do right but in </joey>
<garnt> America it's like when you you see like </garnt>
<garnt> a homeless person in America they're </garnt>
<garnt> like it's hard to describe they're very </garnt>
<connor> much way more active and in your face </connor>
<connor> than compare it compared in comparison </connor>
<garnt> to like other places in the world with </garnt>
<connor> like homeless people I think it's harder </connor>
<garnt> right you're harder to get by yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they have a system that failed them yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah obviously one thing I think we all </garnt>
<garnt> noticed is that the homelessness in a </garnt>
<joey> lot of the Cities was insane yeah </joey>
<joey> you know there's certain cities it was </joey>
<joey> like whoa California this is bad yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah I mean obviously because West Coast </garnt>
<garnt> it's a lot warmer all year round so a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of times people can live there yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um so that makes a lot of sense but man </garnt>
<garnt> you just you feel for them man you know </garnt>
<connor> the system in America the way it's built </connor>
<joey> is not fair I I remember though uh Sarah </joey>
<joey> our VIP manager was just blown away by </joey>
<joey> the fact that it's like wait homeless </joey>
<garnt> people don't just talk to you in Japan </garnt>
<joey> it's like it's like what do they do and </joey>
<garnt> I'm like you do you barely see them yeah </garnt>
<joey> maybe in like Shibu or Shinjuku you </joey>
<joey> might see them but everywhere else dude </joey>
<joey> they're not there she's like where are </joey>
<joey> they all </joey>
<joey> and she just couldn't believe me when I </joey>
<garnt> said like yeah homeless like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> have to deal with homeless people in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan yeah they just don't come up to </garnt>
<garnt> you and she just couldn't believe she's </garnt>
<joey> like what what do you mean what do you </joey>
<joey> mean you don't have to deal with them </joey>
<connor> like as in the not there and I'm like </connor>
<connor> yeah I mean I think in Japan obviously </connor>
<connor> talking about homelessness there's a lot </connor>
<connor> of um obviously how you become homeless </connor>
<garnt> and the systems that make you homeless </garnt>
<garnt> in a sense yeah are very I think </garnt>
<garnt> impactful on then how as a population </garnt>
<garnt> maybe they behave or what they need to </garnt>
<garnt> do yeah Mary you've got to be ruthless </garnt>
<garnt> to get by oh yeah you know in Japan I </garnt>
<garnt> think there's there's more options that </garnt>
<garnt> you have and the the reason why I think </garnt>
<garnt> homelessness is hard to get out of in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan is it's so expensive to get a </garnt>
<garnt> place and if you don't have the correct </garnt>
<garnt> documentation it's impossible oh yeah to </garnt>
<garnt> get it sorted yeah and then a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> homeless people in Japan there I mean </garnt>
<garnt> there's some that you see sleeping on </garnt>
<connor> the street but a lot of them how much </connor>
<connor> people in Japan live in manga cafes or </connor>
<connor> live in those hotels that are one night </connor>
<connor> and they're they're like 30 or something </connor>
<joey> really cheap oh they live like along the </joey>
<connor> river under them yeah yeah a lot of the </connor>
<connor> times they don't you know it's it's like </connor>
<connor> it's an entirely different system </connor>
<garnt> because of the whole the whole way that </garnt>
<garnt> they become homeless and and the </garnt>
<garnt> barriers stopping them from getting out </garnt>
<garnt> of homelessness are different yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> so I you know it's very telling of the </garnt>
<connor> system and what's in place yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's why in Japan it's different yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because I think it's just something that </garnt>
<garnt> if it's like your first time in America </garnt>
<garnt> uh because like my parents like came to </garnt>
<garnt> America for the first time this year as </garnt>
<garnt> well uh and it it shocked them because </garnt>
<garnt> they they'd never seen this kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> this you know this kind of like system </garnt>
<garnt> with uh with homeless people yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> know it's it's something that every </garnt>
<garnt> American knows how to deal with but if </garnt>
<garnt> you come outside from like come from the </garnt>
<garnt> outside to see what is the situation in </garnt>
<garnt> America it's just like very very like </garnt>
<joey> shocking I remember the first time I </joey>
<joey> visited America and a homeless dude </joey>
<garnt> talked to me I was like this is where I </garnt>
<garnt> die yeah I could see the [ __ ] HP </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God I'm gonna have to fight my way </garnt>
<connor> through this situation you know it's </connor>
<connor> very intimidating it is you've never </connor>
<garnt> been experienced the US yeah especially </garnt>
<garnt> if you come from [ __ ] Japan you know </garnt>
<connor> it's scary [ __ ] I'm sure yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> terrifying yeah it's depressing as well </garnt>
<garnt> I hate seeing it online with people like </garnt>
<garnt> demonize homeless people and they're </garnt>
<garnt> like man that they're the [ __ ] worst </garnt>
<garnt> or it's their fault their homeless yeah </garnt>
<garnt> maybe sometimes that is the case but I </garnt>
<garnt> feel like just labeling them as lazy or </garnt>
<connor> whatever is is so not helpful to the </connor>
<garnt> situation and uh it's so frustrating </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's it's their fault if they're </garnt>
<joey> homeless just buy a home yes right stop </joey>
<connor> buying Starbucks laughing that [ __ ] that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] drives me on the wall actually </joey>
<garnt> actually yeah there was one situation I </garnt>
<garnt> think if we were in uh Nashville uh </garnt>
<garnt> Tennessee there was a there was a </garnt>
<garnt> homeless dude that came up to me he was </garnt>
<garnt> a really nice guy yeah and just like I </garnt>
<garnt> actually had like a really nice </garnt>
<garnt> conversation with him and you know at </garnt>
<garnt> the end of it all like I I just gave him </garnt>
<garnt> like five bucks because I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> you know what you're not actually all </garnt>
<garnt> that crazy I actually had a great </garnt>
<garnt> conversation with you you're respectable </garnt>
<garnt> about it whatever yeah that's fine so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah take my money but like you know if </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna come up to me and be rude </garnt>
<joey> and [ __ ] about it then like don't expect </joey>
<garnt> change you know that's not how you do </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] you know no I I I I saw one it </garnt>
<garnt> was actually in Colorado actually </garnt>
<garnt> um you know there was there was a </garnt>
<garnt> homeless person uh who was asking for </garnt>
<garnt> money uh and you know a common response </garnt>
<garnt> was obviously sorry don't have any money </garnt>
<garnt> on me yeah uh you know I've only got a </garnt>
<garnt> card and he was [ __ ] prepared man he </garnt>
<garnt> he whips out this like one-on-one of </garnt>
<joey> this like you do you know the square </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<joey> it was like don't worry you can tip me </joey>
<garnt> if you want I'm like yo he's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> hustling man yo yo marvelous dudes in </garnt>
<garnt> the 21st century holy [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> on his phone he's like I got PayPal I </garnt>
<garnt> was like no [ __ ] shocked me man I was </garnt>
<connor> like holy [ __ ] I respect that I'm taught </connor>
<connor> in many ways about it because I I also </connor>
<connor> like you mentioned like that one of them </connor>
<joey> was nice and some of them aren't nice </joey>
<joey> yeah well I don't know in a weird way </joey>
<joey> it's like man the government should </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] help them why do I have to </joey>
<joey> decide which one is a good Court Jester </joey>
<joey> and which one amused me the most yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah give money out like a king giving </joey>
<joey> it to a peasant like I'm like just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] help these people stop stop </joey>
<garnt> doing wasting all this money on other </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] but I guess they say a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> people don't want to don't want to pay </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and also the problem's going on so </garnt>
<connor> long now that there's no there's no </connor>
<connor> simple solution so ingrained and yeah </connor>
<joey> accept it it's just become a cycle now </joey>
<garnt> unfortunately yeah yeah I mean I've </garnt>
<garnt> currently the system's broken and uh I'm </garnt>
<connor> not well informed enough to </connor>
<connor> unfortunately not to fix it yeah God's </connor>
<garnt> stepping in guys guys </garnt>
<garnt> here's how you deal with it well okay </garnt>
<connor> just give them houses it's also oh you </connor>
<connor> want to preface that obviously America </connor>
<joey> has a bad one but like the UK and Europe </joey>
<joey> is also not not great at all oh </joey>
<joey> Australia has tons of homes yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> for sure yeah I mean house prices are </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] insane yeah all of Europe and </garnt>
<joey> Australia and America right now and you </joey>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<connor> it's hard to change the rules when the </connor>
<connor> dudes in top have uh have benefits yeah </connor>
<garnt> in making sure the house prices stay </garnt>
<garnt> high yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but like what okay so we went across </garnt>
<garnt> like how many states do we go in America </garnt>
<connor> again I'm in a cross or like a </connor>
<connor> drive-through or like stopped in </connor>
<garnt> Stockton yeah like 30 maybe 40 35. what </garnt>
<joey> was that no not that many no maybe 30 </joey>
<joey> 30. I'd say yeah 25 to 30. yeah because </joey>
<garnt> it was weird because I was like talking </garnt>
<garnt> to Sydney I was like I think I've been </garnt>
<garnt> to more States than you have now yeah </garnt>
<connor> how [ __ ] well we've probably traveled </connor>
<connor> more of the US than most people yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah I I actually downloaded an app </joey>
<garnt> which is like you can mark off like </garnt>
<garnt> which states you've been to in the US </garnt>
<garnt> I've been to exactly 25 States like 50 </garnt>
<joey> of the US yeah and I'm like that's more </joey>
<connor> than most Americans I'm like that's </connor>
<connor> pretty cool but obviously we only spent </connor>
<joey> a day there so it's like yeah I don't </joey>
<joey> count the ones we drove yeah yeah I </joey>
<garnt> think like a day is enough to get like a </garnt>
<garnt> Vibe no I agree but not enough to like </garnt>
<garnt> know everything about the place but no </garnt>
<garnt> okay it was like enough for me to get a </garnt>
<garnt> Vibe about where I would where would </garnt>
<connor> like possibly like to go back in the </connor>
<garnt> future maybe yes top three places in the </garnt>
<connor> US we went to go </connor>
<garnt> um on this Tour on this tour okay </garnt>
<connor> first place is easy for me Nashville </connor>
<joey> Tennessee </joey>
<joey> that would be in my top three for sure </joey>
<garnt> like Nashville was super weird for me </garnt>
<connor> because if you're not from the US you no </connor>
<connor> one really like knows about it there's </connor>
<connor> no some musical people are from there </connor>
<connor> yeah you just know if some new musical </connor>
<connor> people know about it uh are from there </connor>
<connor> sorry but like no one really like talks </connor>
<garnt> about Nashville but it was like one of </garnt>
<garnt> the most active and happening cities we </garnt>
<garnt> went to on our tour I think uh because </garnt>
<garnt> there's this strip on Nashville uh and I </garnt>
<garnt> went it's called the strip it's called </garnt>
<joey> The Strip it was like I think it's like </joey>
<joey> their Broadway or something like that </joey>
<joey> um and I went there on a Tuesday at 3 </joey>
<garnt> P.M and it felt like I just walked into </garnt>
<garnt> a music festival there's this strip in </garnt>
<joey> Nashville that is like playing that has </joey>
<joey> live music in every bar 24 7. that's </joey>
<joey> pretty cool yeah it's [ __ ] insane </joey>
<garnt> um and also like the city was like very </garnt>
<garnt> chill it's like in the South as well so </garnt>
<garnt> you get like Southern Hospitality which </garnt>
<connor> I was like one thing I discovered him </connor>
<connor> was good the chicken there was awesome </connor>
<connor> and and and it was only one of uh four </connor>
<connor> cities that voted bone and chicken as </connor>
<garnt> Superior so what isn't there to like </garnt>
<garnt> about Nashville Tennessee [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> awesome City I like natural good chicken </connor>
<garnt> all right so what's number two and three </garnt>
<garnt> then gone number two </garnt>
<joey> is it is it just on this tour just on </joey>
<joey> this tour just on the stool yeah that </joey>
<connor> you discovered okay it's it's I don't </connor>
<garnt> know if it's gonna be a cop-out but I </garnt>
<garnt> already enjoyed Toronto Canada as well </garnt>
<garnt> the only Canadians that we went to no I </garnt>
<garnt> really really enjoy Toronto and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> already like planning to go back they </garnt>
<garnt> would sit here actually I like Toronto </garnt>
<joey> too but I'm not including it on the list </joey>
<garnt> yeah are you know what you said on this </garnt>
<connor> talk we technically went there on this </connor>
<garnt> tour where's number it was number three </garnt>
<garnt> then number three </garnt>
<garnt> I'll have to think about it </garnt>
<joey> well for me it's like in no particular </joey>
<garnt> order Nashville Tennessee was sick as </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah uh I really like Denver </garnt>
<garnt> Colorado Okay um just because like it </garnt>
<garnt> kind of has like it weirdly reminded me </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of Melbourne in the sense that </garnt>
<garnt> it's like especially like in Denver like </garnt>
<garnt> in the city everything is like you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's built up and it's compact but </garnt>
<garnt> like there's a lot of things to do in a </garnt>
<garnt> really small vicinity like you could </garnt>
<garnt> walk Denver if you wanted to and like </garnt>
<garnt> explore it and stuff like that it was </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] dope </garnt>
<joey> um and then I really like Seattle I was </joey>
<garnt> going to say Seattle is sick as [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> because I I I remember going there I </garnt>
<garnt> loved like I love the culture of Seattle </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's kind of like it's it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like a good mix </garnt>
<garnt> um it's like a good mix of like West </garnt>
<garnt> Coast yeah without like but I think like </garnt>
<garnt> felt like their own flavor than say San </garnt>
<garnt> Fran and La yeah the we went down to </garnt>
<garnt> those uh like famous uh markets yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and and like I don't know about you </garnt>
<joey> guys but like it gave me like a weirdly </joey>
<joey> European Vibe yeah yeah like in like a </joey>
<joey> weird way like it was clearly still like </joey>
<joey> American right but like the markets </joey>
<joey> themselves and like kind of the </joey>
<joey> atmosphere and the vibe of just that </joey>
<joey> little area like near the water was very </joey>
<garnt> European I'm like this is cool </garnt>
<garnt> I will say though I I probably wouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> include Seattle on the list because I've </garnt>
<joey> been to Seattle several times before </joey>
<joey> because I have family there </joey>
<joey> um I really really like the city but we </joey>
<joey> went when we went there weather was </joey>
<joey> perfect yeah weather was perfect all </joey>
<joey> right I've been to Seattle before and it </joey>
<garnt> was raining basically every day and it </garnt>
<garnt> was rain I [ __ ] despise rain okay </garnt>
<joey> I don't want the rain oh another place I </joey>
<joey> actually quite enjoyed which I've been </joey>
<joey> to before but this time around I had a </joey>
<garnt> really really fun time was uh Chicago </garnt>
<connor> yeah I was gonna say so my top three in </connor>
<garnt> no particular order Chicago's probably </garnt>
<garnt> on there so it was fun I hate to say </garnt>
<garnt> this to piss off New York people but </garnt>
<garnt> it's like New York it better </garnt>
<garnt> um I know that's gonna that's gonna </garnt>
<garnt> trigger so many more people </garnt>
<garnt> um it kind of had like all the cool </garnt>
<garnt> aspects of New York uh at least at least </garnt>
<garnt> the central part yeah I didn't go to the </garnt>
<garnt> scary part yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but the the town like the downtown </garnt>
<joey> and the center of it was amazing I </joey>
<garnt> thought sick and the food was awesome </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> um except people kept trying to sell me </joey>
<joey> drugs that kind of sucked oh yeah of </joey>
<garnt> course Chicago Seattle for sure yeah </garnt>
<joey> that was [ __ ] awesome that's such a </joey>
<joey> good time yeah Seattle there's a city is </joey>
<joey> so cool yeah and where it's laid out is </joey>
<joey> awesome yeah a really really walkable </joey>
<joey> again it reminds me of Melbourne great </joey>
<joey> food I had awesome [ __ ] food Seattle </joey>
<garnt> with the seafood </garnt>
<joey> had king crab so good yeah so good </joey>
<joey> actually oh go for it and then third </joey>
<garnt> City that's a tough one to put on I'd </garnt>
<connor> say I actually really enjoyed Austin </connor>
<garnt> Yeah Austin Austin was right I I was </garnt>
<connor> like because I you know I it's weird </connor>
<garnt> actually like I I noticed that if I like </garnt>
<garnt> my tier list of like American cities we </garnt>
<garnt> went to a lot of like the top tier ones </garnt>
<garnt> are the ones that were easier easy to </garnt>
<garnt> scoot around in I noticed I noticed a </garnt>
<garnt> correlation of ease of like ease of </garnt>
<garnt> ability to scoot around in with the </garnt>
<garnt> e-scooters and my likability of that </garnt>
<connor> City I will show I really I've been </connor>
<garnt> there before but I really like </garnt>
<garnt> Minneapolis I wish we got more time </garnt>
<garnt> there yeah yeah Minneapolis is like a </garnt>
<garnt> Vibe we get this really cool Diner yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I forgot what it was called owls owls </garnt>
<garnt> breakfast that's so [ __ ] good and </garnt>
<joey> that vibe in that Diner was so fun </joey>
<joey> everyone the staff they were sick yeah I </joey>
<joey> was asking questions they were like so </joey>
<joey> you really eat beans on toast yes yes we </joey>
<joey> do you can't get it here though yeah I </joey>
<connor> am I I don't want it here don't want it </connor>
<connor> yeah it was so good I love Minneapolis </connor>
<garnt> which of course yeah I really like this </garnt>
<garnt> is fun I really like the Midwest Midwest </garnt>
<garnt> Shame about your Winters though as well </garnt>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<joey> my God and of course it was I we had to </joey>
<joey> be there on my [ __ ] boat </joey>
<joey> yeah I swear to God it felt like a cod </joey>
<joey> zombie I felt like we were going to get </joey>
<joey> points if I brought it up Windows like </joey>
<joey> there was no one no one in Cleveland </joey>
<connor> Ohio yeah I I've been told that Columbus </connor>
<connor> Ohio was much better and it was much </connor>
<joey> more lively but Cleveland shocked yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah because I remember I remember when </joey>
<garnt> we woke up for our Ohio show and uh you </garnt>
<garnt> know sometimes we have to stop for gas </garnt>
<garnt> or something uh in Midway from like you </garnt>
<garnt> know driving to each City I wake up I </garnt>
<garnt> look out the window and I turn to one of </garnt>
<garnt> the staff members I'm like so when are </garnt>
<garnt> we going to the venue </garnt>
<garnt> and he points to like this empty parking </garnt>
<garnt> lot and he was like this is the venue we </garnt>
<garnt> are here now and I was just like what </garnt>
<joey> yeah it was wrong it was wrong one thing </joey>
<joey> we learned from this tour about America </joey>
<garnt> is that for some reason everyone is hey </garnt>
<connor> so higher for some reason uh even Ohio </connor>
<garnt> hates Ohio no one likes no one likes </garnt>
<connor> Ohio yeah yeah we we had uh we had one </connor>
<garnt> of the questions in our live show was </garnt>
<garnt> like what is the one stage you don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to be transported or Isa guide to </garnt>
<garnt> and uh out of 23 shows 21 states voted </garnt>
<garnt> Ohio as like the worst state in America </garnt>
<garnt> including Ohio including Ohio and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like what the [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<joey> it was only San Francisco and Portland </joey>
<joey> and they voted at number two yeah so you </joey>
<connor> know it's not much better weird how the </connor>
<joey> US collectively came together to hate </joey>
<joey> Ohio yeah because like I think like </joey>
<joey> everyone's Minds you know outside out of </joey>
<joey> America it's like the worst state is </joey>
<joey> Florida right because you just hear </joey>
<connor> about it so much and it's so </connor>
<connor> sensationalized with like Florida man </connor>
<connor> stuff like that but I guess like the the </connor>
<garnt> the truth the the True Villain at the </garnt>
<garnt> end of it all the secret villain not the </garnt>
<garnt> like once you defeat Florida who's the </garnt>
<garnt> secret boss at the end it's Ohio baby </garnt>
<joey> after the credits roll it's a final boss </joey>
<garnt> you have to fight and that's Ohio yeah </garnt>
<joey> so that was interesting but uh you know </joey>
<joey> yeah after our stop in Cleveland I'm </joey>
<joey> like yeah you know what don't blame him </joey>
<connor> it's pretty bad I think I would have </connor>
<connor> enjoyed um Colorado more if I didn't </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] up when I got there why what </garnt>
<connor> happened oh yeah so yeah so throughout </connor>
<garnt> this entire uh tour we had a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> spare hours like it'll be an hour here </garnt>
<garnt> and out there yeah and I would just play </garnt>
<garnt> TFT uh Team fight time Conor was </garnt>
<garnt> addicted I would just play it because it </garnt>
<garnt> was a lot of the times we would have </garnt>
<garnt> like two hours free and you can't really </garnt>

<connor> and I'm [ __ ] happy hopping off I'm </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] yes yes and then on the door </connor>
<connor> here </connor>
<connor> uh oh okay and so I get up off the bed </connor>
<connor> and as I put my foot down on the carpet </connor>
<connor> I hear like a like a Squish and it's not </connor>
<connor> like a like a light little squish it's a </connor>
<garnt> deep squish like water envelops my foot </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh oh [ __ ] and I see because the </garnt>
<garnt> beds here and the hallway goes around </garnt>
<garnt> like this and I just see wet going all </garnt>
<garnt> the way around right right to the door </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like what the [ __ ] so I run in the </garnt>
<garnt> bathtub I turn it off and prior to this </garnt>
<garnt> I checked that the bathtub had like the </garnt>
<garnt> drains yeah so that it like overflowed </garnt>
<garnt> like things so it wouldn't overflow and </garnt>
<garnt> it had them but clearly they weren't </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] work right so and then I quickly </garnt>
<garnt> pulled the plug realized the plug </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't basically work like it doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> unplug you have to prop something in </garnt>
<garnt> there to keep it up right yeah it's like </garnt>
<garnt> one of those ones stuck in yeah and so </garnt>
<garnt> it won't prop up and I'm trying </garnt>
<garnt> everything I'm trying to [ __ ] empty </garnt>
<garnt> it you know I'm like hearing yeah on my </garnt>
<garnt> door and I'm like [ __ ] okay so I I empty </garnt>
<garnt> this bathtub or try to and it's emptying </garnt>
<garnt> so slowly yeah yeah um and I opened the </garnt>
<garnt> door and I just see that from my hallway </garnt>
<garnt> I can just see a wet patch going around </garnt>
<garnt> bear in mind this is 30 minutes of a </garnt>
<garnt> bathtub yeah it did this much damage </garnt>
<garnt> right so I'm like oh [ __ ] I'm sorry and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm thinking [ __ ] I can't say I was </garnt>
<garnt> playing League of Legends </garnt>
<garnt> I can't say that's the reason why this </garnt>
<garnt> happened uh so she's like what happened </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like I I ran a bathtub and I fell </garnt>
<garnt> asleep I'm so sorry I've been really </garnt>
<garnt> tired yeah and she was like oh okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> um I'm gonna go and call the engineers </garnt>
<garnt> so I wait in this damp room I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> shoveling the water because the the </garnt>
<joey> bathroom's tiled yeah so I'm just </joey>
<joey> shoveling the water into the sink yeah </joey>
<joey> trying to get rid of all this water in </joey>
<joey> the bathroom right yeah I managed to get </joey>
<joey> rid of most of it </joey>
<garnt> um again I don't know how on Earth </garnt>
<garnt> there's this much capacity this is much </garnt>
<garnt> volume of water that was generating for </garnt>
<garnt> 30 minutes it's insane yeah um and then </garnt>
<connor> the engineers come one of them's like </connor>
<joey> super Southern Sound he goes golly this </joey>
<joey> is crazy and he goes I'm like I'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah man I I'm so sorry what the heck </joey>
<joey> happened here yeah I was like yeah I </joey>
<joey> fell asleep I ran the bathtub and he's </joey>
<joey> like all right well they're telling me </joey>
<garnt> they're like yeah just go down to the </garnt>
<garnt> front desk and uh tell them that you you </garnt>
<garnt> flooded your room and you're right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like [ __ ] how is this gonna </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] cost me bro this is gonna cost </garnt>
<garnt> me so so much [ __ ] money so </garnt>
<garnt> I go down and I'm like hey yeah I'm the </garnt>
<garnt> guy who flooded this room can I have a </garnt>
<garnt> new room like yeah yeah sure no worries </garnt>
<garnt> all right oh like remember like berate </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah she I'm like I'm sorry sorry </garnt>
<garnt> this is complete action I mean to do </garnt>
<garnt> this she's like oh no no don't worry </garnt>
<garnt> yesterday somebody flushed their toilet </garnt>
<garnt> all the [ __ ] went to the floor below and </garnt>
<garnt> I was like I was like </garnt>
<garnt> what like yeah it's an old building this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] happens all the time I'm like what </garnt>
<joey> okay they seem really chill about it </joey>
<joey> they were like they made me feel like I </joey>
<joey> did nothing I'm gonna flood another </joey>
<joey> hotel room why are you flooding your </joey>
<joey> hotel room amateur I'm gonna load </joey>
<garnt> another game of League of Legends this </garnt>
<garnt> is awesome </garnt>
<garnt> um you know and so I I get the keys I go </garnt>
<garnt> to the new room and I wanted I wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> take a bath death even though I wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> scared I was determined and it was like </garnt>
<garnt> some Cosmic intervention had come </garnt>
<connor> because there wasn't even a plug so I </connor>
<garnt> couldn't even take it back they </garnt>
<joey> purposely put you in their room to be </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> I was like he ain't taking a bath man </garnt>
<connor> bad things happen I brought in my hand I </connor>
<connor> was like I wonder if this should have </connor>
<garnt> been a problem that kept happening where </garnt>
<garnt> like because none of the Overflow things </garnt>
<garnt> worked yeah before they were like just </garnt>
<garnt> don't like to have bats </garnt>
<joey> am I gross for wanting to take a bath in </joey>
<garnt> a U.S Hotel absolutely [ __ ] lutely </garnt>
<garnt> but I just wanted to soak in it I just </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to relax yeah and so I I I was </garnt>
<garnt> like no I'm taking a bath and I got one </garnt>
<garnt> of the hand towels and I clogged it and </garnt>
<garnt> blocked the drain so I could have a bath </garnt>
<garnt> just enough so the water wouldn't leave </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then when I was done pulled it </garnt>
<garnt> all out had my bath successful was </garnt>
<connor> should I have been deterred from </connor>
<connor> plugging the bath after flooding one </connor>
<garnt> room absolutely yes no you didn't flood </garnt>
<connor> one room you flooded three rooms right </connor>
<connor> so yeah so so it was it was interesting </connor>
<connor> because um I got a message from Mylene </connor>
<connor> who obviously David must have told so </connor>
<connor> I'm one of the managers are told and </connor>
<joey> then I kept hearing Chinese Whispers </joey>
<joey> versions of my own story and then they </joey>
<joey> were like I heard he broke the whole </joey>
<joey> hotel it was like no I heard he flooded </joey>
<joey> four floors I'm like no I heard four </joey>
<joey> people </joey>
<garnt> what actually happened was not that you </garnt>
<garnt> guys ever heard an alternative story is </garnt>
<garnt> that I FL I not flooded the room next to </garnt>
<joey> me got really [ __ ] wet and the room </joey>
<garnt> below me got really wet so three rooms </garnt>
<joey> in total my room the room next to me </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> guys I don't flood four floors I didn't </joey>
<garnt> flooded three rooms guys four floors is </garnt>
<joey> way more dramatic come on that's like </joey>
<garnt> the entire Foundation is [ __ ] right so </garnt>
<joey> um </joey>
<garnt> the room next door was available by the </garnt>
<garnt> end of the day they just had to blow dry </garnt>
<garnt> the floor with this giant [ __ ] thing </garnt>
<garnt> because like because what happened was </garnt>
<garnt> is later about an hour later after this </garnt>
<joey> all happened I went back to look at the </joey>
<joey> scene of the crime yeah because I wanted </joey>
<joey> to see the damage right </joey>
<joey> was it was all dry right by an hour an </joey>
<joey> hour and a half later because I had this </joey>
<joey> giant [ __ ] heat thing yeah which </joey>
<joey> clearly this has happened before oh yeah </joey>
<joey> one of these things it was it was drying </joey>
<garnt> the carpet and the carpet was all dry </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and I was like oh all right and </garnt>
<garnt> then and then I I was like what's the </garnt>
<joey> what's the damage now like well if </joey>
<joey> there's anything we'll let you know yeah </joey>
<joey> and uh they and so I heard back from </joey>
<joey> them yet no oh [ __ ] no so I still </joey>
<joey> haven't had to pay anything yeah he's </joey>
<joey> just like I'm in Japan now </joey>
<joey> bro I was I was about to fight like I </joey>
<joey> was about to become Better Call Saul </joey>
<joey> your honor the bathtub should have </joey>
<joey> drained there was a drain and it wasn't </joey>
<joey> working clearly an engineering yeah </joey>
<joey> clearly a flaw on the design of this </joey>
<connor> bathtub and this was an accident waiting </connor>
<garnt> to happen certainly okay hold on no I </garnt>
<joey> was about to say the cherry on top of </joey>
<joey> this entire [ __ ] cake is just the fact </joey>
<joey> that this happened because you're </joey>
<joey> playing [ __ ] sleep </joey>
<garnt> you can't make that [ __ ] I think I think </garnt>
<joey> my favorite reaction because I was like </joey>
<garnt> I was actually like in a bar because we </garnt>
<garnt> were ironically enough worlds like 2022 </garnt>
<garnt> was going on and we were like I was like </garnt>
<garnt> there was a game going on I was like </garnt>
<garnt> Connor you want to come to this bar and </garnt>
<garnt> watch some league with me and so our </garnt>
<garnt> tour manager was going to join us as </garnt>
<garnt> well </garnt>
<garnt> um and I'd heard that because the room </garnt>
<garnt> was booked under her name yeah she had </garnt>
<garnt> heard that uh that's you know one of her </garnt>
<garnt> talents that she was taking care of had </garnt>
<connor> fell asleep in the bathroom so then they </connor>
<garnt> again this kept the story kept changing </garnt>
<connor> apparently I'd fallen asleep in the </connor>
<garnt> bathtub </garnt>
<garnt> so she was like panicking being like Oh </garnt>
<garnt> my God Connor you okay you hurt are you </garnt>
<garnt> like oh yeah did anything happen and he </garnt>
<connor> was like yeah I was uh no no no she goes </connor>
<garnt> oh my God what happened to you okay and </garnt>
<garnt> I just said back I'm like yeah what's up </garnt>
<garnt> like nothing happened </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I'm fine I was uh playing League of </garnt>
<connor> Legends I was like she was like I </connor>
<connor> already felt even better man I texted </connor>
<connor> her I'm like yeah so I was actually </connor>
<joey> playing League of Legends and I lied </joey>
<connor> because I didn't want to seem like I was </connor>
<connor> an absolute [ __ ] idiot </connor>
<connor> but that's what happens you know you </connor>
<joey> grab you grab the dog in the League of </joey>
<connor> Legends yeah you took an immediately </connor>
<connor> they're very kind about it again all the </connor>
<connor> hotel staff was super chill about it and </connor>
<joey> I really appreciate I just want to know </joey>
<joey> what kind of [ __ ] happens on a daily </joey>
<joey> basis in that hotel if this is something </joey>
<connor> that's like yeah whatever I'm minor </connor>
<connor> inconvenience I'm sure the weirdest </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] [ __ ] goes down hotels </garnt>
<garnt> every Hotel manager has like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> story oh bro [ __ ] that has gone down in </garnt>
<connor> a hotel yeah but that was fun yeah um </connor>
<connor> yeah and then I didn't really have any </connor>
<joey> other funny insane stories other than </joey>
<joey> the time that I went to the gym with </joey>
<garnt> Aaron and [ __ ] died nearly that was </garnt>
<joey> funny oh yes and you uh threw up yeah so </joey>
<garnt> so I don't know what it is </garnt>
<garnt> um I I I can so I obviously I have </garnt>
<connor> exercised a fair amount yeah but </connor>
<connor> obviously on the tour riding exercise in </connor>
<connor> like three weeks right and um I have </connor>
<connor> this thing that I don't know when to </connor>
<garnt> stop </garnt>
<connor> when my my body is telling me to stop </connor>
<garnt> I'm like yeah but that's just that's </garnt>
<garnt> just that's just like baby [ __ ] I'll </garnt>
<garnt> just keep running yeah and then I always </garnt>
<garnt> regret it because I realize I've ran </garnt>
<garnt> past a certain point of like no return </garnt>
<garnt> where my body will now not feel good and </garnt>
<garnt> I will actually have like [ __ ] it my </garnt>
<garnt> body out right right so </garnt>
<garnt> I I we started uh Aaron was like let's </garnt>
<garnt> go to the gym I really want to go to the </garnt>
<garnt> gym and I okay so how this all came </garnt>
<garnt> about is the night before I was like </garnt>
<garnt> let's go gym Aaron but we were kind of </garnt>
<garnt> having like a few drinks and stuff and I </garnt>
<garnt> woke up the next day and I didn't really </garnt>
<garnt> want to go to the gym anymore and so I </garnt>
<garnt> showered and I came out of this room and </garnt>
<garnt> in the corner Aaron was just sitting </garnt>
<garnt> there on the couch and he's like so </garnt>
<garnt> you've shout huh </garnt>
<garnt> not going to the gym anymore and I was </garnt>
<garnt> like no no I'm still going I just want </garnt>
<garnt> to shout out for the gym </garnt>
<garnt> trying to freshen up a little bit you </garnt>
<garnt> know what's what assuming all right </garnt>
<garnt> let's go to the gym right now </garnt>
<garnt> begrudgingly getting my stuff out of the </garnt>
<garnt> bus to go to the gym so you go to the </garnt>
<garnt> Gold's Gym and Aaron's like what do you </garnt>
<garnt> want to do and I was like well I </garnt>
<connor> normally do cardio then I normally do </connor>
<connor> like muscle exercises and he's like yeah </connor>
<connor> sure whatever so I think he was like all </connor>
<connor> right let's do cardio but let's do it </connor>
<joey> how I used to do it when I was prepping </joey>
<joey> for Crater Clash yeah okay so we're </joey>
<connor> doing basically boxing uh yeah and this </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] I knew it was going to be brutal </garnt>
<garnt> but I was like well I can't be a little </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I just like I did my first one of </garnt>
<garnt> my first few times hanging out with that </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know yeah I don't like let him </garnt>
<garnt> down and obviously I I my cardio </garnt>
<garnt> exercise is definitely different from </garnt>
<garnt> this he wanted to do a like a 15 20 </garnt>
<garnt> incline uh at uh like a six miles per </garnt>
<garnt> hour Pace uh which isn't crazy but it's </garnt>
<garnt> pretty tough God if you haven't done it </garnt>
<garnt> and you haven't been practicing this </garnt>
<garnt> type of workout that's tough yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> we're running this for about uh I want </garnt>
<garnt> to say about five minutes and I'm I'm </garnt>
<garnt> struggling and he's like all right we </garnt>
<garnt> can stop and I'm like [ __ ] okay good </garnt>
<garnt> good he's like we'll do one more round </garnt>
<garnt> after this I'm like okay [ __ ] I will do </garnt>
<garnt> one more round [ __ ] [ __ ] I normally do </garnt>
<garnt> cardio and I probably go like you know </garnt>
<garnt> I'll do like around like 3K nothing </garnt>
<garnt> crazy just kind of like get the cardio </garnt>
<garnt> burn a few calories right yeah get the </garnt>
<garnt> fitness just there and then I'll go on </garnt>
<garnt> to wait and spend more time doing that </garnt>
<garnt> so this is just like I'm not prepared </garnt>
<garnt> for this </garnt>
<garnt> so we start doing the other one and </garnt>
<garnt> about halfway through this like five </garnt>
<garnt> minute incline thing I can feel my body </garnt>
<garnt> being at the point where it's like you </garnt>
<garnt> gotta stop or we are going to have </garnt>
<garnt> consequences yeah yeah but I'm like no </garnt>
<garnt> no we'll keep going we'll keep going so </garnt>
<garnt> keep going for some reason I can I can </garnt>
<garnt> keep going even when my body's begging </garnt>
<garnt> me not to and I don't know why I've </garnt>
<garnt> always had this problem from a kid where </garnt>
<garnt> I like whatever my internal limit is I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like no no it's fine and I keep </garnt>
<garnt> pushing myself and this might never </garnt>
<garnt> matter yeah yeah this used to happen a </garnt>
<garnt> lot in like races where in school if we </garnt>
<garnt> were doing like a big race for like the </garnt>
<garnt> end of year racing I would do the whole </garnt>
<garnt> race and right at the end I would just </garnt>
<garnt> throw up yeah because I would just keep </garnt>
<garnt> going right yeah and this happened a few </garnt>
<garnt> times and I haven't done it in a few </garnt>
<garnt> years </garnt>
<garnt> um it's normally when I haven't trained </garnt>
<garnt> enough yeah so I go and I do it and I </garnt>
<garnt> feel awful and so we start doing some </garnt>
<garnt> weights and I do one we do a whole set </garnt>
<garnt> of like chests it's fine but something </garnt>
<garnt> feel a bit more rough </garnt>
<garnt> come on I can keep this down I can keep </garnt>
<garnt> this down I'm not going to throw up I </garnt>
<garnt> just felt queasy and I didn't feel good </garnt>

<garnt> dogs it's so good yeah but I will say </garnt>
<garnt> there's a yeah at least there's a lot of </garnt>
<connor> overrated things I think the most </connor>
<connor> overrated thing in America is chicken </connor>
<connor> waffles I think it's so overrated it's </connor>
<joey> not that good yeah I mean like we I had </joey>
<connor> chicken and waffles a couple of times um </connor>
<connor> we had it in North Carolina and North </connor>
<garnt> Carolina I had it in Mississippi as well </garnt>
<garnt> I I had chicken and waffle and my body </garnt>
<garnt> has never been more concerned oh bro it </garnt>
<connor> felt like I was dying it was it was like </connor>
<garnt> sensory over I was just like am I having </garnt>
<joey> breakfast lunch or dessert I'm so like </joey>
<joey> my body is yes my body was just like </joey>
<joey> what is go why why you have why am I </joey>
<connor> having breakfast lunch and dessert at </connor>
<connor> the same time this is not a taste </connor>
<connor> profile I am like I I will like it all I </connor>
<connor> don't know yeah I love chicken tenders </connor>
<joey> what what is chicken waffles it's uh </joey>
<joey> exactly exactly what you think it is a </joey>
<joey> waffle with chicken Fried Chicken Fried </joey>
<joey> Chicken Fried Chicken on top of the </joey>
<connor> waffles with cereal with syrup oh my God </connor>
<joey> yeah yes like soccer stations </joey>
<joey> take the chicken not the one it's yeah </joey>
<joey> it was insane and like you know it's </joey>
<joey> cool as like a novelty thing right being </joey>
<garnt> like you know this is something that is </garnt>
<garnt> like very American and whatever and the </garnt>
<garnt> first time I had it I was like okay yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this is actually kind of bomb you know </garnt>
<joey> it's pretty good but holy [ __ ] I feel </joey>
<joey> like I just put on like 17 pounds from </joey>
<connor> this meal I love chicken tenders so much </connor>
<joey> American chicken tenders are like next </joey>
<garnt> level it is they're so good it's so </garnt>
<garnt> every like we had a we had like chicken </garnt>
<connor> tenders at the Nashville hot chicken </connor>
<joey> places I can't remember which one it was </joey>
<joey> also the one that like Charlie got us in </joey>
<joey> Tampa as well yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's dude </garnt>
<connor> I'm about to go off I'm about to go </connor>
<connor> chicken tenders are so [ __ ] good dude </connor>
<connor> American I I have I have a message for </connor>
<garnt> Americans okay uh because I understand </garnt>
<garnt> now why these two think all chicken </garnt>
<garnt> taste the same why is that because every </garnt>
<garnt> time you [ __ ] eat chicken you only </garnt>
<garnt> eat chicken dendies I'm like there is </garnt>
<connor> more to chicken Americans than [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> chicken tenders so [ __ ] tired of </garnt>
<connor> chicken tenders I'm like there is you </connor>
<connor> guys don't seem to eat any thing like </connor>
<connor> every time we got like a recommendation </connor>
<connor> for a chicken joint you know people were </connor>
<connor> like yo like Raising Canes is like so </connor>
<connor> much better and some people like yo </connor>
<connor> Chick-fil-A so much better I'm like it's </connor>
<garnt> all you're just eating chicken tenders </garnt>
<connor> they don't do 10. it's either ten </connor>
<connor> dollars nuggets I'm like I'm like it's a </connor>
<joey> contend he's a God too man </joey>
<garnt> I I could I could eat chicken tendys </garnt>
<joey> every single day oh 100 every single day </joey>
<garnt> so far poly mustard those sauces they </garnt>
<garnt> had bro not stupid it just it just like </garnt>
<garnt> annoyed me to no ends like every time </garnt>
<garnt> we'd go to a chicken place what are we </garnt>
<garnt> having chicken tendies I'm like do you </garnt>
<garnt> not have wings do you not have the </garnt>
<garnt> thighs do you not have the [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have the legs it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> there's so much to a chicken and every </garnt>
<garnt> time it was like they were like yo </garnt>
<garnt> Raising Cane's God's here this is so </garnt>
<garnt> much better than the other place and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like it's all the [ __ ] same because </garnt>
<garnt> all you're really judging is the sauce </garnt>
<garnt> you're not even judging the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> chicken </connor>
<connor> quality was good it was good quality it </connor>
<connor> was it's like you know I think like most </connor>
<garnt> of the most of the chicken places we </garnt>
<garnt> went to the chicken quality was kind of </garnt>
<garnt> the same so the only thing you kind of </garnt>
<garnt> the only thing you were kind of judging </garnt>
<joey> is like the sauce right the chicken </joey>
<joey> quality at that at that local Tampa one </joey>
<garnt> that Charlie got us was like the chicken </garnt>
<garnt> itself tastes so much </garnt>
<joey> it was so it was like the perfect </joey>
<joey> moistness it wasn't too much batter but </joey>
<joey> there was a shitload of chicken and the </joey>
<connor> sauce oh but I heard you like Hershey's </connor>
<garnt> chocolate is this true no oh Cindy said </garnt>
<joey> you love Hershey's </joey>
<garnt> ah when did she say is or is love a </garnt>
<connor> strong word two days ago two days ago </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> I think I understand why though </joey>
<garnt> fundamentally why God was so sick of </garnt>
<garnt> chicken tandies because he doesn't eat </garnt>
<garnt> sauce </garnt>
<connor> is like what the [ __ ] what are you doing </connor>
<garnt> don't even bother but like there's like </garnt>
<garnt> this there's so much to chicken like the </garnt>
<garnt> okay here's the thing why I don't like </garnt>
<garnt> chicken tendies okay or no it's not like </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like it but like I would prefer </garnt>
<garnt> to have other types of chicken because </garnt>
<garnt> you remove like one of the best part of </garnt>
<garnt> the chicken in my mind which is the skin </garnt>
<garnt> because you just like you you get rid of </garnt>
<garnt> the skin no and there's like there's </garnt>
<joey> crispiness dude the crispiness the </joey>
<joey> crispy batter is where it's at bro oh no </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> the batteries </joey>
<garnt> the batter is good but the batter with </garnt>
<garnt> like the skin Cooks well that's why </garnt>
<garnt> that's why you know when when you go to </garnt>
<garnt> KFC and you have like anything but </garnt>
<connor> chicken Denny's the best part is the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] skin I will say uh I'm sorry </connor>
<garnt> you're going wrong yeah and like there </garnt>
<garnt> is when when we had chicken and waffles </garnt>
<connor> and you guys ordered chicken breasts </connor>
<connor> with your waffles that like triggered me </connor>
<connor> to no end I I did that to trigger you on </connor>
<connor> purpose that was like there was like a </connor>
<connor> list of like you that the only time </connor>
<connor> where these boys had a choice of which </connor>
<connor> part of the chicken they would prefer to </connor>
<garnt> have with this with their meal they </garnt>
<garnt> could have ordered breasts they could </garnt>
<garnt> have ordered Wings they could have </garnt>
<garnt> ordered thighs </garnt>
<joey> um and they ordered like two breasts </joey>
<joey> to be fair I I I chose I chose a breast </joey>
<connor> and a thigh and I will say the thigh was </connor>
<joey> definitely better in that instance </joey>
<connor> chicken tend these is on another level I </connor>
<garnt> like the kitchen the clean how clean </garnt>
<garnt> breast tastes yeah compared thigh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um [ __ ] there was something else I just </garnt>
<joey> forgot I'm an idiot um something sauce </joey>
<joey> sauce thing about the sauces [ __ ] I </joey>
<joey> forgot </joey>
<garnt> you know what you know what I think </garnt>
<garnt> America unequivly does better than </garnt>
<garnt> anywhere else what chicken wings </garnt>
<joey> straight up chicken wings are like </joey>
<joey> ginormous yeah they're they're right I </joey>
<joey> don't know how the [ __ ] they get clearly </joey>
<joey> something is going wrong the chicken </joey>
<joey> wings are like that in the U.S but I I'm </joey>
<garnt> not complaining because they're huge </garnt>
<garnt> they're [ __ ] those chickens there's </garnt>
<joey> so much meat on the chicken wing it's </joey>
<joey> insane they're on their creator Clash </joey>
<garnt> diet it's insane I I </garnt>
<garnt> disagree </garnt>
<connor> where do you think does chicken wings </connor>
<connor> better than us uh Korea </connor>
<joey> to me like to me like wouldn't that just </joey>
<joey> be the sorcer yeah sorry wouldn't that </joey>
<joey> just be the source no no no no it's it's </joey>
<joey> not the sauce right it's like they like </joey>
<garnt> the Yum Yum Chicken it's it's like you </garnt>
<garnt> know it can be a uh mixture between like </garnt>
<garnt> the meat to skin ratio the meat so like </garnt>
<garnt> like a batter ratio you know I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> the chicken wings in uh America there's </garnt>
<garnt> like too much meat that it [ __ ] up with </garnt>
<garnt> the ratio of like the marinade right oh </garnt>
<connor> God I'm I'm I I love I love Korean fried </connor>
<connor> wings so much but God damn do those </connor>
<garnt> American Wings go hard like they go so </garnt>
<garnt> much harder I I'd say like what I think </garnt>
<garnt> America does better than anywhere else </garnt>
<garnt> in the world is barbecue I was like I </garnt>
<garnt> will give American barbecue as the best </garnt>
<garnt> barbecue in the world I think America </garnt>
<garnt> does the best part I mean this I really </garnt>
<joey> want to try like uh Caribbean barbecue </joey>
<garnt> and that kind of that kind of area yeah </garnt>
<joey> because I know that they are well you </joey>
<joey> know I had like that uh the Cuban </joey>
<garnt> barbecue oh it wasn't really barbecue </garnt>
<garnt> but it was like kind of barbecue-esque </garnt>
<connor> Cuban food in um </connor>
<garnt> it was like the Cuban restaurant we went </garnt>
<connor> to in Miami that was just like nothing </connor>
<garnt> but meat and that's pretty good that </garnt>
<garnt> place was that place was pretty crazy </garnt>
<connor> yeah I wouldn't say it's Bobby but it's </connor>
<connor> like barbecue-esque in terms of like </connor>
<connor> what's that no bro South Korea has good </connor>
<joey> Wings they have they have the I'm sure </joey>
<garnt> North Korea has good wings too if they </garnt>
<garnt> have any there's definitely no meat on </garnt>
<joey> those bones though </joey>
<garnt> I said that but what are you talking </garnt>
<garnt> about don't get me wrong you've been </garnt>
<garnt> America you've been in America no you're </garnt>
<garnt> like more better more food equals better </garnt>
<garnt> I I order from I obviously it's in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> but a lot of these like a lot of them </garnt>
<garnt> are like Korean chains that are in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and I ordered a bunch dude they're just </garnt>
<connor> too flimsy bro there's no there's no </connor>
<joey> meat on the bone it's just all skin I I </joey>
<joey> think the one thing I like about a lot </joey>
<connor> of like American chicken wing is that </connor>
<connor> like a lot of the places at least the </connor>
<connor> ones where you went and it's not Fried </connor>
<connor> Chicken it's not fried chicken for </connor>
<garnt> starters but like the source is like </garnt>
<garnt> separate to the wing right so you can </garnt>
<garnt> like dip as much more as little sauce as </garnt>
<garnt> you want whereas the Yum Yum Ranch but </garnt>
<joey> like the Yum Yum she doesn't like souls </joey>
<joey> for example in South Korea it depends on </joey>
<garnt> the sauce </garnt>
<joey> okay okay </joey>
<garnt> that's why I don't belong in America </garnt>
<joey> Midwestern girl how could you not like </joey>
<joey> wrench is it even possible to not like </joey>
<garnt> Ranch but I'm just like is there more </garnt>
<garnt> sauce than just Ranch because I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> you don't need anything you don't need </garnt>
<garnt> to be I'm I'm not saying there's so much </garnt>
<garnt> more variety in like other countries </garnt>
<garnt> it's all about one [ __ ] sauce okay </garnt>
<joey> let's go let's go through it all then </joey>
<garnt> honey mustard yeah </garnt>
<joey> yes okay what else what what other </joey>
<joey> condiments can you eat with a chicken </joey>
<joey> wing what other condiments can you eat </joey>
<garnt> with a chicken wing oh you don't like </garnt>
<joey> barbecue I actually do I mean I </joey>
<joey> literally just said American barbecue I </joey>
<garnt> think barbecue works better with like </garnt>
<garnt> beef and pork rather than chicken uh </garnt>
<garnt> like I said I prefer like there's uh </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of like Thai chicken wings </garnt>
<garnt> as well with like this very it's a very </garnt>
<joey> sour spicy sauce right </joey>
<joey> um I like the Korean chicken wings as </joey>
<joey> well with like a little bit of sweet I </joey>
<connor> like spicy stuff buffalo sauce I do love </connor>
<garnt> buffaloes buffalo wings are the goat I </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] that's that's the best I just don't </connor>
<joey> want to drench it too much yeah that's </joey>
<connor> what I don't like about buffalo sauce </connor>
<joey> it's like when it's sometimes it's just </joey>
<connor> too I go too hot I don't get it because </connor>
<connor> you drench it in the sauce in the ranch </connor>
<connor> anyway what's the difference the ranch </connor>
<connor> you need to drench it the rent there </connor>
<joey> because Ranch is great because rice is </joey>
<joey> amazing I could drink less it's so good </joey>
<connor> sauce you can eat the buffalo sauce and </connor>
<connor> then you want to mix it up you're like </connor>
<joey> dip it in some ranch yeah you can do </joey>
<joey> Buffalo and Ranch mixture bomb Oh I'm </joey>
<garnt> like I'm like so what I'm so what I'm </garnt>
<garnt> understanding here what I'm </garnt>
<garnt> understanding </garnt>
<garnt> is that you guys just really [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> like Ranch no but the wings are amazing </connor>
<connor> the wings are even without the wrench </connor>
<connor> are way better than anything yeah you </connor>
<joey> get like because I'm actually eating </joey>
<joey> meat yeah whereas like in I disagree </joey>
<garnt> where is </garnt>
<garnt> I said I said I think there is like I've </garnt>
<joey> got what was like the biggest wins you </joey>
<joey> want in America because I'm I'm thinking </joey>
<joey> about the wings I get in the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Midwest and in in the midwest they are </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] obese </garnt>
<garnt> yeah they're huge These Wings Are </garnt>
<garnt> massive yeah that's why it's good I </garnt>
<garnt> think I'm like I'm like I I there is </garnt>
<garnt> like to me like well you guys you guys </garnt>
<garnt> eat chicken breasts right so okay I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just I'm just gonna realize like you </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] love the white meat you [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> you [ __ ] love that [ __ ] that's what I </garnt>
<garnt> love chicken I like a mixture between </garnt>
<garnt> like you know the the skin as well I </garnt>
<garnt> like a mixture between having the </garnt>
<garnt> marinade on it it's not always about </garnt>
<garnt> fried sometimes you grill it as well </garnt>
<joey> that's why I love like the massive </joey>
<garnt> chicken wings though because there's so </garnt>
<connor> much meat on one chicken wing with one </connor>
<connor> chicken wing you can like mix and </connor>
<connor> matches around being like all right </connor>
<connor> first bite gonna put some ranchers </connor>
<garnt> and it's just so good dude because okay </garnt>
<joey> do you do you dip your chicken Wings in </joey>
<joey> the source sometimes sometimes yeah </joey>
<joey> because to me chicken wings chicken </joey>
<garnt> wings are like you know you've chickened </garnt>
<joey> yeah pre-marinated chicken you dip in </joey>
<garnt> the sauce is [ __ ] chicken tendies </garnt>
<garnt> it's nugs not because there's no bugs no </garnt>
<joey> there's no bones right I you know the </joey>
<joey> reason I like Bones the one with the </joey>
<joey> bone yeah the one with the bone like the </joey>
<joey> drumsticks you can dip it in the sauce </joey>
<joey> oh you're talking about are you talking </joey>
<garnt> about drumsticks I've thought you're </garnt>
<garnt> talking about wings easy wings as well </garnt>
<joey> you get a wings as well yeah but like if </joey>
<joey> you can't get it in the container then </joey>
<joey> you get the container like pour it on </joey>
<garnt> top just like your [ __ ] fight into it </garnt>
<garnt> that's just like and it's good [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> that's not I thought that was like the </garnt>
<garnt> one advantage of having boneless chicken </garnt>
<garnt> which is that you can just it's just </garnt>
<joey> yeah why do you think we love boneless </joey>
<joey> chicken because of the convenience I can </joey>
<connor> eat everything but if the wing is there </connor>
<joey> then I'm gonna be like well if there's </joey>
<joey> only Wings here then I'm obviously gonna </joey>
<joey> eat it because I like wings as well but </joey>
<joey> it's a little bit inconvenient for me to </joey>
<joey> have to grab the sauce and pour it on </joey>
<garnt> top that's it and I'm just like the the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] advantage of wings is that </garnt>
<joey> normally it's early candies I can just </joey>
<joey> get straight into that [ __ ] it's like </joey>
<joey> perfectly shaped to fit the container </joey>
<joey> normally the advantage of wings is that </joey>
<garnt> it just tastes good by itself it's </garnt>
<garnt> already marinated or it's already got </garnt>
<connor> sauce you don't have to dip it in yeah I </connor>
<connor> like it sometimes with it with and </connor>
<joey> without it's just a different flavor you </joey>
<joey> want to mix it up yeah you want to mix </joey>
<connor> it up it's clam take on it what I'm what </connor>
<garnt> I'm like discovering right now is that </garnt>
<garnt> these two just doesn't they don't care </garnt>
<garnt> about the taste of the chicken it's all </garnt>
<garnt> about the taste of the sauce you know </garnt>
<connor> that's that's what do you mean no one </connor>
<joey> eats chicken wings with no sauce or dry </joey>
<joey> rub or anything that's psychotic are you </joey>
<garnt> Dr you there's dry rubs yeah no no </garnt>
<connor> you're not and you know literally the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] Wings we had in the office from </garnt>
<garnt> like that male in cook they were dry </garnt>
<connor> rubs no I know I like that yeah I'm not </connor>
<connor> arguing against them sometimes you want </connor>
<joey> to put more sauce on it yeah why is it </joey>
<joey> so hard to comprehend sometimes I wanna </joey>
<joey> I I like the option of additional shoes </joey>
<joey> if I want extra sauce or not sometimes </joey>
<joey> you know I'm in the mood where I'm like </joey>
<joey> I don't need the extra sauce because it </joey>
<joey> already tastes good enough sometimes I </joey>
<garnt> want a little more yeah but like what </garnt>
<garnt> I'm what I'm trying to say is what I </garnt>
<garnt> think good wings are well I think good </garnt>
<garnt> chicken is is that it should taste good </garnt>
<joey> you know by itself if you are putting </joey>
<joey> too much sauce in it then you're not </joey>
<joey> really judging the chicken you're </joey>
<joey> judging the sauce which is like which is </joey>
<joey> like my biggest pet peeve with a lot of </joey>
<joey> like chicken places </joey>
<joey> because the chicken wing sucks no amount </joey>
<joey> of sauce is Gonna Save it yeah I'm not </joey>
<connor> gonna eat it </connor>
<connor> I think we like the taste of the chicken </connor>
<joey> we just like it also it yeah we enhanced </joey>
<garnt> yeah I like I already like the taste of </garnt>
<garnt> the chicken but with the sauce it's like </garnt>
<garnt> an added bonus yeah yeah but if the </garnt>
<garnt> chicken wing sucks no amount of ranch is </garnt>
<garnt> going to save that [ __ ] ah you I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know man with the amount of ranch I see </garnt>
<garnt> Americans put on their chicken wings I </garnt>
<joey> it just seems like putting a [ __ ] ton of </joey>
<joey> ranch is not a choice it's the default </joey>
<joey> unless that's one and you know what I'm </joey>
<joey> glad </joey>
<joey> that's what I saw right it's it's not </joey>
<garnt> even about how good the wings are it's </garnt>
<garnt> about how much sauce you put on it and </garnt>
<joey> I'm just looking multiple times </joey>
<joey> throughout the tour where all I had to </joey>
<joey> say was Ranch and I got an entire crowd </joey>
<joey> chant everyone loves Ranch everyone </joey>
<joey> loves Ranch </joey>
<joey> thankfully you're the minority question </joey>
<joey> is boys what's the tour of success oh </joey>
<joey> massive success I mean a better question </joey>
<joey> Robert is would we do it again yeah I </joey>
<connor> think a lot of people you know in Europe </connor>
<garnt> and Southeast Asia would want a tour and </garnt>
<garnt> uh they were very vocal about how </garnt>
<garnt> annoyed they were they didn't get it </garnt>
<connor> yeah and they were like I don't care </connor>
<joey> about the tool I don't see anything </joey>
<joey> about it the amount of Europe tour wins </joey>
<connor> yeah southeast Asia we're definitely </connor>
<connor> considering stuff like that because the </connor>
<garnt> first one went so well yeah I think yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I think uh I don't know if this </garnt>
<garnt> can be a spoiler but we we recorded some </garnt>
<garnt> of the shows and we're gonna we're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> put some of them on YouTube uh but I </garnt>
<garnt> think even after that one thing I liked </garnt>
<garnt> about the tour was that we got to learn </garnt>
<garnt> about each place we went to and there's </garnt>
<garnt> so many more places and so many more </garnt>
<garnt> shows I want to do in different places </garnt>
<garnt> to like learn about what goes on in that </garnt>
<garnt> place the culture of that place and I </garnt>
<garnt> think if we were to do another tour we </garnt>
<garnt> probably would not do exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> format or exactly the same show but </garnt>
<garnt> we'll we would probably take aspects of </garnt>
<garnt> this show and try to do it you know in a </garnt>
<joey> more worldwide uh worldwide more places </joey>
<joey> worldwide I think one thing as well that </joey>
<joey> again like you know was a great thing to </joey>
<garnt> come out of doing this tour is the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that we've learned so much about how to </garnt>
<garnt> put on a performance in a stage setting </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which I think is really valuable </garnt>
<garnt> and uh you know it's you know I </garnt>
<joey> personally learned a lot of skills doing </joey>
<joey> shows on stage that you know I can </joey>
<joey> utilize on trash test recordings or like </joey>
<joey> you know just regular videos and stuff </joey>
<joey> like that right and it's like it's just </joey>
<joey> like a cool and also you know like it's </joey>
<joey> just a cool thing to be like yeah I went </joey>
<joey> around America doing shows and [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> that on stage it was pretty dope yeah </joey>
<joey> like it's just like a cool story and </joey>
<joey> experience and you know like from the </joey>
<joey> amount of stories we've already told </joey>
<joey> just from this episode it's like </joey>
<joey> invaluable yeah I I will say if we do a </joey>
<garnt> show again we'll probably do less shows </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> 23 was too much 23 was too much too much </garnt>
<garnt> I got back and like I haven't like </garnt>
<garnt> streams haven't even tweeted because I </garnt>
<garnt> was just like I need a period in my life </garnt>
<garnt> where I just don't have an audience </garnt>
<garnt> watching me I was like I just I just </garnt>
<garnt> don't need an audience right now and I </garnt>
<garnt> was just like chilling out just doing </garnt>
<garnt> nothing </garnt>
<garnt> um and </garnt>
<garnt> that's because 23 shows is way too much </garnt>
<garnt> also I think I was like the only one </garnt>
<garnt> that actually got ill on the tour as </garnt>
<connor> well I got sick twice oh okay I got sick </connor>
<garnt> once right before we started and I was </garnt>
<connor> like oh no please </connor>
<garnt> towards the end yeah it's like I think I </garnt>
<garnt> had to like perform like the last few </garnt>
<garnt> shows with like a pretty bad fever which </garnt>
<garnt> was difficult but hopefully I I got told </garnt>
<joey> that no one really noticed it no no you </joey>
<garnt> hit it very well yeah but that's because </garnt>
<garnt> like I was literally in like I was </garnt>
<garnt> literally in Sage Mode the entire day I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't see any of these boys I was just </garnt>
<joey> like by myself on the bus conserving </joey>
<joey> energy for this two-hour show because I </joey>
<garnt> was like dying in bed it was in monk </garnt>
<joey> mode yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> I was like Gathering energy I was like </garnt>
<garnt> you can do with this gun you can do this </garnt>
<garnt> um so yeah 23 shows is a lot uh probably </garnt>
<garnt> to do less shows but I I I would </garnt>
<garnt> definitely want to do more shows yeah </garnt>
<garnt> hell yeah for sure </garnt>
<connor> yeah I enjoyed it it was just too long </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah but the last Slide the past </garnt>
<garnt> like last week we week and a half two </garnt>
<garnt> weeks I was kind of like all right </garnt>
<connor> everybody ready to go home now yeah </connor>
<joey> think about Japan okay yeah I missed </joey>
<joey> Japan yeah I think though I think I'm </joey>
<joey> just glad that like you know I because </joey>
<connor> again this was our first tour ride so I </connor>
<connor> think we all three of us weren't really </connor>
<connor> too sure if we were gonna bro I did not </connor>
<connor> know what I actually experience it like </connor>
<connor> nothing you know just we'd heard from </connor>
<connor> other people about like how tours went </connor>
<connor> but it's like you know not every tour is </connor>
<joey> the same kind of thing right so you know </joey>
<joey> I was just hoping I'm like please </joey>
<joey> I just want to come out of this tour </joey>
<joey> liking what I went through yeah luckily </joey>
<joey> I did so I think it was like awesome </joey>
<joey> it's like you know I think a lot of </joey>
<joey> YouTubers </joey>
<joey> um and streamers whatever they often get </joey>
<garnt> in the Trap of like never leaving their </garnt>
<garnt> house and you're just making stuff in </garnt>
<garnt> your home and I feel like you're selling </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of really cool life experiences </garnt>
<garnt> that could enhance maybe even your </garnt>
<garnt> content or how you view the world well </garnt>
<garnt> for sure and allow you to learn and </garnt>
<garnt> expand your horizons you know I think I </garnt>
<garnt> think traveling is one of the best ways </garnt>
<garnt> to just kind of open your mindset a bit </garnt>
<garnt> and learn from other cultures yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> so I think it's uh if you get the </garnt>
<garnt> opportunity to do it you should always </garnt>
<garnt> do it I genuinely learn a lot about </garnt>
<garnt> American history yeah I did I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> I know a lot more intricacies of the US </garnt>
<garnt> now yeah and how States view each other </garnt>
<garnt> and how they interact and how States </garnt>
<garnt> well they're proud about what they what </garnt>
<garnt> they love talking about yeah um and I </garnt>
<garnt> think I speak for all of us when I say </garnt>
<garnt> this um that you know we're really </garnt>
<garnt> grateful to everyone who took like a </garnt>
<garnt> gamble on us essentially because we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't we'd never taught before there </garnt>
<garnt> was absolutely no reason that this was </garnt>
<garnt> going to be good there was nothing to </garnt>
<garnt> tell value that it was going to be a </garnt>
<garnt> good show yeah you know and a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> people spent a lot of money spent a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of time they were driving you know four </garnt>
<garnt> or five hours to come to these shows and </garnt>
<garnt> was buying hotels and buying a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> tickets and you know just at the uh just </garnt>
<garnt> at the opportunity to see us and maybe </garnt>
<garnt> hopefully have a good show and uh that </garnt>
<garnt> night it was gonna be good yeah um I </garnt>
