<SPEAKER_01> - Boys, America, America, America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (mid tempo music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's up freedom fighters? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Welcome to "America
and Trash Taste", baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm freedom fighter one with
freedom fighters two and three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is not even the right accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for where we're at.
- In America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're in LA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We're in LA, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my fucking God guys,
welcome back to "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the best show
on the fucking internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This ain't my mans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Guys, this is not our mans right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, come on, you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am your, mans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not when you do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not when you do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had to set the scene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we're once again in
a different place entirely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're not in the UK anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're in the United States of America now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you truly had the Karen accent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You are truly now cosplaying
your Karen form aren't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Call the manager right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to speak with her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> But yeah, we're in LA in
this beautiful Airbnb. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The most grandiose our
set has ever looked. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it?
- Is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - These couches are pretty
fucking nice to be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - These couches are comfy,
a bit too comfortable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm just sinking back in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm definitely sinking back in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gotta fucking talk and be aware </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, "Oh Joey,
Joey, you fucking talk." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was thinking about
I have to hold my mic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it just keeps moving. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So I have to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every podcaster ever
fucks with their mic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They go, "If I go one
second without touch my mic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "on a podcast, I'm gonna cry." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll double fist like
Lady B did in "Cry". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, double clutch it like Lady B did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, we've made it to Los Angeles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we've somehow been
able to build a studio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> despite a lot of issues
that we've been through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're gonna get into that very quickly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure the rounds have already been made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the actual situation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The rounds have already been made. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - The rounds have already been made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> People online-
- I mean, if you been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Reddit, maybe you're aware of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If not, which our big
portion of audience isn't- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey Paul, the sub Reddit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so our baggage containing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne said it was
$30,000 worth of equipment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is actually I think closer to 50,000. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's closer to 50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, closer to $50,000
worth of filming equipment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all our mics, all our cameras
were lost on the way here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and at this moment we
still dunno where they are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we had to scramble to
get all of this equipment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so that we can actually film some episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially because we're
gonna get guests on eventually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as well from next episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, so it's just stressful as shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This was not the start that we wanted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm so thankful that we
scheduled in two, three days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> of just no guests, no filming
anything because if we thought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that we were gonna hit the ground running, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> we would've been fucked,
absolutely fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Our guest literally
arrives and it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So where's the set?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And we're like "Ah, yeah, about
that, it doesn't exist yet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you wanna explain your process </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of going to the airport. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I was in charge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of bringing all of the
equipment to America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause these boys flew a bit early. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I get to Heathrow Airport terminal two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and already, alarm bells were ringing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I get there and I want to check in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can't check in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I hear one of the operators say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh no, we can't check anyone in right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "'cause there is a queue
downstairs of about 200 bags </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "and no one can check in right now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm like, "That's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "That's a bad omen right there." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's worrying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I arrive an hour,
no, two hours before my flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as that's what they recommend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I have to wait an hour
just to check in my bags, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to check in my bags </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's true for pretty
much everyone on the plane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I check in my bags an
hour before our flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I check in my normal bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we have two massive
Pelican cases containing all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of our filming equipment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they look at that and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We can't check that in here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You're gonna have to go to
the oversized luggage section." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh no, oh no." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is scary already. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - My spidey senses were tingling. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Something
is going to go wrong." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so I bring over the
two Pelican cases over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to the oversized luggage place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And so there's an operator there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you could tell this
operator, he was fucking done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He does not give a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's probably been dealing
with this for a few days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he does
not give a shit at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he looks at the
Pelican cases and he is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, just put
them on the conveyor belt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and I'll get it through the system." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I put it on the conveyor belt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He presses a button to open a shutter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get it through the airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The shutter doesn't open and
he presses again, doesn't open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Okay, something
weird is going on here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Is this a malfunction or something?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he sits there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He sits down and he sits there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for five minutes doing nothing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doing nothing.
- [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - He just sits there for five minutes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not even pretend to work? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah just doesn't
even pretend to work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He just sits down and plays on his phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then while I'm waiting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a queue starts to form behind me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> First it's one person,
then it's two people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's three people and
it really starts to build up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so after about 10 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of just sitting down doing nothing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy just tries to press
it again, doesn't work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then finally, he phones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He tries to phone someone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He tries to do something about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so he phones the operator in charge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of whoever is in charge of the baggage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he says, "Oh, the shutter won't open." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, we're not letting
any bags in right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "because we are just completely full. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We cannot take anymore bags </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into our system.
- What the fuck happens? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so I was waiting
for about 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was waiting in this queue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for about 20 minutes before
he presses the button </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the shutter finally opens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the fucking bags finally went through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember by the
time my bags went through, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was half an hour before my flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember thinking,
finally, the shutter is open, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bag goes through and
then the shutter close. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there was just this moment of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm never gonna see them again am I?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a feeling, I had a feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Self-fulfilling prophecy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, had a fucking vision. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It closed and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I have a bad feeling about
this, like fucking OB one." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember texting
the group being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, not to be alarmed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "but I'm pretty sure there's a good chance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "that maybe we won't get
to see our equipment." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I was hoping outta hope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I check in, we go through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I flew Aer Lingus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So the Aer Lingus flight
goes from Heathrow to Dublin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then Dublin to America, LAX. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so the flight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from Heathrow to Dublin was
actually on time, which I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the reason our
bags didn't get delivered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was on time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we woke up the next
day and we found out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that there's an image on screen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with all of the bags </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are stuck in
Heathrow terminal two now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a fucking sea of bags. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Our bag is somewhere
in there at this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then after that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I check in to my second
flight to go to America, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we all check in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sitting in my seat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you know where you
have some of those flights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where for some reason, the
plane just doesn't move? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So we were sitting
there for a full on hour. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So we were sitting there
for a full hour trying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to figure out what's going on? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Are we actually gonna take off? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then after an hour,
the operator comes in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and was like, "Guys, I know
you've been waiting a while, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "that's because there's
been a massive queue </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "on the runway right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "So we're gonna be a bit delayed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "and I'm gonna be real with you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "it's looking like that
we're gonna be sitting here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "for another two hours." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know when bad news gets announced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just feel the air just drop? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was that fucking grown noise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just distributed throughout
the entire fucking plane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone's just like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we all start getting out our phones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was thankful
'cause I got to catch up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with fucking "Spy family". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I did with my
extra two hours on the tarmac. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It could've been worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it could've been worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But after being delayed for
three hours on the tarmac, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> finally I get to go to LAX. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Fucking brilliant, I finally
get to go my flight to America. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The flight itself was very, very pleasant. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We had some very good, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what are they called,
air stewardesses there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Service?
- Yeah, service, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had very good service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The flight itself was great, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then the nightmare
continued when I landed in LAX. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or just any landing at LAX. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - The nightmare continued.
- Yeah, and so I get down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I thought that I had saved time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause if you fly from Dublin to America, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have pre-clearance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you fly from Dublin,
you don't actually need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go through immigration in America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's very fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you can go through
immigration in Dublin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's treated as a domestic flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, "Great." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can just pick my bags and
get the fuck out of there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I walk for what
feels like 20 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get to my baggage collection. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was pretty fucking long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we all had to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and by the time I get there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> our bags aren't even on the carousel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they are so busy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> The people from the previous flights </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are still getting their
bags from this carousel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause there's only one carousel
in the domestic terminal. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> People from Hawaii, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which was the flight
before were still waiting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for their bags to come out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So we couldn't get our bags </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before the passengers from Hawaii </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to completely get their bags out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I was waiting for about an hour </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before we even got any bags
from our flights to come out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And then after their bags
finished getting collected, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finally our bags come out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like a drip feed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how it was
such a slow drip feed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Were they fucking cycling
it over one bag at a time? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they were dragging it
over the same journey you did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so it was coming out
fucking five bags at a time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So by the time I got some of my bags out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I had to wait another 20, 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then of course, I was
waiting for my equipment bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I wait, I wait a little longer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wait a little longer and they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So thank you, ladies and gentlemen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "the Aer Lingus bag flights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "at the Aer Lingus flight
bags are now finished. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So if you have any bags to collect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> "we've collected it in a corner." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was just like, "Fuck,
I did not see the bags </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "that I had." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I would rather have lost my clothes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> than lose the $50,000 of equipment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I go to this
corner and there's a line </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of about 30 people being like,
"Where the fuck is my bag?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no.
- And so after that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to queue again with
these 20, 30 people all trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to wave their fucking
tickets to pick a form up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was my first reminder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about what I can experience here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of customer service </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I'm used to
Japanese customer service. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are blessed with
Japanese customer service. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I am very blessed
with Japanese customer service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where they felt like they
will do anything they can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to help you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Or at least, they will at
least pretend to give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> At LAX, I've had two instances now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where there is not even any
pretending to give a shit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about the customer at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If anything, I felt guilty
for having to trouble them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for an issue with the fucking airport. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I had to fucking fight my way through </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to give them the ticket. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And this guy punching my numbers in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to this lost and found form
just could not give a shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> He didn't give a shit so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we found out later that he'd
punched in the wrong numbers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to this form. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so it was this
experience of everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that could go wrong with
a flight did go wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it turned a already long
travel time from England </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to America and added
around five to six hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on top of that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm so sorry you had to go through that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just ain't it, it just ain't it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, this ain't it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And yeah, at this moment in time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that's all we know about
what's happened to our bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's still in
Heathrow if I'm gonna guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Hopefully, we can get our equipment back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - But what happens if they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, by the way, we delivered
it to LAX a month later." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "We're not in LAX anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what the fuck is happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just frustrating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish they would tell you anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the fact the airline
leaves you completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the dark and doesn't
tell you, "Hey, it's here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It hasn't been shipped out yet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "'cause it's all backed up." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Okay well, I could
somewhat understand that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> But when they just
fucking tell you nothing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're like, "Oh well no, it's in LAX." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause Meilyne was calling them up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and being very angry, good Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They told Meilyne that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, yeah, the bags have
been at LAX since June 16th." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he goes to LAX
again to try and get them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they told us that the bags
have been delivered to LAX. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was just like, "I want
to go there physically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "to pick them up." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because we got $50,000 of equipment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna risk like
waiting anymore time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I drive to LAX and of course, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> driving to LAX is a
fucking nightmare in LA </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you have to fucking fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you have to drive in LA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so it
takes us about 40 minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get to LAX. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I go to the section </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they told me to pick the bags up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I had my second experience
with LAX customer service, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was I tried to
explain that I have tickets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to pick up my bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so the woman in charge just goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, no, no, we don't have any bags </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "from Aer Lingus right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's all she says. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she goes away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She doesn't even give me, time's
like explain my situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She just fucks off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Well, what, what do I do?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's annoying.
- So I phone up Meilyne </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, "Can I get
like the exact details </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "of everything our airline said to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "so I can explain the situation." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so this lady goes off and
I can see her in eyesight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She goes off to the other side of the room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and starts picking up and
messing around with some bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I talked to one of
the security guards there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, "Can I call
that lady over please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "because I think she's in charge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "of the baggage system here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And she literally picks out
her phone and phones the lady. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can see the lady pick up
her phone and answer it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she's like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then hangs up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then she continues
messing around with the bags. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can see her in eyesight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I see her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can literally just run up to her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so after 20 minutes of
dicking around over there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno what she's doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She reluctantly comes back, looks at me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can see the disappointment
in her face be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why the fuck are you calling me again?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I'm like trying to explain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I just wanted
to get more information </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "and explain more of the situation
about what I've been told </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "and what the situation is." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I explain everything that
Meilyne has explained to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I give her the tickets and
she does a fucking eye roll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And just (sighs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She literally does that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Why am I
being made to feel guilty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "for trying to solve a
situation with my bags." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That you guys created. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it made a stressful situation
10 times more stressful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because with customer
service, I don't mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you are not fucking Japanese level, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yes King, we'll do
anything we want for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What do you need?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll explain everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at least don't make
the customer feel guilty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about bringing up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about needing a service.
- Needing a service. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - She made me feel guilty for even trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to explain the situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and trying to find out more
information after driving there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for 40 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she goes there and
she checks the details </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the fucking luggage tag and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she comes back
and she's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There is no bags here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Your bags and have not been delivered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I dunno what the airline have told you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "They've pretty much
just said something false </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "because we've had no bags
from that airline at all." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that almost broke
me, that almost broke me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because after driving
there for 40 minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not getting my bags after being delayed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after wasting five hours
of my time the day before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I now had to drive back
from LAX to our studio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> God just hated me on that day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the traffic back was way worse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than the traffic there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it took twice the amount
of time to drive back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just, ah- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You couldn't get a dog dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh man, that drove my
monk experience to its limit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was up to here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was about to fucking explode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm surprised you didn't explode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think anyone else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would've fucking exploded
long before that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I would've certainly exploded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Internally, I was screaming
'cause I don't wanna scream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna be the Karen to
the customer service manager, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they just-
- But in situations like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where I think it's almost a
necessity to be a character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, no, because I didn't
wanna bring out my frustration </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the person, but also that person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was I felt bringing out her
frustrations on me, the customer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with maybe previous customers she's had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just awful. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was an awful experience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's no silver lining in this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just an awful experience
and it's still not resolved. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So it wasn't the best first
experience touching down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in America, but yeah.
- Welcome to America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean you
didn't tip your bag handler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> at the airport? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> How dare you not give him
a 20% tip on his salary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to get your bag delivered. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can we fucking talk about that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause that's one frustration
I've had since getting here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So obviously, because we had lost our shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it still hasn't been resolved, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had to figure out ways
to get the equipment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we're calling up camera rental places, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're calling up light rental places, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then we realized,
oh, there's no mic stands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we're usually attached to a table, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's not gonna work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the current set we're in right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we're like, "All right fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "we gotta buy some mic stands." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, "All right, I'll
just get some on Amazon." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Go on to Amazon, blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think, again, this
is where we're blessed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Amazon Japan standards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is, it is very rare
to get something on Amazon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how small or large,
how cheap or expensive it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and usually 99 times out of a 100, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll get it the next day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, next delivery. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's next day delivery. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That's just normal in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I thought It would be the same here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> They do have next day delivery, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you would like to pay
500% more for shipping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I looked at it and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hold on, how does that work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So I get free shipping if it
comes on three days from now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But if I wanted tomorrow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I basically have to
tip Amazon 10, $15 more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to get it the next day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's about 10, $15 delivery </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if you want to get your
stuff the next day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which we are obviously blessed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> with Amazon UK, Amazon Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which it comes free with Prime. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You get next day delivery. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I would understand maybe
if it was kind of like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> one thing that surprised me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I thought fucking Amazon started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in California, right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Can we fact check that at least? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did Amazon start in California? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's Seattle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it Seattle?
- Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was Seattle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's American. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, okay, okay, ignore that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a just I made
it the fuck up moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Woman] Seattle. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, Seattle.
- Seattle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I would think that with LA being one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the fucking major cities in America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you get perks if
you order from say London </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK, I thought with LA, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with this being Hollywood and
needing a lot of equipment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of shipment and
everything like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought that they would have a service </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is more convenient. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, I was very surprised to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can't get the same level </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of convenience just by being in LA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you literally have to pay to win. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, it's hard. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a lot of like
socioeconomic factors involved. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean already, next day shipping, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't really need next day shipping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> How often do you need next day shipping? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All the time.
- No, never normally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I do because usually
when I have to buy something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> on Amazon, it's when I need it urgently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't have enough time
to go to the shops to get it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or perhaps, it's something
that I can't get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd like an example. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Can you gimme an example? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, say for example, like
camera equipment in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's very rare that you can go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to a big enough Yodobashi or big camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has the exact specific
thing that you need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or sometimes there are
some brands for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can't easily
access in Japanese science. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd say it's very
rare that you need 100%, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you need this next day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I bet 90% of shit you order on Amazon, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you do not need that next day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well I'm sure, yeah, but the
convenience is there, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah it's there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's good to
have that convenience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think especially in America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's just so inefficient </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything is delivered by road. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you seen the videos
of the freight trains </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that deliver stuff in California? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I have not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to fucking break and open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They get robbed all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow.
- I just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause the infrastructure just isn't there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the next day
delivery that they do do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it fucks up the the people who
have to actually deliver it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they have to do these insane routes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to try and deliver this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're pissing bottles and shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So a part of me is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah, I'd love next day delivery." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I feel like in America it's not- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Feasible?
- It's sort of feasible, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and if you are doing it
something bad is happening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to someone who is delivering. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I guess this is
definitely me being privileged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's definitely us being privileged. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's definitely a privileged problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I sort of talk about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it's a complicated thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a bigger underlying
issue to where, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan, for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> people don't give a fuck
about being worked like crazy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for nine hours and being
superficial, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the UK, you get next
day delivery as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - You do, but in London, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it seems like it would make way more sense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to have that work in London. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But in Wales, you don't have that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh you, don't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not really, I lived right next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to the Amazon warehouse in Swansea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was never next day delivery, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I lived next to the
warehouse for the whole area. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno, London, it makes more sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's possible, there's a
lot more couriers available. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there maybe a sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of urgency towards fulfilling
customer requests maybe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I assume in Wales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not a lot of people are
ordering from Amazon, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, there's a lot.
- Surely in Cardiff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> surely in Cardiff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe in Cardiff there are a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think all the Cardiff
orders are being fulfilled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> by the Swansea because
it's about an hour drive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I guess that's what I thought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> where I would understand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you lived in the fucking boonies </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the middle of nowhere, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, you're not gonna
get next day delivery, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if you live in an amazing city- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] This is LA.
- Yeah, this is LA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean you can get it,
but it's only certain items </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's gotta be fulfilled by Amazon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which means it's in
their warehouse already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and they get one of their
couriers to come and get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And that makes more sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't know, the whole
fucking system here is weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And even in Europe, it's
not as good as Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan works, but Japan's had
an amazing shipping network </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like forever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They've just sort of figured it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're so on top of everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what they care about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And not a single tip was necessary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause people here they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Bro, we've got so many issues like guns." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then Japan's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "If that fucking package
doesn't fucking turn up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "when I tell it to, I'm
not voting for you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Legit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what they give a fuck about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We've only been here a few days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and within that few days, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> we can feel an entirely
complaining about America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is just the complaining
about America episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because it's just this
endless fucking stream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because America is an endless
loop of dichotomy is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Okay, oh, this big
company does bad thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "but the reason why it's doing bad thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "is 'cause people don't
wanna do anything else." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just this fucking cycle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I get it to a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why I've experienced
such bad customer service </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they have no fucking incentive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to give a shit about their job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I get it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially dealing with
people with the airport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you deal with the most stressed
out people in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> At a level, I get it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's kind of sad in a way, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I see a lot of people
in customer service positions </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it feels like the only
people that you see actually care </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about giving a good service
is when there is an option </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to tip in that occupation. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's true, it is true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, that's just what I've seen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There are plenty of customer
service positions in America, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but only the ones that
tip with my own experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is the ones where you really feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they care about the customer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Society, right?
- We live in a society. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Society.
- I'd love to say that, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> dude, I would do different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would totally care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I'd care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I'd be like,
"I don't fucking care." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Why would I? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's on my bag. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, especially if you're
surrounded by that environment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, you look like the weirdo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're the one that's caring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sure at LAX, that woman has probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> had the most horrible
people shouting at her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and fucking just screaming
and then no repercussions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Well yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And can fucking walks
off, goes home and is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, I did nothing wrong." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I totally get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sucks though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But it does suck 'cause you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why are you taking it out on me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was nice to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it sucks for me 'cause
I happened to be the person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that all that fucking
frustration got taken out on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just felt fucking horrible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is not to be given the time of day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or just to be made to feel
guilty for just trying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to resolve one issue on my end. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Even in the UK, that's pretty rare. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like there's just
a level of disappointment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and resentment that everyone has. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't really go below that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone kind of was
just kinda like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I feel like in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you can really just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Look, I'm going through a
fucking bad day right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a certain tone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in this kind of situations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I feel like it's
much rarer in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from what I've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to see people really
have a fucking outburst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, that they will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, I've seen plenty, I've seen plenty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It will definitely happen, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's less than what I've
seen here in America at least. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I just needed to vent a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I literally
lost about in counting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about eight hours of my time to this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like when it's LAX, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's triple a mental time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You gave eight, but you lost 25. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Time moves slow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I lost a year of my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with this experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'd be miserable
if I worked at LAX. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking worst airport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm miserable going through LAX, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let alone working at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Bro, at least we're not in New York." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "You are not fucking any better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "What are you on about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "You all suck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "This is all broken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "None of this works!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so actually 'cause
we've been to LA before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think this is the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've had extended stay in LA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the longest time
I've spent in LA in one go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is maybe five days at most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and that's
always been in downtown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And every time I talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to a local they're
like, "Downtown really?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the awful fucking sector. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty sketch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's the sketch sector. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll get stabbed or shot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you walk down the streets there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is something we've
definitely come close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to experiencing in
downtown LA around "AX". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the reason we normally come to LA </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is because of "AX", and
"AX" is in downtown LA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So this is actually our first experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mostly outside of downtown, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also getting a chance
to experience others. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually explore Los Angeles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so you guys were
here a few days before me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How was your guys' experience so far? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, it was good until I got COVID. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I mean, it was good for
the first three or four days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was staying in Pasadena, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> which is a relatively nicer part of LA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at least everyone in LA
says it's a nice part of LA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was nice to be fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you have places like Glendale, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is where all the
YouTubers live and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I definitely saw a more relaxed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt safer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Pasadena and Glendale
a million times more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than in downtown LA, which is not hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause downtown LA is
just "GTA" in real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt a little safer and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, I can actually
kind of walk the streets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "of Pasadena during the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and it feels just like a regular town." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like kind of nice and
there's like lots of places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to eat and it's really chill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just looked like "Drake
and Josh" when I was there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I felt like I was on an
episode of "Drake and Josh". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why.
- A little bit, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I walked past an elementary school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that looked like it was ripped
straight from "The Simpsons". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Oh!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was that point where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, you know what,
LA might not be as bad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> there was just those like
just small little instances </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that just made me be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Mm, yeah, maybe not, maybe not." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Say, the fucking LAX situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the Amazon situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's very nitpicking, I know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think it just goes to show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how much we've been blessed in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's nitpicking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you choose a place
to live for example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> visiting and living </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is two totally different experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a lot of little things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that will build up over time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One thing I've really,
really missed is walking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've missed walking a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm sure there are some places in LA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I'm sure you can walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like a lot
of America as a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just not built for walking at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember I was
meeting up with a friend of mine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and she lives like kind of in the middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between Pasadena and Glendale. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So from my hotel, it was
a 20 minute walk at most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so we were hanging out in Pasadena, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had lunch and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, let's just go back to your place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "and we'll just hang out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I looked on the map
and it was 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, "Yeah, we can walk that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's a nice day, fucking
it's the middle of the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's what, 2:00 PM in the afternoon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I kinda wanna have a walk." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She looked at me like
I was a fucking weirdo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She was like, "What are you, homeless? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Walking, what the fuck?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And she's like, "We're gonna walk it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't fucking look at me like that! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yes, I would like to use my legs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "'cause I haven't done that
in a while since I got here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she was just like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she kind of reluctantly followed me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got five minutes into this walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I turned a corner and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't wanna go down that street." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, I can see what
you were talking about." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yes, it's a 20 minute walk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's also 20 minutes
of my life potentially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in a lot of danger at the same time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's 30 minutes when you
gotta do the Navy Seals checks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and all of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, when you gotta
dodge all the homeless people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel weird catching
an Uber to some place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's five minutes away,
but you have to living here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think that's one
thing that made me realize, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> perhaps LA is fun to visit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but definitely I wouldn't wanna live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here personally speaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, when there's
four lanes of cars crossing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it just feels like a fucking dice roll. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And a lot of them don't have lights. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm like, "Wait, so when do I go?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just like, no,
no, you play chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You cross the first two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you kinda wait in the middle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally the moment
you step out of the car, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you are playing with your life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just playing "Frogger". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, it gets pretty fucking scary, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> especially when you're in
downtown LA or any sketch places, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> which there are a number of in LA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno, I'm white. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you get free pass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I still remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was saying this to Connor the other day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that fucking Airbnb you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Sydney booked the
last time we were in "AX". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you were having like a house party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you sent me the
address on Google maps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, sick, it's literally
just around the corner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "from our hotel." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was just like, "Let's
just fucking walk it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a three minute walk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember we were
mostly on the main road, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> cars whizzing by, a couple of people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on the streets or whatever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like, all
right cool, that's fine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the moment we got to your street, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just this dark alleyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "This can't be right." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then from all the
way across the alleyway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could just hear you going, "Over here!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You are not making me walk
down this fucking alleyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Are you kidding me?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are two other people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in this alleyway looking sketch as fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just standing around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm literally about to
put my life on the line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "to go and hang out with Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, fuck it, let's do it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember that Airbnb 'cause inside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it looked fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, inside was great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, inside was fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had a pool table and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a nice open space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was in the most sketch
area you could ever imagine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I felt bad whenever I
was inviting people around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to that Airbnb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I remember at least you walked down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that dark alleyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause our house was right at
the end of this dark alleyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was an alleyway with a dead end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So if you would like
to rank the top places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to get mugged in LA, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure that was
top 10 places to get mugged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and stabbed in LA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Definitely, definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember I invited
Super Eyepatch Wolf John </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the apartment as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember he gets to the same point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all I see is a dark silhouette </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he's saying that he's standing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the end of this alleyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see this dark silhouette. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's John, he's by himself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I go out, I see him like,
"John, over here, over here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm sure to him, he just goes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh, hello, hello, hello." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I remember, he sees my silhouette. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember he starts walking
the opposite direction, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately starts power
walking the opposite direction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Who's this fucking weirdo calling to me?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so I have to fucking
sprint to run up to him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And be like, "John, John it's
me, it's me, don't worry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then he starts running more faster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "Get away from me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> That was scary.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I remember a long time ago, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Connor, you were saying you
wanted to live in America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think it'd be fun for a while. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Has that opinion changed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, dude, I'd get so
much content living here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, okay, when you
say living in America, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you mean living in LA? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I just feel like even you
just talk to an Uber driver, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like, "Great, I just
got content for a week." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just talking about this guy,
crazy shit he said to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno, it's a crazy
place, but I dunno know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> at some point, I'd like
to experience it more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I feel like even
two weeks isn't enough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I want experience that
awful process of signing up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> for a water bill or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, I love that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you not already
experienced it enough in Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, but yeah, I love going
through that mundane stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Something about, I dunno, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you really feel like you're in it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's something about that
experience I really enjoy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm good bro.
- During I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "This is awful", but after
that fact I'm like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd love to be like yeah, LAX dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what a fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Just sitting down like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fuck, I don't wanna go to LAX." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one wants to go to LAX. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, being here for a few days, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've already got a fucking
weeks' worth of content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, honestly, honestly, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean you got married </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we didn't even speak about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We were too busy fucking
ranting about America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, I guess this
is the first podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since I got married, so yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Congrats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I'm a married man now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell yeah.
- Look at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, silver.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, silver. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Classy, very nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I guess now, I can ask. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember before the
marriage, you were just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh yeah, is it gonna be the
"JuJutsu Kaisen" of marriages?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it gonna be myth? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Is it gonna be myth? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> How was your guys' experiences with it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was okay.
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Joey could never say anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> He can't say anything good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could have been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in my hotel room watching
"JuJutsu Kaisen", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I had to come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, no, it was fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean yeah, 'cause I mean,
this is what, my second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or third wedding I've been to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this your first mate's
wedding you guys have been to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is my second mate's wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is my first friend's wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it was very different
to my first mate's wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, because it was the Indian wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it was the Japanese wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was the very traditional
fucking invite your boss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and your colleagues
level Japanese wedding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So actually, I'd say
this was the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was a proper
mate's wedding type thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got really fucking close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to crying watching you cry though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause in my head, I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, this is a really fucking momentous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "occasion for Garnt." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously every wedding, very emotional, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really important day for a lot of people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, I cried at my cousin's waiting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously watching
a family member cry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is gonna make you cry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I didn't cry at my mate's wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Nothing against my mate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're not good enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't deserve it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're a mate, but you're not my boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was fully expecting that
I was gonna cry at some point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in your wedding, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I didn't know what was
going to be the trigger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And the trigger came very
quickly when you started crying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's something
about watching Garnt cry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is really fucking sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like seeing your
dad cry for the first time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This shit just doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It doesn't happen.
- [Connor] What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It never fucking happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So when you see it in
real life, it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, shit, this is gonna make me cry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I could tell that
I wasn't the only one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because literally fucking
70% of that room was crying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at that moment as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was like a sniffing
convention for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a sniffing convention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - People told me man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I almost cried a second time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it was that clip
where we honked it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the dance floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's so many
fucking wholesome moments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from that wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fucking glad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fucking glad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm happy, I'm happy because I'm glad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that everyone, it was just a
happiness fucking gathering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone was just like good vibes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone was just happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was good vibes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was before everyone
got fucking hammered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and fucking drunk like holy fucking shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, some people got blasted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Meilyne, Meilyne, Meilyne! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had an open bar and I remember- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Best and worst decision ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Best and worst decision of my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember going up
to the bar to open the bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have to put a tab down on the bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember asking how
much is a reasonable number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to put the tab down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the guy says, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We've been doing weddings for years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We recommend this number." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Great, and so I was like,
"Great, just in case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm gonna put double of the amount </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "so that I don't have to get charged, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "so you don't have to call
me if it breaks that limit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like, "Great." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so how it works is that
however much you don't spend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll refund you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So about a few days after the wedding, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I give them an email to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh great, can I get the refund please? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "How much was not used on the tab?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I waited a few days
'cause it was bank holiday </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something, and then
I get an email back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Processing all these
fucking transactions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and I get an email
back and they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh great, we can refund you
a grand total of one pound 40. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Legit, one pound 40?
- One pound 40. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Damn.
- And I'm like, "damn." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not even mad anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just impressed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You meticulously calculated that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it was double the recommended amount </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you guys fucking destroyed that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm not surprised
because I've never seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many fucking shots
being taken in one night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I took around seven shots
of tequila that night. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> My God, Meilyne was a
fucking tequila fiend. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> My God, if you went into a
five meter radius of Meilyne, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you were getting dragged
to do a shot of tequila. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember this one time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember seeing Meilyne ask Joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you wanted the shot and you were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No Meilyne, I hate shots." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she fucking gave
you a fucking death grip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and just dragged you to the
bar and made you do a shot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - She literally grabbed me by my sleeve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and was just like, "No, is not an answer." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I did that first shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So the first shot was like,
all right, you know what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a wedding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's seven other people
doing the shot with me, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate tequila so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'll do it just because I don't wanna- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] You're vibing, it's good vibes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna be part of the vibe so I did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the second time around
was when Meilyne was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "No is not an answer." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And dragged me to the bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, with all the familiar faces like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, the first time for you all? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, yeah." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I did the second shot, hated it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then a couple of hours
passed by and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, Meilyne hasn't called me back yet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I just when I
thought I was in the clear, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meilyne from a distance
fucking scuttles towards me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she was just like,
"Tequila shot, Joey?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just had to go, "Fuck off." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally flipped a
finger and was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, get away from me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just walked off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And Meilyne, she was just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Fucking ran. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I literally ran from her </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I knew if I wasn't stern about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> she would grab me by the sleeve again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I heard from a
bunch of other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who were way too nice to
Meilyne that they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, she made me do six shots." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "That's 'cause you have
to say the hard no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "It's not just the soft
no, it's the hard no." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Pressure, pressure. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did she make you do any shots? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't really mind though, one is fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You only got to do one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Meilyne only made me do one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why did she make me do three? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess 'cause you were just too close </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> to her vicinity wise. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I was really worried
'cause you we had food </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like, "This isn't enough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Three courses gone, really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Come on, I'm a six
course kind of guy minimum </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> "or at least gimme someone
else's course who didn't finish." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then lo and behold, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> people just start bringing out pizza. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was all you can eat pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was all we can eat
like stone bake pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think I had
like four whole pizzas. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a worrying amount of pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was more pizza than any
doctor would ever recommend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if you were carb
loading for a desert survival </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for 10 weeks, you wouldn't
eat this many calories. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno, every time they
brought it to me, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "Well, I can't say no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I mean, it's a different topping. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "I gotta try it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was me with the espresso martinis. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I had five
espresso martinis that day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "Oh that's why I'm shaking." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so we had a station </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to give out free espresso
martinis to everyone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow.
- [Joey] Wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we wanted everyone
to have a good time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No wonder that tab was high. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that wasn't even on the tab. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a pre-package that we paid for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I went up to the bar after
my first espresso martini </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they brought out for everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Oh, can I
get another espresso martini?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And the dude literally
just points to the side </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's literally
this three layered shelf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of espresso martinis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was 12 espresso martinis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Take your pick." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Oh
shit, all right, cool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just drank three of them and
I was just fucking shaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I guess to go to the
start of my experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause obviously you
guys' experience was very, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very different from mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was only 62
people at this wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was a fairly small wedding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I really, really liked
the size of the wedding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was a good amount of size. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could keep up with pretty much everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could interact with everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could talk with everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and not feel like it was just
like a convention experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where I was having one sentence
conversations with people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but have proper, meaningful conversations, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is good 'cause I just
wanted to share the good vibes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember like the
night before the wedding, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was so fucking, I
dunno what the right word </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to describe it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a mixture of nervous and excited </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was not the bad kind of nervous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The way I described it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it kind of felt like you were 10 years old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was the day before Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you knew, you knew you were getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that N64 for Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You knew, that this was
the special Christmas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you were getting
the fucking game console. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I got two hours of
sleep before my wedding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before the day of my wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I tried to go to
sleep at a reasonable time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was gonna go to sleep at around 11. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Great, I'm
gonna have a reasonable amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "of sleep before my wedding
and can be well rested." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like an hour passes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two hour passes and I'm
like, "I cannot get to sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, okay, if I go to sleep now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'll get six hours of sleep now, now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> An hour passes, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Five hours of sleep, now, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how it always works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "If I just go to sleep now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'll wake up and I'm gonna have a wife. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's gonna be great." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it gets to about
four or five in the morning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm in pure copium right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What if I just have no
sleep before my wedding? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can function. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "If I just stay up or not, I can function, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "that's something I can do before one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "of the most important days of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can do that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But before I like truly
justify it to myself, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, let's just try something new." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I take off all of my sheets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and take off all my blankets
and I put them on the floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Let's try
sleeping on the floor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "on the hard floor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if there's
just these like Asian genes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something where it just
felt like I was home again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just immediately conked out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh my God.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I dunno, I was sleeping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Were you reminded of your monk days, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sleeping on the temple floor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even know, pretty likely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It felt like I was sleeping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on a fucking futon or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno what it was about
sleeping on the floor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I just immediately
conked out after sleeping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on a nice comfy bed or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then yeah, we go to the wedding venue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And of course, I was tense nervous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like the feeling
of before you get in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you start a panel where you
go on stage or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like you know
this big thing is coming up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but you just gotta wait
around for it to start. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] That's the worst. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I was so fucking jittery. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause I talked to Sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if she was nervous for the wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she was like her nerves
ended the moment she woke up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because she was so busy
before the wedding started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because she had to go do her makeup, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go do her hair and all
the bridesmaids as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So she was at the venue from 9:00 AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't need to
get there till 12 noon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You had the easy job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and so that was just a lot of time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for just me to be alone
with my own thoughts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be really, really fucking nervous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And so yeah, I was really
tense, nervous, whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but luckily, I had my boys with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had my boys.
- The lads were there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The lads were there, my
hype men were there with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember going to the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So to fully explain neither
of these two were my best men. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's okay.
- Heartbreak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sorry guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Only Connor was a groomsman, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but part of the reason
was it, made me realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how long it's been since
I've planned this wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because me and Sydney had
planned the wedding basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before we had moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And every role </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the entire wedding party
was chosen and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Before "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The wedding was going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to originally be before
"Trash taste" even started. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's fucking insane that
I've grown so much closer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to these two in these past two years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where when my wedding
was planned, I knew Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but we'd hung out only a few times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And we'd hung out a lot, but
I was not as close to you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as I am now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was so weird to have a wedding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that was planned two years ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where now the dynamic is
totally fucking different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was just sitting in
the crowding, like, "Yeah!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I remember, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we call everyone in to
the main ceremony hall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So everyone starts getting
their seats and I go out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by myself and I'm like,
"Garnt, you got this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "you got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Garnt, you're gonna do
a no tear wedding run. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "There's going to be zero
crying at this wedding." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And I go out to myself just
to give myself a breather. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Me and Sydney had personal vows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I bring out my personal
vows and I'm rehearsing them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "Okay Garnt, you got this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Zero tears, we're not
gonna cry at this wedding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "You got this, you got this." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I read the first sentence </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I start fucking like
my jaw just starts going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Oh no, oh
no, this is a bad sign. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is a bad sign." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so while I'm doing
this all of my lads, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all my groomsmen come out and they see me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Guys, I'm gonna
need some hype around me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm gonna need some
fucking hype around me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so this was a moment
where I took a page out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of Connor's book. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally go full monkey mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right outside the ceremony room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It works, dude.
- It works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "You fucking got this! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "You fucking got this!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not realizing that everyone inside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could you hear me just
fucking shouting by the door? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I heard you shouting at something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I wasn't too sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "That's Garnt, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - People who fear the shouting type </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> are people who haven't tried it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you try it, it actually works. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> If you fully commit to it, it works. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, that time,
it really fucking worked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I had so much adrenaline in my body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I needed some way to release it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I remember getting to
the ceremony room and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "The shouting helped." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm reset and the shouting's helped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go to the front, I turn around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look at my mom's face
and just immediately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm a broken man again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> My cousin told me this after the ceremony, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but he's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "If there's one thing you
definitely should not do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "when you're standing up there, waiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "is look at your mom." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's look at your parents. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true, I can understand that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, it's a feeling I can't describe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> My dad and my mom were fucking tearing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I rarely see them tear up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno, what did my face look like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was waiting up there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can do a reenactment of
exactly what you were like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You were like (exhales). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what you looked like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're close, yeah ,
that's pretty accurate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every now and then,
you'd turn and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, (exhales)." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what you looked like right before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause there was a lovely,
what you call it, quartet? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, quartet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was lovely, killing
it, playing this music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And every time they
were about to you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause the song ends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're not doing a medley. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The song finishes and then
they start the new one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone's talking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the moment they finish the song, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, everyone stops.
- It's starting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they start playing the next song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're all waiting for Sydney to show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And even I'm standing up here
next to Garnt, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What's my fucking role? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What do I do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "I just wanna not fuck up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "It's his day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't wanna do like a bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm not here to do a bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What do I do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't know." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then seeing you again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it was seeing you nervous
that made everyone else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the room nervous, being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh shit, this is actually
finally happening and all that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the quartet
stops for the final time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone was like,
"Okay, its starting." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then Sydney walks down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you immediately
start breaking down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I expected that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I fully expected. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just like, "Oh,
here come the floodgates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Here it comes." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then what stopped me was
the song you guys played. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, "Oh
my God, here it comes." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that "Gus' theme"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Jen was sitting next to me and
Luna was sitting next to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and we all looked at
each other and were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "That's "Gus' theme", right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What made you choose that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, Sydney walked down
the aisle to "Gus' theme". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Which is amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, which I knew it was coming </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I remember, it
was literally the day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that Mira passed away. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I remember, we were at
a Netflix shoot at the day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so I didn't have proper
time to process that news. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I remember that day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I went back home and I put on "Gus' theme" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just zoning out "Gus' theme", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking crying to the news
that had just got announced. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Sydney was also listening to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just listening to it, seeing
me listen to it for hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's just like, "I
fucking love this song." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> To me, "Gus' theme" is by far
one of the greatest tracks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in anime to ever be made. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's such a beautiful track </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's unfortunate that it's
been memed a lot nowadays. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So that's how people
perceive "Gus' theme", </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> but I remembered listening
to that on that day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just such a
beautiful fucking track. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, it's gorgeous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I fucking cried to it so many times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I remember Sydney
goes to me jokingly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> she turns me and she was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Wouldn't it be funny if we
walked down the aisle to this?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was just like, (chuckles)
"Yeah, that'd be funny." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then we both turned to each other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and we looked at each other in the eyes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were just like, "But what if?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - What are you gonna do, using
the fucking default music? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> That's boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then we're like,
"Would it be cheesy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "Would it be cheesy?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And so we let it sink for
a while and we let it sit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> for a few days. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We let it sit for a few weeks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then the longer we sat in it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the more it felt like it
was just the right idea </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I fucking knew that
I was gonna cry listening </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to "Gus' theme" seeing
Sydney down the aisle. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm sure if people knew we
were gonna play "Gus' theme", </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> that would've taken
the fuck, "Gus' theme"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I wish I knew beforehand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because I feel like for me,
it was the initial really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It was that moment where I was just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow, they're actually using "Gus' theme"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a split second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was about to start laughing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but then again, seeing you,
and then seeing Sydney, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, "This
is the right choice." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember Sydney was telling me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that before Sydney comes out,
all the bridesmaids walk out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you are familiar with "Gus' theme", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the intro bit.
- Then there's the voice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's the voice of guy going. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ♪ Ah ah ♪ </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see all the bridesmaids
walk out and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Where's Sydney, where's Sydney?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And as soon as the fucking ah comes out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she just appears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And apparently behind the scenes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney's with her dad waiting to walk out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and her dad's like, "Come
on then, it's time to go." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's like, "No, I need
to wait for that moment." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The right moment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I need to wait for that
voice before I appear. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was so incredibly well timed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was incredibly timed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it was just fucking
God smiling down on us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but no, Sydney was like, "No,
I'm waiting for this moment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "I am waiting for this moment." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You only get one shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Why not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it fucking worked, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's why I just
immediately started balling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I hear that voice just pop off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I see Sydney emerge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "This is-" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a double whammy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a fucking beautiful sight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I cannot even begin to describe
what I felt at that moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was literally
like a scene out of anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It had the final episode vibes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Final episode vibes, all happy endings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That moment that fucking voice hit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she emerges and I'm fuck man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm fucking getting teary
eyed just thinking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, she walks down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we say our vows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and we fucking stumble
through our fucking vows, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys did pretty good.
- Did we? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You guys were tearing up obviously, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I think, yeah, you
guys said your vows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wouldn't say stumble. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd say you took pauses, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but who doesn't take a dramatic pause? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you took your time with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not one of our fucking sponsors, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which is (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you wanna talk
about the actual stumble, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which was the greatest
moment of this wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So obviously, everyone's sniffing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Everyone's crying after
we've just finished </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> our vows together.
- Very emotional. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's a very emotional,
which is good vibes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Everyone's just happy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so the registrar comes over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and she starts to say the official vows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that we need to repeat after her </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in order to officialize our marriage. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> She said my name a few times before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So she knows how to
pronounce my name correctly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it gets to like the
final vows where she goes- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The most important one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And she goes, do you Grant, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And everyone in the room
was like, "Yeah, she did it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - All of the nervousness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the emotions just fucking evaporated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The entire room explodes and
fucking starts applauding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You would've thought it
was a FIFA match happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just like, "Yeah!" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was so fucking perfect that everyone- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Everyone thought it was scripted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone thought it was scripted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And everyone was like, "You
made her say that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "It was a bet, it was a bet." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, "No." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That just makes it even better. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah and I can't remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what I said after that happened, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I was like, "Yeah, got him." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Got it, she did the thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - She did the thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, "Damn, are
you a "Trash Taste viewer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> "Cause you just gave us a
year's worth of content, man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - She's like, "This
marriage hits different." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We don't say that anymore, do we? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We don't hear that.
- We don't say that anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't hear that.
- We gotta bring that back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just realized whoever said that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a wedding with attitude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, that
was a brilliant moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That was the icing on the cake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Anyone would be pissed off if
their name got mispronounced </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> at their wedding, but I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "This just made the wedding
10 times more memorable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "and that moment 10 times more special." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I guess yeah, as you were saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the nerves just immediately disappeared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from you, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the rest of the
night was just good times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I did almost fuck
up, so close to fucking up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at one of the most important
moments of my life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we finished our vows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, officially were husband and wife. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I go sit down to
sign my marriage papers. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And my marriage was a week after MCM </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so the previous week, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I had just been signing
hundreds and hundreds of prints </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and everything like that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I was signing them as Guggukaz. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And my Guggukaz signature
is very, very similar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> to my real signature, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but except it spells out my real name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so what happens? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I sit down to sign my
marriage certificate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I put down the G and
then I put down the, I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Giarnt Giarnt, maybe.
- Giarnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's Italian Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Hello, I am Giarnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it's a small line. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And luckily, I stopped
myself before I go too far, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but I get a fifth of the
way to signing Guggukaz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on my marriage certificate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That would've been amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could make the A from the I, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Making it a vertical A. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can recover from that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but
luckily I was able to recover </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from that before I put down the extra G. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like Sydney (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if Sydney was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "I nearly made a big mistake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "I nearly married the wrong person." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I married Guggukaz. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney's almost married
to fucking Guggukaz </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> instead of Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I might as well just put
down the fucking animes on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just got a flashback. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember when the fucking spiel of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "If anybody has anything to say." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sydney was like, "Don't you
fucking dare.", to everyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I liked that part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause we were planning beforehand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in the boys' locker room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or not the locker room,
but the changing room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Boys' locker room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The groomsmen and all
the dudes were hanging out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were conspired to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What if we just like,
when the pastor says, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "'If anyone objects to this wedding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "'please say your piece
right now, whatever.'" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were all planning, all
the boys to just stand up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like, "We object." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And then we just skip out
of the room with the boys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That would've been funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then Sydney was just
like, "Don't you fucking dare!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> She verbally said that
and everyone laughed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a great time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then yeah, it just
felt like after that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was just on such a high. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It felt like everyone was drunk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Drunk on happiness.
- Drunk with good vibes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then alcohol.
- And then alcohol. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So double drunk.
- On top of that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, there was a lot of magical things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that happened at the wedding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember, we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some fucking excellent
photographers and videographers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were great, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I remember we went outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We started taking photos and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the group photos, family photos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And then we finally have
a moment to ourselves </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and Joey turns to me and he goes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Wouldn't be funny if we did the end </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "of "Ava" congratulations
scene right now?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I looked at Joey and I look around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I realized, this is
a once in a lifetime. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You have the power.
- You have the power. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is literally a once
in a lifetime opportunity. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Joey, that's
a great fucking idea." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've seen it, we can do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I literally gather the boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like, "Lads, assemble." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was really funny because before that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while we were taking photos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had separate photos,
the guys and the girls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And, oh my God, the guys had
so much fucking testosterone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when we took our photos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't wait to see them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I remember there was
this really funny moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was like a
school playground again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where all of the girls were
on one side of the venue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all of the guys were on
the other side of the venue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was like a school trip or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So luckily all of the guys
are gathered in one spot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I gather the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gather the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "Boys, come here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You were like, "Lads, lads, lads, lads." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have an important mission, lads. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And at this point, people were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Garnt, why are you calling us? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We've just taken the photos." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Has everyone seen "Evangelion"?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And immediately as soon as
I say that, everyone's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "King, we know what to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Say no more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Say no more, King. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "We know exactly what to do," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the beauty of having
a bunch of weebs as friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everyone's just on the same page. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't even need to say what we did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And so we filmed the
congratulations scene, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's fucking amazing.
- Which came out amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, it came out amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially the edit you
did as well on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (people cheering)
(mid tempo music) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Guests] Congratulations (clapping)! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Thank you all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, so I guess going
off of that same vein, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we tried to have a traditional wedding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We tried. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We tried to have a traditional wedding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But also, we're a bunch of weebs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so even though it was fucking painful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have this wedding be
delayed for two years, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it actually, I think came out
to be a blessing in disguise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it really, really
gave me and Sydney the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to really add a lot of little
things that were just us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like that's the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that people hopefully really remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they think back to our wedding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we wanted to have
some anime references </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at our wedding, of course we did, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but we didn't want a full
on fucking cosplay wedding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't want a full on weeb wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean I couldn't
be Sebastian Michaelis? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - And so we gave everyone
a postcard with a drawing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of either it was me and
Sydney in a wedding dress </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> in the end "Eva" end screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or, it was the famous "Oreimo" one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I can't remember
which one you guys got. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got the "Eva" one.
- Oh, you got the "Eva" one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't remember.
- You don't remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Eva", "Eva".
- You guys got a lucky one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why is that lucky? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know 'cause I had a
bunch of people coming to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, "You gave me
the fucking "Oreimo" one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - D got the "Oreimo" one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> He was so pissed off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But we tried to write a
nice little personal message </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to everyone who attended our wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's little touch like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that I don't think we
would've been able to do one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we didn't have enough time and two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there was too many people there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yours was nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Sydney just insulted me.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, "What the fuck, Sydney? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - She was pretty much
the same with everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What did I do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I turned up didn't I? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But another thing is we wanted to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to integrate the places we'd been to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the cultures we lived
in as much as possible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we had a custom made masu box made, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which if you don't know what that is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's one of those sake boxes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had a custom crest that we made, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was a combination
of both of our families. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we gave everyone masu boxes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which you normally drink sake out of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I was excited. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was telling everyone
at the table being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, so there's this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "called (speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "that you use these masu boxes
for where you pour it so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "that it overflows into the box." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone was like, "Oh cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then if you know me and Sydney, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know that we are not sake drinkers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I dunno why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there is a drink within our group, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which we are really famous for drinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because every time we go to like a party, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> someone brings crates
and crates of this stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I announce in my speech </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we're not gonna be
toasting with champagne, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we're gonna be toasting with Soju. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'd heard from several people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that Joey's face was just
like, "How dare you?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never experienced
racism at a wedding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I felt like my culture
was extremely appropriated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Really?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> For fuck's sake, I don't even like Soju. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did it for you, Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The culture appropriation, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had several people being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Bro, Joey is pissed." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You said that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, pissed is a strong word. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I know, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "Yeah, fuck it, whatever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was too much on a happy
high to give a shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was the next day
where I thought about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Those fuckers."
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> How dare you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna take this masu box
home just because, goddam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sake just tastes like ducking
foot vodka, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You guys just haven't had the good shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did the 100 tasting sake thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All of them happen to taste like shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nah, you don't have the palette for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - A palette of what, like
a fucking wood chipper? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not Japanese enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think so.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's fire shit, sake, oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to not like sake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I used to think it was like paint thinner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe when I get older
and I get more (indistinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm much older than you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe I just have two years to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, two years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ask me in two years will I like sake? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll find out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe I've lived in
Japan for long enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the next thing I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was actually the cake cutting, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno what you guys remember,
but I'm trying to think back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to all the big fucking things </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I remember about the wedding. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so obviously it's
traditional for a wedding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you have a cake cutting
with the bride and groom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and everyone gathers
around and take pictures </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember Sydney cuts the cake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then on her second slice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she completely fucks up
and just goes diagonal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's footage of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I fucking burst laughing saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Sydney, what the fuck is that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then she full on just
grabs the slice with her hand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shoves it in my face and I'm eating it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she has a bite for herself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Guests] Two, one, woo!
(upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And obviously, everyone's laughing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's applauding and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I turn over to Meilyne </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I see Meilyne's mouth moving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And she says, "Oh, blah, blah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "What?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think she must be saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, your size is so cute or
something, congratulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go closer to be like,
"Meilyne, what'd you say?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And she goes, "Lick it, lick her." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What the fuck?
- You fucking freak. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm like, "I'll do it for you Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll do it for you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That beats Meilyne's weird, it's weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, did you just
do a Bucciarati on her? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Basically, I licked the rest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> of the cake off of Sydney's face. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - You got to go half cake, half makeup. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> You just got a mouth full of makeup. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - She was caked with makeup. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - She was caked physically.
- Yeah, in multiple ways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, I've heard some funny
stories about other people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other things that have
happened around the wedding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I wasn't involved in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously everyone was drunk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think one of the people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who got drunk the fastest
actually was Karen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you guys see Karen at all Demon dice? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was the one that noticed
that she was slouched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on the couch, just forward
slouched like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I walked up to her
'cause no one was there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Karen, are you okay?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then she just turns to me, she's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I fucked up, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> "I fucked up, man." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "What happened, what happened? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Did you get in a fight or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What happened?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "No, I had four double shots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "of whiskey before the food." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Why did you do that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laugh)
- Good vibes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 'cause I guess she was just having </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> a really good time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I sobered up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> My bedroom was on the
third floor, no elevator. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I fucking sobered the fuck up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Every time I had to go and
get something from my room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I came back down fully sober. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck, walking those stairs, fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> To get my luggage up,
fucking my entire life up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I was kind of comforting her, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting her water and shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then Sydney and a bunch of
other girls came to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You can just go crash in
Sydney's room, whatever." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The other one that was hilarious was Jan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because he wasn't fucking there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was literally talking to him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was me and Maki and Jan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were just chatting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was 30 minutes before the dinner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Jan was like,
"Dude, I'm gonna get a nap." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Jan, dinner's
in literally 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We're about to go in and sit down." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he is like, "Oh no, no, don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'll be back, I'll be
back, bro, don't worry." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And we never saw him again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man went for cigarettes
and never came back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like the dad going
for milk and cigarettes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was just like, "Yeah, I'll be back." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, and it was like
10:00 PM when I noticed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I came out of my drunken
stupor and I was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "Has anyone seen Jan?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I called him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Where the fuck are you?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause right when he was about
to leave you, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Where you going?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he said, "Oh, I'm gonna go sleep." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Dude, dinner right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Come, it's right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was just like, "No,
no, no, no, I'll be back." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "You're not
gonna fucking be back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I know you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You're not gonna be back." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "At least eat
the dinner and then go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "They paid for the food, eat
the food and then leave." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and that was
literally the last time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw him until now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I texted him I think on
the day I was about to fly out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> to LA because I just remembered. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "That was
literally the last time I saw </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "and talked to Jan." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I texted him being
like, "Are you alive?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That is one question I've asked Jan more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than any other person I know in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause he just disappears. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just disappears and you
just don't know where he is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, "Are you alive?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every has that one friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he was like, "Yeah, bro." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You were telling me
about how you saw Jan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the most Jan place
before the wedding started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it was before the wedding started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was Connor, myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I forgot who else, someone else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, it was Mudan I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were just like, let's just go get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because dinner wasn't until 4:00 PM, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and we had gathered at midday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well fuck, I'm gonna be starving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "throughout this reception." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So were just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "There's a cafe around the corner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Let's just go there." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was walking there, and
we walked past this alleyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I literally did a double take. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because Jen is standing
there full suit, sunglasses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a cigarette in his hand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just talking to a homeless dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was the most scruffy homeless dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's wearing this red
bathroom with this cigarette </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in his hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno if he was homeless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> He just dressed like fucking
what's Daniel Ratcliff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the "Guns Akimbo",
but without the guns. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> He was literally dressed like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You mean the one where he's like this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally that outfit, one
for one just without the guns. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, just like no shoes,
bathrobe just with nappy hair, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> with a cigarette in his hand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And Jan is just properly
dressed up in sunglasses </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> with a cigarette. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, "Jan?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And he looks over and he
is like, "Bro, help me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What do you mean help you?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "Oh, sorry, my friend's here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he walks over to me and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Do you know that guy?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he is like, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Why were you there?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he is like, "Because
he asked for a cigarette </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "so I just gave him a cigarette. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "And then he just started talking to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "and I couldn't leave." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You can very easily leave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You can just be like, 'Sorry,
I have somewhere to go.'" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But because of course, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jan is just too fucking nice and naive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just sort of tries
to sweet talk everybody. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he's like speech 100 every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "Oh, thanks for saving me bro." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "I literally did nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I just walked past and
you were talking to a dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "in a bathrobe." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the most Jan thing
I've ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Another thing that fucking
cracked me up as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause Mudan flew in from
Estonia just to basically come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to this wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I felt so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was before the ceremony. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were all getting ready
in the boys' powder room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Mudan comes in and then Connor's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Mudan, I got something for you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He reaches into his bag and
brings out the hard disc </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the previous "Trash Taste" episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we had just filmed in England. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so I didn't
just spring this on him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I wasn't like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> So we recorded the "Trash
Taste" episodes in the UK. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But obviously in the UK and the US, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> these episodes are normally
about 400 gigabytes total. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've been blessed by Japanese internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's just no internet
speed that can do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was either we ship
it to him in Estonia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it would actually be faster
than trying to find somewhere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to upload them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So he was coming to the wedding. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I messaged him like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Hey, I know this is kind of weird, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "but can I just give you the
SSD of the episodes in person?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, "Yeah, sure." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then obviously he was kind
of playing it up in person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> He was like, "Wow, really
making me work today?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Come on man, I'm
just here with this thing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like thank you for
coming all the way to England. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Here's some work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - He specifically said, "I'm
gonna bill you for this hour." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Oh, alright, okay, whatever." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Hey, but it all turned out okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. you guys
got the episode on time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's because Mudan
got the work at my wedding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And to build on the Karen story, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because you saw the girls
carrying her off to her room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So Sydney told me what happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after they started carrying her off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I told you the story about my mom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at my cousin's previous wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I've never seen my mom drunk before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I saw a sleeping dragon
awaken at my cousin's wedding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw that sleeping dragon
awaken even harder this time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because apparently what
happened was Sydney was trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to help Karen up to her room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She feels a tap on the shoulder,
turns around, it's my mom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she has a beer in hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney's trying to be polite being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh mom, are you doing okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm trying to get my
friend up to her room." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Karen is on Sydney's shoulder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My mom's like, "Watch this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she downs the bottle of beer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She doesn't even say do
you want me to down this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This time, she just goes, "Watch this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she downs it.
- Walks away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sydney's like, "Mommy,
I'm kind of busy right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my mom looks at Karen and
my mom looks back at Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she goes, "I'll be back, wait here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And apparently she tries
to go back to do it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Sydney's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Mom I really need to take my friend up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "to my room right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This time, my mom didn't
even make it to the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of the night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your mom was popping off, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, she was popping off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You were popping off on
the fucking dance floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Holy fucking shit, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was with D and he
can dance his arse off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I heard the "Kaguya-sama"
opening and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I have to pop." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was played? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't remember.
- Yeah, it did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ♪ Love is war ♪ </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was at the bar, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like the dance
floor was kind of weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there was either no one
there or everyone was there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> There was no in between. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was during the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was me, D and
a couple of other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's like a
couple of tracks playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the "Kaguya-sama" theme starts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're just like, "Well,
we gotta dance to this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We gotta pop off to this song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I just start popping off
'cause I was stupidly drunk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not realizing someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is behind me filming this entire ordeal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so when I received
the video, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> "Wow, I'm fucked right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm so fucked." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I never dance 'cause
I can't dance for shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was dancing like my life
was fucking depending on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you went again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when "Devilman No Uta" started playing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And when "Devilman No
Uta" started playing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "All right, all
right, tie is coming off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm popping off today." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Woo! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah 'cause I remember it went in waves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause everyone went on the dance floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then everyone was
like, "Let's get a drink." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then everyone
immediately went to the bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just kept coming in waves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember the time when
everyone started to pop off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was when fucking "September" played. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's when the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of me and Joey fucking hugging came about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember before that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember I gave Connor the hug as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was fucking "September"
and everyone was so hype. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was I think the hype song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why it was "September". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It's a happy song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a happy song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And also every time we used
to go to karaoke together, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that song was always the most hype song </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so that's what I thought it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I think one of the best
decisions I made with my wedding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wedding planning advice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's some wedding advice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you are planning a
future wedding or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So even though there was
only 62 people at my wedding, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is a fairly small
wedding in my eyes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Small wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Small little wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wedding FOMO is a fucking thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I wanted to be
with everyone at all times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to see what
was fucking popping off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> what people were talking about. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I just wanted to see what's going on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because there's only one of me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and because there's only so many hours </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in this one fucking day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you can only be at one place at a time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had so many regrets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we were also
really, really fucking busy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the photographers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting our own wedding
photos or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Probably my biggest regret of the wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that I didn't see everyone's
reaction to the postcards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and all the messages and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Should've all filmed your reactions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I could react to it later. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause we were outside
taking wedding photography </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you guys were in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> So one of the best decisions I made </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that we had a GoPro there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause of course we did. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I learned from "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I learned from "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I went to everyone and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Film whatever you want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just film, whatever you want." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I've seen the footage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It gives you such an on
the ground experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to what everyone was doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We had videographers there
and so I'm very, very excited </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see what they captured on their end, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think it was a
totally different view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you just have people
filming their own POVs on GoPros </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you got to see
like the progression. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone was so well spoken, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so happy at the beginning of the wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you go to the end
footage and it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Garnt, fucking cut, I'm
so fucking happy for you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And yeah, it was one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the best decisions I
think regarding my wedding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I got to see so much of my wedding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that I wouldn't have got to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I didn't have a GoPro there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got a "Trash Taste"
special outta that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, "Trash Taste" special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unfortunately you guys are
never going to see that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it does exist on my hard drive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, like I said, fantastic day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it's a cliche to say
your wedding's the happiest day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of your life, but it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Top three, top three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one's that jaded where they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, my wedding was alright." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of course, live it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause before the
wedding, I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Maybe it'll be the
happiest day of my life." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't really think about it too much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah, looking back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was genuinely the happiest
day of my life so far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I'm glad you
guys got to share that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that's the best thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about having a wedding to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We had a lot of mates there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just having your mates around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to experience the happiest
moment of your life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is something that I cannot put into words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so fucking special.
- Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Joey wore trainers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, we're gonna talk about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey got the Vessis on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do, so because the wedding
was not done in London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was done just outside of London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we were in London for about a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was hanging out with a
bunch of people, whatnot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I had forgotten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause originally I was
supposed to get a suit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the suit rental place
that Garnt had organized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but because right now in the UK and just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess everywhere in the world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's wedding craze right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we're approaching
the end of the pandemic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> they were all booked up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So Garnt messaged me a few days </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before I was about to
fly out to UK being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Hey, so sorry, but I wasn't
able to get your suit rental </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "so you're gonna have
to bring your own suit." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, "okay, I
only have a JoJo suit." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, that's fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's not a problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which was okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was like, "Whatever, I'll
just get that dry cleaned, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "wear it, whatever." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then when I got to London </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was sorting out
my luggage, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Shit, I forgot to bring my suit shoes." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And so in the back of my head, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, I'm in London for an entire week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'll just pop over to a shoe store, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "buy some nice shoes." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got a little bit ham in London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was drinking every day in London </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of course you do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meeting up, catching up
with a bunch of people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the morning of the wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I was taking my suit out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I realized I don't have suit shoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And the only pair of
shoes I had were a Vessis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I was wearing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I rocked up to the
wedding in full suit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tie pin, belt, everything
and a pair of Vessis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone at the
wedding was giving me shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They were literally doing the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What are those?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fully deserved mind you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know what, at
the end of the day I won </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because when I got onto
that dance floor, dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was fully prepared. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was fully prepared with my Vessis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone had taken their
shoes off to dance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Step aside, I
got the footwear for it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Bring proper suit shoes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] You had one job, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had one job to buy suit
shoes and I did not fulfill it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's making a statement
there, making a statement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly, I was making a statement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I guess wedding aside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess it was a reasonable
amount of time in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like you got to experience more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of the UK this time as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, absolutely, I mean,
last time I was in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which was the first time
was we were staying mostly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at your place in Brighton. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think we were only in
London for maybe two days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And even then, it was mostly just going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to all of the touristy places and whatnot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think, yeah, this time around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not only did I get to have a proper view </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of London, London, but also
like Chris took me out of London </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well 'cause we went
filming to a bunch of places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I actually got to see
the country side of London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I got to see Stonehenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, did you actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we went to Stonehenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really disappointing, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it looks way
cooler from a distance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So to get to Stonehenge, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to go to this visitor center, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy a ticket for some fucking reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you can either take a bus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is five minutes to Stonehenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you can walk across
the fields for 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, "Well,
it's kind of a nice day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Let's just walk across the fields </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> "'cause it might be nice." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was not nice because
it was not only nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for 30 minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there was also just
horse shit everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm fucking dodging this horse shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because God forbid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these are the only pair of
fucking shoes I have as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your Vessis, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, I was wearing the Vessis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No wonder why I smell shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "No, I have to
wear these in the wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm not having horse shit on these." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we got to it and then I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because there was like an
incident some years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of some drawing shit on
the Stonehenge stones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so they had actually fenced it off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but they had fenced it off
not really an arms reach away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least about a 100 meters away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the closest you could get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to Stonehenge was 100 meters away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was kind of defeating
the purpose I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because apparently you used to be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to actually walk into Stonehenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and actually get like a view of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't do that anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I guess some people
just ruined it for everyone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was kind of underwhelming,
I guess in a sense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was like, "Well, Stonehenge
is that one heritage site </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "that you hear people talking about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "and it's a hot tourist place." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Just weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I was just like,
"Well, you know what, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "at least now I can say
that I've seen Stonehenge." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But was it fascinating necessarily? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd go to a Greggs
any day over Stonehenge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, we did afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> We went to a Greggs afterwards, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I think the most enjoyment I had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on that trip out of London was the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I just actually got to
see the real side of the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the actual countryside. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> We went past all these really
small, quaint little villages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There were some villages
that we drove past </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that legitimately looked like RPGs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like an RPG medieval
town, which was so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's most of the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, but I had never seen that before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause my experience of the
UK is London and Brighton, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is very much not like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was really cool to actually stop by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> in these really small,
quaint villages to be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh, we got like the full
experience of the UK. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> One of the best fucking
stories was we stopped by. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was dying for a piss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was like, "We
have to stop by somewhere." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But we're in the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we're like, oh, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess we'll just stop by
the closest village to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there's an establishment we can borrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we stopped by this village. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even remember
the name of this village. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking tiny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And we got to the entrance of the village </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's this old dude standing there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he kind of flags us down like, "Hey." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so Chris was like, "All
right, what's what's happening?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And we drive up to him and he is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, what's, the problem." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the guy goes, "Are you
here to see the duck race?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we're like, "What?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "There's
a duck race happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "So make sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "to drive nice and slowly
across this road, okay?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we're like, "A duck race?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A duck race. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And sure enough, we
drive maybe about 50 meters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's just this gathering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of about 10 to 20 old people
just watching these ducks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "This is the most British
thing I've ever seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "in fucking my life." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - What else are you gonna
do with your free time? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and I was like, "I
wanna be there at that age." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna just like wake up
in the morning and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, the duck race is today." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just go down some of my local pond </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just watch some ducks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We went to a pub the day for the wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was this very,
very quaint local pub </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this very, very small town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because where the wedding took place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was in a town that you could walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from one end to the other in
about 30 minutes, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was fucking tiny.
- It was fucking tiny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was a local pub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember there was
just this poster on the wall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "This is the place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "for the Worldwide Annual
Pea Tossing Tournament," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or something like that.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was the Pea Flicking Tournament. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- Well, I think it's the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that the streets had kind of
the way the natural landscape </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was is that the idea was
that you threw the pea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I Googled it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was curious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You throw the pea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is gonna tell them
wherever your wedding was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's only in this place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I already have one wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So the way that this kind of town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has really cool architecture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a village at the top
and then it kind of winds down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> towards the bottom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So the idea of this pea throwing thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently according to Google, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that the idea is that you throw it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and hopefully if you throw it well enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or you're kind of lucky, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll kind of bounce around the walls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and kind of go all the way down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People will follow it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and see the furthest it goes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> which I think that's pretty fucking fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds fucking fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also extremely British. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's really British, but that's fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I like that. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> Thank you again to Book Walker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you met my parents
for the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, that was fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Connor came around
to my house a few days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before the wedding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We had a nice meal together,
and Connor met my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I got out of the car
and I was wearing a hat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I met your dad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, "Oh, hi, hi." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's like, "Oh hi, hi." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I go inside and then your mom sees me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> She said, "Oh my God, it's Connor." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She was like, "I watch you all the time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Oh, oh yeah,
hell yeah, hell yeah." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> She's just really sweet
and she gave me a hug. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And she just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh my God, I always watch you on the TV. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "It's so nice to see you here." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so wholesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was really wholesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she whipped up
the best food I'd ever had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It was really good food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - But there was this one moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I can't remember if it
was when she first met you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or when you were having food or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I remember she was talking to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then she's never
really mentioned to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about any of our content aside
from what we've talked about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So she's never mentioned
this to me before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember she turns
to Connor and she's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You should have won the cycling special." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like, "What the fuck, mom?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everyone knows that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone knows that.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I got betrayed
by my own fucking family." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was so happy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I was like she's never, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ever mentioned the cycling
special to me before at all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> aside from, "Oh, it looks
like a really beautiful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "place you guys went to." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Glad to know where
your mom's loyalties lie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your mom is literally the
embodiment of the sovereign. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, I got fucking
betrayed, man by my own blood. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I think your
dad then realized who I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he'd said hi to me, but he didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I think when your mom
had said that, he was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, he's that guy." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, "Oh, it's
Connor, it's Connor, hi, hi." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Oh, okay, hi." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It was very sweet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was so cute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - How was your experience back in England? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You know how it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like going back and
just like, "Hey, I'm back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "let's drink, let's do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> It was weird seeing somethings </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> had changed kind of a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, it was interesting this time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was very full on this time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Every single day, there
was something happening, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but that was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like that 'cause I kind of hate it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm not doing anything
and I'm like wandering around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What am I gonna do today? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What am I gonna eat? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause what am I gonna
eat is so important. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was actually really much happier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> with the food that I had there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was so fucking good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I dunno if the
food quality just improved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or we just went to better restaurants. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno, it felt like there
were more food options </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my trip back to England this time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, just got
Borough Market in London, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> best fucking food in London I swear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Every restaurant there
goes unequivocally hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I spent an afternoon
in the Borough Market </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with a friend of mine from high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So cool, dude, the
cheese there, to die for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's good shit, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did a livestream in London as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you did it during fucking
Jubilee weekend as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That looked like hell, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I was filming with
Chris at West Minister Bridge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and you couldn't move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so busy 'cause everyone was waiting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> because the only thing
that was happening that day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was the jets and stuff were flying over, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which was kind of cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The jets flew over in the formation of 70. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> A stupid amount of jets. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Is this where
our military power is?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, never mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they did the
fucking red, white and blue, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> not America, UK, all
that fucking came over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just so busy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Could not get phone signal anywhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was just so
many people were there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got a view through a shooting bridge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we were stopping to
try and set up my IRL bag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We could not get signal
anywhere to start the stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause there was just so many people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was accidentally in the
right place at the right time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to see this thing happen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so I finally managed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> to find a spot three or four miles away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from where we originally
were gonna start the stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was like, okay,
the signal is kind of okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's just fucking start it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my laptop is in my hotel
room connected to the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and I press go live and it's one megabyte. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And for Twitch, you need about six. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It can work on three to four,
but it's sketch and I had one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, "Fuck". </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And we'd already started. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We'd already spent an hour prepping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Fuck." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know that funny thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when your PC is connected
to wifi and internet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for some reason it'll be like, sorry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was connect to wifi and ethernet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes it's like choose the wifi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the wifi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kind of sick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Wireless and it's like, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Use the fucking, why would
you use the slower one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when you connected to the fast one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure there's some fucking
engineer in the comments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> who'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, actually it's because the wifi." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't fucking care." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> To me, it just doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm remote access
with my fucking phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like trying to zoom
in, click the wifi thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turn off the wifi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then suddenly it's
all working perfectly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> We go live and we fuck around in London. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It was great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was really fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Chris was probably the
happiest I've ever seen him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, Chris seemed like
he was in his element. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, he was in cloud nine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, "I'm so glad to be back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "I just wanna go to a pub. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "I wanna have fish and chips, mash pies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't fucking know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My man was like cleaning
up English breakfast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think he was doing
the English breakfast tour </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> of the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna try it here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna try it here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna try it here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Man was unstoppable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was great time though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was so interesting
just seeing the dichotomy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Chris doing an IRL stream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with you in Japan versus in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In Japan, he's just like,
"Don't talk too loud. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "I don't wanna be a dickhead." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I feel like in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I have to be the one who's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo, we're gonna do this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "We're gonna do this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And in, in the UK, Chris is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Let's fucking go here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Let's do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Get outta the way poor people." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It was just so fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It was great, it was great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sad I didn't get to
hang out with Chris before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because I was stacked every
day before the wedding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, of course, obviously, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean you had so much shit to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you had to
entourage the American family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and show them around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and make sure they weren't in trouble. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, it was a very, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very interesting experience
showing them around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the first night
they'd just flown in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and so they didn't wanna go too far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But we went to my local pub, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is literally down the road. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's not in central, central Brighton. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're on the outskirts
of Brighton, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's not somewhere you see
a lot of touristy people go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because Brighton's a pretty
famous touristy place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember we go
there and we sit down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're having a pint and
obviously they're American </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they got the true British experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a local pub and
we had local people there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some younger people
recognized their accents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Were there like road men or something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, road men. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'd never seen,
there's always the image </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of how Americans think
British people speak. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And for the first time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney's family got the
true British experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They got true local Brits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember there was this
one kid having a conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Sydney's brother, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and of course, he was talking
about his fucking rap career </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was going to take off in America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause he had listeners from New York, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he had a Spotify account. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I could see Sydney's
brother's face just, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I know you are speaking English, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> "but I have no idea what
the fuck you are saying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was literally like a scene
now of "The Inbetweeners". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meilyne's husband, Maki
had the exact same experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when I took him to a friend's house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause my friends in London, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not originally from London, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're from further up north, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so they have the more northerner accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of my friends Yusuf, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he has a really strong Leeds accent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is hard even for me
to understand sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was just fucking hilarious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time Yusuf opened his
mouth and just said something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Maki would just squint like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like he's really trying to concentrate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do I turn the subtitles on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like, "This is
definitely English I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't know." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And every time Yusuf would stop talking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would turn to Maki in Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd be like, "Did you understand that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, "No."
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he got really sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, "I thought
I was good at English, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "but I guess I'm not." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Don't
worry, don't worry, Maki. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's fine, even I have
trouble with this English." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That should be on the TOEIC exam. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It should be, "Can you
understand a man from Leeds?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> If you can, you're fluent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're good to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's funny 'cause the
more Northern you go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the harder time it gets for
anyone outside of the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to understand what the fuck is being said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause even for me as like of southerner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can barely understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> what's being said in
Liverpool or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why it's OP being from the north. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just understand everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's great, I'm like, "Yeah, super chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's all good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The only time I struggle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is I felt ashamed at this one point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think there's a clip of a
really, really rural Irish pub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they interviewed this guy- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that the guy with the three teeth? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so, and he
just fucking says shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And even at that point, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I haven't even understood three words. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the guy from
"Kalani" or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It might be something like that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the only time where I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I don't even know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "if the other people in
the pub understood him." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if I'm the weird one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the interviewer understood him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because he's from that part of the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The guy would just
be like, (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And he'd be like, "Yes,
I look this pub too." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, you're
conversing with this guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wish I understood that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That was the only time I felt inadequate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "Fuck, I thought I understood
everything, everything, fuck." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know the exact video
you're talking about as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I felt disappointed as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I'm like, "I'm sure
I can understand this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I'm sure I can understand this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, you start
playing it at 0,5 speed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Maybe I can like gauge the syllables." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - The closed captions just say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Fuck it, I don't know." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even think the
closed caption can determine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's English or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wish it was a TV ad one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> so they have to had that woman
who does the sign language. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just trying to do the sign
and she's like, (exhales). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I dunno, I give up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they have strong accent
in Wales to the point where? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe nothing you wouldn't
be able to understand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just the very like, "Oh,
I'm from this village. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "We talk like this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there differing
geographical differences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in Wales like the UK </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> or is it kind of just stronger or weaker? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Generally, the more north west you go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had to fucking do
that thing with my hand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It gets a little stronger. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The south has a different accent, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's not completely, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wouldn't say it's that different, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but they also have different words. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I feel like the difference
is not so much in the dialect, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> well, not the dialect
it's a different word, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but the accent isn't as
different, just the words. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So the accent sounds
very similar with both, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you get the more
traditional Welsh accent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you might hear in movies
and stuff from the South. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it's more of a dialect difference </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than a pronunciation difference. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, the dialect's pretty similar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, so it's basically like Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, I keep fucking up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's like Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, I mean it's
'cause the fucking history </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is so different between
the north and the south </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause the south was conquered by England </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for a really long time
and the north wasn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's way more Welsh up north. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Just watch "Vinland Saga". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> They lightly touch it a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm jealous 'cause Australia
doesn't have that at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I always thought it was really cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> America and the UK, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, you can immediately
tell where someone is from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but in Australia, we
don't have that at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I really love the history of it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but no one gives a fuck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's really boring to talk about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And I don't wanna talk about it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> if people are fucking resident
sleeping, they're like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But "Vinland Saga" is pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's super hot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's super hot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It doesn't really cover it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It's cool that it at
least touches upon it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a fucking mess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really cool though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least you got an anime around it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got England, but
at least we had Askeladd, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that's all that matters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got one of the
most bad ass characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in all of anime, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The most representation we
got is fucking five minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a "Hetalia" episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got "Ren" from "Free!". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, oh wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, he's Australian. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally the worst character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, he fucking tears
it up in the water. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, when I did
watch the "Free!" Movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I saw Sydney station,
I was like, "Yo." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck yes, let's go.
- Let's go! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the most representation I've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just one guy from "Yuri!!!
On ICE", and that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What about the "K-On!" Movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was set in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm talking about Thailand, Thailand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh Thailand.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had a one Thai ice
skater in "Yuri!!! On ICE" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember there's a big anime chain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan called like Animate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we have an Animate in Bangkok, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and there was just like
this one cardboard cut out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of that one Thai ice skater
from "Yuri!!! On ICE". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was just like, "We did it boys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> representation in anime, let's go!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be fair, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> he's kind of like one of the
most badass animate characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well so that's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> He's definitely up there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and not because he's warped, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that might have bumped him up a few spots. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - We just got racially
profiled by "Hetalia" character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that wasn't even accurate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he was in one episode
and he never came back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least you got "Hetalia". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Wales didn't even get one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every other country got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> except Wales apparently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wales didn't get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> They were like, what are
they fucking doing in Wales? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This is it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, I've said this a billion times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Wales has a branding problem. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The post in charge of Welsh branding, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know who it is, prime minister, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno, needs to fucking sort this out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We need to have a game plan
of how we're gonna brand more. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What's there in Wales? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - See, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What am I gonna tell you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, do you like history? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Great, well there's loads, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if not, go and eat some fucking sheep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you like lamb, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We also have some pretty good baked stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We have a lot of Welsh
cakes, that's kinda good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Nature, nature's really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've been to like Ireland
and I fucking love Ireland. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one of the most aesthetic places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever been to
outside outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Felix went to Wales, he loved it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I think it was Abergavenny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really cool looking place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was inspired by like
Mediterranean things weirdly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the west of Wales. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a really cool area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He sold me on Wales. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a lot of really cool areas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't just rock up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If you just rock up without
researching where to go, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna be like where
the fuck is everything? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is there to do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where am I? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you know what you're going
for some amazing hiking spots, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really beautiful nature parks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of the north Brecon Beacons area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is all nature reserves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nothing's built there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just go hike, having a great time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Brecon Beacons is really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Snowdonia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Snowdonia.
- Snowdonia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That sounds like a place
from "Game of Thrones". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like a "Pokemon". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Chris has been up there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a bunch of cool seaside
stuff that you can go to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it depends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You really have to research. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause when you hear about
people visiting the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously there is England.
- Ireland, Scotland. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are like, "Oh I
fucking love going to Ireland." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause every fifth person here in America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is apparently half Irish or some shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then you also hear people
talking about Scotland. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it really helps
for the UK countries. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, you have London and
then you can branch out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have Scotland, then
you can branch out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You got Dublin, then you can branch out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You have Cardiff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> even then, Cardiff is really
far from all the nature stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of weird in Wales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where if you wanna travel via
public transport up north, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to go around and back up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> You can't just go through the middle. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause there's a lot of mountains or? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there's a lot of mountains </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and that didn't make sense
to build the trains there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it kind of
connects through England </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it goes back in just
like Shrewsbury and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you go really far west
and it is going on, off or on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of really
annoying to get back up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So if you're going westward </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you plan your whole trip to
go west and then you go back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of annoying to go back up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can if you wanna go to Aberystwyth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, Aberystwyth is down south. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> What am I saying? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No, Aberdare, there's so many. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's all weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's a really cool place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you plan your trip, it'll be cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I still wanna go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Again, there's some amazing stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - You gotta show us around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I've never had a
guide for Wales basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - You have to bear in mind, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my experience with Wales was
when I was young and a kid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you are like, "Oh, show me Wales." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "Show you Wales" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I'm gonna be
like that for Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - My view of Sydney is
gonna be very different </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> to the average tourism. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think 'cause
all my tourism was done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in the confines of school trips and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's very warped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What I actually would think would be fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My parents know though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My parents love doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They're doing this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they go all around Wales by walking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not in one go, it's in trips. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they do a section and they go back, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they do another
section and they go back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That's cool.
- That's fucking insane, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - My parents love walking and exercising. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I wish that rubbed off on me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I've got the bare minimum of
wanting to walk and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, if you're interested
in really convoluted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and complex history, yeah,
you might wanna look into it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's kind of cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just about people
trying to not be taken over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> by the English for 400 years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they fail. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's more history than
what we've got, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's pretty much
every country in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think they did a pretty good job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at the rest of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They didn't last very
long against England. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we did pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, we had a pretty good run. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a pretty good run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean it's cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's some pretty funny history moments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've told that story before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the castle that got took over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking love that story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so fucking funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish we had fun stories like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't have any of that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A bunch of convicts were
just like, "Fuck you, UK." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we just started
our own country and yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just a whole lot of racism
and politics happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - When Sydney's family were visiting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you take for granted just
how much history the UK has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was showing them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> even them just seeing buildings, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pubs that were just really odd, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that was fascinating for them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Many churches in the UK </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> have been around since over 1,400 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> There's been a lot of churches </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that were still built in 800. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> This is just insane that
they're still there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] It's crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We take for granted
just having a country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with history in it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas I think if you're over
25 or something in America, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you've been alive for a 10th </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the entire country's history. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your entire country's age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that just fucking blows my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that there's a country that is that young. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - But then you run into the issue of okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna learn about UK
history, where do I start? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you go with the highlights, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then when you start digging
into stuff, you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is really fucking convoluted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they took over, and
then another guy took over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then another guy took over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then England's got
taken over by Vikings, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then now it's the French. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's convoluted, but
it's super fucking fascinating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're into that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what makes it even cooler </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that some of these churches </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and stuff have lasted being
taken over 10 different times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, how the fuck did this happen? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the exact same thing
with Japanese history as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's what makes it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so fascinating for history fanatics. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Australia's not even 250 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We fucking founded 1777, I think 78. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> The UK had already figured
this shit out by then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> We were just like, "Oh,
what the fuck do we do?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of countries that we know today </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and we're super used to are very new. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think Finland is only
like a 100 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and Germany. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To think that Germany </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was a completely different fucking thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause we've been alive our whole life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, our whole life
is like an Angela Merkel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so weird when you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these countries weren't a thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think Germany wanna
talk about their history. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, they don't want to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Actually, they do talk about it a lot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like, "Be ashamed." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how we got onto
countries or whatever the fuck, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I mean, I love talking
about history and countries. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fucking obsessed with history. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love it so much, but there's
just too much to learn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's just too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta pick an era. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get so jealous when I meet
people who are like, dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "I fucking love the Byzantine era." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, "Fuck, dude,
that's just like (indistinct)." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I heard of that from "Age of Empires". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I'm a history buff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but then someone talks to
me about like ancient Rome </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Egypt and I'm like, "Fuck, I wish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "that was the stuff I was
really interested in." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just love the past 1000 years history, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> even then, that's pushing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm the opposite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I love like the ancient stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Then you feel like is
your history more better? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Is your history more better? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - More better?
- Is it more significant? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the Romans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, "Okay dude,
that's kind of fucking sick." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can't go up against that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, that's been this
episode of "Trash Taste" I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look at all these people.
- Welcome to the America ark. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, America ark.
- Let's go! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's welcome all the
patrons as per usual, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Welcome to America guys.
- Yeah, welcome to America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many of them are Americans? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the UK ark didn't
actually last that long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We filmed three episodes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but literally, we went
to the UK for a wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we somehow got three
episodes out of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is pretty impressive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's probably gonna
be eight plus for this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we're gonna have a
lot more for the America ark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're gonna see this set for a while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so get used to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we're gonna have
a lot of guests as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Very exciting guests coming soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, look forward to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unfortunately, if you
are one of the viewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that like hearing us shoot shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna go back to that, don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll figure it out.
- Don't worry, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just heard us shoot shit now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we have a rare opportunity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we can get a lot of guests </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in a very, very short amount of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we wanted to take advantage of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rather than just waiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for people to come to fucking Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which we've been waiting for two years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God knows when that's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But Hey, if you'd like

<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna have so many
America stories, so many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look forward to those, all right, bye. </SPEAKER_00>
