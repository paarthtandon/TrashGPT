<connor> - I guess because you're
used to the normal dynamics </connor>
<garnt> in anime where they're like,
"Oh a hot girl turns up </garnt>
<garnt> and he wants to have sex with her. </garnt>
<connor> But then he actually just starts her. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he just starts fucking her, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Who is this chad?" </garnt>
<garnt> I've never seen such a big
chad in animated before. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to trash taste. </connor>
<connor> I'm your host Connor. </connor>
<connor> And I'm tired of smiling. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Great intro. </connor>
<connor> - We all just had a very strong coffee, </connor>
<garnt> but I'm again with Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hi. </garnt>
<garnt> - And Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello. </garnt>
<garnt> - No nicknames today. </garnt>
<garnt> I just didn't think to do that. </garnt>
<connor> - We're keeping it simple today, are we? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's who we are, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm very tired. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> Every, every day before we do an episode, </joey>
<joey> I wake up at 7:00 AM to
go to a Japanese class </joey>
<joey> for two hours. </joey>
<joey> - How's that going for you? </joey>
<joey> - It's going. </joey>
<joey> - It's going forward. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you're too
tired to learn things. </joey>
<joey> And I remember being this in university. </joey>
<connor> I would be asleep basically. </connor>
<connor> - But then they make you talk. </connor>
<garnt> So I kind of- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, how's it going for you? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause me and Connor have
gone very different routes </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of how we've
approached learning Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> Cause you've taken
classes and I'm completely </connor>
<connor> self-taught because I
realized in university </connor>
<connor> how classes really slowed me down </connor>
<connor> in terms of my learning process. </connor>
<connor> Just the biggest problem I've encountered </connor>
<garnt> is self discipline. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's exactly why I wanted lessons. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Cause, the way I see it, right. </connor>
<connor> Lessons are okay, if I'm
keeping up with these lessons, </connor>
<joey> these are the bare minimum that someone </joey>
<joey> at any mental capacity can learn Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - [All] Right. </joey>
<garnt> - So if I'm learning it
at this structured course </garnt>
<garnt> that anyone can do, right. </garnt>
<connor> I should learn X amount of Japanese. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because we know that
everyone who's homeschooled, </joey>
<connor> doesn't actually do anything. </connor>
<connor> - Also I'm a liar, dude. </connor>
<joey> I lie to myself a lot. </joey>
<joey> when I say I'm gonna learn Japanese </joey>
<joey> I will do everything in my power </joey>
<connor> to think that I'm learning
Japanese, but not do it. </connor>
<joey> - During the quarantine,
because at this point </joey>
<garnt> in the episode, it's pretty much done. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty much open. </connor>
<connor> But during the quarantine,
because you know, </connor>
<connor> Connor you didn't go to
Japanese lessons right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You had to do zoom lessons. </connor>
<connor> - I hated Zoom lessons. </connor>
<connor> - And you were telling
me that most of the time </connor>
<joey> you were just playing Arknights. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> You were just like, "Yes,
I am listening teacher." </connor>
<joey> - It's like, new unit. </joey>
<connor> - Problem was right, is that I was in a... </connor>
<garnt> My class is mainly like housewives </garnt>
<garnt> and people who are much older than me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, a lot of them weren't tech-savvy. </garnt>
<garnt> So, they were all spending
10 minutes saying, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hello, hello, can you hear me? </garnt>
<connor> Hello." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> Meanwhile, I'm already set up. </connor>
<connor> I've got my whole
YouTube is set up, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've got two monitors,
three mobile phones. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - You got the green screen in the back. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - The pro stream is set up. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct chatter) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like when I'm at my PC, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm doing everything but what
I'm supposed to be doing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, I got two monitors, right. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I can also put my webcam
wherever the fuck I want, </garnt>
<garnt> so when they're like, "Are you looking?" </garnt>
<garnt> And like, "Yeah." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm doing work on the other
monitor [indistinct] else. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Well, Connor you're
paying for those lessons. </garnt>
<garnt> Why would you not do it?" </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> I paid to be in class, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> That's that's university
in a nutshell though. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you're, you're paying to be here. </connor>
<connor> You're paying to learn. </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, why do I have to
get a classes though?" </garnt>
<connor> - I don't have to. </connor>
<connor> I can just study from home. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I hate going to the class and having </connor>
<connor> to do that and be back
in that environment. </connor>
<connor> Because you know, I
wanted to get out of that. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time I am learning stuff. </connor>
<connor> It is slow. </connor>
<joey> And I do a lot of study on
my own time, mainly Kanji. </joey>
<joey> Because they don't teach
us Kanji in my class. </joey>
<joey> - They don't teach you Kanji? </joey>
<joey> - It's practical Japanese. </joey>
<joey> So it's all supposed to be for speaking </joey>
<connor> and getting by. </connor>
<joey> Because to reiterate, when I say classes, </joey>
<connor> I think most people will assume every day. </connor>
<garnt> I do classes two times a week
for two hours, that's it? </garnt>
<joey> So not a lot of time to
learn a language really. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> That's better than nothing I guess. </joey>
<garnt> It's much better than doing nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<garnt> Because for me, I've tried to focus </garnt>
<connor> less on the reading and just
pure conversational for me. </connor>
<connor> And actually one thing
that's really helped </connor>
<connor> with that is not watching
anime actually, but- </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - But watching virtual YouTubers. </connor>
<connor> So I've I've really gotten
into watching virtual YouTubers </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - For the last few months. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Who are you into? </connor>
<connor> - Asa Coco is probably my
favorite one at the time </connor>
<joey> of right now. </joey>
<garnt> She just had her 3D debut. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sounding like a
total fucking degenerate. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that the one you
simped over in [indistinct]. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I saw that. </garnt>
<connor> - All over Twitter was, Garnt was simping. </connor>
<garnt> - I was very drunk at the time </garnt>
<garnt> and I saw she was having
her first 3D debut. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm, "I'll just fucking throw her </garnt>
<joey> like 30 bucks, whatever." </joey>
<garnt> And then as soon as I did </garnt>
<garnt> my Twitter notification fucking exploded. </garnt>
<joey> - Gigguk is simping over VTuber. </joey>
<connor> - Imagine getting caught simping,
but over virtual YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, because it's actually
really helped my Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> way more than watching anime. </garnt>
<garnt> Because with watching anime, </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno what the anime watching experience </garnt>
<garnt> has been for you Connor since
you've started learning. </garnt>
<garnt> But for me I found it a lot more difficult </garnt>
<garnt> to watch anime now that
I'm learning Japanese </garnt>
<connor> because you know when
you read the subtitles, </connor>
<connor> and then you kind of
understand what's going on. </connor>
<connor> So you wanna try to listen in </connor>
<connor> to what's what's being said. </connor>
<connor> But because you do that,
you kind of just miss </connor>
<connor> what's on the subtitles. </connor>
<garnt> That's been my anime watching
experience recently and well- </garnt>
<connor> - I imagine Joey is just
on his throne here being, </connor>
<garnt> "Yes, tell me more about your struggles." </garnt>
<joey> - What are these Subtitles you speak of? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, one thing that
I noticed that bugs me, </joey>
<joey> is that now that I know,
I'd say a very basic amount. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> Very minimal. </joey>
<joey> Not, enough to watch
an episode and be like, </joey>
<garnt> "Yup, I understood, all that." </garnt>
<garnt> But enough to get some sentences, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that when I read the subtitles </garnt>
<garnt> and obviously because in Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes the subject at the
end of the sentence in English, </garnt>
<garnt> it's normally at the start in Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> So sometimes you'll see a subtitle, </garnt>
<garnt> that comes with the other
half of the sentence. </garnt>
<garnt> So you're hearing the
sentence that's gonna come up. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, you're Johnson Joestar. </connor>
<connor> I was just like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor And Garnt] I
know what you're gonna say. </connor>
<garnt> - You're next line is gonna be. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - And it kinda messes with you. </garnt>
<connor> And then also like </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> Just watching any hentai,
it's really frustrating. </connor>
<joey> Because I realized two minutes in, </joey>
<joey> I'm starting to be, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, what are they
saying, just a minute." </joey>
<joey> (speaking in Japanese) </joey>
<joey> - Means feels good. </joey>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, understand. </connor>
<connor> (speaking in Japanese) </connor>
<connor> - I guess though it makes
sense to watch VTubers though, </connor>
<connor> to learn Japanese. </connor>
<connor> Because you know, these are real people. </connor>
<garnt> - No, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who are speaking. </garnt>
<garnt> They just look anime, but their mannerisms </garnt>
<garnt> and their phrasing, </garnt>
<garnt> even though they might be
playing a character, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's still a real person. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it feels like, </garnt>
<joey> they're having an actual conversation. </joey>
<joey> Because you know watching an anime, </joey>
<joey> and you hear a conversation. </joey>
<connor> You're like, "I've never actually... </connor>
<connor> - This isn't a real conversation. </connor>
<connor> - This isn't a real conversation
that's happening right now. </connor>
<connor> And I'm zoning most of it out. </connor>
<connor> Whereas when I'm watching a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> it feels like a genuine... </connor>
<joey> Like a Japanese conversation. </joey>
<joey> Like you're actually hearing a story </joey>
<connor> the way any person you talk
to Japan would talk like. </connor>
<connor> It's been way more useful
for me in learning Japanese </connor>
<garnt> than it has been watching anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Also because I guess with VTubers again, </joey>
<joey> they're real people, right? </joey>
<connor> So the speed that they talk
at as well is very real. </connor>
<connor> And it's not overly accentuated. </connor>
<connor> So it actually makes more sense </connor>
<connor> to get used to that kind
of speech, speed, than like </connor>
<connor> (speaking in Japanese) </connor>
<garnt> No one talks like that, right? </garnt>
<joey> - No, cause you're not it's
the anime voice acting voice, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Which is not how real people talk like. </joey>
<joey> This is true in I'd say dub as well. </joey>
<joey> You know you hear a dub voice actor, </joey>
<joey> or a dub performance. </joey>
<connor> And you're like, "This
isn't how real people talk. </connor>
<connor> This isn't how people talk." </connor>
<connor> - No, of course. </connor>
<connor> - It's very anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it's more watching a live streamer. </connor>
<connor> So it's been... </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna say that's... </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna say that's the only reason </connor>
<connor> I'm getting into VTubers. </connor>
<connor> But if you're trying to learn Japanese </connor>
<connor> I'd say VTubing is much
more useful than learning- </connor>
<connor> - It's educational, I swear. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> - Than watching anime. </connor>
<joey> Because watching anime now for
me has become a lot harder. </joey>
<joey> And you get the joy of finding
that one VTuber you can simp. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You're like, "Oh yeah, that's my one." </connor>
<connor> - It's a little bit annoying
to watch anime sometimes. </connor>
<connor> But then also now
sometimes I can look away </connor>
<garnt> just for a second </garnt>
<garnt> and I can still understand
what they said roughly. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I'll know, three of
the five words that they say </garnt>
<joey> and that after that I can
kind of piece together. </joey>
<joey> What was being said. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't that such a
gratifying moment though. </joey>
<joey> - It really is, I was
going to say as well, </joey>
<joey> one thing that I found really helpful </joey>
<connor> than I thought I would
dread is learning Kanji. </connor>
<connor> I think Lennon Kanji is so interesting. </connor>
<connor> I know you love your Kanji. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But learning has been so fun. </connor>
<connor> Just because when it slowly
starts to make sense, </connor>
<joey> it feels like an RPG, </joey>
<joey> where you're unlocking
the world where you live. </joey>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I can slowly start to read stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's multiple different ways </garnt>
<connor> to read a Kanji. </connor>
<connor> And then when you know both,
it's like, "Yeah, I'm kinda- </connor>
<joey> - You're like that one Isekai protai </joey>
<connor> who just comes in is
like, "What does this say? </connor>
<connor> I don't know." </connor>
<connor> And they're 12 episodes it, his like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I get it." </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's been really
helpful for just learning. </connor>
<joey> Speaking in general. </joey>
<connor> Because a lot of the words
have the same pronunciation, </connor>
<connor> and then obviously Kanji is
the way to differentiate it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Kanji holds the meaning, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And sometimes reading a
whole sentence in Hiragana </connor>
<connor> is like a fucking nightmare. </connor>
<joey> - It is a nightmare. </joey>
<joey> And weirdly enough for
people who'd have no idea </joey>
<connor> about Japanese it might
be hot to think about, </connor>
<connor> but a full on Hiragana
or Katakana sentence </connor>
<connor> is so difficult to read sometimes. </connor>
<connor> Whereas Kanji is just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, I know exactly what that means. </connor>
<joey> I know exactly how to read it." </joey>
<connor> - The way I see it, is that in English, </connor>
<garnt> is that how we don't
need to read the word, </garnt>
<garnt> we know the shape of the word. </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We can see a word. </garnt>
<connor> I know the shape of the
word, I can read it. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's how
Kanji is to Japanese people. </connor>
<garnt> Where they don't necessarily read it </garnt>
<garnt> but they recognize that the shape. </garnt>
<connor> And then they just know what's
being said in the sentence </connor>
<garnt> - Because have you seen that video </garnt>
<garnt> where you can read an entire paragraph? </garnt>
<connor> Where if the word the
first letter is the same </connor>
<connor> the last letter is the
same and then you swap </connor>
<connor> all the letters in the middle, </connor>
<connor> you can still read what's going on. </connor>
<connor> Just because of how your fluency works. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I feel it would be the
same with Kanji as well. </joey>
<joey> - I think so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It is the same. </joey>
<joey> But instead of the first and last letters </joey>
<joey> it's like does this have
one line in it or two? </joey>
<joey> It's that but just squinting really hard. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there are some
where there's so many lines </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, "How the fuck do people </connor>
<connor> just read it this fast?" </connor>
<joey> - I mean the more difficult
is when you start to write it. </joey>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true, true. </connor>
<joey> - That's when it starts to get difficult. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because I have an app </joey>
<joey> and it vibrates my phone if
you do the wrong stroke order. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> (Connor grunting) </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, "That's not how you do it." </garnt>
<garnt> It's been good though, </garnt>
<garnt> because whenever write
a Kanji out in my class </garnt>
<garnt> in the right stroke order. </garnt>
<garnt> The teacher is like </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor grunting) </garnt>
<garnt> Like in the TV shows. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, "Why?" </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Because you never really think about </connor>
<connor> something like strike order. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> Which stroke order is basically
the order you write it in. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because I write my
Ss the wrong way in English </connor>
<garnt> and people freaking out. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've seen you write your S. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tell people how you write your Ss? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're supposed to do
it top to bottom right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, most people do it like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do it from top to bottom up. </garnt>
<connor> And then swish down with the cursive. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did you learn that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, I was so bad at English in school. </garnt>
<garnt> So to clarify, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I'll just start the story with this. </garnt>
<garnt> We'll start strong, right. </garnt>
<garnt> I was so bad at English that
they put me with the kids </garnt>
<garnt> who you know we're not
good at anything, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I was in the English class for one year </joey>
<joey> with kids with learning disabilities. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> And I remember being dude, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Because okay. </connor>
<connor> I've always been really good
at most subjects in school </connor>
<connor> and, okay to clarify the reason
why my English was so bad </connor>
<connor> is because the only reading
and writing I ever did </connor>
<connor> was in Welsh. </connor>
<connor> Because my school was Welsh. </connor>
<connor> Everything I spoke in school,
and read was in Welsh. </connor>
<connor> But I obviously knew how to spell English. </connor>
<connor> Speak English obviously. </connor>
<garnt> And then yeah, I remember we
did an English spelling test </garnt>
<garnt> and I got everything wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> But bear in mind I was like eight. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember they said like </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, can you smell the woods said for us?" </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, "Yeah sure." </joey>
<joey> And I just- </joey>
<joey> - S-E-D. </joey>
<joey> - S-E-D. </joey>
<connor> - I put like Z-E-D. </connor>
<connor> And then my parents were like, "Oh no." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Bear in mind, I never
read anything in English. </connor>
<connor> Reading at all. </connor>
<connor> It was just always video games. </connor>
<connor> So, yeah. </connor>
<joey> And I forgot why was I... </joey>
<joey> Why did this story come up? </joey>
<joey> I forgot why I was saying this now. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct chatter) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I think I
learned how to write... </joey>
<connor> Because in English as well, in school </connor>
<connor> they teach you the stroke order. </connor>
<garnt> - Do they? </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember this. </garnt>
<joey> - I learnt it when we had to... </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is only in Australia </joey>
<joey> but I think I was in
fourth grade or something </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because you have those
papers which are half width </connor>
<joey> and full width. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And you have to. </joey>
<joey> I learned how to do it when
we learned to write cursive. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because I
remember learning cursive, </connor>
<connor> and it kind of became a
thing where I for some reason </connor>
<connor> I just started writing
some of them weirdly, </connor>
<connor> and no one ever stopped me. </connor>
<connor> - I do what I want. </connor>
<connor> - And so I've always done. </connor>
<connor> I'll go into the A and then I'll go down </connor>
<connor> and then do the S up and then slash down. </connor>
<joey> - How do you write the number five. </joey>
<joey> Do you go from the bottom
or do you go from the top? </joey>
<connor> - It depends, I guess. </connor>
<joey> Whatever the situation. </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean it depends? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - How does that work? </joey>
<garnt> - There's only one way to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Most of the time I
would do it from the top, </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember distinctively </garnt>
<garnt> I was doing it from the bottom for a while </garnt>
<garnt> and then I stopped that. </garnt>
<connor> But I also used to write my fours like... </connor>
<garnt> The correct way of doing... </garnt>
<connor> How do you learn to
wright fours in Australia. </connor>
<garnt> - I do it this way. </garnt>
<garnt> I do it that way. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the way I learned. </connor>
<connor> But then I remember I was
playing brain training </connor>
<garnt> and they wouldn't accept
that way of writing four. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> This is when I was like 11. </garnt>
<garnt> So then I started having to write fours </garnt>
<garnt> in the Americanized way,
which is doing that way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the Americanized way? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I think so, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> It looks a a kind of spiky nine, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think I've
write any letters starting </garnt>
<connor> from the bottom. </connor>
<garnt> I'm always- </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, how do you do your fours? </connor>
<joey> - Like this. </joey>
<connor> - I do it the opposite way, I think. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So you do it from the bottom? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, from the bottom, and then I go- </joey>
<joey> - How the fuck do you do that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, this feels so weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - So in school, did you have to learn </garnt>
<joey> English literature and language? </joey>
<joey> - What's the difference? </joey>
<connor> - Because they were two different
subjects for us in school. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, we just had English. </joey>
<connor> - Shit, cause see, I had
to learn English literature </connor>
<connor> English language, Welsh
literature and Welsh language. </connor>
<connor> I fucking hated doing that many. </connor>
<joey> Okay, cause I think for us,
maybe it's just my school. </joey>
<connor> But it depended on the day of the week. </connor>
<connor> It was like on Mondays we
go through a literature </connor>
<connor> for the term that we have to study. </connor>
<connor> And then on Wednesdays we
got to do something else </connor>
<connor> watch a movie or study a
different text for a certain thing </connor>
<connor> or how to read an essay and
write an essay on Fridays. </connor>
<connor> And shit like that. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, we didn't... </connor>
<connor> I think it's because my school
was just very small as well. </connor>
<connor> So they probably wasn't
enough English teachers </connor>
<garnt> in our school to be like, </garnt>
<connor> "You're the literature one, </connor>
<joey> and you're the comprehension one." </joey>
<garnt> - How does it feel learning a
new language as your older now </garnt>
<garnt> though, compared to when you were a kid. </garnt>
<connor> Because I remember we had
to learn a lot of the other </connor>
<connor> languages when were in school. </connor>
<connor> We had to learn Spanish, French. </connor>
<connor> - Didn't take any of that shit- </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - But it's been a really
different challenge </connor>
<connor> learning Japanese as a grown adult. </connor>
<connor> I would say. </connor>
<connor> Because I don't know, has the fact that </connor>
<garnt> you are very much into Japanese culture </garnt>
<garnt> and watching anime helped you
at all from your perspective. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, definitely. </connor>
<connor> I think it's made it easier, </connor>
<garnt> but easy with an asterisk, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Easier to understand
some concepts culturally </connor>
<connor> that might explain some of the language. </connor>
<connor> Which is great. </connor>
<connor> But at the end of the
day it doesn't help me </connor>
<connor> in a crazy amount. </connor>
<connor> I think it just helps me understand </connor>
<connor> why certain things are the
way they are in a language. </connor>
<connor> You know, why you can't
be direct to someone. </connor>
<garnt> Why it's always </garnt>
<connor> (speaking in Japanese) </connor>
<connor> - I guess because sometimes
when you're learning </connor>
<garnt> the language you're, "Why
can't I just be direct? </garnt>
<garnt> It's not a thing you can't do that. </garnt>
<connor> That's too aggressive. </connor>
<garnt> I think learning Japanese from me, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't realize how much I kind of just </garnt>
<garnt> zoned out Japanese when
I'm watched anime before. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you do. </connor>
<garnt> You filter it out. </garnt>
<garnt> because you're that's nonsense to me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm focusing on this. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just absorbing the subtitles. </garnt>
<garnt> Then you kind of just
mute out the Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't realize that
until I started learning. </connor>
<connor> When I actually picked out individual, </connor>
<connor> how the sentence works and how
the language actually works. </connor>
<connor> That I realized, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh this didn't help me a lot at all. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<connor> I find it really hard in my head </connor>
<connor> to recommend learning
a language to people. </connor>
<connor> Because I feel if you're
not going to actually do it, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of a waste of time. </connor>
<connor> - I know, it takes commitment. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I said to
people though, about Japanese. </joey>
<connor> - And it's one of those
things where learning Japanese </connor>
<connor> especially if you're not
going to do it full time, </connor>
<connor> it's like at least a five-year thing </connor>
<connor> that you have to commit to. </connor>
<connor> And if you quit two half years in, </connor>
<joey> - But that's the problem. </joey>
<connor> So many people. </connor>
<connor> I get fucking emails about
it all the time goddamn time, </connor>
<garnt> being like. "What's the
easiest way to learn Japanese?" </garnt>
<garnt> There is no easy way to learn Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> You just have to sit
down and just be like, </garnt>
<connor> "I'm I about to commit
five to 10 years of my life </connor>
<connor> to learn this shit?" </connor>
<connor> "Yes." </connor>
<connor> Go for it. </connor>
<connor> It's like any skill chart. </connor>
<connor> Where it's the first getting </connor>
<connor> over the first real difficult bump </connor>
<garnt> is the hardest. </garnt>
<connor> And once you get past that,
you've gone through a challenge. </connor>
<connor> You've overcome it. </connor>
<connor> Normally you could keep going. </connor>
<connor> That's the same with any craft, right? </connor>
<garnt> Voice acting as well,
photography, anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's always gonna be that first point </garnt>
<garnt> where you think you're
starting to understand it. </garnt>
<garnt> Then you get to that
point where you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck, I know nothing about
what I'm getting into. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's that point
where if you keep going </garnt>
<garnt> and actually start to
really put in the work </garnt>
<garnt> you'll probably see some results. </garnt>
<connor> But a lot of people quit at that point. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I'm always really paranoid </garnt>
<garnt> and this is true in my life. </garnt>
<connor> And whenever I'm doing a
play through of a game. </connor>
<connor> When I'm doing something
and it's just sub-optimized. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I paralyze myself. </connor>
<connor> because I'm just like,
what if I'm not doing this </connor>
<connor> the most optimal way? </connor>
<connor> Is this a waste of time? </connor>
<connor> I'm so scared of wasting my time. </connor>
<connor> So when I first started learning Japanese </connor>
<connor> I spent more time trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> the best way to learn Japanese, </connor>
<connor> than actually learning Japanese. </connor>
<garnt> - It's usually like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess you're the
opposite to me in that sense. </connor>
<connor> Video games. </connor>
<connor> I'm definitely that. </connor>
<connor> I'll maximize the shit out of video games, </connor>
<connor> but everything else in my life like, </connor>
<joey> "That's good enough." </joey>
<connor> - I'm kind of the
opposite with video games. </connor>
<connor> I'm just video games video games... </connor>
<connor> - You are. </connor>
<joey> - Video games are just made
to be fun and time wasting. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because I'll
talk to Joey about videos </connor>
<connor> that we're both playing </connor>
<connor> and I'll be like, "Do you
know, this is 2% more efficient </connor>
<joey> to do this method, right? </joey>
<joey> And Joey is like, "Bro,
I don't give a fuck." </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, "I've
already put 60L in this game, </joey>
<joey> I don't care." </joey>
<joey> - That's how with you
learning a language though </joey>
<joey> I'm like as long as I'm learning something </joey>
<garnt> in the language that I can view </garnt>
<garnt> as somewhat useful I'm
sure it's not a waste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like there's no
route to learning a language. </garnt>
<garnt> Any bit you learn of it. </garnt>
<connor> It's putting the jigsaw together. </connor>
<connor> - It depends on the person. </connor>
<garnt> At the end of the day. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, some people are crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone has a different path. </joey>
<joey> Everyone learns differently </joey>
<joey> and you're not gonna discover
the best way you learn </joey>
<joey> unless you actually just go
out and fail at something. </joey>
<joey> I didn't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> I would waste a month on Duolingo. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I wasted a lot of time on Duolingo. </connor>
<garnt> - I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Other languages, European languages. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure it's pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> But I took Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> It was not very useful. </garnt>
<garnt> - [indistinct] you right from the get-go </garnt>
<connor> and not explaining why
you need to learn it </connor>
<joey> or what this is. </joey>
<connor> - That sounds efficient. </connor>
<connor> It was teaching me the Kanji for window. </connor>
<connor> One of the first things- </connor>
<garnt> - That a difficult one too. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was hard. </garnt>
<connor> And see Kanji for see. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, "Why are
you teaching me this shit?" </connor>
<connor> I don't even know the Kanji from Monday. </connor>
<connor> Why would you teach me window? </connor>
<connor> I don't need to know this. </connor>
<joey> I don't even think
window is in the top 100 </joey>
<joey> most used Kanji. </joey>
<joey> So why you teaching me? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's pretty uncommon to see. </joey>
<joey> - I feel that the way
Duolingo went about it. </joey>
<joey> We're never gonna get a
Duolingo sponsorship by the way. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it was, yeah, not good. </joey>
<joey> - If we do, you can call us out on that. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Duolingo is a way... </connor>
<connor> It tricks you into
thinking you're learning. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - You know a lot of just- </connor>
<connor> - Useless shit. </connor>
<connor> - Pieces of information </connor>
<connor> that you can never piece together </connor>
<garnt> as a whole to use anywhere basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's a shame, </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel you don't really realize </garnt>
<connor> that you're being mugged off by Duolingo </connor>
<connor> until you actually start
learning it properly. </connor>
<connor> And then you're like,
"I literally have no use </connor>
<connor> for anything I learned on Duolingo, </connor>
<connor> because it was such a,
it was such a mess." </connor>
<connor> I remember distinctively. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<garnt> I didn't even know how
to say any sentences. </garnt>
<garnt> But they were teaching
me how to read the Kanji </garnt>
<garnt> of Kyoto in Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "That's cool. </garnt>
<joey> But I don't need to know this. </joey>
<connor> I genuinely don't." </connor>
<connor> - If you go to Tokyo and Kyoto </connor>
<connor> it's written in fucking English </connor>
<joey> This is something that
I don't need to know. </joey>
<joey> What I would to know is how do I say, </joey>
<connor> "Oh I recommend this." </connor>
<connor> "I think." </connor>
<connor> I didn't know how to say,
I think or anything that. </connor>
<connor> - Duolingo, I don't need
to know if this is a pen. </connor>
<connor> I know what an Apple is. </connor>
<connor> I don't have to ask what an apple is. </connor>
<connor> - You know, there's some good stuff there. </connor>
<joey> I'm not saying it's all bad, </joey>
<connor> but I just felt the structure
was all over the place. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember. </garnt>
<garnt> When we first moved... </garnt>
<garnt> Before we moved to Japan </garnt>
<connor> Me and Connor were on
Duolingo for a good month. </connor>
<connor> Month and a half. </connor>
<connor> Before moving to Japan. </connor>
<connor> And then we got here, </connor>
<connor> and we were "Oh, we don't know shit." </connor>
<connor> So we needed to start off by
learning hiragana and Katakana. </connor>
<connor> And I remember I sat down. </connor>
<connor> And I Googled what the best
memorization techniques were. </connor>
<connor> And then I found this
memorization technique. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember what it's called. </connor>
<connor> - We'll link it in the description. </connor>
<connor> - It's like mnemonics or mnemonics. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the
exact pronunciation of it. </connor>
<connor> And then I learnt all of
hiragana and Katakana in one day. </connor>
<connor> And then I told Connor,
"Yo, this shit works." </connor>
<connor> Connor was like, "Nah, I
don't know about this." </connor>
<connor> I linked him then same article. </connor>
<connor> And he comes back to me
three, four hours later. </connor>
<connor> I'm, "Bruh." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I can read. </connor>
<garnt> - Hurrah moment. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I said earlier, when you go outside, </garnt>
<joey> and you've unlocked the world. </joey>
<joey> Cause you can start suddenly
reading McDonald's menus </joey>
<joey> with no. </joey>
<joey> - Is the pneumonics thing where you. </joey>
<connor> It's shape based. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It would make you assign... </joey>
<garnt> And to be fair, this is how
memory champions, memorize stuff </garnt>
<garnt> they assign stories and shapes
and objects to the memory. </garnt>
<connor> And that way they can
recall them much easier. </connor>
<connor> So it would say [indistinct]
which is the one </connor>
<connor> that's like that. </connor>
<garnt> They're like, "It's a chef's hat. </garnt>
<garnt> Think of a chef's hat when you
see this symbol for cooking. </garnt>
<garnt> - [indistinct] Look like a chef's hat. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct chatter) </garnt>
<garnt> It was yeah, it was a sign. </garnt>
<garnt> Because then you remember
that's kind of dumb </garnt>
<garnt> that it's telling you to do that. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you remember when you see it. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, it's that dumb thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You remember the dumb shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's really stupid, </garnt>
<connor> but it made you remember it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's Counter-intuitive right. </garnt>
<joey> Because by remembering more stuff </joey>
<joey> you remember one stuff better </joey>
<joey> as opposed to just repeating
the same thing over and over. </joey>
<joey> But the best way I've
heard an explanation for it </joey>
<connor> is that your memory is kind
of a filing cabinet, right? </connor>
<connor> So if you just have one
random piece of information </connor>
<connor> that you just randomly file. </connor>
<connor> It's very hard to just find </connor>
<connor> that random piece of information. </connor>
<connor> But you have... </connor>
<connor> If that information is got a bunch </connor>
<connor> of other information that relates to that, </connor>
<connor> then it's much easier for you
to find it in your memory. </connor>
<connor> So that's why you can just
recall things a lot easier. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I definitely feel that. </connor>
<connor> I find that learning symbols for me </connor>
<connor> is way easier than learning anything else? </connor>
<connor> That's why Kanji has
been pretty fun so far. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you're definitely a person </joey>
<joey> who remembers stuff visually, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, if you give me a set of numbers </connor>
<connor> I can normally remember
the numbers decently well. </connor>
<connor> Learning Kanji is great. </connor>
<connor> Cause I love just putting
100 symbols in a program </connor>
<garnt> and just making it test me over and over </garnt>
<garnt> and I'll do that for hours </garnt>
<joey> until I can remember all 100, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's what I do, and
I find that pretty easy. </connor>
<connor> - At the end of the day, that's what </connor>
<connor> is probably the most effective, right. </connor>
<connor> It's just fucking- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you literally just need to force </connor>
<joey> that shit in your head. </joey>
<joey> By just doing it, doing it, doing it. </joey>
<joey> And at least the good thing
about doing that here in Japan </joey>
<connor> is that if you then
force yourself to learn </connor>
<connor> all those symbols, is
that you just walk outside </connor>
<connor> and you're like, "Oh, oh." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you can use it practically, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, somewhere, I'm like
I'm never going to fucking... </connor>
<joey> Why would I need to know this Kanji? </joey>
<joey> And then two seconds
later, I'm on the train </joey>
<connor> and the place has one of
the Kanjis in their name. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Bruh." </garnt>
<connor> - "I get it." </connor>
<connor> - My question for you, Joey, </connor>
<connor> which is, I have always been curious. </connor>
<connor> How much studying have you done? </connor>
<connor> Because a lot of people
assume that Joey's Japanese </connor>
<connor> is a second language. </connor>
<connor> And it's completely wrong. </connor>
<connor> Joey has a second first language. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, pretty much. </connor>
<garnt> A lot of people would don't know this, </garnt>
<garnt> but Joey's Japanese is better
than most Japanese people. </garnt>
<connor> - I had no idea how
good your Japanese was. </connor>
<connor> I just kinda thought that
you were decent at it. </connor>
<joey> But then I came here, and
then you were teaching Kanji </joey>
<joey> to 40 year old people. </joey>
<joey> And then they were like, "What the fuck? </joey>
<connor> - It was in the studio. </connor>
<connor> We were doing a party
and we had three people </connor>
<connor> from our company, all Japanese. </connor>
<connor> And I was teaching them about
different Kanji structures </connor>
<connor> and shit, they were like, </connor>
<connor> "I've never heard of the shit before." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm have you heard of it before? </garnt>
<garnt> It's so simple. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I did a lot, a lot, a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> when I say I've said it in videos </garnt>
<garnt> but when I've said </garnt>
<garnt> I've studied my entire
life, I'm not joking. </garnt>
<garnt> I've studied my entire life. </garnt>
<garnt> Just to put it in perspective </garnt>
<garnt> when I was maybe 10 years old. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I used to do for fun? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - I used to read the Kanji dictionary. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Seriously? </connor>
<connor> - I was that one kid. </connor>
<connor> My parents probably thought
I was borderline autistic, </connor>
<connor> because I would sit in
my room as a 10 year old </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "I've got
nothing better to do." </connor>
<garnt> And I would just go to my mom's bookshelf </garnt>
<garnt> just take out this massive, you know </garnt>
<garnt> 2000 page Kanji dictionary
and just open it up </garnt>
<connor> to a random page and just
read it for hours on end. </connor>
<connor> And I dunno, maybe I don't know how much </connor>
<garnt> that actually helped me in the long run </garnt>
<garnt> but definitely it kind of got me to </garnt>
<connor> familiarize myself with
different shapes and you know </connor>
<connor> in that sense I'm
definitely a lot like Connor </connor>
<connor> where I'm very good at
learning things with visually. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I need visuals. </joey>
<connor> Learning sentences and stuff,
doesn't do anything for me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but another huge
thing for me was probably </joey>
<connor> the fact that my mom had this
kind of this unspoken rule </connor>
<connor> where if I spoke to her in English </connor>
<garnt> I would usually get ignored. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's really cruel. </garnt>
<connor> Especially when a four
year old is trying to talk </connor>
<connor> to their mom about something. </connor>
<connor> But I quickly picked up on it because </connor>
<garnt> I was four or five years
old and I'd be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Hey, mom can I do, you know, blah, blah." </connor>
<connor> She just straight up ignore me. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "All right,
she's in a pissed off mood. </connor>
<connor> but then the more times you
experienced it, I'm like </connor>
<connor> "I have to ask her in Japanese." </connor>
<connor> The moment I asked her in Japanese, </connor>
<connor> she's like, "Yes son, what- </connor>
<connor> - That's a genius way to make
you kid learn your language. </connor>
<joey> - My mum was exactly the same actually. </joey>
<joey> She's like, "You're gonna appreciate this </joey>
<connor> when you're older. </connor>
<connor> You're getting this now, mom, </connor>
<connor> I appreciate it now that I'm older. </connor>
<joey> - Mom, I also appreciate it, thank you. </joey>
<connor> Because if she didn't do that, </connor>
<connor> then I wouldn't have just... </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't have forced
myself to learn Thai </connor>
<joey> or to use Thai in a practical setting, </joey>
<joey> which is very hard when you're not living </joey>
<garnt> in the country that you're using it in. </garnt>
<joey> - Exactly, you know, everybody
around me spoke English. </joey>
<connor> Because I was living in Australia. </connor>
<connor> And I had a few childhood
friends who spoke Japanese, </connor>
<connor> but because all my childhood friends </connor>
<connor> were also halfies like me. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes we just spoke
in English to one another. </connor>
<connor> So I needed a way... </connor>
<connor> I guess my mom was like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, I need to find
a consistent way for my son </connor>
<connor> to keep speaking the
language, just keep improving. </connor>
<connor> And it really helped as well </connor>
<connor> because my mum was exceedingly
good at Japanese and Kanji </connor>
<connor> and stuff that, especially. </connor>
<connor> So whenever I had a question </connor>
<connor> or I learned a new word,
I always went to my mom </connor>
<connor> and I tried to force
myself to use that new word </connor>
<connor> in a sentence. </connor>
<connor> And she would either say, </connor>
<connor> "Oh that's not how you use that word." </connor>
<connor> This is how you use it. </connor>
<connor> - You dumb little shit. </connor>
<connor> Let me tell you how to use this word. </connor>
<connor> She could immediately know
when I was trying to... </connor>
<connor> Where I was oh yeah, you just
learnt that word didn't you? </connor>
<connor> Because she'd be like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, that's not quite how you use it. </joey>
<joey> This is how you use it." </joey>
<joey> And then I'd use it
again and she'd be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, perfect." </joey>
<joey> And that's just how I
learn from practicality. </joey>
<garnt> - You know one big reason </garnt>
<joey> I've really want to learn Japanese </joey>
<joey> is one specific series
I want to experience </joey>
<connor> after having learned Japanese. </connor>
<connor> And that's the Monogatari Series. </connor>
<connor> I've really, really wanna
experience The Monogatari Series </connor>
<joey> after learning Japanese. </joey>
<joey> Cause I love the Monogatari Series now, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like I'm getting
maybe half the enjoyment </joey>
<garnt> I could be getting, </garnt>
<garnt> or the appreciation I could be getting. </garnt>
<joey> - There's this video
I've been trying to write </joey>
<connor> for the longest time, </connor>
<connor> called You'll Never Understand Nisio Isin. </connor>
<connor> Where, because as you
said, The Monogatari Series </connor>
<connor> and everything Nisio Isin
writes is fucking phenomenal. </connor>
<connor> He's an amazing author. </connor>
<connor> A lot of it translates
pretty well into English. </connor>
<connor> But the thing that makes
Nisio Isin so amazing </connor>
<connor> is the subtleties and the
way that he plays around </connor>
<connor> with the Japanese language. </connor>
<connor> And that shit is fucking
impossible to translate. </connor>
<connor> And I've wanted to make that video </connor>
<connor> because I fucking love Nisio
Isin and the Monogatari Series </connor>
<connor> more than anybody. </connor>
<connor> But it's like how do I explain </connor>
<connor> to my English speaking audience about how </connor>
<connor> you'll never understand it. </connor>
<connor> If you're an English speaker. </connor>
<connor> That is so hard to- </connor>
<connor> - You need to have a basic
understanding of Kanji. </connor>
<joey> To understand- </joey>
<connor> - Not just Kanji, it's- </connor>
<connor> - Everything. </connor>
<connor> - He does word play in a
way that I've never seen </connor>
<connor> any Japanese author do. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's the whole reason why </connor>
<connor> so many people love him, </connor>
<connor> it's because it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow I didn't know that you could... </connor>
<connor> He makes Japanese people's
Japanese look dumb </connor>
<connor> That's the only way to describe it. </connor>
<garnt> A Japanese person will
read that and be like, </garnt>
<joey> "Wow, it's like, I don't
know this language." </joey>
<garnt> Because, have you ever
seen The Monogatari Series? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was learning Kanji the other day </connor>
<joey> and I came across Monogatari Kanji. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - For, is it Hanase or [indistinct]. </garnt>
<garnt> Which Kanji is it. </garnt>
<garnt> The one where you... </garnt>
<joey> It's like to speak or to
tell a tale is like a- </joey>
<joey> - [indistinct] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [indistinct] one of the
meetings is to tell a tale. </joey>
<joey> - Is to tell a tale. </joey>
<connor> - And so it's like a- </connor>
<joey> - Monogatari just means thing tale. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct chatter) </joey>
<connor> - I saw it and I was like,
"That's pretty cool." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, cause that's the thing
with the Monogatari Series. </joey>
<connor> That even the titles
are a play on the words. </connor>
<connor> Because Bakemono, and Monogatari
is two different words. </connor>
<garnt> And he just mashes
those two words together </garnt>
<garnt> to just turn it into one thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the brilliant
subtlety of Nisio Isin. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna say the whole thing, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I wanna save them for our video. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was gonna ask, how is it
reading the lighting novel </garnt>
<joey> compared to watching the anime? </joey>
<garnt> Cause that's something I've
always been curious about. </garnt>
<garnt> How well the anime has been
able to translate his writing </garnt>
<garnt> into a visual a format. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that's the one
thing I love about Shaft. </joey>
<connor> Is that they do hold this
really weird appreciation </connor>
<connor> for Nisio Isin's writing. </connor>
<connor> And that's why Anadagi's
monologues are way longer </connor>
<garnt> than any anime monologue should be. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> - There were so much... </garnt>
<joey> That why its so dialogy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I just remember being like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck, can we just end." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a standard Monogatari episode </joey>
<connor> is like 95% dialogue. </connor>
<connor> But it needs to be because everything </connor>
<connor> that Nisio Isin writes is
so important to the story </connor>
<connor> because it is really convoluted. </connor>
<connor> And it does add a lot of character. </connor>
<garnt> And and you know if you've
seen Monogatari episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> You know how every now and then </garnt>
<connor> there were just these
flashing images of texts. </connor>
<joey> That's all texts ripped
straight out of the novels. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I was really
confused that would happen. </connor>
<connor> I was confused a lot during
every series of the Monogatari. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is confusing. </connor>
<joey> I'm very surprised how big Monogatari got. </joey>
<joey> - Same. </joey>
<joey> - I remember when I first watched it </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "This breaks basically
every rule of filmmaking </connor>
<connor> convention that I know." </connor>
<connor> It was like oh show don't
tell, and Monogatari </connor>
<connor> is like, "How about we tell everything." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And show basically nothing. </connor>
<connor> And you're just gonna enjoy
this 20 minute long dialogue </connor>
<connor> And it turns out amazing. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Why does this work?" </connor>
<connor> I have never seen something
work so eloquently </connor>
<connor> as the Monogatari Series. </connor>
<garnt> And what surprised me
is that it just became </garnt>
<joey> for the Otaku culture back then, </joey>
<joey> it kind of became a cultural phenomenon. </joey>
<joey> - It did, especially in Japan because, </joey>
<joey> it was just unlike anything. </joey>
<joey> And I mean, Katanagatari
in a sense as well. </joey>
<connor> - I was gonna say, if I was a betting man, </connor>
<joey> I would have put them on
Katanagatari being way bigger than- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's kind of weird that in the West, </garnt>
<garnt> it was the other way around. </garnt>
<garnt> People still don't really
watch I think Katanagatari </garnt>
<garnt> because of maybe it's like... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why you can
watch it other than illegally. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've no idea how- </connor>
<connor> - You have to buy a $400 Blue Ray I think. </connor>
<connor> - Such a shame. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's an absolute banger of a show. </connor>
<garnt> - It is fucking great. </garnt>
<joey> - So good. </joey>
<connor> - Fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - It's got nothing to do
with the Monogatari Series. </connor>
<connor> Just so you know. </connor>
<connor> - It's a good thing, honestly. </connor>
<connor> - Recently there was an OVA adaptation </connor>
<connor> of the first novel that
Nisio Isin ever wrote. </connor>
<connor> I forgot what it's called. </connor>
<connor> Its Kubikiri Cycle. </connor>
<connor> That's what it's called. </connor>
<connor> There was a four episode
OVA of it that came out. </connor>
<garnt> And I was okay, it's Nisio Isin, </garnt>
<garnt> it's essentially the series </garnt>
<garnt> that inspired the Monogatari Series. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, "This has to be big." </garnt>
<garnt> Of course every morning
guitar fan is gonna watch it. </garnt>
<joey> No one fucking watched that OVA. </joey>
<joey> And I was really sad, </joey>
<joey> because it is screaming Monogatari vibes. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird. </connor>
<connor> Cause I liked the Monogatari Series. </connor>
<joey> I don't know which part I got up to. </joey>
<joey> I watched a lot of it. </joey>
<joey> - It's like eight, nine seasons right now. </joey>
<connor> - It's just so fucking many bro. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like a monkey when I watch Anime. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I don't wanna
have to think about how </connor>
<connor> order and shit and what I'm
doing, just put something on. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> And sometimes I don't know what happened </connor>
<connor> in between the series sometimes. </connor>
<connor> Because it's so confusing. </connor>
<connor> There were so many times
where I would start a season </connor>
<connor> of one of that franchise. </connor>
<connor> I don't know which fucking one. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Am I on the right one,
or am I just confused, </connor>
<connor> because this series?" </connor>
<joey> - That is easily the most... </joey>
<connor> That is the number one question I get, </connor>
<connor> it's probably the most. </connor>
<connor> - What's the order? </connor>
<garnt> - What order should I watch
the Monogatari episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not even that complicated. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, but even though if you're watching </connor>
<connor> in the right order, it's
such a confusing show </connor>
<connor> that normally you can get
halfway into the first episode </connor>
<connor> of season two, right. </connor>
<garnt> You're like, "Is this season two. </garnt>
<connor> I really, I really don't
know what's going on." </connor>
<connor> Then I guess I didn't have any idea </connor>
<connor> what was going on the whole time. </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Is the Monogatari Series, one season </joey>
<connor> is already confusing enough as it is </connor>
<connor> in an enclosed story. </connor>
<connor> And when you look at it on
the grand scale of things </connor>
<connor> it's even more confusing because </connor>
<connor> basically Nisio Isin
pulled a Quentin Tarantino </connor>
<connor> Pulp Fiction. </connor>
<connor> Where everything is out of order, </connor>
<joey> but it's in the same universe. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't think it
matters that much, honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> As long as you just get the... </garnt>
<garnt> Just Google with the release order. </garnt>
<connor> You can't really go wrong. </connor>
<connor> - It's stressful though, man. </connor>
<connor> I've somehow fucked it up many times. </connor>
<connor> When I watch the [indistinct] Kishibe OVAs </connor>
<connor> for some reason Araki, when he wrote them </connor>
<garnt> gave them episode numbers in the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> So when you're watching the OVAs, </garnt>
<garnt> they don't do them in order and Araki </garnt>
<connor> never did them in order anyway, </connor>
<connor> if I remember correctly. </connor>
<connor> So you'll turn on episode
one, there'll be episode six. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "What? What do you mean?" </connor>
<connor> - Araki please stop. </connor>
<connor> - And you're like, "Space
bar. Fucking Google, </connor>
<garnt> Which episode is episode one?" </garnt>
<garnt> Episode one is episode six,
episode two is episode nine. </garnt>
<connor> Episode three is episode four. </connor>
<connor> And then you're like, "Why? </connor>
<connor> Why would you do this? </connor>
<connor> - They pulled a George
Lucas Star Wars right. </connor>
<connor> Episode four is the first one. </connor>
<joey> You have to understand. </joey>
<connor> - It goes episode four, five,
six, then it goes one, two- </connor>
<connor> - It's not even that, it's
just four, nine, two, seven. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Why". </connor>
<connor> - No it's like the... </connor>
<connor> No, just Haruhi Suzumiya. </connor>
<connor> Do you watch Haruhi
Suzumiya when it was airing? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So Haruhi Suzumiya had
this broadcast order. </connor>
<connor> And it was, it was for
absolutely no reason. </connor>
<connor> It was just broadcasted
in this random order. </connor>
<connor> And people were like.. </connor>
<connor> I remember when it was when it was airing, </connor>
<connor> people were like, "Oh
this is a genius move </connor>
<connor> because it's kind of like you're
piecing together the puzzle </connor>
<connor> each episode." </connor>
<connor> And now that it's all aired now, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure that
they edit out the order </connor>
<connor> because the fucking last
episode chronologically </connor>
<connor> was just the most anticlimactic episode </connor>
<connor> of the entire series. </connor>
<connor> So they're like, the best
episode is episode six. </connor>
<connor> - Mix it up, mix up. </connor>
<connor> - Just mix up the order. </connor>
<connor> And people are gonna
call that genius move. </connor>
<joey> It wasn't genius, Tanigawa
Nagaru was just on crack. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, was this the
original Japanese broadcast? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Out of order? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<joey> - Because Tanigawa Nagaru was on crack. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<joey> - I didn't know that. </joey>
<joey> See, I only watched it years after now. </joey>
<connor> I think we mentioned this before </connor>
<connor> but I watched the movie first by accident. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah </garnt>
<connor> - What a dumb mistake. </connor>
<garnt> - This, this guy, I think you
mentioned in episode zero. </garnt>
<connor> So most people have seen it. </connor>
<connor> This person watched </connor>
<connor> The Disappearance of
Haruhi Suzumiya first. </connor>
<garnt> Which is like, how do you do that. </garnt>
<connor> I was still less confused
watching that movie </connor>
<connor> than I was watching
most Monogatari series. </connor>
<connor> So if you don't know they made a movie </connor>
<connor> of the thing that tied
the whole Haruhi Suzumiya. </connor>
<joey> - It was The disappearance
of Suzumiya Haruhi </joey>
<joey> which is the fourth- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Novel. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why novel. </joey>
<joey> - I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> All I was is like... </joey>
<joey> I had just gotten into anime. </joey>
<joey> I wanted to watch the best
rated anime movie you know. </joey>
<joey> No one told me. </joey>
<joey> - And it still is the best move. </joey>
<connor> - No one told me that I
needed a backstory, you know? </connor>
<connor> And I went into it, I watched
it all and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow." </connor>
<garnt> - What did you think? </garnt>
<garnt> Did you think it was a good movie? </garnt>
<connor> - I thought it was shit,
cause I didn't know </connor>
<connor> what the fuck is happening. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - How can I think it's a good movie </connor>
<garnt> when I don't know anything. </garnt>
<connor> I remember being really annoyed with... </connor>
<connor> I bet Connor just watched
this, right after School Days. </connor>
<connor> And it was 10 out of 10, 10 out of 10. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is going on? </connor>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> - I think School Days was
what broke the camel's back. </connor>
<connor> It was definitely the
Haruhi Suzumiya movie </connor>
<connor> watching thing that
definitely made me think </connor>
<joey> reviews sucks. </joey>
<joey> - Have you gone back to watch
the movie since then or? </joey>
<connor> - No I haven't. </connor>
<joey> - You haven't. </joey>
<joey> - But you've seen the TV series now right? </joey>
<joey> - I watched watched the first
season of this TV series. </joey>
<connor> I got two episodes into
the second TV series </connor>
<connor> where they were repeating everything. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "No, not doing this." </connor>
<garnt> - I would say that Haruhi still
is very much worth watching </garnt>
<garnt> in this day and age
because of Disappearance. </garnt>
<garnt> Disappearance is still my- </garnt>
<connor> - Such a good movie. </connor>
<garnt> - It's probably my favorite
anime franchise film </garnt>
<garnt> of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree. </garnt>
<garnt> - And up there as one of
my favorite anime films </garnt>
<garnt> of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> And this guy apparently fucking hates it. </garnt>
<connor> - I think that the whole
series is kind of mediocre. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - The first season was just fine. </connor>
<connor> I was watching it and I was okay, </connor>
<connor> I know this is a terrible comparison </connor>
<connor> but I was just man this just
feels Toradora, but worse. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck are you talking about? </garnt>
<connor> There's zero romance in there. </connor>
<connor> - I know. </connor>
<garnt> - How? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the whole
setting reminded me so much </garnt>
<connor> of Toradora and the
way that it was set up. </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> That it was et in a school. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like every anime. </joey>
<garnt> - I know this is a completely
stupid opinion on my part. </garnt>
<connor> I recognize this is a garbage opinion, </connor>
<connor> but the whole time I was just like, </connor>
<connor> I guess cause it was just... </connor>
<connor> Okay, I was very bored a lot of time, </connor>
<connor> watching Haruhi Suzumiya. </connor>
<connor> The only thing that made me wanna watch it </connor>
<connor> was the fact that Crispin
Freeman, voiced Kyon. </connor>
<connor> - No that's the best part of it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, he was amazing. </garnt>
<connor> And it was a treat watching him. </connor>
<connor> - What you said is like saying, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, Anohana was kind of Another, </connor>
<connor> cause they have ghosts
in there or whatever. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a fair comparison Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I don't know cause... </garnt>
<garnt> - They both start with A-N. </garnt>
<garnt> - What show can you
compare Haruhi Suzumiya to. </garnt>
<connor> If you had to. </connor>
<connor> The closest comparison. </connor>
<garnt> - Here's the thing, Haruhi
Suzumiya inspired a lot of... </garnt>
<connor> I came after that huge... </connor>
<connor> I became an anime fan
after that huge thing </connor>
<connor> that had had its impact. </connor>
<connor> So I think I came into it
with zero attachment to it. </connor>
<joey> In any sense. </joey>
<joey> - Because I think the thing with Haruhi </joey>
<joey> that I find really interesting. </joey>
<joey> Is the fact that it's one of those anime </joey>
<connor> that is really weirdly tied to the period </connor>
<connor> that it came out in. </connor>
<connor> Much like Lucky Star I feel. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that's why I don't give a shit </connor>
<connor> about either of them. </connor>
<connor> - Because the thing is, I
fucking love both Lucky Star, </connor>
<connor> especially Lucky Star. </connor>
<connor> I think [indistinct] was fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> But the problem is that the
references in Lucky Star </connor>
<garnt> and the whole fact that
it really reflected </garnt>
<connor> the Otaku culture of the 2000s, </connor>
<connor> is what made that show really funny </connor>
<connor> in the mid 2000s </connor>
<connor> But, as much as I love Lucky Star, </connor>
<garnt> I can't really recommend
it to people today </garnt>
<garnt> because the scene has
just completely changed. </garnt>
<connor> - But does that mean you can recommend </connor>
<joey> Haruhi Suzumiya today? </joey>
<joey> - Yes, I can. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because- </garnt>
<connor> - I think I ruined it for myself. </connor>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> - You basically just watched the climax. </garnt>
<garnt> You watched the climax before
watching any of the buildup. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So now you just kind of
ruined it for yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I don't
feel bad for being like </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I think it's not that good." </garnt>
<connor> Because I'm like, "I know
I ruined it for myself </connor>
<joey> and it might've been good." </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> The only way to top that experience </connor>
<connor> is if you committed to reading
all of the light novel. </connor>
<connor> - I'll be dead if I read a light novel. </connor>
<garnt> I'm never reading a light novel. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did that, and the final,
final volume of Haruhi </garnt>
<garnt> was pretty fucking good. </garnt>
<joey> You just have to sit down
and read nine volumes man. </joey>
<connor> - I have no interest in
reading a light novel, ever. </connor>
<garnt> Because, I remember a lot
of the elements in Haruhi </garnt>
<garnt> have been done in other places now. </garnt>
<connor> Cause there's a lot of
self-referential humor in Haruhi </connor>
<connor> and how he, I remember what
that was an innovative thing. </connor>
<connor> Remember when every fucking light novel </connor>
<connor> wasn't trying to parody
every other light novel. </connor>
<connor> And now it's just gotten so fucking lazy </connor>
<garnt> with it's self-referential humor. </garnt>
<joey> - Again that's the whole
thing where it comes </joey>
<connor> to the time period. </connor>
<joey> - Damn, you guys because
sound anime boomers </joey>
<joey> we had it better back then. </joey>
<connor> You should have seen the animes we had. </connor>
<joey> - In '06 when Haruhi
and Lucky Star came out. </joey>
<garnt> As you said, the whole
self-referential thing. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think the whole
meta aspect of anime, </garnt>
<connor> was just so new. </connor>
<joey> I remember- </joey>
<joey> - It was such post-modernist. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It was so post-modern at the time. </joey>
<joey> - No, because I remember at the end </joey>
<joey> of every Lucky Star episode
while the credits were rolling </joey>
<joey> there was no ending song for Lucky Star. </joey>
<joey> What it was was it was the scenes </joey>
<joey> of all of the Lucky Star
characters in a karaoke booth. </joey>
<connor> But you were outside of the karaoke booth. </connor>
<connor> So you could only hear them. </connor>
<connor> But the conversations
that they were having </connor>
<connor> in the karaoke booth </connor>
<connor> weren't characters having a
conversation with characters </connor>
<connor> it was voice actresses
having a conversation </connor>
<connor> with voice actresses. </connor>
<connor> And people were like of course </connor>
<connor> they're voiced by voice actresses. </connor>
<connor> These aren't just characters on a screen. </connor>
<connor> They're real people. </connor>
<joey> And that meta was like,
that was fucking cool. </joey>
<joey> Cause no other anime did that. </joey>
<joey> You're laughing. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - He is laughing. </joey>
<connor> - You don't understand. </connor>
<connor> - You're gonna sit down, </connor>
<connor> and you're gonna respect this culture. </connor>
<connor> You're gonna respect this Conner. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I just don't care. </connor>
<connor> - It was cool back in the day. </connor>
<connor> - Back in the day, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I still think Meta
anime peaked Monogatari. </connor>
<connor> In terms of light novel shows, adaptations </connor>
<connor> it kind of peaked with Monogatari. </connor>
<connor> And there's been other good
light novel shows as well </connor>
<connor> that has been meta. </connor>
<connor> But I'd say, you know, Haruhi
really was the first time </connor>
<connor> I noticed it. </connor>
<connor> It was Haruhi and Lucky Star. </connor>
<connor> And then Monogatari was the
one that came afterwards </connor>
<joey> and then it kind of nothing out did it. </joey>
<joey> And now you see a lot
of lazy fucking attempts </joey>
<joey> at meta humor and meta jokes. </joey>
<joey> There was one anime I saw recently, </joey>
<joey> which was such an eye-rolling moment. </joey>
<joey> Is the the MILF Isekai
that aired last year. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone's favorite. </joey>
<joey> - It kind of marketed itself as a parody </joey>
<joey> of the Isekai genre. </joey>
<joey> Cause it's like, it's the Isekai genre. </joey>
<joey> But there's mom this time. </joey>
<joey> - It's different now. </joey>
<joey> - It's different cause
there's a mom this time. </joey>
<joey> And I remember there was one joke, okay. </joey>
<joey> They were in a hot Springs. </joey>
<joey> And there's this one sindorei
that's in the hot springs. </joey>
<joey> And then she stands up and she's naked </joey>
<joey> in front of the main character. </joey>
<connor> And then the main
character literally says, </connor>
<connor> "Ah, this is the scene where
you're about to hit me, right?" </connor>
<connor> And the sindorei goes, </connor>
<connor> "Ah, but how about if I don't hit you, </connor>
<connor> I bet you weren't
expecting that were you?" </connor>
<connor> And the main character
goes, "Ah, you're right. </connor>
<connor> I wasn't expecting that." </connor>
<connor> And the sindorei just goes off crying, </connor>
<connor> and that was the joke. </connor>
<joey> That was the joke. </joey>
<garnt> - I remember we had this
exact same conversation </garnt>
<connor> at the Isekai [indistinct] Video. </connor>
<connor> You were fucking fuming. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "This is not how
you write a meta joke." </connor>
<joey> You basically explained the
meta before you told the meta. </joey>
<connor> - First of all, I want all
my anime scenes acted out </connor>
<connor> by Garnt like that. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Second of all, I just like... </connor>
<connor> Whereas you said you tend
to watch the trash Isekai. </connor>
<connor> I could give less of a
fuck about the Isekai </connor>
<connor> that's coming out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm right there with you. </connor>
<joey> - It just iterates on itself
and then changes one thing. </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't be surprised if
there's another slime one, </joey>
<joey> except he's a green slime next. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, that's
gonna be the next thing. </joey>
<joey> - That's just season two. </joey>
<joey> - It's green. </joey>
<joey> I just struggle to give a
fuck about any of the Isekai. </joey>
<connor> I wanted to watch the mum
one just for the memes. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't even muster up to type it in. </connor>
<connor> - The thing is, it wasn't
even that good for the memes. </connor>
<connor> It was you saw the title. </connor>
<connor> You're like, "Haha I can
make a meme out of this." </connor>
<garnt> And then I did. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I watched two
episodes and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "No, I'm done." </garnt>
<connor> - Because I wanna watch these shows </connor>
<connor> so I can talk about them. </connor>
<connor> But then I realized now
maybe, I don't even know, </connor>
<connor> that six months after that show has aired </connor>
<joey> that meme is long dead. </joey>
<joey> And no one's going to mention. </joey>
<connor> - It's like by the time the
next season comes around </connor>
<connor> in three months time. </connor>
<joey> No one is fucking talking about it. </joey>
<connor> - And then maybe it would
be a factoid one day like, </connor>
<joey> "You watched the mom Isekai?" </joey>
<garnt> "Yeah," </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, okay." </garnt>
<connor> I mean you don't need to
watch it for any reason. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause for me watching trashy Isekai </garnt>
<connor> or just trash anime in general </connor>
<connor> cause apparently that's
my brand or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - It is. </connor>
<connor> - It's just the reason I do it </connor>
<connor> is because it's just
like, it's just the easy, </connor>
<connor> turn your brain off show of the season. </connor>
<connor> I have to be in a certain
mood to watch something </connor>
<connor> like Monogatari </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I can't just casually sit down
having my lunch or something. </connor>
<garnt> And like, "I'm gonna... </garnt>
<joey> - Monogatari is the antithesis of, </joey>
<garnt> "I'm just going to put something on." </garnt>
<joey> You don't put Monogatari on. </joey>
<joey> - Whereas whereas with the trash Isekai, </joey>
<garnt> I just sit down for lunch and
I just put it on, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> And I just don't have to
think, I watch it every week. </garnt>
<garnt> And those are the shows I end up watching. </garnt>
<garnt> Because they're the easiest watch. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I know what I'm getting into. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not being challenged. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This character's going
to do that, whatever." </garnt>
<joey> - How much of a brain dead
show can we make this season? </joey>
<connor> - Go on Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why I can watch them
because they are brain dead. </connor>
<connor> Because I don't have to think. </connor>
<connor> Because you know, sometimes
where you watch a good show. </connor>
<connor> And sometimes you just really
wanna be in that right mood </connor>
<connor> to watch something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, definitely. </connor>
<connor> - For something good. </connor>
<connor> - But with some, with the trash shows </connor>
<connor> I never have to be in a certain mood- </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - To watch it. </connor>
<connor> Which is why I've found I've watched </connor>
<connor> more trash shows because, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I get anxiety sometimes when- </connor>
<connor> - It's a good show. </connor>
<connor> - If it's a good show,
but I'm not in the mood. </connor>
<connor> Do you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Dude, what was the show? </garnt>
<connor> Keep Your Hands Off </connor>
<garnt> - Eizouken. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> That was one of those
shows where I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> "I can't just watch this." </joey>
<garnt> - You have to commit to it. </garnt>
<garnt> It seems such a passionate
thing where I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "I can't just, half-ass this." </connor>
<connor> I watched one episode,
and I liked what I saw. </connor>
<garnt> But because of that, </garnt>
<garnt> I just never watched episode two </garnt>
<garnt> because I had to be in
that mood to watch it. </garnt>
<joey> And I never was. </joey>
<joey> - It sucked because it
was really hard to stop </joey>
<joey> and then get back into it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and it sucks. </connor>
<joey> Cause I know that was a good show. </joey>
<joey> I know it was, but I
just, I didn't care enough </joey>
<connor> to find that time to be like, </connor>
<connor> I wanna keep watching this." </connor>
<connor> And I feel bad cause everyone was like, </connor>
<connor> "This is the best show of the season." </connor>
<connor> I'm just sitting there watching the 100th </connor>
<connor> documentary on Netflix, you know? </connor>
<garnt> Because- </garnt>
<garnt> - I have no time. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I've had that problem a lot
more with animate recently. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel you. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the reason. </connor>
<connor> - This is the fucking reason </connor>
<connor> I still haven't watched
Fullmetal Alchemist, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Because you it's good. </connor>
<connor> - I know it's good. </connor>
<connor> Because here's the thing, I can go years </connor>
<connor> without watching or
reading a manga of a series </connor>
<connor> that I know I'm going to love. </connor>
<joey> But I want to be in the right mood. </joey>
<joey> And it might take years. </joey>
<joey> It might take a fucking decade. </joey>
<joey> Last year, I finally
read 20th century boys. </joey>
<joey> And it went from, </joey>
<connor> I know I was gonna read this since </connor>
<connor> I basically started getting into manga. </connor>
<connor> This is I thought, one of my
favorite mangas of all time. </connor>
<connor> And it's fucking incredible. </connor>
<connor> But I had to wait, so many years </connor>
<connor> to experience it because
I just wanted to be </connor>
<connor> in that perfect zone to read it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm so glad I did. </connor>
<connor> Because there are some shows. </connor>
<connor> Do you have some shows that
you think if you re-watch it </connor>
<connor> you won't enjoy it as much. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because you're not in the same head space. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 100%. </connor>
<connor> - 90%, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Because I feel like,
I can never get behind </connor>
<joey> watching anime weekly. </joey>
<joey> - No, I can. </joey>
<joey> - I can't </joey>
<joey> - I can't. </joey>
<joey> - Because I'm always in a
different head space sometimes </joey>
<connor> when I'm watching a show. </connor>
<garnt> - No, okay, because there's some shows </garnt>
<connor> that transcend that. </connor>
<garnt> There's so hype. </garnt>
<garnt> - Such as? </garnt>
<joey> - Attack on Titan. </joey>
<joey> Watching that weekly was hype as fuck. </joey>
<joey> Every single week, no matter what, </joey>
<joey> that one day it came out. </joey>
<connor> I was hyped as shit for that show. </connor>
<joey> - Because I binged that whole series. </joey>
<connor> - It was such a good episode by episode </connor>
<connor> that even though it sucked. </connor>
<connor> It sucked to have to wait a week. </connor>
<connor> It was so good. </connor>
<connor> Cause that one day in the
week you've got a treat. </connor>
<connor> And it didn't matter how bad your mood was </connor>
<connor> or where your head space was at. </connor>
<connor> For 25 minutes, shut your brain off </connor>
<connor> and just have a fucking time. </connor>
<joey> - Man, I used to be able
to do that so easily </joey>
<joey> when I was in high school in uni. </joey>
<connor> - As well, joining in,
in the discourse online </connor>
<connor> talking about it. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel that's a different side </garnt>
<garnt> that I never got growing up with anime, </garnt>
<garnt> which is the social aspects. </garnt>
<connor> Because for me, it was just I watch a show </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "That was an amazing show." </connor>
<connor> And I have no one to talk to. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, same, same. </connor>
<garnt> - The social aspect has quickly become </garnt>
<garnt> one of my favorite
parts of watching anime. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's why, I caught up to
Demon Slayer on episode 19, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I wanted to get involved
with the social discourse. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause the memes are great. </garnt>
<garnt> I love memes. </garnt>
<connor> - The memes are great. </connor>
<garnt> - It's made us so, if a show
has a bad ending or something </garnt>
<connor> I still enjoy it because. </connor>
<connor> - The shit storm on Twitter. </connor>
<joey> - It's just the shit storm that follows. </joey>
<joey> - I like that shit. </joey>
<joey> - I remember when
Darling the Franxx ended. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> there was this shift at episode 18 or 20. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the exact episode. </connor>
<garnt> And then everyone lost their shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's not a good ending
but I had a blast watching it. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just realized something. </garnt>
<connor> I remember when Big Ed was a thing. </connor>
<garnt> Bear with me, this is gonna make sense. </garnt>
<connor> Big Ed from 90 Day Fiance was the thing. </connor>
<connor> It was great memes. </connor>
<connor> Fantastic. </connor>
<connor> I went to start watching 90
Day Fiance because of that. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "It's just not the same." </connor>
<connor> I was watching it. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, it's cause
I need the YouTube comments </connor>
<connor> for everything. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because it's one thing to
have a clip, it's funny. </connor>
<connor> But when there's just the perfect YouTube </connor>
<connor> thread roasting the shit out of it. </connor>
<garnt> It's so funny. </garnt>
<garnt> And also when someone's an in a TV show </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna be like, </garnt>
<joey> "Everyone else thinks this
guy's an asshole, right? </joey>
<joey> Let me go check the comments real quick." </joey>
<joey> Do you get this now where
you watch some YouTube videos </joey>
<joey> or clips from shows or YouTube video </joey>
<connor> where they do something in the clip </connor>
<connor> and that's the moment when
you open up the comments. </connor>
<connor> I hope everyone's talking about this. </connor>
<connor> And that's what I love
about watching anime weekly </connor>
<connor> is that you get that kind of, </connor>
<connor> everyone's gonna be
talking about that thing </connor>
<garnt> that just happened on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna be fun. </garnt>
<garnt> I love joining in on that. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you said. </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, go on." </connor>
<garnt> - Do you ever get personally offended </garnt>
<garnt> when you go on a YouTube video </garnt>
<connor> and then the comments are disabled? </connor>
<connor> Even if it's something you'd never wanted </connor>
<connor> to comment on or you never... </connor>
<connor> Most of it is anime trailers
of anime repeat sometimes. </connor>
<connor> I see the comments are disabled. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, I don't know
why, but I feel offended. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like, "You fucking pussies." </garnt>
<garnt> - I turn American for five seconds. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Free speech is dead. </garnt>
<connor> Where's my second- </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Going back to what you said earlier, </connor>
<connor> if you re-watch the show
not in the right head space. </connor>
<connor> I just, for some reason I was like </connor>
<connor> "I'm pretty sure if I re
watched Darker Than Black </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't think it's that good of a show. </connor>
<connor> - No, I agree with that. </connor>
<connor> - I remember really liking that show. </connor>
<joey> And I'm happy to leave that memory. </joey>
<connor> - There's a lot of shows like that. </connor>
<connor> There a lot of shows like that.. </connor>
<joey> Ergo Proxy for me is one of those. </joey>
<connor> - If I re watched a proxy. </connor>
<connor> I don't think I'd like it. </connor>
<joey> I don't think I'd it as much. </joey>
<joey> But when I watched it,
I was in that perfect- </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Angsty, big brain boy mode. </connor>
<connor> Where it's just like, yep. </connor>
<joey> There was a lot of shows </joey>
<garnt> that I'm just leaving in that bubble. </garnt>
<garnt> Where I'm, I'm happy to
talk about these shows, </garnt>
<connor> but I never want to re-watch them. </connor>
<garnt> - No, cause for me the one big
show for me is Katana Kyoukai </garnt>
<garnt> I watched it when I was like
in a really dark head space. </garnt>
<connor> - I watched this one with the blood sword. </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - That's that's Beyond the Boundary. </connor>
<joey> That's a different one. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I thought we were talking about </joey>
<joey> Beyond the Boundary. </joey>
<joey> What are we talking about? </joey>
<connor> - He said Beyond the Boundary. </connor>
<connor> It's Katana Kyoukai. </connor>
<garnt> It's Kyoukai no Katana
is Beyond the Boundary. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck is the
Japanese title of that?" </connor>
<joey> That's the one with the pink
haired girl in the glasses </joey>
<garnt> with the sword. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's about it's the
one with the assassin </garnt>
<connor> who has death eyes or whatever. </connor>
<connor> I was in a really dark head space </connor>
<connor> when I watched that. </connor>
<connor> - I've become a- </connor>
<connor> - No, it was one of those series that, </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna be that guy </garnt>
<garnt> but it was kind of life-changing for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, now we need to know. </connor>
<garnt> Please explain. </garnt>
<garnt> How has that changed your life? </garnt>
<garnt> - Please elaborate. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna get in
too much in the detail </connor>
<connor> but I was in a head space </connor>
<garnt> that I was like kind of the lowest </garnt>
<connor> I've ever been in my life. </connor>
<garnt> And then I watched this series </garnt>
<garnt> and it connected with me on a level </garnt>
<garnt> that nothing else could at the time. </garnt>
<connor> And it kind of really
changed my perception </connor>
<connor> of the world and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> And because of it, it's
one of my favorite anime </connor>
<connor> of all the time. </connor>
<connor> But because I'm not in the same head space </connor>
<connor> that I am now that I was back then. </connor>
<connor> I'm so fucking terrified
of re watching it. </connor>
<connor> Cause if I re watch it, </connor>
<connor> and I just don't get that same connection. </connor>
<connor> Then I'm like... </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna lose that. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna lose what
that series gave to me </connor>
<connor> at that time of my life. </connor>
<connor> And that's the one
series, that I really hold </connor>
<connor> really close to me. </connor>
<connor> And another series is actually Evangelion. </connor>
<connor> Because Evangelion, I think is one show </connor>
<connor> that is just infinitely re watchable. </connor>
<connor> Because, very time that
I've watched Evangelion, </connor>
<garnt> I've got a different experience out of it. </garnt>
<joey> - I 100% agree with that. </joey>
<garnt> - I watched it first time
when it came out on Netflix. </garnt>
<joey> First time ever watching it. </joey>
<connor> - How'd you find it? </connor>
<connor> - It was good. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I think because
it was the mega hype show </connor>
<connor> that it was. </connor>
<connor> I think you go in expecting too much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I was always
happy with what I got. </connor>
<connor> It was just very confusing. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's on Anno Hideaki for you. </connor>
<garnt> - He was great. </garnt>
<joey> And I liked how he built the world </joey>
<connor> as a very, very terrifying one. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like a lot of
animators struggle to do that. </connor>
<connor> And a truly terrifying one. </connor>
<joey> - Do you have that one
anime, that as Garnt said </joey>
<joey> is life-changing for you? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, we spoke about it last episode, </connor>
<connor> which fucked up the recording by the way. </connor>
<connor> But Bokurano is definitely
one of those shows </connor>
<connor> that I think definitely changed. </connor>
<connor> Because again, I think
it was a similar thing </connor>
<connor> where I was at a point where </connor>
<connor> I think I was really confused
with what I wanted in my life. </connor>
<connor> And it really helped ground me a lot, </connor>
<connor> and really understand a lot of emotions </connor>
<connor> that I was perhaps feeling. </connor>
<garnt> - Can we re-talk about Bokurano, </garnt>
<connor> because I want the audience
to know about Bokurano. </connor>
<joey> - Not enough people have
seen Bokurano unfortunately. </joey>
<connor> - It's one of those shows where, </connor>
<garnt> it's not the best show, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a very important one </garnt>
<garnt> that I think people should watch. </garnt>
<connor> And I don't know how to
describe that eloquently. </connor>
<joey> - It's very disturbing but not </joey>
<joey> for the conventional
reason for being disturbed. </joey>
<garnt> - What Bokurano is about is,
there's these group of kids </garnt>
<connor> - This is going to sound
awesome by the way. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Because it sounds like
an Evangelion rip off. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It really does. </connor>
<connor> - Because there's these group of kids </connor>
<connor> and then, I think they were
on a school trip or something. </connor>
<connor> - They're on a school trip. </connor>
<garnt> - All I remember is they find his cave </garnt>
<garnt> with a talking head or something that. </garnt>
<connor> - No, so there's a guy in a cave </connor>
<garnt> and he's a middle-aged man
working on a PC in a cave. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really weird set up. </garnt>
<joey> And he basically asked them,
"Do you wanna play a game?" </joey>
<connor> - Would you to play a game? </connor>
<joey> - Which, you know, anyone
asking you that ever </joey>
<joey> with a bunch of kids is
an immediate no, no, no. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then I think they all
get on a scale or something. </connor>
<connor> They all take turns, he measures them. </connor>
<garnt> Then whatever happens. </garnt>
<garnt> And then suddenly they go outside </garnt>
<connor> or happens later on in that evening. </connor>
<connor> Because they were all... </connor>
<connor> We get to know these
characters a little bit. </connor>
<connor> There's how many kids is there? </connor>
<garnt> 12. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like 12, 13. </garnt>
<garnt> Something that around that many kids. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they get teleported
into this huge mech </garnt>
<connor> and there's a scary floating
head that's talking to them. </connor>
<connor> And one of the children
has to pilot the Mech. </connor>
<connor> And now we're going to go
into spoil this, a little bit. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, it's it's episode one. </connor>
<connor> So I'm going to spoil the
premise a little bit to you. </connor>
<connor> So one of the kids, pilots, the mech, </connor>
<connor> and they're finding another mech. </connor>
<connor> And it's to save the
world that they're told </connor>
<connor> before this floating head character. </connor>
<connor> - A very intimidating character. </connor>
<connor> They win the battle. </connor>
<connor> Hooray, they all win they all
celebrate and they go outside. </connor>
<connor> They stand on the mech </connor>
<connor> and then one of the kids just drops dead </connor>
<garnt> and falls off the mech. </garnt>
<connor> Then they find out that each
time this mech comes back </connor>
<garnt> and they're summoned, </garnt>
<connor> one of the kids has to pilots the mech. </connor>
<connor> And when they do, they're
gonna, die immediately after </connor>
<connor> but it's to save the world. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and what the
real beauty of this show </garnt>
<garnt> isn't really the mech
battles or the make fights. </garnt>
<connor> It's more of the fact that these kids </connor>
<connor> who have to pilot the
mech to save the world. </connor>
<connor> It's basically kind of
a monster that we show. </connor>
<connor> Every week a new monster comes along. </connor>
<connor> And the new kid, another
kid from that group </connor>
<connor> has to pilot the mech. </connor>
<connor> But it's about the backstory
of each of the kids. </connor>
<garnt> And just having to deal with the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that they're gonna die. </garnt>
<garnt> They're just going to die. </garnt>
<joey> - And in really realistic ways as well. </joey>
<joey> These characters are very believable. </joey>
<connor> - It makes me uncomfortable,
even thinking back </connor>
<garnt> to the emotions it brought out to me. </garnt>
<garnt> I get very... </garnt>
<connor> It's a really, really brutally honest look </connor>
<connor> into the human condition and life. </connor>
<connor> And especially how, you
know, a lot of these kids </connor>
<connor> from a lot of different backgrounds. </connor>
<connor> Some of them have it easier. </connor>
<connor> I remember there's a one
kid who's the stereotypical </connor>
<connor> piece of shit. </connor>
<garnt> His that spoiled.. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - But there's some of the kids who, </connor>
<connor> I think there's one kid
who's 16 or whatever. </connor>
<connor> And he's looking after his two siblings. </connor>
<connor> It's brutal, because he's
the one who's raising </connor>
<connor> his two sisters, I think. </connor>
<connor> It's horrible, seeing
him after come to terms </connor>
<connor> with that he's not gonna be
able to look after his sister. </connor>
<garnt> It's really brutal. </garnt>
<connor> It's something that just
disturbs you on a level </connor>
<connor> that you can't really describe. </connor>
<joey> It's so raw, it's so realistic. </joey>
<joey> No filters whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> - It's something that
really was not many people </joey>
<garnt> have watched. </garnt>
<garnt> It's something that was
really glossed over. </garnt>
<connor> It's uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> It's really uncomfortable
to have to sit down </connor>
<joey> and sit through. </joey>
<joey> - I admit, I definitely did not watch it </joey>
<connor> when it first came out. </connor>
<connor> I definitely gave it some time. </connor>
<joey> - It'd definitely not a, "Yo,
you watched the last episode?" </joey>
<connor> - Cause I think the problem with Bokurano, </connor>
<connor> and the reason why </connor>
<connor> so many people didn't
watch it when it came out, </connor>
<connor> is because the way that they marketed it, </connor>
<connor> was not that good, not that accurate. </connor>
<connor> A lot of people are like, </connor>
<connor> "It's a mecha. </connor>
<joey> Must just being Evangelion rip off." </joey>
<connor> - There's no world where
it's the number one anime. </connor>
<garnt> cause it's just too uncomfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It also came out in the time period. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I think it was
the early to mid 2000s. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was. </garnt>
<connor> - where there was just so
many Evangelion rip offs. </connor>
<connor> They they're of varying quality as well. </connor>
<connor> There's another show that
I fucking love as well, </connor>
<connor> which is Rahxephon. </connor>
<connor> - That's just an Evangelion rip off. </connor>
<joey> - I have no idea what that is. </joey>
<joey> - It's an Evangelion rip off
but it's still really good. </joey>
<joey> - It's really good. </joey>
<joey> It's totally rips off,
but it goes about it </joey>
<connor> in a totally different
way from Evangelion. </connor>
<connor> Bokurano also sits in this
category of just shows </connor>
<connor> that people have really looked over. </connor>
<connor> Cause the premise alone
sounds an Evangelion rip off. </connor>
<connor> - It does, it does. </connor>
<connor> But the way they go about it
is just absolutely harrowing. </connor>
<connor> Just seeing these stories of these kids </connor>
<connor> who have to come to terms
with their own mortality. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's a fucking tragedy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> - It's different from Evangelion. </connor>
<connor> Evangelion to me is just
Anno's raw cry for help. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone's analyzed last
two episodes of Evangelion. </connor>
<connor> I think it's going back to that meme </connor>
<connor> about the blue curtain. </connor>
<garnt> I'm fucking sure that
Ano had no fucking clue </garnt>
<joey> what he was doing. </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone is like, "Oh, okay,
the way that these lines move </garnt>
<connor> and the way that it's very sketchy, </connor>
<connor> is like really reflective
on Shinji's mental state." </connor>
<connor> Meanwhile, Ano is just like, </connor>
<joey> "We didn't have much of a budget. </joey>
<garnt> just wanna put that out there." </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I love about Evangelion. </garnt>
<garnt> Because everyone comes out of Evangelion </garnt>
<joey> with something different. </joey>
<garnt> Because his message was so raw </garnt>
<garnt> and he puts so much of
himself into the series. </garnt>
<garnt> That it's impossible
not to come out with it </garnt>
<joey> feeling something. </joey>
<joey> - I love how with Evangelion
especially that I don't know </joey>
<joey> if it's just Anno is
just trolling like crazy. </joey>
<connor> But there were moments where
the Evangelion fan base </connor>
<connor> and the super hardcore
analysts, Evangelion </connor>
<connor> are just so committed to this idea of </connor>
<connor> everything in Evangelion,
every piece of imagery. </connor>
<garnt> Everything has to have a meaning, </garnt>
<connor> that I remember when Anno
finally came out in an interview </connor>
<connor> about the meaning behind Evangelion </connor>
<connor> and he just straight up
said, there is no meaning. </connor>
<connor> It's just the show I wanted to make. </connor>
<connor> And people were like, "But
what about the fact that </connor>
<connor> every time the angels die
it turns into a cross. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "I just
thought that looked cool." </connor>
<connor> And all the analysts are
like, "No, no he's lying. </connor>
<connor> There has to be a meaning behind it." </connor>
<joey> if the creator says there's no meaning, </joey>
<joey> there's no meaning, bro. </joey>
<connor> - What's Occam's razor
where the simplest solution- </connor>
<connor> - The simplest solution
is the best solution. </connor>
<connor> - Is normally the actual solution. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And even though he indefinitely </joey>
<connor> made me uncomfortable and feel bad </connor>
<connor> for a lot of the characters. </connor>
<connor> Bokurano just went way deeper. </connor>
<connor> - I'd say Evangelion isn't from a story. </connor>
<connor> - They're not even remotely similar. </connor>
<connor> - It's not even remotely similar. </connor>
<connor> Bokurano, I feel like
has more of a structure </connor>
<connor> around its plots. </connor>
<connor> Where Evangelion just ended on this, </connor>
<connor> as I said, raw cry for help from Anno. </connor>
<connor> But Bokurano was definitely </connor>
<garnt> here's a group of kids
dealing with something </garnt>
<garnt> that's very very uncomfortable </garnt>
<garnt> and you're going to feel
fucking awful watching the show. </garnt>
<connor> It's not even the worst part
that kids are gonna die. </connor>
<joey> It's like, sometimes it's
their backstories are horrific. </joey>
<joey> And I'm not gonna say it,
because I don't wanna spoil it </joey>
<joey> because it's a really good one. </joey>
<joey> But there was one episode in particular. </joey>
<joey> And after I finished it, </joey>
<joey> it was one of the things
where I had to like </joey>
<garnt> just sit there for five minutes </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, "Fuck, fuck." </garnt>
<connor> I don't know if you can
remember all the episodes. </connor>
<connor> There's one or two plots. </connor>
<connor> One of the stories, where I was just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Fuck, Jesus Christ." </garnt>
<garnt> It was right at the end. </garnt>
<joey> It was the episode. </joey>
<connor> Then you think that you
expected everything, right? </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's what I love though
about these human drama shows. </joey>
<connor> Is that sometimes they may
just be the simplest thing </connor>
<connor> of just a story between
two people or one person. </connor>
<connor> But if it's done really well, it can be </connor>
<joey> some of the most powerful storytelling. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's more
relatable than most things. </connor>
<connor> And it's really uncomfortable to think </connor>
<connor> that you could be in a situation where </connor>
<connor> you have to come to terms with your death. </connor>
<joey> That's why I'll say this
till the end of time, </joey>
<garnt> but like that's the whole
reason why my favorite </garnt>
<joey> [indistinct] of all time is Inio Asano. </joey>
<garnt> - I was gonna say, the one series </garnt>
<garnt> the one manga series
that I'm still waiting on </garnt>
<garnt> to be in the right head space
to read is Oyasumi Punpun. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct chatter) </garnt>
<connor> Because I've read that, I've
re-read that two or three times </connor>
<connor> all the way through, and
every time, I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh no." </garnt>
<connor> That's the only way it's just, "Oh, no." </connor>
<connor> Because it's just so... </connor>
<connor> It's not just Punpun as well. </connor>
<connor> Inio Asano is just so good
at writing these characters </connor>
<connor> that are just so believable. </connor>
<connor> And it's really disturbing
when you see these characters, </connor>
<connor> these very believable characters. </connor>
<connor> Run into these very believable
and horrifying situations. </connor>
<connor> And you're just ah. </connor>
<connor> If this isn't based off
a real person's life, </connor>
<connor> then that's just scary in it of itself. </connor>
<connor> Because this guy can
just think of stuff this. </connor>
<joey> And present it in a way
that is just so terrifying. </joey>
<connor> - When people are like, </connor>
<connor> man Danganrompa is really despairful. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Please shut the fuck up." </connor>
<connor> It's called pink blood for fuck sake. </connor>
<connor> Real despair is uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> Danganronpa is not fucking uncomfortable. </connor>
<garnt> Sorry, I know that I- </garnt>
<connor> - For my wife who died. </connor>
<connor> - You probably pissed off </connor>
<garnt> so many Danganronpa fans about now. </garnt>
<connor> - When you see these characters </connor>
<connor> they're about to die in
Danganronpa, it's like </connor>
<connor> who the fuck gives a shit? </connor>
<garnt> - I feel that there are certain levels. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause everything the series
that we've talked about, </garnt>
<connor> it's just like... </connor>
<connor> It hits you. </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna say it
but it hits different. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - A reason why you should watch this. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're like me, I'm a person who avoids </garnt>
<garnt> these kinds of shows the plague. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I cry at anything. </garnt>
<garnt> I cry at Dekuo when he
says anything [indistinct]. </garnt>
<garnt> When Dekuo screams even a little bit. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in tears. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, it's a human reaction. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll cry at anything. </garnt>
<garnt> So I normally just watch shows </garnt>
<joey> that I can turn my brain
off to, because I don't </joey>
<garnt> want to have to get into, "Oh
fuck sake, I'm feeling it." </garnt>
<joey> - I'm really scared
now, I really just want- </joey>
<connor> Now that you've said that, </connor>
<joey> I really want you to read an Inio Asano. </joey>
<connor> - I will, I know it's gonna ruin me, </connor>
<joey> and that's why I stay away from it, </joey>
<connor> but please watch Bokurano
you will not regret it. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, if you're in
the right head space </garnt>
<connor> for that kind of show. </connor>
<garnt> Cause you know, when you
have social barriers up </garnt>
<garnt> and you see something
that's sad or something. </garnt>
<joey> It's yeah, you feel sad, you cry whatever. </joey>
<joey> But there are some shows </joey>
<joey> that you don't know whether
you wanna cry or just lie down. </joey>
<connor> and just disappear. </connor>
<garnt> - [All] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Because there's plenty of romance shows </connor>
<connor> that have really left me kind of very sad. </connor>
<garnt> But it's a different feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a different feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> - Golden Week made me very
sad a lot of the time. </garnt>
<connor> Is that what it's called the Golden Week. </connor>
<connor> - Golden Time. </connor>
<connor> - Golden time, whatever yeah. </connor>
<connor> Golden Time, sorry. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, I'm an ape. </connor>
<connor> I liked Golden Time a lot. </connor>
<garnt> And it made me very sad. </garnt>
<garnt> Very upset a lot of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's just like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't leave that feeling like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh man, there's no hope anymore." </connor>
<joey> - I felt the same way when
I watched Sakurasou as well. </joey>
<connor> Because that seems like all like, </connor>
<connor> Yeah, you know, cute kids in
a room just rolling stuff. </connor>
<connor> But some of the backstories
of some of these characters </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Fuck man." </connor>
<connor> That's the only way I can describe it. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, "Fuck man." </connor>
<connor> That's just sad dude. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, as you said. </connor>
<joey> It's sadness and despair, </joey>
<joey> are just two totally different emotions. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause it's kind of those
kinds of shows where, </garnt>
<connor> I use those, it changed my life kind of. </connor>
<connor> Which is really corny when you say it. </connor>
<connor> But it's just one of those
shows where you finish </connor>
<connor> and you just sit down and you
just stare at a blank wall </connor>
<connor> and you're like, "Whoa." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's the big sigh, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's the big sigh. </connor>
<garnt> - It's the big sigh of </garnt>
<connor> - You can't even listen
to the ending song. </connor>
<connor> Shit, I can't even listen to this shit. </connor>
<connor> I need to be in silence right now. </connor>
<connor> I remember being very sad
and having a similar feeling </connor>
<connor> watching BoJack Horseman. </connor>
<connor> And it taps in the same areas. </connor>
<joey> I know you're laughing. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> By the way last time we recorded this, </joey>
<joey> I said an analogy where Bokurano, right? </joey>
<joey> - The most amazing analogy. </joey>
<joey> - Bokurano to sum it up to you. </joey>
<joey> If you're familiar with BoJack Horseman. </joey>
<connor> Bokurano is imagine if
BoJack Horseman had 12 kids </connor>
<connor> and they were all equally as
fucked up as BoJack Horseman. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - And then they all had to get sacrificed </connor>
<connor> and you slowly got to hear the
backstory of these fucked up </connor>
<connor> BoJack Horseman, children. </connor>
<connor> It's so fucked up. </connor>
<connor> It's different because in
BoJack it's his own fault right. </connor>
<connor> Its all that and whatever. </connor>
<joey> It's very, very sad, okay. </joey>
<joey> It hits differently. </joey>
<connor> And I hate it. </connor>
<joey> - This episode of Trash Taste
is sponsored by Express VPN. </joey>
<connor> - Wow, we've changed shirts, Joey. </connor>
<connor> How amazing. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I'm here to tell you
today about Express VPN. </connor>
<connor> Now I'm sure a lot of you are thinking, </connor>
<connor> "Connor, I use incognito mode. </connor>
<connor> The FBI can't see me, and you'd be wrong </connor>
<connor> in thinking that. </connor>
<garnt> - Wow, call me out this Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - I thought incognito mode is safe me. </connor>
<connor> Wrong. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't save. </connor>
<connor> You only Express VPN can save
you and your browsing history. </connor>
<connor> As a lot of these websites can still see </connor>
<connor> your browsing history, or
your internet service provider </connor>
<connor> can see what websites you're visiting </connor>
<connor> because of your IP address. </connor>
<connor> And honestly, that's
why I never get online </connor>
<connor> Without Express VPN. </connor>
<joey> - Also the good thing
about Express VPN is that </joey>
<joey> you can bypass geo restrictions. </joey>
<joey> So say for example, I
wanna go onto Netflix </joey>
<joey> and watch I don't know Harry Potter </joey>
<joey> but it's not available
on Japanese Netflix. </joey>
<garnt> So what do I do? </garnt>
<joey> I tap on Express VPN. </joey>
<joey> I reroute it to the US
Netflix and boom, there it is. </joey>
<garnt> All of Harry Potter. </garnt>
<joey> Because sometimes I don't
want to watch anime. </joey>
<joey> I wanna watch some goddamn Harry Potter. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<garnt> Good thing is, if it doesn't
matter if you're on Verizon </garnt>
<garnt> or Comcast or whatever ISP you're on. </garnt>
<garnt> Express VPN will hide all the information </garnt>
<joey> and all the traffic that routes </joey>
<garnt> through your router from them. </garnt>
<garnt> So even the ISPs can't
see your browsing history. </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing is, it runs so
smoothly that most of the time </garnt>
<garnt> you don't even realize that
you have to Express VPN on. </garnt>
<joey> And the best thing is
express VPN is available </joey>
<joey> on all devices. </joey>
<joey> Of course, the computer, mobile phones, </joey>
<joey> tablets, you name it. </joey>
<joey> - So you can predict your
online internet safety today </joey>
<joey> by using the number one
rated VPN service out there </joey>
<joey> by going to expressvpn.com/trashtaste </joey>
<joey> to get three months free
off of your subscription. </joey>
<connor> - That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S vpn.com/trashtaste </connor>
<connor> Yes, I'm reading this from my phone, </connor>
<connor> just in case I get the spelling wrong. </connor>
<joey> - Expressvpn.com/trashtaste to learn more, </joey>
<joey> links in the description below. </joey>
<garnt> - Back to the video. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I think one of
the series that I watched </garnt>
<garnt> that just hit really deep is this </garnt>
<joey> four episodes OVA based on this novel </joey>
<joey> called No Longer Human. </joey>
<joey> Which is a classic
Japanese novel, I think. </joey>
<joey> (speaking in Japanese) </joey>
<joey> - That is probably one
of the most harrowing </joey>
<joey> things that I've watched. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never heard about that. </garnt>
<joey> What does it about? </joey>
<joey> - It's written by this
guy called Dazai Osamu, </joey>
<garnt> who is considered one of the three greats </garnt>
<garnt> in traditional Japanese literature. </garnt>
<garnt> He was a guy from- </garnt>
<garnt> - The big three. </garnt>
<joey> - He was. </joey>
<connor> He was the big three. </connor>
<connor> - So what's the story about in this one. </connor>
<garnt> - It's been a while since I've watched it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm not sure if it's his autobiography </garnt>
<joey> or if it's based on his life story. </joey>
<joey> - It's based on his life story I believe. </joey>
<joey> - So it's just based on this life story </joey>
<joey> about this guy </joey>
<joey> who just keeps taking L's man. </joey>
<connor> Imagine if you just take
L's your entire life </connor>
<connor> and you're just looking for that one win. </connor>
<connor> But no, he just keeps coming out. </connor>
<connor> You just keep taking L's your entire life. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like The Joker. </connor>
<connor> I'm joking, I'm joking. </connor>
<connor> This guy just gets more and more depressed </connor>
<connor> as his life goes on. </connor>
<connor> Because it is based on his life story. </connor>
<connor> So this character, it's someone
who's clinically depressed. </connor>
<connor> And he's so depressed that, </connor>
<connor> you know he tries taking
his life multiple times. </connor>
<connor> With you know, a woman that he's been with </connor>
<connor> or just people that he finds. </connor>
<connor> And then he just keeps living. </connor>
<connor> Which is actually true. </connor>
<joey> The author tried committing
suicide several times </joey>
<joey> and then he succeeded. </joey>
<joey> He actually succeeded. </joey>
<joey> - He drowned himself. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so that's the head space </joey>
<connor> of the author who wrote this. </connor>
<connor> And the story. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, so he died? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> After finishing this story. </joey>
<joey> - This was the last novel he wrote </joey>
<garnt> before he drowned himself. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the most- </garnt>
<connor> - That's one long suicide note then. </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause it's just a raw peek
into the head space of someone- </garnt>
<connor> - This is our most depressing episode. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<joey> - I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> - It's really good though. </joey>
<joey> It's a really good piece
of literature though. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's just
based on his life story </joey>
<joey> and all the shitty things
that happens to him. </joey>
<joey> And then it ends with
just, you think he's found </joey>
<joey> this Ray of hope, right? </joey>
<joey> You think he's found his Ray of hope </joey>
<joey> and then he just gets shit on once again. </joey>
<connor> Imagine if someone has
stage four leukemia. </connor>
<connor> And then you just find
out he has AIDS as well. </connor>
<connor> And then he gets picked on. </connor>
<connor> I then you just kick on his- </connor>
<joey> - It just keeps going. </joey>
<joey> - How it ends is that he's so... </joey>
<joey> He doesn't even think that... </joey>
<joey> If he committed suicide
that's not even the right way </joey>
<joey> to end it. </joey>
<joey> It's called No Longer Human </joey>
<joey> because he feels like... </joey>
<joey> He's so low that he's No Longer Human. </joey>
<joey> He no longer is in this human world. </joey>
<joey> And it is the most harrowing thing. </joey>
<joey> I've used harrowing a
lot because I don't know, </joey>
<joey> - It's the only way to describe- </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - You're essentially reading the fall. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<connor> That sounds like a lot. </connor>
<connor> - It's brutal. </connor>
<connor> - It's the only way to describe it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I like those experiences, </connor>
<joey> but like you said earlier you have to be </joey>
<garnt> in the right head space. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I feel like, I don't
know if you go into it, </garnt>
<joey> already pretty up, you're
not feeling too great. </joey>
<connor> It's not gonna do great
for your mental health. </connor>
<joey> - I think the one problem
as well with No Longer Human </joey>
<joey> and the reason why probably
not a lot of people </joey>
<joey> know about it, </joey>
<joey> is that not just because
of it's subject matter, </joey>
<garnt> but just the fact that anime
fans today know Daza Osamu </garnt>
<garnt> for one Bungo Stray Dogs character. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true isn't it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and people are
like, "Dazai, yeah he was </garnt>
<garnt> my husband Bungo Stray Dogs." </garnt>
<connor> Not knowing that the real Dazai </connor>
<connor> was the most depressed
fucking author in probably </connor>
<connor> all of Japanese literature. </connor>
<connor> And he wrote some, not
just No Longer Human </connor>
<connor> but he wrote some amazing
pieces of literature. </connor>
<connor> Just because again, he based
it so much on his real life </connor>
<connor> and the fact that he was just
fucking depressed as hell. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause I feel you have
to be in that head space </garnt>
<connor> to write something that
powerful or just that raw, </connor>
<garnt> that just hits and just cuts that deeply. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like an Edgar Allan Poe Situation. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't write dark poetry like that </garnt>
<connor> unless you had a fucked
up life growing up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it feels spoiled, you know. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> I don't have anything to worry about. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry to bring a downer to this episode. </connor>
<connor> People even watch less. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<joey> - But bottom line is that, you know, </joey>
<joey> regardless of the that we did talk about </joey>
<connor> a lot of light depressing
pieces of literature and media, </connor>
<connor> just because it puts you down </connor>
<connor> at the end of the day, it doesn't mean </connor>
<connor> it's something that
people should skip over. </connor>
<connor> I think that it's equally as important </connor>
<joey> to experience those kinds
of anime and literature. </joey>
<connor> - I like to do that,
so that I'm comfortable </connor>
<connor> with having those
emotions pop up sometimes. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I have at
least some experience </connor>
<connor> dealing with them. </connor>
<connor> Maybe when someone
else's it's a lot easier. </connor>
<connor> But if you do get to
that point where you are </connor>
<garnt> starting to feel that, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay I kind of understand
where this is coming from." </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I know better how to process it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, a questions for you
guys going off this then </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a bit less depressing. </garnt>
<garnt> Has there been any shows or any anime </garnt>
<connor> in your history that has
affected you in any way? </connor>
<connor> Not just in the negative
aspects obviously, </connor>
<connor> or just rethinking life, but just- </connor>
<connor> - Black Butler- </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - You definitely has a
rethink life after that one. </connor>
<garnt> - I think for me, as much
as I hate to use the word </garnt>
<garnt> changed my life. </garnt>
<connor> For me was, and this is
gonna sound cliche as fuck, </connor>
<connor> but Clannad was one of them. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - I know, I totally understand </garnt>
<connor> where that laughter comes from. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there was a handful of people </connor>
<connor> who laughed at the same time. </connor>
<connor> Because it's so cliche
now, to say that Clannad </connor>
<connor> changed your life. </connor>
<connor> When I watched that all the way through, </connor>
<connor> it straight up. </connor>
<connor> - That after story fucked me up. </connor>
<connor> - That was the first time that I, </connor>
<connor> not just in anime, but
in any piece of media </connor>
<connor> that I just fucking broke down crying. </connor>
<connor> Because especially that second
half of Clannad After Story. </connor>
<connor> It was just the most brutal
pain to the longest buildup. </connor>
<connor> And just, I don't think I'll be able to... </connor>
<connor> That's again going back million topics. </connor>
<connor> That's another show I
don't think I'll be able </connor>
<connor> to watch again. </connor>
<connor> Just because again, I'm
not in that head space, </connor>
<connor> and it's just something. </connor>
<connor> It's not just the fact that
it was just a sad anime, </connor>
<connor> but I think it's just the fact that </connor>
<connor> again you've been kind of
following these characters lives </connor>
<connor> all the way through. </connor>
<connor> Whereas visual novels or
romance stories would end </connor>
<connor> with the couple getting together. </connor>
<connor> Clannad took that one step further </connor>
<connor> and showed you as the
title says the after story. </connor>
<connor> Of what happens. </connor>
<connor> And I think just seeing
that made these characters </connor>
<connor> even more relatable to me. </connor>
<connor> That was the first time where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "You know what family is cool, man. </connor>
<connor> Family is fucking dope." </connor>
<connor> Before that family was just a thing you- </connor>
<connor> - Just a Christian matter of- </connor>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> - Because before you know,
the concept of family </connor>
<connor> was just very much everybody else. </connor>
<connor> Where it's like, of course family's cool. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, everyone wants a family. </connor>
<connor> But Clannad was that one
show that really dug into </connor>
<connor> just how important family is. </connor>
<connor> And I think that, I mean,
as weird as it is to say </connor>
<connor> after I watched Clannad, I
became way close to my family. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's a big aspect </connor>
<garnt> - That's pretty wholesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is wholesome. </garnt>
<joey> And that really changed my life. </joey>
<joey> - I feel really bad now. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Because you're talking about
how can I change your life? </joey>
<joey> I couldn't fucking
finish the first season. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - That's no problem. </garnt>
<joey> - I've watched Clannad and After Story. </joey>
<joey> The whole time when I was
watching Clannad, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "When is it gonna get good?" </joey>
<connor> Don't fucking sing that Dango
song one more time bitch. </connor>
<connor> I dare you to sing that song one more- </connor>
<connor> - Cause I remember watching
the first eight episodes </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, man
this is trying really hard. </connor>
<joey> - It's so fucking boring. </joey>
<garnt> - But that's the problem. </garnt>
<connor> Is that the thing with the
first season of Clannad. </connor>
<connor> I never say to people, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, you should watch the
first season of Clannad. </connor>
<connor> Because I know that on
the grand scale of things, </connor>
<joey> the first season is fucking boring. </joey>
<connor> - You can't appreciate the second season. </connor>
<joey> - That's the problem. </joey>
<joey> You can't jump into After Story </joey>
<connor> without having experienced
these characters. </connor>
<connor> And it is important. </connor>
<connor> Because a lot of these characters </connor>
<joey> do make a very significant
impact in After Story. </joey>
<connor> - But I guess, you know, it's really hard </connor>
<connor> I guess, especially now. </connor>
<connor> Maybe back then you could
make someone watch 25 episodes </connor>
<connor> of bullshit to get a good pay off. </connor>
<joey> But now you can't do that. </joey>
<connor> I just don't think you
can recommend anymore. </connor>
<joey> - Right, because the story structure </joey>
<joey> and the joke structures that pop in. </joey>
<joey> It's just so overdone now. </joey>
<joey> That it just seems like an aged version </joey>
<joey> of everything that you can see today. </joey>
<joey> But back when Clannad first
came out in 2009, I believe. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was about 2007, 2009. </joey>
<garnt> I think I watched it, after
I watched Haruhi Suzumiya </garnt>
<connor> the first season. </connor>
<connor> And I remember thinking, </connor>
<connor> "This is just shittier in every way." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> The school dynamic was just garbage. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you just watch every high
school anime, and just like </garnt>
<connor> yeah, it's in high school. </connor>
<connor> It's the same show. </connor>
<garnt> - This must be good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like to compare the high school anime </garnt>
<joey> and see what dynamics they got going on, </joey>
<joey> and see what I'm enjoying. </joey>
<joey> Their uniform is different than before. </joey>
<connor> - This was a model in their school. </connor>
<garnt> - Going off topic. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the first time
I watched Seraph The End. </garnt>
<joey> And I remember it was a it was a show </joey>
<joey> with a post-apocalyptic show, </joey>
<joey> about how vampires had
taken over the world. </joey>
<joey> And then for like four episodes in </joey>
<joey> there's just a fucking high school. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Why is
there a high school?" </joey>
<garnt> If there's one show that doesn't
need a high school dynamic, </garnt>
<garnt> it's fucking this show. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm guilty. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm the only guy
I think who has read </connor>
<connor> all of that manga so far. </connor>
<connor> - I'm the complete opposite of guilty. </connor>
<joey> I never consumed anything about it. </joey>
<connor> Which is so weird because
for the longest time </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you
guys got these messages. </connor>
<joey> So many people were asking to make a video </joey>
<joey> on Seraph of The End. </joey>
<connor> - It's got a really big female following. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Have you noticed I
don't think there's been </connor>
<connor> a single AniTuber that
has made a video on it. </connor>
<connor> - Because they're all dudes. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Not even the few females
we have in the [indistinct] </joey>
<joey> community have made it. </joey>
<joey> - The first episode of Zeraph of The End </joey>
<garnt> was one of the best first episodes of, </garnt>
<connor> I remember for a while that we had had. </connor>
<garnt> It was such a good first episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it was really good. </garnt>
<connor> - World ending Wars. </connor>
<connor> And then like you said, high school. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It gets really good again, </connor>
<connor> when they leave high school. </connor>
<garnt> - It does. </garnt>
<garnt> - They quickly abandon that. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'd to think that's
the author being like, </garnt>
<connor> "Yeah, this is... </connor>
<connor> - Shit go back. </connor>
<connor> - It got really good. </connor>
<connor> And I'd say about two
thirds through the manga. </connor>
<connor> Because it hasn't finished yet. </connor>
<connor> But about two-thirds through the manga. </connor>
<connor> Where it is right now, it gets amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then it goes not so good. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause did the manga
deviate from the anime? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I remember watching All of The Anime </garnt>
<garnt> and it was one of those shows where </garnt>
<garnt> I had a good time watching it. </garnt>
<connor> - If I remember correctly, the manga </connor>
<garnt> was really really similar to the show. </garnt>
<garnt> And they build on a lot of the things </garnt>
<connor> that I thought were really
interesting in the show </connor>
<connor> amazingly in the manga as it goes on. </connor>
<connor> But then it became really weird </connor>
<connor> and world ending plot kind of trigger E. </connor>
<connor> I don't really like the final villain </connor>
<connor> that they have as well. </connor>
<connor> It's just a fine, it's fine. </connor>
<garnt> - It's one of those shows where I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> "I had a good time watching it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not going to re watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm probably not gonna remember </garnt>
<garnt> most of the stuff that happens." </garnt>
<joey> - Would you recommend people
to read it or watch it? </joey>
<joey> Because I haven't done either. </joey>
<connor> - I would say watch it and
if you what you've watched </connor>
<joey> then continue onwards. </joey>
<joey> You'll going to probably enjoy it I think </joey>
<joey> up to a certain point and then
you'll start to be confused </joey>
<joey> and, it's good though. </joey>
<joey> It's good. </joey>
<joey> I like how they did a lot of things. </joey>
<joey> Sounds like the most Trump sentence ever. </joey>
<joey> I like how they did things. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It means a lot to me. </joey>
<connor> - They did things, I
like the things I did. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - I totally get it though. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I actually agree with you. </garnt>
<garnt> It was good. </garnt>
<garnt> I had a good time. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the most 6 out of 10 ever. </connor>
<connor> It's very decent and I
have minimal complaints. </connor>
<garnt> There's not much to it. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're just kind of like, I'm happy. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm happy with what happened. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't want an more. </garnt>
<garnt> It was before I had five
Isekai to watch every season </garnt>
<garnt> and this just took the space of that. </garnt>
<garnt> - This came right after the hyper </garnt>
<garnt> season one of Attack of Titan. </garnt>
<connor> I remember everyone was
hyped as fuck for this app. </connor>
<connor> And then it kinda fell off. </connor>
<garnt> Even though I thought the anime </garnt>
<connor> was pretty fucking hype. </connor>
<garnt> - It just kind of just... </garnt>
<connor> It just didn't take off. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird as hell because the anime </connor>
<connor> had an amazing fight scene. </connor>
<connor> An orchestrated, fight. </connor>
<joey> They were hunting down these vampires. </joey>
<joey> Really cool episode. </joey>
<connor> And for some reason
that wasn't enough hype. </connor>
<joey> - It's one of those shows that weirdly </joey>
<garnt> I hear some people still talk about </garnt>
<joey> but I don't really see anything about. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Cause I think people who read it </connor>
<garnt> are really, really into it. </garnt>
<connor> It's good. </connor>
<connor> - I think the problem with it </connor>
<connor> is that I just kind of
liked its own identity </connor>
<connor> when it first aired. </connor>
<connor> Because I remember when it first aired </connor>
<connor> I think I made a joke that I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh it's Attack on Blue
Exorcist with gay vampires." </garnt>
<garnt> Or something along that line. </garnt>
<garnt> - It very much is an amalgamation </garnt>
<connor> of a lot of different aspects. </connor>
<connor> And the main character
is kind of annoying. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's true as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's never a good sign. </garnt>
<garnt> It's annoying cause it's
like I like all of this, </garnt>
<garnt> but we're getting a lot of this one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm just kind of wish it would </garnt>
<garnt> just be a little less potent, you know? </garnt>
<connor> There's a lot of shows like that though. </connor>
<connor> I've read the manga after it </connor>
<connor> and no one really spoke about it. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "I don't
really know why I like this." </connor>
<joey> - Like a certain Black Clover. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't read Black Clover. </connor>
<garnt> - Hey man, Black Clover is good. </garnt>
<joey> I'm repping Black Clover man. </joey>
<joey> - Shit, I shouldn't have said that. </joey>
<joey> He's gonna go off for 40 minutes about it. </joey>
<connor> - My monkey brain is taking over now. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Black Clover, Black Clover. </garnt>
<garnt> - Black Clover. </garnt>
<garnt> - For some reason, I
always ended up reading </garnt>
<garnt> the manga that no one fucking talks about </garnt>
<garnt> or gives a shit about. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know why I ended up... </garnt>
<joey> I think because I don't know anything. </joey>
<joey> I find it more interesting. </joey>
<joey> Because no one talks about it. </joey>
<connor> - I'm definitely in that phase right now. </connor>
<connor> Where I'm just like, I just wanna find </connor>
<joey> the weirdest fucking unknown
manga and just talk about it. </joey>
<connor> - I know it's not unknown at all </connor>
<connor> but I read Terraformars just
because no one speaks about it. </connor>
<connor> And I remember liking
what I saw of the anime, </connor>
<garnt> which is funny cause the
anime adaptation was horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember enjoying the concepts. </garnt>
<joey> So I went back and read all of it. </joey>
<joey> and I had a fucking great time. </joey>
<joey> Terraformars is awesome. </joey>
<joey> - It's amazing. </joey>
<joey> - You should definitely read
it if you get the chance. </joey>
<connor> Super gory, terrifying cockroaches. </connor>
<connor> Great time. </connor>
<connor> - Really good. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - If you've seen the
thumbnail that Connor has made </garnt>
<garnt> about his cockroach story, </garnt>
<garnt> that's a Terraformar cockroach. </garnt>
<connor> - No, let me give you a
32nd pitch on Terraformars. </connor>
<connor> There's an expedition to Mars,
and there's these cockroaches </connor>
<connor> that are absolute giga
charged cockroaches. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> Gym bro cockroaches. </connor>
<connor> And then they wanna
bring them back to earth </connor>
<joey> to see why they're like this, </joey>
<joey> who made these cockroaches like this. </joey>
<joey> Because there must be some reason. </joey>
<joey> - Why are they so chad? </joey>
<garnt> - And then it turns out
that these guys can fight. </garnt>
<garnt> And then did humans get
injected with bug DNA, </garnt>
<connor> insect DNA to become super humans, </connor>
<connor> but then they still keep getting destroyed </connor>
<connor> by the giga charged cockroaches. </connor>
<connor> And it's just a great war. </connor>
<connor> It's a great time. </connor>
<connor> Lots of politics. </connor>
<connor> Lots of Game of Thrones
politics-esk things involved. </connor>
<connor> It's fantastic. </connor>
<connor> - Lots of deaths. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's great. </connor>
<connor> Because you would think that
a really straightforward plot </connor>
<joey> where it's about action, big
cockroach fight, big bug boy. </joey>
<joey> But then it just suddenly... </joey>
<connor> But then it really quickly... </connor>
<garnt> - Big bug boys. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's such a perfect
way to describe it. </garnt>
<connor> - Bug boy. </connor>
<garnt> - You be bug boy. </garnt>
<connor> - You don't ever feel as
excited for learning one bug. </connor>
<garnt> cause I remember, I remember thinking </garnt>
<garnt> when I was in high
school the mantis shrimp, </garnt>
<garnt> coolest bug in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what the mantis shrimp is? </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that a bug? </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that the one that punches. </garnt>
<joey> - It punch, the speed of
sound and it punches so hard </joey>
<garnt> that it can't be contained in aquarium. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember that chapter. </garnt>
<garnt> - This thing is tiny. </garnt>
<connor> And then when they made a human
formed with a mantis shrimp, </connor>
<connor> I was bro, bro, I know what that is. </connor>
<connor> And then yeah, he was RP. </connor>
<connor> He was pretty strong. </connor>
<garnt> But I've gone off topic. </garnt>
<garnt> But because I remember thinking. </garnt>
<garnt> You read 80 chapters of this thing, </garnt>
<connor> thinking that it's just gonna
be big man punch bug man. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, that's fine. </connor>
<connor> Cause you're down frame. </connor>
<connor> Then it quickly turns into, but wait, </connor>
<joey> if earth was trying to take
over Mars and get these samples </joey>
<joey> there would be a lot
of up politics involved </joey>
<joey> with which country is gonna want what. </joey>
<connor> And so it divulges into a lot of that. </connor>
<joey> And it's really fucking interesting </joey>
<joey> - The wall building has done really well. </joey>
<joey> - It's super fucking good. </joey>
<joey> I really recommend it. </joey>
<joey> Sorry that turned from a 32nd
pitch into a whole discussion </joey>
<garnt> but it's a great manga. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you, if you something
Gantz, something like that, </garnt>
<garnt> you'll probably go
right ahead and view it. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've read it,
just after I read Gantz. </garnt>
<connor> Cause I was looking for some very- </connor>
<connor> - Perfect for that kind of- </connor>
<garnt> - I was in the edgy teenager phase. </garnt>
<connor> - I was literally living
my edgy teenager phase, </connor>
<garnt> like six months ago. </garnt>
<garnt> I read Gantz, I read Terraformars . </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, sometimes, the edgy teenager phase </garnt>
<connor> you never grow out of it. </connor>
<connor> I fucking love going back
to my edgy teenager phase </connor>
<connor> because I really wanna
reread Gantz as well. </connor>
<connor> Gantz is fucking great. </connor>
<connor> That defined what I was into </connor>
<garnt> as a late teen. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so good, Gantz. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like aliens, sexy girls, gore. </joey>
<joey> Sign me up baby. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, there's a scene in Gantz. </connor>
<connor> And I guess because we're used </connor>
<connor> to the normal dynamics in anime. </connor>
<connor> Where they're like,
"Oh, a hot girl turn up </connor>
<garnt> and he wants to have sex with her." </garnt>
<connor> But then he actually
just starts fucking her. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he just starts fucking her. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Who is this chad?" </garnt>
<garnt> I've never seen such a
big chad in anime before </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - I was on the train,
reading this as well. </connor>
<connor> That was a terrible manga
to read on the train. </connor>
<connor> Cause every time I'd flick the panel, </connor>
<connor> it'll just be naked tits and stuff. </connor>
<joey> - That sex scene The manga is so long. </joey>
<joey> It's so long. </joey>
<connor> - It's so weird that it's
like not even remotely </connor>
<garnt> a realistic depiction of sex. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so weak then suddenly she's
obsessed with him after it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so fucking dumb. </garnt>
<garnt> But the one thing that's
amazing about Gantz </garnt>
<garnt> and I would to sell people on </garnt>
<connor> is one the monster drawings
and the level of detail. </connor>
<connor> - This is why you do not want
to watch the anime at all. </connor>
<connor> - Cause Gantz is peak mid 2000 Gonzo CG. </connor>
<connor> You think CG today is bad. </connor>
<garnt> Watch, Gantz, and you just
see how bad CG was back then. </garnt>
<joey> - I just remember just the
absolutely just messed up CG </joey>
<garnt> of even the opening. </garnt>
<garnt> Where it's just like, </garnt>
<connor> let's see how many times
we can rotate this camera. </connor>
<joey> Make everybody sick. </joey>
<connor> - I'll put that on the screen
right now, so you can see. </connor>
<joey> - The opening was a banger. </joey>
<joey> Oh, that song was so good. </joey>
<garnt> (indistinct chatter) </garnt>
<garnt> Every time I watched it, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "I'm about to throw up." </joey>
<joey> It's so dizzying. </joey>
<connor> - If you enjoyed the good
parts of Darling and the Franks </connor>
<connor> the mystery and not knowing
anything about the world </connor>
<connor> and wondering, "Oh my God,
how does this all function?" </connor>
<connor> If you like that aspect of world
building you'll love Gantz. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was really impressed, </garnt>
<garnt> by world building in Gantz, </garnt>
<garnt> because not to spoil how it ends, </garnt>
<connor> but the actual ending of Gantz itself </connor>
<connor> was very very anticlimactic. </connor>
<connor> - Questionable. </connor>
<connor> - But the actual answers was like, </connor>
<connor> that kind of was that you
know that big brain meme. </connor>
<connor> That was, "Oh my God." </connor>
<connor> It's fucking great. </connor>
<connor> It's one of the few series that I've seen </connor>
<connor> that has built up this huge mystery </connor>
<garnt> and has delivered on it. </garnt>
<garnt> And has delivered on a answer that. </garnt>
<connor> It's satisfying. </connor>
<connor> - The actual ending is not great, </connor>
<connor> but the answers for the main
mysteries were very satisfying. </connor>
<garnt> So it doesn't end amazingly, </garnt>
<garnt> but the explanation for all the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that was happening is very cool. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought it was really interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> But there's also some stuff in the manga </garnt>
<garnt> that did not age well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like what? </garnt>
<garnt> You don't wanna say. </garnt>
<connor> Everyone who's read it
will know what I mean. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, there's a part where
a character does black face </connor>
<connor> and suddenly turns- </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I completely
forgot about that. </garnt>
<joey> (indistinct chatter) </joey>
<garnt> - I read it six months ago. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's a scene where
one of the characters </garnt>
<garnt> goes to shoot up a thing in public. </garnt>
<garnt> He goes to do a public shooting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - It's really really bad. </connor>
<joey> Its awful. </joey>
<garnt> - That is the most yikes moment I've ever- </garnt>
<connor> - Please don't cancel Oku Hiroya, please. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's a normal Japanese guy </connor>
<garnt> and then he wears blackface </garnt>
<garnt> but then he's just drawn
like an actual black guy. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's really, really
uncomfortable to read. </garnt>
<connor> Cause you're like... </connor>
<connor> "I don't really know." </connor>
<connor> And that was the moment
where I went online, </connor>
<connor> to be like has anyone else
realized how fucked up. </connor>
<joey> And then immediately everyone was like, </joey>
<connor> "You know it's good." </connor>
<connor> - We kind of turn a blind eye on it. </connor>
<connor> - Its the one thing that
makes it really hard </connor>
<connor> to recommend, because it's
a very interesting series </connor>
<garnt> and it does a lot of cool things, </garnt>
<connor> but then it's really, really fucked. </connor>
<connor> That part is you kind of
wish that wasn't there. </connor>
<garnt> Because then you could
recommend it to edge people. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just too much. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just an example of
something that has an aged well. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause when I read that as a kid. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a lot of nuance that
is lost in Japanese culture </connor>
<garnt> and that kind of stuff. </garnt>
<connor> It's still, even for Japanese
standards is pretty awful. </connor>
<joey> - It was, yeah. </joey>
<joey> When Gantz was serializing. </joey>
<joey> It was very lopsided in
terms of, is this okay </joey>
<joey> or is this not okay. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know if the Japanese
audience is concerned </joey>
<garnt> with it being racist? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> It's definitely the one giant
stain on Gantz in general. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<joey> Other than the 3D CG. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - That's a pretty damn, I
mean, that's just the stain </connor>
<joey> - That's just the shit stain on the- </joey>
<connor> and they have a live action movie. </connor>
<connor> Didn't they? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But the live action was not as horrible </connor>
<connor> as a lot of people
thought it was gonna be. </connor>
<connor> Ca use I watched the live action. </connor>
<connor> and I was like, it wasn't amazing. </connor>
<connor> Solid 5 out of 10. </connor>
<connor> But , there was definitely
a lot of questionable CG </connor>
<connor> about it because of course
Japanese live actions. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously. </connor>
<connor> But the way that they actually
did the whole Gantz thing </connor>
<connor> and the whole feel of it. </connor>
<connor> The whole despair of, shit, this wall </connor>
<connor> we don't know what the fuck is happening. </connor>
<connor> They did that really
well in the live action. </connor>
<connor> - What do you think is the
best live action anime movie? </connor>
<joey> 'cause that's hard. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna say, I know, which one it is. </joey>
<connor> - Which one is for you Gintama? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not familiar with Gintama. </joey>
<joey> - The Gintama live action. </joey>
<garnt> I've never laughed that
hard watching a live action. </garnt>
<garnt> And not talking about
Dragonball Evolution, </garnt>
<garnt> ironic laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> It's genuinely- </garnt>
<garnt> - Funny. </garnt>
<connor> - It brings out the Gin Tama
spirit, so fucking well. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know how the hell they did it, </connor>
<connor> because you read a Mana like Gin Tama </connor>
<connor> or watch an anime like Gin Tama. </connor>
<connor> And you're there's no way
this can be live action. </connor>
<connor> no fucking way. </connor>
<garnt> You can't translate this
comedy into live action. </garnt>
<garnt> But they somehow did it. </garnt>
<connor> - The mat lads did it. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I'm like the casting was perfect. </connor>
<connor> The costumes were perfect. </connor>
<connor> - I'll take your word for
it, cause I have no idea. </connor>
<connor> - Even the action scenes,
because the second half of it </connor>
<connor> goes into the first story arc of Gin Tama. </connor>
<connor> And concludes it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, wow, this
is actually really good CG </connor>
<connor> and really good choreography. </connor>
<connor> And it's very believable ginta movie. </connor>
<joey> I would watch that again. </joey>
<connor> That's how good it is. </connor>
<connor> - I was pleasantly surprised
with the Jojo part four movie. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> I didn't like it. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<joey> - It was fine. </joey>
<connor> I thought some of the
scenes they did pretty good. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the thing with
live-action anime movies. </garnt>
<joey> The bar is so low that just </joey>
<joey> (indistinct chatter) </joey>
<garnt> - Is it good compared
to all these other shit </garnt>
<joey> or is it just genuinely good. </joey>
<garnt> - Being passable is the best compliment </garnt>
<connor> you can give an anime live action. </connor>
<garnt> I remember watching the ghost
in the shell live action. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember how
offensively average it was. </connor>
<joey> - I couldn't form an opinion on it. </joey>
<garnt> Because I'm just like, "It's okay." </garnt>
<joey> - The ghost in the show was really weird </joey>
<connor> because it's if you watched it as a ghost </connor>
<connor> in the show live action,
it was a four out of 10. </connor>
<connor> But if you just watched it as like... </connor>
<connor> If you just thought okay this
is just a standalone, scifi- </connor>
<garnt> - Complex. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<garnt> bring brain references. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what, I watched
Alita the Battle Angel </connor>
<garnt> was really good. </garnt>
<garnt> And you totally forget it's a manga. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you think it was good? </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was kind of shit. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's one of the best animated </connor>
<joey> or manga movies we've had. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, the ending was just whack man. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but I mean, everything
up until the ending was- </connor>
<joey> - For me, Alita was very
much Ghost in The Shell. </joey>
<connor> - No, I put it higher
than Ghost in The Shell. </connor>
<connor> - Have you read Alita? </connor>
<connor> - No, who the fuck has read Alita? </connor>
<joey> - I have, that's why I watched the movie. </joey>
<joey> - Joey has read everything. </joey>
<joey> - That why I've watched the movie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I bet, if I watched
the manga I'd like it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, very much like Ghost in The Shell. </joey>
<connor> - I bet if I read the manga
I'd like the manga more. </connor>
<connor> - It's like Ghost in the Shell . </connor>
<connor> People who are fans of Ghost in The Shell </connor>
<connor> before they watched live action, </connor>
<connor> that was a shit adaptation
of Ghost in the Show. </connor>
<connor> Alita is the exact same. </connor>
<connor> It's good as a standalone movie. </connor>
<joey> But as an adaptation of
Alita it was pretty weak. </joey>
<connor> But at least the Hollywood one is better </connor>
<joey> than the Japanese adaptation. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you watch the attack on Titan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - What's with them being Nazis. </joey>
<connor> What's with that? </connor>
<connor> - I got invited by Madman in
Australia to go to the cinemas </connor>
<garnt> on the day, premier day. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like, "You
can bring a plus one." </garnt>
<garnt> So I brought my best friend. </garnt>
<connor> Who's a huge anime fan and we watched it. </connor>
<connor> And we just kind of sat there
as the credits were rolling. </connor>
<joey> And I just looked over and
I'm like, "How was that?" </joey>
<joey> And my friend's like, I
know you got me in for free, </joey>
<joey> but I want my money back." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm like, you what I kind of have to agree </joey>
<joey> with you there man. </joey>
<garnt> - Because my cousin who I've been trying </garnt>
<garnt> to get into anime for ages. </garnt>
<connor> Biggest norma, you can kind of think of. </connor>
<connor> - Breaking bad. </connor>
<connor> - I was, recommending Attack on Titans. </connor>
<connor> Because that's one of the perfect- </connor>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> It's Attack on Titans. </connor>
<connor> And then he fucking ends up watching </connor>
<connor> the attack on Titan live action. </connor>
<joey> And he is like, "Yeah,
that wasn't very good." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "You were almost there. </joey>
<connor> You're this close." </connor>
<connor> And now whenever I
recommended Attack on Titan. </connor>
<garnt> Am like, trust me the
anime is so much better. </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "But is it the same story?" </garnt>
<garnt> But you don't get it. </garnt>
<joey> - You might not know, </joey>
<joey> but there's this character called Levi. </joey>
<connor> He wasn't in the live action </connor>
<connor> because they couldn't pronounce his name. </connor>
<connor> - You know that's the reason
why they cut him out right. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> The reason why Levi's
known in the live action </connor>
<connor> is because they were like,
"These are Japanese actors. </connor>
<connor> I don't think they can
pronounce the V sound." </connor>
<connor> And I'm, "You do realize this was written </connor>
<joey> by a Japanese person." </joey>
<connor> - People like that are
the reason why microwave's </connor>
<joey> come with instructions. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> - They need a hand to hold. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, you watched the movie. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - How'd you fuck up this bad. </garnt>
<connor> - How is he fucking this up? </connor>
<connor> Man, I kind of just stay
away from the movies. </connor>
<connor> I just stay away from all my movies. </connor>
<connor> - I think the only one I've
enjoyed is Edge of Tomorrow. </connor>
<connor> Which I didn't- </connor>
<joey> - That one was really good. </joey>
<connor> - Tom Hanks? </connor>
<garnt> - Tom Hanks. </garnt>
<garnt> Tom cruise. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking Tom Cruise. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tom Cruise. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it was Tom Hanks, I
would have [indistinct]. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I didn't even realize
that was based on a manga. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's All You Need is Kill. </joey>
<joey> - Which is like the edgiest title ever </joey>
<garnt> All You Need is Kill. </garnt>
<joey> - Coming to you next summer. </joey>
<garnt> - It's actually based off a novel </garnt>
<garnt> that was then later adapted into a manga. </garnt>
<garnt> That was written by Obata Takeshi. </garnt>
<connor> It's the illustrator for Death Note. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, which is also very good manga. </garnt>
<garnt> So when I saw, cause I picked up the novel </garnt>
<garnt> while I was in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> Because I was just like,
"All You Need is Kill. </connor>
<connor> Fuck yeah, dude, that sounds awesome." </connor>
<connor> And I read it and the
novel was really good. </connor>
<garnt> But then, when they were
promoting in the bookstore </garnt>
<connor> they were like, "Tom Cruise
movie coming out soon." </connor>
<connor> I was just like, "Oh no. </connor>
<connor> Oh, don't do this. </connor>
<connor> Please, please, Tom. </connor>
<connor> Don't do this." </connor>
<connor> But of course I had to go watch it. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm like all right, </connor>
<connor> "This is probably gonna be shit, </connor>
<garnt> let's go watch it." </garnt>
<joey> I was like, "All right, you know what, </joey>
<garnt> - It was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll give you this one Hollywood. </garnt>
<joey> You did good. </joey>
<garnt> - It was one of the few
films that I watched it. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh I gotta go
read the source material now. </connor>
<joey> And it was quite different
from the source material. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't exactly the same. </joey>
<joey> But that's how you adapt a live
action movie in my opinion, </joey>
<garnt> you've gotta change some things. </garnt>
<joey> If there was something that is just... </joey>
<joey> If there's a concept in
a story that you know, </joey>
<garnt> will never work in live action. </garnt>
<connor> Don't put it in. </connor>
<connor> It's so simple. </connor>
<connor> And yet there are so
many fucking productions </connor>
<connor> and directors who are like, </connor>
<connor> "No, we can do it. </connor>
<connor> No, we can definitely." </connor>
<joey> Assassination Classroom, giant yellow guy. </joey>
<joey> Fucking man CG will fix that. </joey>
<connor> - That was a weird adaptation. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why, but I've
slowly started to find myself </joey>
<garnt> watching live action, animated movies. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why, why? </garnt>
<joey> - Why would you do this to yourself? </joey>
<joey> - Because it's just- </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna give me shit
for watching [indistinct]. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a guilty pleasure for me now. </joey>
<garnt> Even if it's... </garnt>
<joey> Because I watched the
Erased live action as well. </joey>
<joey> And even though I didn't like Erased. </joey>
<connor> - That was on Netflix, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But purely just because, </joey>
<connor> it's the perfect example of
curiosity killed the cat. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Because I'm just so curious to be like, </connor>
<connor> "How could they possibly adapt this?" </connor>
<joey> And then I go into it, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Amazing, I just wasted an
hour and a half of my life." </joey>
<connor> - There are just some animated actions, </connor>
<joey> you just know are gonna be shit. </joey>
<joey> There's some you watch for the train wreck </joey>
<joey> but not all of them. </joey>
<joey> Like Erased, you don't need to watch. </joey>
<connor> The Full Metal Alchemist live action. </connor>
<connor> I don't need to watch that to
know it's going to be shit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the one thing
I still haven't watched. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I'm gonna do? </joey>
<joey> - The definite one is- </joey>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna watch the
live action movie now. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<joey> And you'll be guys, Metal of
the Alchemist isn't that good? </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck are you talking? </joey>
<garnt> It sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> Full Metal Alchemist sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> What were you guys on? </garnt>
<connor> - We should please do that. </connor>
<connor> - No, please don't, please don't. </connor>
<connor> You will actually ruin
the story for yourself. </connor>
<connor> You'll get a speed run story. </connor>
<connor> It's just awful. </connor>
<connor> I mean, the only reason I
watched the Death Note one. </connor>
<joey> - The Death Note one. </joey>
<connor> Is because, you know, I
wanted to be able to help </connor>
<connor> with the discussion on Twitter and- </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I got a great video out of it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, right. </connor>
<connor> You can clown on it. </connor>
<connor> It's great. </connor>
<joey> Because everyone's
gonna be waiting for it. </joey>
<joey> But you can't clown The Erased one </joey>
<joey> because no one gives a fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, that's why I
didn't make a video on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why watch it, why
waste an hour and a half. </garnt>
<connor> Why, why? </connor>
<connor> I mean, I've done that. </connor>
<connor> I think there are more anime live-action </connor>
<connor> that I haven't made a video on </connor>
<connor> than ones that I haven't made a video on. </connor>
<connor> Just because no one needs
to know this is shit. </connor>
<connor> I just need to know this is shit. </connor>
<connor> I don't need to share this, </connor>
<connor> because everybody already knows it's shit. </connor>
<connor> I didn't have to make a video
on The Parasite live action. </connor>
<joey> Because everybody knew
it was gonna be shit. </joey>
<joey> But I needed to know that
it was gonna to be shit. </joey>
<joey> And sure enough, I found out
that it was absolutely garbage. </joey>
<connor> - You know what blows my mind, </connor>
<joey> that sometimes they
may only make the anime </joey>
<joey> to promote the garbage movie. </joey>
<joey> With Parasite one of those situations. </joey>
<connor> I know Kaiji, the gambler one. </connor>
<connor> That was definitely a... </connor>
<joey> That anime was just made
to promote the movie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was it? </joey>
<connor> - It was. </connor>
<connor> - And the movie was... </connor>
<joey> - The movie was questionable. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, actually... </joey>
<joey> I enjoyed the Kaiji movie </joey>
<connor> in this really campy kind of way. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - But in what world would
you choose the movie </connor>
<connor> over the anime? </connor>
<garnt> Oh no, absolutely not. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolutely not. </connor>
<connor> - Because watching, watching
the Kaiji live action </connor>
<garnt> was kind of just watching </garnt>
<garnt> some K drama or J drama. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, do you want to explain what Kaiji is </garnt>
<garnt> quickly to the audience. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so, it's a gambling story. </garnt>
<garnt> So this guy racks up this
massive, massive debt. </garnt>
<joey> I forgot why he even
racked up this massive debt </joey>
<joey> I can't remember why he did it. </joey>
<joey> - It's for some reason. </joey>
<joey> - So, so basically he gets an offer </joey>
<joey> from this mysterious company
that can clear his debt. </joey>
<joey> That just says, "You
need to go on the ship </joey>
<joey> and you're gonna play a bunch of games. </joey>
<joey> And if you win these games,
then we will clear your debt. </joey>
<joey> Or you can go into even greater debt. </joey>
<joey> And the basic premise is
just Kaiji on the ship </joey>
<joey> or just after the ship parks over, </joey>
<garnt> it's just him going through </garnt>
<garnt> a bunch of different gambling games </garnt>
<garnt> and just trying to clear his debt. </garnt>
<connor> - And he's not OP. </connor>
<joey> So that's the best part,
is that you genuinely... </joey>
<joey> He loses a lot. </joey>
<joey> He loses as much as he wins. </joey>
<joey> And it's great because
you genuinely don't know </joey>
<joey> if he's gonna lose or win every day. </joey>
<joey> It's a very quotable show. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of people didn't watch it. </joey>
<joey> I think mainly because for some reason </joey>
<garnt> it was only published in for ADP. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you remember that? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was only published in 40P. </garnt>
<garnt> - It came out in 2007 as
well, it only for ADP. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember when I was watching it </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Where's the- </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> Just know that when you watch
it it's gonna to be like that. </connor>
<connor> But it's definitely worth your time. </connor>
<joey> - I thought the reason why
people didn't watch Kaiji </joey>
<joey> was because of the art style. </joey>
<connor> - I think is that. </connor>
<joey> And I think there's a ton of reasons </joey>
<connor> why people don't watch it </connor>
<garnt> - It's got zero female
characters in it, I think. </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember a
single female character. </joey>
<joey> - It's got a lot of ugly
bastards in it, I know that. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> That was the one show </joey>
<joey> that has more ugly bastards than hentai. </joey>
<joey> - That's Kaiji, right. </joey>
<connor> Imagine an NTR plot, but instead of sex </connor>
<connor> it's just watching a guy- </connor>
<connor> - It's just gambling. </connor>
<connor> - It's just NTR gambling. </connor>
<connor> That's just Kaiji, okay. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But it's fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<connor> Going from watching Kaiji to, </connor>
<joey> I don't know how you
pronounce it, Kakegurui. </joey>
<joey> - Kakegurui, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was like, how can I watch this shit, </joey>
<garnt> when this gambling is so fake? </garnt>
<garnt> it's all just gambling to serve the plot </garnt>
<connor> whereas in Kaiji, it felt real gambling. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Kakegurui was just they threw ... </joey>
<joey> They were like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, how do we make
these hot girls orgasm? </joey>
<connor> Gambling. </connor>
<joey> Let's just throw in." </joey>
<joey> - The main character always wins. </joey>
<joey> Unless it doesn't really matter. </joey>
<connor> Then she doesn't win. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Haha,
you didn't expect that." </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Yeah, but it didn't matter." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> There was the one dumb moment. </connor>
<connor> That's the part I dropped the series. </connor>
<connor> Was when the girl with the
gun playing Russian roulette </connor>
<connor> and it's like it's obvious
no one is going to die </connor>
<connor> in this situation. </connor>
<connor> Don't pretend like someone is going to die </connor>
<connor> because I'm not stupid. </connor>
<connor> And then I couldn't watch it further. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm like, "This is just dumb." </connor>
<joey> - Whereas if that was in Kaiji, </joey>
<connor> - Someone's gonna die. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey and Garnt] Someones gonna die. </joey>
<connor> - Which is great, but then it wasn't sure, </connor>
<connor> maybe both of them could die. </connor>
<connor> We don't know. </connor>
<connor> That's the best part about Kaiji. </connor>
<connor> Is that you just genuinely don't know. </connor>
<joey> - No, the best part of Kaiji
is the narrator's voice. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<garnt> - Why is there just that narrator </garnt>
<joey> in every fucking show of that time. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's so epic. </joey>
<joey> I love it. </joey>
<connor> - Because I only see it an anime. </connor>
<garnt> You're not watching this
Netflix show and this narrator </garnt>
<garnt> comes out, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, what's the follow-up series? </connor>
<connor> The spinoff one with the
middle management, whatever, </connor>
<garnt> Tonegawa. </garnt>
<garnt> Tonegawa, maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never watched that
one, was that any good? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's quite funny. </garnt>
<connor> If you go in expecting Kaiji, </connor>
<connor> you're gonna be very disappointed. </connor>
<garnt> - If you want Kaiji, then
it's better if you read. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno the author's name, </garnt>
<garnt> but read some of his other works. </garnt>
<joey> - Akagi is really good. </joey>
<garnt> - Akagi. </garnt>
<connor> Akagi, is basically Mahjong Kaiji. </connor>
<connor> Here's the thing, I had
no interest in Mahjong. </connor>
<connor> I was watching the show. </connor>
<connor> I had no fucking rules... </connor>
<connor> I had no clue of the
rules of Mahjong either. </connor>
<garnt> You get drawn in right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But after I finished Akagi, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, man, maybe I should
learn how to play Mahjong. </joey>
<joey> This looks fun. </joey>
<joey> - I had the exact same thing. </joey>
<joey> I don't know which show was it. </joey>
<joey> It was a little girls competing
in mahjong tournaments. </joey>
<joey> I think it might've just
been called Mahjong. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe, I don't know, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it was, but I remember </joey>
<connor> I was trying my goddamn
best to learn Mahjong. </connor>
<joey> And I was like... </joey>
<joey> - There a lot of shows like that. </joey>
<joey> Well, I mean you know,
March Comes in Like a Lion, </joey>
<joey> made me really invested in Shogi. </joey>
<connor> I was like, I don't know
what the fuck Shogi is. </connor>
<connor> But then after I watched
March Comes in Like a Lion. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna learn Shogi. </connor>
<connor> - Man, I kind of wanna learn Shogi. </connor>
<connor> Shogi is just Japanese chess right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, I'm good at
chess, I wanna be good at that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know how to play chess. </connor>
<connor> And yet I was like, Shogi looks fun. </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<connor> - I was like, I don't know
how to play chess Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Because of, I just didn't. </joey>
<joey> We didn't even own a
chess board in my house. </joey>
<connor> - You know how to play chess, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know the basics. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's good. </garnt>
<connor> - I fucking suck at it. </connor>
<garnt> I haven't played in years </garnt>
<connor> - We need a chess anime, but
obviously, because Shogi- </connor>
<garnt> - No, because I actually
really want a chess anime. </garnt>
<connor> - That would be so good in anime. </connor>
<garnt> - It would be so fucking hype in anime. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm surprised there hasn't been one yet. </joey>
<garnt> - Is because how big is Chess in Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> It's not very big. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I guess if
you're gonna play chess, </garnt>
<garnt> you might as well play Shogi, right. </garnt>
<connor> - No, because I think a
lot of the grandmasters </connor>
<garnt> are from Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that's true actually. </connor>
<connor> Because I remember I got
sucked into this YouTube hole </connor>
<connor> of just watching a lot of chess. </connor>
<connor> I had no interest in chess. </connor>
<connor> I had no interest in chess. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Man, this is
actually really interesting." </connor>
<connor> Cause the history and
just the entire premise </connor>
<connor> of chess is really, really interesting. </connor>
<connor> The fact that you- </connor>
<connor> - There's a history around chess. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically this
massive tournament arc. </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And there's reading about </connor>
<connor> some the most historical chess games. </connor>
<connor> I have no interest in chess,
but this was fucking hype. </connor>
<connor> And I remember thinking,
man this would work so well </connor>
<connor> in an anime or manga setting. </connor>
<garnt> So I went out to try and find
a single chess anime or manga. </garnt>
<garnt> And there just wasn't one. </garnt>
<garnt> I was really, really disappointed. </garnt>
<joey> - It's surprising
honestly, because I think </joey>
<joey> the whole stereotype with
chess in anime is like </joey>
<joey> you know, the transfer
student who also happens to be </joey>
<garnt> the daughter of the giant companies. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, "Let me just do
a little bit of chess </garnt>
<joey> on the side line. </joey>
<joey> The way chess is used in anime </joey>
<connor> is to make someone look smart. </connor>
<connor> Like, there's no reason
for Lelouch to play chess. </connor>
<connor> - I was about to say that. </connor>
<garnt> - Because he's a tactical genius. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, he's a tactical genius. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you ever lead with the King Connor? </garnt>
<connor> - No, you never lead with the King. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Do you wanna tell
people about your hidden- </garnt>
<connor> - That's you're a chess champion. </connor>
<connor> - When I was 13 or 12 or I
just started high school. </connor>
<connor> It was after I left primary school. </connor>
<connor> I was playing professional chess. </connor>
<connor> And how I ended up
playing professional chess </connor>
<connor> was weird to begin with. </connor>
<connor> Cause I never played it much. </connor>
<connor> I just liked video games a lot. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It was the only video game </connor>
<connor> that my dad would play with me is chess. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> So cause if I wanted- </connor>
<connor> - EChess. </connor>
<connor> - No, normal chess. </connor>
<connor> But I remember I was
playing at year three. </connor>
<garnt> How old are you in year three
in the UK, like eight, nine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Eight, nine. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the chess club is
only for the last year, </garnt>
<garnt> which was all the 12 year olds. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember they wouldn't
let me play with them, </garnt>
<garnt> but one they let me play with
them and it's just so anime. </garnt>
<connor> Cause outside of the chess club </connor>
<connor> I beat their best player
in a game of chess. </connor>
<connor> Then they were like, "No, no
you've got to let this guy </connor>
<connor> play with us his good." </connor>
<connor> So I beat them all, and
then nothing happened </connor>
<garnt> for three years until it was
my time to join the chess club </garnt>
<connor> and I was allowed to join the club. </connor>
<garnt> And then I joined the chess club. </garnt>
<garnt> And our school had lost every
single chess tournament ever. </garnt>
<connor> Because it was a local... </connor>
<connor> I didn't even know we had this. </connor>
<connor> There was a local circuit, right. </connor>
<connor> Between all the schools played each other, </connor>
<connor> like football and every other sport. </connor>
<connor> There's one for chess. </connor>
<connor> And I remember that we
started playing in that </connor>
<connor> and also the guy who is
number two in our chess team, </connor>
<connor> because I was number
one, we were both equal, </connor>
<connor> which is also very anime. </connor>
<connor> - Rival character in everything. </connor>
<joey> - He's power level was on par with mine. </joey>
<joey> - My whole chess experience
is genuinely an anime. </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna keep talking and
there's more stuff to it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we just started
winning every single game </garnt>
<garnt> against every other school. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't even close. </garnt>
<connor> I remember these kids were bad. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> And I remember every time
they would be shocked </connor>
<connor> at how quickly we would beat these kids. </connor>
<connor> Cause, it's very different
in professional chess </connor>
<connor> to playing if somebody doesn't... </connor>
<connor> In professional chess, it's a long thing </connor>
<connor> and I'll get more into it later. </connor>
<connor> These were games I
could win in 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> Because I can see how they
fucked up and I would take it. </connor>
<connor> To me, it just made sense. </connor>
<connor> I didn't practice. </connor>
<connor> I was just good at
games and it made sense. </connor>
<connor> And then one time there was a school </connor>
<connor> and these guys had been
number one for like 10 years </connor>
<connor> in a row or something. </connor>
<garnt> Cause they had a guy
who was someone's parent </garnt>
<garnt> and he's obsessed with chess. </garnt>
<garnt> Very, very good at chess. </garnt>
<garnt> And we beat his team. </garnt>
<garnt> And they were shocked. </garnt>
<connor> They were like, "Not me,
you beat the protege team. </connor>
<connor> - This is a sports anime. </connor>
<joey> This is a fucking sports anime. </joey>
<joey> - You could base a chess manga
off of your life honestly. </joey>
<connor> - I remember thinking it
was weird because this guy </connor>
<joey> was making like a whole... </joey>
<connor> Bear in mind, I was 12, I didn't know </connor>
<joey> what the fuck was going on. </joey>
<garnt> And this guy is making a whole commotion. </garnt>
<garnt> He was shocked. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was sitting there and he was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Walk me through everything you did." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't write it down." </garnt>
<garnt> Because most you're
supposed to write it down </garnt>
<garnt> in professional chess. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was writing it down
and I thought that was weird. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Why don't
you write down your moves? </garnt>
<garnt> You just did them. </garnt>
<garnt> You're not gonna go back. </garnt>
<connor> And he was like, "Why did you move here? </connor>
<connor> How did you know how
to do that and stuff?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "I don't
know, I just did it." </connor>
<connor> And then he spoke to my mom, and was like, </connor>
<connor> "You should come to this thing." </connor>
<connor> It's weird. </connor>
<connor> It's 200 kids come to a place. </connor>
<connor> By the way, chess for kids is
a really weird kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> It's just adults pushing a bunch
of Cambridge kids to do it. </connor>
<connor> So I went to a location
and that was 2, 300 kids, </connor>
<connor> all just playing chess. </connor>
<garnt> Then you would get an opponent. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you won to lost, </garnt>
<garnt> you would then play someone who has won. </garnt>
<connor> And the more you kept winning,
the more you would go up. </connor>
<connor> And eventually people
who won all their games </connor>
<connor> would go on to play for the area. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a legit tournament. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Legit. </garnt>
<connor> Here's the best [indistinct]. </connor>
<connor> I was killing all my games, right. </connor>
<connor> And I had won four. </connor>
<connor> So you play seven. </connor>
<connor> I remember I won four in a row. </connor>
<joey> They were really easy. </joey>
<joey> My friend as well, he'd lost two </joey>
<joey> and then he was already
out and I felt bad. </joey>
<joey> I was like, </joey>
<garnt> (indistinct chatter) </garnt>
<connor> - I'll go on for you friend. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll see you in the finals. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - And then it's weird. </connor>
<connor> Cause I never had any... </connor>
<connor> A lot of these kids as well. </connor>
<connor> They would be studying
it in between games, </connor>
<connor> but I would just whip out
Pokemon at start playing it. </connor>
<connor> Then I'll be like, "It's my
time to go and save and play." </connor>
<connor> But I remember, so my fifth game, </connor>
<connor> was against the guy, I beat in my school. </connor>
<connor> The prodigy team or whatever. </connor>
<connor> And I had to play him again and we drew. </connor>
<connor> It was really anti-climactic. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Fuck, I beat him last time, </connor>
<connor> I wanna beat him again." </connor>
<connor> Anyway, I got on the team and I was okay. </connor>
<connor> I was struggling. </connor>
<connor> Cause this is where it was
getting really serious. </connor>
<connor> I was decent enough where I
could win 70% of my games, </connor>
<connor> but it was still starting
to get really long. </connor>
<connor> Because chess games never
went more than an hour. </connor>
<garnt> And then they start becoming two hours. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm 13. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, "This is [indistinct]." </garnt>
<garnt> - I just want to play- </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct chatter) </garnt>
<garnt> I start winning and then I got
content and they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, do you wanna play for your country?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Sure, I guess
I'll play for my country." </garnt>
<garnt> Why not? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, I'm doing good enough. </connor>
<connor> So I turn up, I go to
the first tournament. </connor>
<connor> You won't believe because I was number 10. </connor>
<connor> So there's 10 seats. </connor>
<connor> 1 is the best 10 is the worst. </connor>
<connor> So I was the worst on the country. </connor>
<connor> Worst for the country for team. </connor>
<connor> Guess who was number one. </connor>
<joey> I think I've told you guys this story. </joey>
<connor> It was the main bully at my school. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<connor> I shit you not. </connor>
<connor> - You can't make this shit up. </connor>
<connor> You can't make this shit up. </connor>
<connor> - I shit you not, it was
the main bully at my school </connor>
<connor> who no one knew he did this. </connor>
<joey> - This is the point in the manga
where the flashback begins. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - He used to bully me. </joey>
<garnt> - He was the main rival all along. </garnt>
<connor> - He literally was the kid
that everyone was scared of. </connor>
<garnt> And I remember thinking man, </garnt>
<garnt> he was really good at Halo Wars too. </garnt>
<garnt> That was weird. </garnt>
<connor> Then suddenly he's really good at chess. </connor>
<connor> He was amazing, and he
was winning a lot against </connor>
<connor> really really good players. </connor>
<connor> Bear in mind, when it got to this point </connor>
<garnt> it was pretty much me, him and eight kids </garnt>
<garnt> who were gonna go to Cambridge. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> The environment was really weird as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember just, that
was when I really started </garnt>
<garnt> to not enjoy chess anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that when I remember,
when I lost the game, </garnt>
<garnt> I got fucked bollocked by the coaches. </garnt>
<garnt> They were furious at me, because
they would take your sheet. </garnt>
<joey> Because this is when you had
to start writing it down, </joey>
<joey> they would take your sheet, </joey>
<garnt> and they would rinse you for your moves. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they would
watch you the whole game. </garnt>
<connor> So that's always an area above
where they can watch you. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> I remember if you made a move,
that was under five minutes. </connor>
<connor> That was a mistake. </connor>
<connor> You've got rinsed for it. </connor>
<connor> Because they were like, "You
didn't think long enough." </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - You've gotta go through the options. </connor>
<connor> Because it gets to the
point where you're like, </connor>
<garnt> you know that they're
thinking just as many moves </garnt>
<garnt> ahead as you are and it's
starting to get really difficult. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you're like, "Fuck,
I haven't studied enough </garnt>
<connor> at this point." </connor>
<connor> Because I never studied chess. </connor>
<connor> But this is where I was
getting to the point where, </connor>
<connor> I was against people who
are naturally pretty good </connor>
<connor> but also were studying
all the fucking time. </connor>
<connor> And it's just a really bad environment. </connor>
<connor> I really didn't like it. </connor>
<connor> I would finish my games
and I'd play Pokemon. </connor>
<connor> They would wanna talk about,
so why did you move rook </connor>
<connor> to F2, why did you do that? </connor>
<connor> Because he was really
impressive when he moved his... </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "I don't." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> We are playing chess
for eight hours today. </connor>
<joey> I do not wanna talk about
chess in between my games. </joey>
<joey> It was just a really... </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it was a really weird environment. </joey>
<garnt> I think, if I came into
chess later in my life </garnt>
<garnt> I would've had a more
healthy enjoyment of chess. </garnt>
<garnt> I still like to play it occasionally, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think I'm just scarred
from the anime experience </garnt>
<connor> that I had. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause that's what I find
so fascinating about chess, </garnt>
<garnt> is just talking to you and hearing </garnt>
<connor> about your chess story and
reading up and watching </connor>
<connor> Magnus Carlsen I think that's his name. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Magnus Carlsen, his one the best. </connor>
<connor> - His story and how you were just like... </connor>
<connor> You were just born and
you just got the game. </connor>
<connor> There are people who
just studied the game. </connor>
<connor> And then there are just
people who just are geniuses </connor>
<connor> and they don't know why. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking fascinating. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking fascinating to me. </connor>
<connor> - It was weird because you kind of... </connor>
<connor> No matter how good you are at something, </connor>
<connor> and how much raw talent
you have at something. </connor>
<connor> When you start competing
at such a high level, </connor>
<garnt> you start to realize that
it doesn't matter as much, </garnt>
<garnt> but also you meet people who also... </garnt>
<garnt> There might be 10 people in that country. </garnt>
<garnt> Who also have that same raw talent. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it's like fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause then it starts to
come to who can put them. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I didn't care about chess. </garnt>
<joey> I never cared about chess. </joey>
<joey> I was just good at it,
and I just played it. </joey>
<connor> - Such a thing that a
protagonist would say. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I never cared about chess. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas the protagonist
would have got to my point lost </connor>
<connor> and then been like, "I'm gonna
to dedicate my life to... </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Pokemon Ranger just came out, </garnt>
<connor> so I'm gonna start spinning around that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you took the [indistinct] route. </connor>
<joey> Where you're just like, "I
lost, end of the manga." </joey>
<joey> - And it was just kinda like... </joey>
<joey> It gets to that point in
your life, where you're like, </joey>
<joey> I don't need this anymore. </joey>
<joey> I remember my parents are so sad. </joey>
<connor> I don't know why my parents
were so invested in it. </connor>
<connor> I think it was a mixture of proud </connor>
<connor> and also they love bragging about it. </connor>
<connor> Why wouldn't you do that? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your series got
canceled from poor sales. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - I had a spin off. </garnt>
<connor> So what happened is about
when I was 16 or 17, </connor>
<connor> I had a rejuvenation of my enjoyment. </connor>
<connor> Do you remember a website
called MLG Game Battles? </connor>
<garnt> - I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was where you could
compete against cob, </garnt>
<garnt> but also Yahoo Chess. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember, I would compete
against fully grown men </garnt>
<garnt> and beat them on Yahoo Chess. </garnt>
<garnt> They'd get so pissed off. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<connor> and then joined the local pub, </connor>
<connor> and that was a weird experience. </connor>
<connor> So I joined the local pub
chest team and I remember... </connor>
<garnt> bear in mind they were all 80
to 40 year old men, always. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember one time I
was playing against a guy </garnt>
<connor> who looked Ross Kemp. </connor>
<connor> A skinhead, terrifying dude. </connor>
<connor> He's like this over the table. </connor>
<garnt> - Like a brick shit out. </garnt>
<connor> Every, every bouncer
you see at a nightclub. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm 15, 16, like this with my Coke. </connor>
<connor> And he had a pint and was smoking, </connor>
<connor> I'm there with my Coke,
occasionally checking my phone. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if that pissed him off </connor>
<connor> but in between moves, I wouldn't
look at what he was doing. </connor>
<connor> I would just check my phone. </connor>
<connor> And I would like... </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm normally thinking in my move. </connor>
<connor> So I don't really pay much
attention about doing it. </connor>
<connor> And I remember when I beat him </connor>
<connor> and he looked really fucking
angry and I was so scared. </connor>
<connor> I was, "Is he gonna hit me?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> He was like this on the table. </connor>
<connor> Like this. </connor>
<garnt> I can't believe you won. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't believe you've done this man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't believe you've done this. </garnt>
<connor> People didn't losing to a 15
year old, that happened a lot. </connor>
<connor> - I can understand, I get it. </connor>
<garnt> - But you know. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just really committed
to making this a manga mnow. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, please, cause from
a narrative perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many interesting ways </garnt>
<garnt> you could tackle chess just as a content. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna take that concept
of your friend being beaten </joey>
<connor> in the preliminary and
then just cut to the scene </connor>
<connor> where you're in the final. </connor>
<connor> And your friend is that
one guy who narrates </connor>
<garnt> all you'll moves. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a speed wagon. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct chatter) </garnt>
<connor> - He's like, he just did a [indistinct]. </connor>
<connor> He's like, what's an [indistinct] </connor>
<joey> is and then he just goes
along with the explanation. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, this is gonna sound so nerdy. </connor>
<garnt> There's one move in chess
that I always wanted to use. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know the name of it, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was the one where if someone moves </garnt>
<connor> their pawn to and then in front of... </connor>
<connor> If you move your Pawn 2,
and then move it 2 as well </connor>
<connor> that you can then take it. </connor>
<connor> - That's an [indistinct]. </connor>
<connor> - I always wanted to do that. </connor>
<garnt> - Dude using a castling
is Op, you always castle. </garnt>
<connor> That's all I remember. </connor>
<joey> It says, "Why did the castle there?" </joey>
<joey> It's like, I'll tell you why he's- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I remember they tried to teach us. </connor>
<garnt> They were like, "Why don't you use </garnt>
<garnt> the Indian Prince opening of 1970?" </garnt>
<connor> Because when I would do an opening move, </connor>
<connor> I always did the same opening
move because I just liked it. </connor>
<connor> It was nice and symmetrical, I liked it. </connor>
<connor> And they would always say
why did you use, this person? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, like I said, the
Indian Prince move of 1764. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What the fuck is that?" </connor>
<connor> I just like how the Bishop goes to boop. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Bishop goes, boop. </garnt>
<garnt> It just feels nice, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> It just feels nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's hard to explain
it when you're a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> because you're just
thinking four moves head. </garnt>
<connor> And you're like, if this goes
here, and this goes here, </connor>
<connor> and this goes here, then you go there. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's just how you see it, it was weird. </connor>
<connor> It's like any sport I imagine </connor>
<connor> where kids are really good at it. </connor>
<connor> And the adults are really pushy </connor>
<connor> and kind of almost borderline... </connor>
<connor> Some of the kids I'd say they had </connor>
<connor> a predatory relationship with it. </connor>
<connor> Because a lot of them, again, I said </connor>
<connor> they were very rich
parents whose kids went </connor>
<connor> to very good private schools </connor>
<garnt> and they were destined to
go to Cambridge or Oxford, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter what. </garnt>
<garnt> And they would, you know
exactly what I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> what kind of kids I'm talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the moment you spoke to them? </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, we're from a different world. </garnt>
<joey> It's really odd. </joey>
<joey> - Chess is like their
entire world to them. </joey>
<connor> It was something that
was forced upon them. </connor>
<joey> Cause it was, you know, </joey>
<garnt> it's something that
looks good on the resume </garnt>
<garnt> when you apply for Cambridge. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, to be fair it
got me a few good jobs </garnt>
<garnt> where it helped a lot. </garnt>
<connor> I remember some job interviews </connor>
<connor> where they liked playing chess,
and they would bring it up </connor>
<connor> and it was like, "Oh,
that's cute, you're good." </connor>
<connor> It was like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - That's cute. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's a really
interesting story that you have. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, bottom line is we need
to turn this into an anime. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Most definitely. </garnt>
<joey> - If someone was I want
to make a chess anime. </joey>
<joey> I would absolutely- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Just talk to Connor. </joey>
<joey> He has a very interesting story. </joey>
<joey> - If anyone would like a
free story, it's right here. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it's the perfect
chance to teach people </garnt>
<garnt> about how to play chess as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's a really good game, </connor>
<connor> and it's one of my
favorite things to sit down </connor>
<connor> and talk to someone about. </connor>
<connor> Just talk and then play chess. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's a really
good way to, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> just have fun. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And it's also fun beating people </connor>
<joey> who think they're good at chess. </joey>
<joey> That's pretty fun. </joey>
<joey> - Power trip. </joey>
<joey> - Because I'll meet people </joey>
<joey> who have just been studying chess. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's getting really
big on Twitch right now. </joey>
<joey> And you'll meet people who
they're really getting into it </joey>
<garnt> and then you just stomp them. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "Oh, well." </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, here's the thing,
here's the worst part </garnt>
<garnt> about chess professionally. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that you normally know </garnt>
<garnt> five or six moves in
if you've lost or not. </garnt>
<garnt> But you have to play it for
another two and a half hours </garnt>
<joey> and all it is </joey>
<joey> - Crappy. </joey>
<joey> - That's the difference
between casual chess </joey>
<joey> and professional chess. </joey>
<connor> Is that casually, you
always think you could win, </connor>
<connor> if you outsmart them. </connor>
<connor> Professional chess, it's just
how do I drag this out enough, </connor>
<connor> so that maybe they'll make a mistake. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh God it was awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - It sounds horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was awful, I hated it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it just got to the
point where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> what's the fucking point in this. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, being a troll online. </garnt>
<joey> I'm literally just being awkward. </joey>
<joey> - Just prolonging the inevitable. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's like,
"I fucked up, I fucked up </joey>
<connor> 30 minutes in and now I
gotta put up with this </connor>
<garnt> for two and a half hours." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's learning a game of league </garnt>
<connor> and then five minutes in your own side. </connor>
<connor> - Someones hinting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, someone's hinting, </connor>
<connor> the jungle is just AFK. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "Can I just FF now. </connor>
<connor> Can we just FF. </connor>
<garnt> This is a diamond game right now. </garnt>
<garnt> No one's going to make a mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember this, </garnt>
<connor> I never got praised for winning games. </connor>
<garnt> They would always be good job. </garnt>
<garnt> You know when they would praise me, </garnt>
<garnt> when I made it hell for the other person. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when I... </garnt>
<garnt> This poor girl, I dragged it
out and she made a mistake </garnt>
<garnt> to a stalemate. </garnt>
<garnt> This game went on for
3 hours and 20 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> or something ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> It was something fucking long. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember I'd lost an hour in 100%, </connor>
<connor> and I just made it awkward. </connor>
<connor> I wasn't playing to win anymore. </connor>
<connor> I was playing to make it awkward for her. </connor>
<connor> And so I did things that
you wouldn't normally do </connor>
<connor> to try and win. </connor>
<connor> You would just do it to block
everything that she did. </connor>
<joey> - To annoy them right? </joey>
<joey> - And I remember she
was getting so stressed </joey>
<joey> and I remember being like, </joey>
<connor> "This is kind of fun,
but also I hate this. </connor>
<connor> - This is torture. </connor>
<connor> - When I got back, it was coming back </connor>
<connor> into the football locker room. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> Nice one let's hit the shower son. </connor>
<connor> You really made it hell
for that 13 year old girl. </connor>
<connor> Congratulations Connor. </connor>
<garnt> I was just like, "Man,
that didn't feel good." </garnt>
<garnt> I got a stalemate. </garnt>
<garnt> I worked three hours for a stalemate. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you kidding me? </garnt>
<garnt> - Absolutely cock tease. </garnt>
<connor> - There's these other
worst ones there where... </connor>
<connor> I remember those people
who would constantly... </connor>
<connor> Cause you can ask for a draw. </connor>
<connor> You're like, do you want to draw? </connor>
<connor> And it would fuck my psychology up. </connor>
<connor> Because I was like, "Does
this mean I'm winning? </connor>
<joey> Does this mean his losing?" </joey>
<joey> And one time I remember
I regret it to this day. </joey>
<joey> I should have took the draw and I lost it. </joey>
<joey> He gave me an out. </joey>
<connor> - That's a learning experience man, </connor>
<connor> that's the character development we need. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I got a little trophy. </joey>
<garnt> If you won three games professionally, </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta a thing called a Wendy. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know what it was,
it was like a little- </joey>
<joey> - Why is it called a Wendy? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, it's just
says Wendy on the plaque. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a Wendy's burger. </joey>
<garnt> - It was just a Plaque
that just says a Wendy. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm sure there's some chess people </garnt>
<garnt> who know what this is,
but I have no idea what- </garnt>
<garnt> - Please, educate us. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was so confused. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, "Why does it not say my name? </connor>
<connor> I won these things." </connor>
<joey> - I'm not Wendy, I'm Connor. </joey>
<connor> - But I think also if you Google my name </connor>
<connor> I think my chest records come up- </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - If you dig deep enough. </connor>
<joey> People are gonna find them now. </joey>
<joey> You'll see exactly
which county and country </joey>
<connor> I was playing for. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't stalk him though. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there anything else
you guys wanna talk about? </connor>
<joey> - That was a huge detour, I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think we can
top that chess story. </joey>
<joey> That was an intense </joey>
<garnt> - We just watched the
entire anime, in like- </garnt>
<connor> - It's a story I love telling, </connor>
<garnt> but it's one of those
things where it's like, </garnt>
<connor> I can't bring it up if they're
not gonna be invested in it. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's such a long story. </connor>
<garnt> - But it's a really interesting story. </garnt>
<connor> I remember this last time you told me, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "We need to
talk about this publicly." </connor>
<connor> You've never talked. </connor>
<joey> - I bring it up occasionally. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine just being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I was a chess pro by accident." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "What do you mean you were
a chess player by accident." </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct chatter) </connor>
<connor> - Easy conversation starter. </connor>
<joey> - From a young age though. </joey>
<joey> I was just always really, really good </joey>
<connor> at video games as well. </connor>
<connor> It always just clicked. </connor>
<connor> I'd always just caught them. </connor>
<connor> To this day I normally get
video games super quickly. </connor>
<garnt> - You just have that talent man. </garnt>
<connor> - You're a tensai. </connor>
<joey> (indistinct chatter) </joey>
<garnt> - For me it was English. </garnt>
<connor> If they gamed English I'd have
been fucking pro at English. </connor>
<connor> If they'd have made it a
spelling fucking simulator. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's a good place to end it. </garnt>
<joey> - Thank you guys for watching. </joey>

a diverse episode of- </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, another thing, </garnt>
<garnt> so this episode wasn't scripted at all. </garnt>
<connor> And none of our episodes are scripted, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes we come in

<connor> "What if we just sit down- </connor>
<connor> - Let's just talk. </connor>
<connor> - Let's just sit down and start talking. </connor>

<connor> Because this is I think
our very first one, </connor>
<connor> that we just had nothing. planned </connor>
<connor> - We had nothing planned. </connor>
<connor> - We could have just sat here
in silence and just been like, </connor>
<connor> "So what'd you guys want to talk about." </connor>
<connor> - I guess what kind of
balance do you guys want of... </connor>
<connor> Because I mean we can do either. </connor>
<garnt> We're comfortable with doing either. </garnt>
<garnt> I think we're really interested to see </garnt>
