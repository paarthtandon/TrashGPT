<joey> - What kind of wave form </joey>
<joey> are we making today?
(electric guitar sound) </joey>
<joey> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. </joey>
<joey> Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. </joey>
<joey> - Let's make a penis wave form. </joey>
<joey> - Dude. </joey>
<joey> (upbeat music) </joey>
<connor> - Well, this is like "Squid Game". </connor>
<joey> - What?
- No, it's not. </joey>
<connor> - Says a lot about society. </connor>
<joey> - You can't just say
something is like something. </joey>
<connor> - Just say everything
is like "Squid Game". </connor>
<connor> That's like human now. </connor>
<joey> That's what makes me laugh. </joey>
<joey> - What's the meme?
I don't get the meme. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know.
- What's the punchline? </connor>
<joey> - That's the point. </joey>
<joey> It's like poo poo stinky. </joey>
<joey> - It's like an anti-joke. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Well, this says a lot about society. </joey>
<garnt> - It says a lot about society, </garnt>
<joey> when I have to explain an anti-joke. </joey>
<joey> - It says a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> - You just want to say it. </joey>
<joey> I just want to see the
context of this fucking meme. </joey>
<connor> - There is no context. </connor>
<connor> It's just like Peter Griffin, </connor>
<connor> just like leaning over in black and white. </connor>
<connor> And his like, "This says
a lot about society." </connor>
<joey> - This does say a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> - That has become a meme.
- That has become a meme. </joey>
<joey> - Says a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why it's become a meme. </joey>
<connor> But I'll be bored of it by
the time this episode airs. </connor>
<connor> - Like, there are some
anti-jokes that I get, </connor>
<joey> and then there are some that are just, </joey>
<joey> this isn't even bass boosted. </joey>
<connor> How can you find it funny? </connor>
<connor> - Give it a day and
you'll be laughing, I bet. </connor>
<joey> - Welcome society to another </joey>
<garnt> episode of "Trash Taste."
- For fucks sake Joey. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - It says a lot when they have to open </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> a "Trash Taste" episode like that. </joey>
<joey> - It says a lot.
- It does say. </joey>
<joey> I don't think it says enough. </joey>
<joey> - I am society member number one </joey>
<joey> with two more members of society. </joey>
<joey> Hello.
- Hello. </joey>
<joey> - Hello.
- Hello, hello. </joey>
<joey> You know what says a lot about society? </joey>
<joey> The fact that we don't
watch anime anymore. </joey>
<connor> - See, see, now you're
laughing at the joke. </connor>
<connor> See, now you're laughing at the joke. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just laughing at how
shit the fucking segway was. </joey>
<joey> - Did you just like
speed run, titular title. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, I think so.
I think so. </joey>
<joey> Okay, for once we gotten a
pretty interesting discussion </joey>
<joey> before we started turning on
the cameras and we were like- </joey>
<joey> - We're like, "Wait."
- ... "Wait." </joey>
<joey> - "Sh, save it for the episode." </joey>
<joey> - I think we should turn on the cameras </joey>
<joey> before we start- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true.
- ...talking. </joey>
<joey> - But instead we're talking about society. </joey>
<joey> - I can't believe we had a conversation, </joey>
<joey> and didn't try to monetize it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right?
- What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - I just don't talk
unless the camera is on. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm a professional podcaster. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was basically ranting how, </joey>
<connor> I don't watch anime nowadays. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you guys know that anyway. </joey>
<joey> - That's not a revelation.
- [Joey] No. </joey>
<joey> - But I think that a lot of people </joey>
<joey> think it just because like
I've fallen out of it. </joey>
<connor> It's not that.
It's just like, </connor>
<connor> I find so much anime, </connor>
<connor> just so goddamn boring now. </connor>
<joey> - I just find, </joey>
<joey> it's not even about it being boring. </joey>
<joey> It's just redundant. </joey>
<joey> I just feel like it really
says a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> See, he laughed, see liked the meme. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, why does it say a
lot about society, Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> I want to hear your explanation. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just, he was going
to say, he was going to say, </joey>
<garnt> it says a lot about anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was going to say, "It
really says a lot about anime." </garnt>
<garnt> But then the moment I said,
"It really says a lot." </garnt>
<garnt> It just like, it was like, it was like. </garnt>
<joey> - That was like the
100% unintentional pun. </joey>
<connor> - I support this, okay, go on, go on. </connor>
<joey> - It really says a lot about anime, </joey>
<joey> when all it takes is for
me to read a synopsis. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I could probably
tell you with 90% accuracy </joey>
<joey> what the first three
episodes of that anime </joey>
<joey> is going to be about. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Not even in like, </joey>
<joey> an arty farty general type of
way, like in a detailed way. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I would like to preface, </connor>
<connor> since we have to preface every argument. </connor>
<garnt> You know, there's always
like one or two shows </garnt>
<garnt> that are good.
- [Joey] Yes. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that are entertaining. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course.
- No, all anime sucks. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But like there is just </joey>
<joey> so much like mediocre stuff </joey>
<joey> that is so uninspired, </joey>
<joey> and just rehashing of
what we've seen before. </joey>
<connor> Just kind of jumping off
successful characters, </connor>
<connor> and premises we've had before. </connor>
<connor> I was talking to Joe earlier, I was like, </connor>
<connor> there's so many characters now, </connor>
<connor> I feel like I've watched so many anime. </connor>
<connor> Like, I get the power fantasy ones, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, </connor>
<connor> I understand that the point is, </connor>
<joey> is that they went to be all powerful, </joey>
<joey> and they can't fuck up.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like, is that always that fun? </joey>
<joey> Like, is it always like, great? </joey>
<garnt> Like sometimes I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> can you have like a flaw or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like something that
makes you a little human. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that, I'm not like bored
out of my mind watching you. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, Saitama is bold, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- That's flawed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a flawed.
- That's a flaw in itself. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - I can relate, man. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that I think the reason
why power fantasies are just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they make the most like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Perfect main characters," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because it, if they had flaws, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it would completely go against </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the point of it being a power fantasy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, why would I want to self insert </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> myself into this all powerful character, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> if this character, </joey>
<joey> that is supposed to be
the better version of me </joey>
<joey> also makes mistakes, right? </joey>
<joey> I get that. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, that's fine, if
you're self inserting, </joey>
<joey> but not every person who
watches shows like that </joey>
<joey> wants to self insert." </joey>
<joey> They just want to watch a
character that is completely </joey>
<joey> independent from them, </joey>
<joey> go through this adventure
or whatever, right? </joey>
<joey> But I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, </joey>
<joey> I feel like I'm like the
spokesperson for like that- </joey>
<garnt> - Go on, go on go on.
- ...that kind of anime. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I completely recognize that. </joey>
<joey> The problem with anime nowadays is that, </joey>
<joey> one, there is so much of it. </joey>
<joey> And number two, </joey>
<joey> a lot of it is what I just
call "Cold Disposable Shows." </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Where, </joey>
<joey> it's just not even like a show anymore. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's just content. </joey>
<joey> It's just something you consume, right. </joey>
<garnt> So, that's how I view
a lot of Isekai, right. </garnt>
<garnt> The reason I watch a lot of Isekai, </garnt>
<garnt> is because it's exactly the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not going to remember most of them, </garnt>
<garnt> but I get the same kind of experience. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the same region as
what I see people watching, </garnt>
<garnt> "Trash TV shows" for, </garnt>
<garnt> like trash reality shows. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know what
you're getting with say, </garnt>
<garnt> "Kitchen Nightmares" or "Hell's Kitchen," </garnt>
<garnt> or, something along those lines, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just a repeatable format. </garnt>
<garnt> Gordon Ramsey comes to a restaurant, </garnt>
<garnt> and surprise, surprise
the restaurant sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's why I also don't
watch shows like that, either. </garnt>
<connor> They're the exact same. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a massive market. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely.
- I agree. </connor>
<connor> In some senses, but
then it also feels like, </connor>
<connor> especially Isekai is just like, so inbred. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like they don't
take from anything else. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Yeah.
- They just keep fucking. </connor>
<connor> - Incest. </connor>
<garnt> They just keep having in with these shows. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is incentious. </garnt>
<connor> - Where is the incest card? </connor>
<connor> - But like these shows
when I'm watching them, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> it just feels like, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> the shows aren't trying to
take from anything interesting. </connor>
<connor> - They're all just taking
from the successful show </connor>
<connor> in their own category. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right? </connor>
<connor> So, I kind of feel like
I'm just losing my mind, </connor>
<connor> watching these shows where like, </connor>
<connor> no one even tries to do anything
even remotely different. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's the issue of like anime
that is inspired by anime. </joey>
<joey> Like Isekai as a genre, </joey>
<joey> is basically just like a self sucking, </joey>
<joey> like circle where, </joey>
<joey> is it ouroboros where-
- [Joey] Yeah, ouroboros. </joey>
<joey> - ...it's like the fucking
snake eating itself. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, it is. </joey>
<joey> - It is an ouroboros. </joey>
<joey> And that's why, again, like
it just feels derivative. </joey>
<joey> You watch a show that
is supposedly brand new. </joey>
<joey> - And I just read through
the synopsis and I go, </joey>
<joey> I feel like I've seen
this show about 10 times. </joey>
<connor> - I'm glad that you say that, sorry Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Just because I feel like
if I was just saying that, </connor>
<joey> I feel like some people might argue </joey>
<joey> there's a language difference going on </joey>
<joey> where I can't fully understand </joey>
<connor> the nuance of these characters. </connor>
<joey> - Like, every time I go
to a bookstore, right. </joey>
<joey> And I'm trying to find something new, </joey>
<joey> and I go over to the Light Novel section. </joey>
<joey> Because I always want
to say like, you know, </joey>
<joey> what's popular.
- [Garnt] What's popping. </joey>
<joey> What's popping, right? </joey>
<joey> - Because I'm just curious. </joey>
<joey> It's like, okay, </joey>
<joey> maybe there's like a
change or something, right. </joey>
<joey> I go over and I see all these new titles </joey>
<joey> I've never heard of. </joey>
<joey> And I just look at the title
and I look at the covers, </joey>
<joey> and I go, </joey>
<joey> "How is this title and cover </joey>
<joey> any different to the one next to it?" </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like it doesn't. </joey>
<joey> They just look like
spinoffs of each other. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Just from the feel, </joey>
<joey> and even going through the synopsis, </joey>
<joey> I just think to myself, </joey>
<joey> it's like this book right here, </joey>
<joey> was inspired by the
book sitting next to it, </joey>
<joey> and vice versa. </joey>
<joey> There's no difference. </joey>
<joey> It's just a reskin of the same thing. </joey>
<joey> So, every time, I do like </joey>
<joey> the "What Will I Be Watching," </joey>
<joey> which is where, you know, I
go to the next season, right. </joey>
<joey> - Biggest lie of the century. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, </joey>
<joey> but nowadays the reason why
I still continue that show </joey>
<joey> on my channel, </joey>
<joey> it's not because I actually sit through, </joey>
<joey> and watch all the anime I talk about, </joey>
<joey> it so that I can hopefully
find that one show, </joey>
<joey> that would actually be non derivative, </joey>
<joey> and somewhat interesting for
me to actually go and watch. </joey>
<joey> - Which is why I feel
like the Isekai genre </joey>
<joey> right now especially, </joey>
<joey> like, the show that I'm
like been bigging up so much </joey>
<joey> is "Mushoku Tensei". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's the Isekai that basically started, </joey>
<joey> the whole Isekai Light
Novel trend in terms of, </joey>
<joey> this is the one series that,
from what I can see has like, </joey>
<joey> this is the one progenitor
for all the tropes, </joey>
<joey> or a lot of the tropes that you've seen, </joey>
<joey> and like watching the anime adaptation, </joey>
<joey> which is airing right now. </joey>
<joey> It's just a really fucking good show. </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying it's a
good show for an Isekai. </joey>
<joey> It's just a really good show. </joey>
<joey> - It's a great fucking fantasy. </joey>
<joey> - So, I've started
watching "Mushoku Tensei". </joey>
<joey> I'm like halfway through the first season, </joey>
<joey> because it's season two right now, right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's season two right now, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, I started watching the first season </joey>
<joey> just because Garnt and a bunch
of other people were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this is the one that started it all." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Bet, I'll check it out." </joey>
<joey> And yeah, I completely agree. </joey>
<joey> You can see where all of
the origins of what made </joey>
<joey> the Isekai genre was so great came from. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, as you said, it's just a good show. </joey>
<joey> - Like with so many Isekai, </joey>
<joey> and so many of these
disposable anime nowadays, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the first episode airs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the anime is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "You know how it is, you know how it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> We don't need to explain shit. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't need to like build up
the world or the characters, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, this character
archetype, you know, this world." </garnt>
<garnt> I remember watching the first
episode of "Mushoku Tensei". </garnt>
<garnt> And they spent like a whole episode </garnt>
<garnt> where they're building up this character, </garnt>
<joey> and how he dies, </joey>
<joey> and how he's a baby, </joey>
<joey> and how he like wakes up in this world. </joey>
<joey> And he's just like figuring out the world, </joey>
<joey> even though in every other Isekai, </joey>
<joey> they're just like, </joey>
<joey> dies, Isekai, it's like five minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It really says a lot when
I've watched some Isekai. </joey>
<garnt> Shut up. </garnt>
<joey> - It really says a lot of Isekai. </joey>
<joey> - It really says a lot
about Isekai society. </joey>
<joey> When I start up a show, just
the generic Isekai show, </joey>
<joey> just wanting to see what it is. </joey>
<joey> And I think I'm watching episode one, </joey>
<joey> but it feels like I'm
halfway through the season. </joey>
<joey> - Just because they just
assume you already know </joey>
<joey> all these tropes. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like, </joey>
<joey> are you not going to try and make it </joey>
<joey> unique or interesting, </joey>
<joey> or explain anything about the world? </joey>
<joey> Do you just assume that
everyone who watches the show </joey>
<joey> already has seen the show
in some of the forms? </joey>
<joey> - Because sometimes you
also watch an anime as well, </joey>
<joey> where you can tell that the
people behind this like, </joey>
<joey> put a lot of effort into this. </joey>
<joey> There's like, </joey>
<joey> that extra tinge, </joey>
<joey> that extra sparkle that, you know. </joey>
<joey> - You can say when an anime </joey>
<joey> is just like clearly thrown together. </joey>
<joey> - Like, from "Mushoku Tensei" for example, </joey>
<joey> like, you know with a lot
of anime that they speak. </joey>
<joey> Where the character speak
a different language, </joey>
<joey> and they just don't even bother. </joey>
<joey> And they translate it back into Japanese, </joey>
<joey> even though the characters are not </joey>
<joey> technically speaking Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - I hate that.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, in "Mushoku Tensei", </joey>
<joey> they didn't just make up one language. </joey>
<joey> They made up two separate, </joey>
<joey> fantasy made up languages for this show, </joey>
<joey> which is used in the show. </joey>
<joey> And I've never seen that
with any other anime, </joey>
<joey> especially not any other
Isekai fantasy anime, </joey>
<joey> where the characters are actually speaking </joey>
<joey> to like the fantasy characters
in their own language, </joey>
<joey> which is just a made up Isekai language, </joey>
<joey> or made up fantasy language, </joey>
<joey> and then different species
have different languages. </joey>
<joey> So, they literally have just
made up two separate languages. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> this is the shit that not
like everyone will appreciate, </joey>
<joey> but this is one big indicator that </joey>
<joey> the people producing these
show really gives a shit. </joey>
<connor> - Shit like Welsh or something. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like Icelandic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they made this shit up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Because you want "Vinland Saga", right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so, do you
remember that scene where </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't Askeladd, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was Thorfinn talking
to some French people </garnt>
<garnt> with also English people there, </garnt>
<connor> and Thorfinn is also from Scandinavian, </connor>
<connor> whatever the Scandinavian languages is, </connor>
<connor> but they were all speaking
Japanese to each other. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that was really boring. </connor>
<connor> I really hated it.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And they were all speaking Japanese </connor>
<joey> telling each other how
they can't understand </joey>
<joey> what each other are saying.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Even though they were
all speaking Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And I was like, </joey>
<joey> this is "Vinland Saga",
fucking amazing, amazing anime, </joey>
<joey> but the little things like that </joey>
<joey> are just like immersion breaking. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it really does make a difference. </joey>
<joey> And that's what I would argue </joey>
<joey> some of the greatest
fantasy stories out there </joey>
<joey> is what made it so in. </joey>
<joey> I mean like, could you imagine, </joey>
<joey> if you will watching
fucking Lord of the rings. </joey>
<joey> - And just Elven, wasn't
just spoken at all. </joey>
<garnt> And like, every character
is speaking to the Elvens </garnt>
<garnt> in English. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that one could be
such immersion breaking. </garnt>
<joey> And it would also just completely
ruin the world building. </joey>
<connor> - Right, even like Netflix dramas, right. </connor>
<connor> They'll sometimes have
like four or five language, </connor>
<garnt> different casts and
everything all on site. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's like something
that I always get. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> Like I appreciate a fuck ton. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love that. </garnt>
<garnt> - But in anime it just feels like </garnt>
<joey> that never ever happens. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - I know it's happened a few times. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember which ones. </joey>
<joey> I Know it has, </joey>
<joey> but it has just never rarely happens. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it just sucks this well, though. </joey>
<joey> I feel the main reason why a lot of anime </joey>
<joey> just opt to not do that </joey>
<joey> is just because they think, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, the audience isn't
going to be fucked." </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I think most </joey>
<joey> in an ideal world they
would like to do it, </joey>
<joey> but it's just, </joey>
<joey> there's so much anime being made now </joey>
<joey> there are so much being made
under like a big time crunch. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That is true as well. </joey>
<connor> - I wonder with the whole anime thing. </connor>
<connor> Is it like a natural thing? </connor>
<connor> If me as an anime fan, </connor>
<joey> who's watched anime for a very long time, </joey>
<joey> to get bored of anime? </joey>
<joey> Is it a natural occurrence? </joey>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - Or is it that I'm being picky? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Would you say you're
growing out of anime? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think am growing out. </joey>
<joey> - Dare I say. </joey>
<joey> - Well, this says a lot about society. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does say a lot about society, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One thing that says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like a lot of anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of anime do this is kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disguise of like, "We're not for kids," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then you watch it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you watch the character
dialogue and how they talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> And you're like only a
teenager would think like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is how people talk to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is not like a real conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> That's where like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I hate to use a Western example, </garnt>
<garnt> but like "Castlevania," </garnt>
<garnt> like the script in "Castlevania"
was so goddamn good. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The character interactions
in "Castlevania" was so good. </garnt>
<joey> Like I wanted to know more
about these characters. </joey>
<joey> Every time they spoke, </joey>
<joey> even the ones I didn't like. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I agree.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Every character when
they spoke about anything </joey>
<joey> was anime fucking delight. </joey>
<joey> But in anime it's always just like, </joey>
<joey> it's got to serve the plot if it doesn't, </joey>
<joey> it's all about tits or funny. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, like me being a peep. </joey>
<joey> And like I was saying earlier as well, </joey>
<joey> another thing I really dislike, right? </joey>
<joey> Lelouch is like, </joey>
<joey> anime's favorite character. </joey>
<joey> And it really fucking shows. </joey>
<joey> Because like there's so many characters </joey>
<joey> that are like Lelouch, right. </joey>
<joey> But like fail to see, </joey>
<joey> what made Lelouch so good, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like diet Lelouch. </joey>
<joey> - Lelouch is good to me. </joey>
<joey> - What did make Lelouch good then? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - One, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> First of all, you get lured in with this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my God, he's a genius," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- That he's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> He's sick, bro.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - He's strong. </joey>
<joey> And then you realize he's a psychopath, </joey>
<joey> and that he's scared as well. </joey>
<joey> Like anyone else in this world. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the thing that I find that a lot of, </joey>
<joey> and you know, even like Light, right? </joey>
<joey> Light in Death Note. </joey>
<joey> Light makes mistakes.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Light worries, Light panics,
Light freaks out, right? </joey>
<joey> Like with a lot of these
power fantasy shows </joey>
<joey> where they try and make a character </joey>
<joey> that like resembles or takes from that. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> I find that most of
the time it's so boring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's absolutely no
other character trait to them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe the one thing they're sad about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like the Saitama thing where like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I'm so strong, it's boring."
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But even then the way
that One Punch Man does it, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> is really tasteful. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know how to describe how. </connor>
<joey> - It's because the show
doesn't take itself seriously. </joey>
<connor> - Right, Saitama does it in a way </connor>
<connor> that's kind of like really
fun and really playful, </connor>
<connor> that doesn't really take itself too much. </connor>
<connor> But anytime I watched
these power fantasy shows, </connor>
<joey> I feel like my brain is rotting. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm watching it, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd rather watch Big Ed have
like some mental breakdown, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on 90 Day Fiance.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I don't know how to put it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I feel like animate
treats me like I'm stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> and I hate that.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - A lot of anime shows
do check the audience </connor>
<joey> like they're stupid.
- Yeah, I hate it. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe because a lot of them are. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jojo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> assumes I'm stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then doesn't give a
fuck and carries on any way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like Jojo doesn't care. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> It's fucking stupid.
But I love it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I was
telling these boys earlier </connor>
<connor> that I've recently had
to start watching anime, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> or like two 2 times
speed or 1.5 times speed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because 1 time speed is so boring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is like fucking insane to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> And I don't watch it at
that point for enjoyment. </joey>
<joey> - It's just to consume, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's just for like my seasonal videos </joey>
<joey> where I do have to watch everything. </joey>
<joey> I remember it got to a point
like two, three years ago </joey>
<joey> where you look at the seasonal
chart and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "If I watched everything on this chart, </joey>
<joey> I literally be watching
two seasons worth of anime </joey>
<joey> every week, </joey>
<joey> just to keep up with
every show being aired." </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry to go on.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's just impossible to actually consume, </joey>
<joey> or watch everything coming out now. </joey>
<joey> That's why a lot of it's just
disposable shit, honestly. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Go on. </joey>
<joey> - No, I was about to say, you know, </joey>
<joey> that's I guess like one
of the biggest criticisms </joey>
<joey> I get about like Joey doesn't watch anime. </joey>
<joey> It's like, yeah, because I can't. </joey>
<joey> There's so much shit out there. </joey>
<joey> So much of it is so derivative </joey>
<joey> that I would dead ass rather go back, </joey>
<garnt> and watch shows that I didn't get to watch </garnt>
<garnt> all those years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> or shows that came out before
I was even born, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I'd much rather spend the time on that </garnt>
<garnt> there is in fact less of a
selection all those years ago </garnt>
<garnt> than there is every single year, </garnt>
<garnt> like new shows coming out, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, like I'm
limited with my time, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to spend, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking you know, 20
hours of the day watching- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, fuck that. </garnt>
<garnt> - ... anime bunch of
shit that I'm not going </garnt>
<connor> to remember next week </connor>
<joey> because it's so fucking
mediocre, and redundant. </joey>
<connor> - You always do like Isekais. </connor>
<joey> You do the anime, the
seasonal anime videos, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - And like, I'm going to watch them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, you know.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm watching, I watch them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I feel like after
I've watched them now, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> you'll always like talk about </joey>
<joey> a show or two that sounds amazing. </joey>
<joey> And then I'll never hear you
ever mentioned ever again. </joey>
<connor> What's up with that? </connor>
<joey> - What's up with that? </joey>
<joey> Well, I talk about shows
that have potential, right. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - And a lot of them might not, </joey>
<joey> might not say pan out and some of them do. </joey>
<joey> - They might fizzle out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they might fizzle out. </joey>
<joey> That's why I do like my
end of year videos as well, </joey>
<joey> which is just like, </joey>
<joey> okay, these are the shows
that I actually stuck with, </joey>
<joey> because they're okay. </joey>
<joey> So, there are some good
shows that air every season, </joey>
<joey> but then there are some shows
that I feel are just the best </joey>
<joey> and are best consumed via anime, right. </joey>
<joey> There are some shows that
have interesting concepts </joey>
<joey> that I call like Manga
recommendation shows, </joey>
<joey> which is I watched like
the first two episodes. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, this is really interesting, </joey>
<joey> but like, you know what, </joey>
<joey> it's just like an average adaptation. </joey>
<joey> So, what happens is I just
go off and read the Manga, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "Cool. </joey>
<joey> I don't need to watch the anime anymore." </joey>
<joey> - I have a much better experience
reading the Manga, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That does happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you just watch a
show and you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can get this exact same
experience, just reading Manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> And then you do.
And then you're like, great. </connor>
<connor> The seasonal anime did its job </connor>
<joey> as a Manga recommendation channel. </joey>
<connor> - It's like something about reading Manga, </connor>
<connor> that is way more palatable
for shitty shows. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> I think when these
characters are so boring, </connor>
<joey> because I can just speed run through </joey>
<connor> their boring ass dialogue, </connor>
<connor> and it's like way more enjoyable. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I think it's
because there are more </joey>
<joey> like places or more factors in anime </joey>
<joey> that leave for a larger room for error. </joey>
<joey> Because the only thing you
have to really worry about </joey>
<joey> with a Manga is the dialogue
and the artwork and the story. </joey>
<joey> But whereas with anime, </joey>
<joey> you have things like voice
acting to worry about. </joey>
<joey> You have things like
sequencing to worry about, </joey>
<joey> you have things, animation
and fucking music. </joey>
<joey> And like there's all these
other factors that could make </joey>
<joey> that show look and feel way more mediocre </joey>
<joey> than the core of the show. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, which is why like, </joey>
<joey> I rarely read Manga that
hasn't been released yet </joey>
<joey> because I do feel even now </joey>
<joey> that I'm reading more Manga, </joey>
<joey> that if there's a good anime adaptation, </joey>
<joey> it's just untouched.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like a good anime
adaptation of a good Manga, </joey>
<joey> fucking untouched. </joey>
<joey> I'd rather experience the
anime first time hand, </joey>
<joey> which is why when these
anime do get released, </joey>
<joey> and I see one or two episodes, </joey>
<joey> that's all I need some see to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, this is going to
be a mediocre adaptation. </joey>
<joey> I'm just going to read the Manga." </joey>
<joey> There's so many shows right now, </joey>
<joey> which I feel like you
can just read the Manga, </joey>
<joey> and you'll be completely fine with. </joey>
<joey> But they're all just like
those one or two gems </joey>
<joey> every season, or like most seasons </joey>
<joey> where you're just like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, this is a banger. </joey>
<joey> I'm glad anime exists because
of these fucking shows." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- True. </joey>
<joey> Like "Attack on Titan"
is one of those, right? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, 100%, I
love "Attack on Titan". </connor>
<joey> - I can not read the Manga
for "Attack on Titan." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I refuse to read it. </joey>
<joey> I hope we're not spoiling this. </joey>
<joey> Not to demerit anyone
who does read the Manga, </joey>
<joey> but I just feel like
"Attack on Titan" anime </joey>
<joey> is the best way to like
experience that story. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I agree. </joey>
<joey> - I can't imagine getting like </joey>
<joey> the emotional highs I did </joey>
<joey> with the story without having
watched it in the anime first. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and again, </joey>
<joey> it's because I feel that because
of the added factors that </joey>
<joey> make an anime different from a Manga, </joey>
<joey> like the animation, </joey>
<joey> the voice acting the music. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - In the case with the "Attack on Titan," </joey>
<garnt> all of those were fucking amazing. </garnt>
<joey> So, it just heightened. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, don't get angry about the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's the thing, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like those like anime only factors </garnt>
<joey> only heightened an already
great story and characters. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - So, that's why I feel you just get </joey>
<joey> a better experience with the anime. </joey>
<joey> But a lot of anime
adaptations can't do that. </joey>
<joey> In fact, they pull it down sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> Which is why, like, I there's
some shows where like, </joey>
<joey> I know it's going to like
slap like "Chainsaw Man." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's one show where I'm
like, I could read the Manga. </joey>
<joey> Because I know it's a
fucking amazing Manga. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't want to, go on. </joey>
<joey> - But I want to wait. </joey>
<joey> I want to wait for the anime adaptation. </joey>
<joey> - See, but that's good though </joey>
<joey> that you guys are waiting </joey>
<joey> because in case it sucks, </joey>
<joey> you have a great Manga to look forward to. </joey>
<joey> - True, true. </joey>
<joey> - So, it's just a win for you guys, right? </joey>
<joey> For me, it's like, </joey>
<joey> I've already read the
Manga multiple times now. </joey>
<joey> So, like I'm scared that my experience </joey>
<joey> could go really far down, </joey>
<joey> or it could just keep getting better. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm at a gambling stage right now. </joey>
<joey> For you guys it's like, I
don't care what the plot is, </joey>
<joey> I'm taking fucking taking over the Manga. </joey>
<connor> - I want to like anime, I do. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to watch more, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I really do, and I feel bad that like. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like part of the
reason you don't watch more </joey>
<connor> is because it's like harder
for you to watch more now </connor>
<connor> living in Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> - That too. </connor>
<connor> - Because you have to go out of your away. </connor>
<joey> Because everything you've
watched is on Netflix now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> A big thing for me with watching stuff </connor>
<joey> is like being comfortable. </joey>
<joey> Like I don't want to watch
something at my computer desk. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do not want to do that.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I like to Chromecast
things as we all know. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I like to Chromecast things. </joey>
<joey> And I mean, I can do with anime. </joey>
<joey> It's just a lot more annoying to do it. </joey>
<joey> You know, Control doesn't work in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And so you've to get
through a lot of layers, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> and Chromecast doesn't work
with VPNs unless you have like, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> it's a whole fucking mess. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - But there are obviously there's ways. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Netflix is a very like hassle free. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I don't have to think. </connor>
<connor> Everything just works nicely. </connor>
<connor> I know that's so, normie
of me, I know that's normie </connor>
<joey> but it works. </joey>
<joey> - No, but like, I've been slowly starting </joey>
<connor> to feel the same way. </connor>
<connor> - Because you value your time
and mild frustration is like, </connor>
<joey> my house could burn down, </joey>
<joey> whatever we'll deal with it. </joey>
<joey> That's a big problem, right. </joey>
<connor> I'll be devastated. </connor>
<connor> But there's something about
mild annoyances that get to me </connor>
<connor> on an emotional level way
more than like devastated. </connor>
<joey> - Are you're saying that
your house burning down </joey>
<joey> is a mild inconvenience. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You said your house burning down </joey>
<joey> like it was a mild annoyance.
- Both. </joey>
<garnt> If my house burnt down, we'll be fine. </garnt>
<connor> - Why did it sound like
your house burning down </connor>
<joey> is the same equivalent to
like, "Oh, I ran out of milk." </joey>
<connor> - I have a very good insurance
policy, okay, Joey, I know. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean like something about like massive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like really big annoying things happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I don't know why it's like
easier for me to deal with, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> but like really annoying little things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like you can't quite complain about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's not big enough to be a problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Except on this podcast.
- It's just always annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, except on this podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> It's just a little bit annoying. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's why for me, </joey>
<joey> if there's one thing that
will get me frustrated </joey>
<joey> every single fucking
time without question, </joey>
<joey> it's just dealing with
small issues in tech. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It kills everything for me. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that annoys me more than like, </joey>
<joey> I'm not a very like, ragey angry person, </joey>
<joey> but that is one thing </joey>
<joey> that will get me pissed off every time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - By the way, if you haven't noticed </joey>
<joey> the lighting is a little bit different </joey>
<joey> because our WiFi isn't working
in this office right now. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, speaking of techy shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> You just reminded me, </garnt>
<garnt> and like having to try and fucking debug, </garnt>
<garnt> and deal with the WiFi
issues and this office, </garnt>
<garnt> which we haven't fucking figured
out what the issue is yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Has just like put me in
this like rage inducing </garnt>
<joey> fucking coma, I swear to God. </joey>
<joey> - That's why though like, </joey>
<joey> my PC set up at home, </joey>
<joey> is like quite complicated. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of stuff. </joey>
<joey> A lot of moving things. </joey>
<joey> A lot of wires. </joey>
<joey> I have like two externally
powered USB ports </joey>
<joey> that are all full. </joey>
<joey> I have like 15 plugs taken out. </joey>
<joey> Like this shit isn't like
a fire hazard problem, </joey>
<joey> I don't even know. </joey>
<joey> - Are you running the fucking
White House from your place? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - When one thing goes wrong,
it like fucks everything up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to deal with so many
tech issues for like streaming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or making YouTube videos or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I just don't want to
deal with tech issues, </connor>
<connor> when I want to relax. </connor>
<connor> It brings me back into work. </connor>
<joey> - This brings me back
into my engineering phase, </joey>
<joey> where you turn on something, </joey>
<garnt> you turn on a device and
something doesn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> Or you write a piece of code
and something doesn't work. </garnt>
<joey> It doesn't render out correctly. </joey>
<joey> And you're just like, </joey>
<joey> "Great, so how do I figure
out what's going on?" </joey>
<joey> And you just have to go through everything </joey>
<joey> one by one by one. </joey>
<joey> I remember, </joey>
<joey> because since I've been trying
to set up my new office, </joey>
<joey> and do like a proper streaming
set up and everything </joey>
<joey> like that, I'm just like, "Wow." </joey>
<joey> I can see why people complain
about cable management. </joey>
<garnt> Because before when I moved to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like one computer,
two monitors, speakers done. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't care about streaming. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't care about that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Now we're like doing all
sorts of different things. </garnt>
<garnt> You've got to worry about lighting. </garnt>
<garnt> You're worried about all
these different plugs. </garnt>
<garnt> You've got to worry about,
you know, the GoXLR, </garnt>
<garnt> all this, like, there's
so many different devices </garnt>
<garnt> on our desk now. </garnt>
<garnt> And as I was setting up. </garnt>
<garnt> I overestimated how fast
it would take to like set </garnt>
<garnt> everything up in a neat package, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It took me like four days. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, like I set everything up. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, let's like cable
manage this entire thing." </garnt>
<garnt> Spend the entire day trying to like </garnt>
<garnt> cable manage everything, super neatly, </garnt>
<garnt> setting up all my devices. </garnt>
<garnt> So, they are like optimally placed. </garnt>
<garnt> Set everything up, do
it for an entire day. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I forget, </garnt>
<garnt> that my desk is a standing desk, </garnt>
<garnt> and I've been setting it up
during the sitting position. </garnt>
<garnt> And so what I did is, I set everything up. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Great," check
my emails, stand up. </garnt>
<connor> - Everything breaks. </connor>
<connor> - And then the screen
just like turns to black, </connor>
<connor> and everything falls down. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, "oh, my God." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like maybe
YouTube is overrated. </connor>
<connor> Maybe streaming is overrated.
- Here the thing, </connor>
<joey> if people don't tell you about
cable management too, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> When you, when you put
it all in like one braid, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you put it all together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> When you want to change one
cable, that shit fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to take everything
apart and then find the cable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like between like the
nested, all the shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> And then you're like, all right. </connor>
<connor> Maybe being neat is just not worth it. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I should be fucking messy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, my idea of cable
management in my place, </joey>
<garnt> is just take all of the wires, </garnt>
<garnt> and just get them off the ground. </garnt>
<garnt> That way the Roomba doesn't
fucking suck up the wires. </garnt>
<joey> It looks clean. </joey>
<joey> I can easily vacuum under there. </joey>
<joey> I'm happy about that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like I streamed </joey>
<joey> for like the first time
in months yesterday. </joey>
<joey> - Congratulations. </joey>
<joey> - For this chess stream, </joey>
<joey> and pretty much everything that
could go wrong did go wrong </joey>
<joey> when I pressed the go live button. </joey>
<joey> So, I set up my stream set up, right? </joey>
<joey> Set everything up, tested
everything the day before, </joey>
<joey> because I know what it's like. </joey>
<joey> I know how temperamental equipment is. </joey>
<joey> So, I tested everything
before I went to sleep. </joey>
<joey> Everything was working fine. </joey>
<joey> I wake up. </joey>
<joey> I didn't even turn the computer off. </joey>
<joey> I put it into sleep mode
because I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Don't fucking up the settings. </joey>
<joey> Don't fucking up the settings." </joey>
<joey> This is the first time I'm
going live in my new office. </joey>
<joey> I know something's going to go wrong, </joey>
<joey> but I hope it doesn't go wrong too bad. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, I go live, </joey>
<joey> I put on the starting screen, </joey>
<garnt> starting soon screen, </garnt>
<garnt> everything's going well. </garnt>
<garnt> I switched to my camera. </garnt>
<garnt> It's black. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Oh no, oh fucking no." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Okay," </garnt>
<joey> turn the camera on off. </joey>
<joey> So, the camera we use is
a DSLR with a cam link, </joey>
<connor> which is what we use for
"Trash Taste" stream. </connor>
<joey> - Cam link is just saying that you connect </joey>
<connor> a camera to a PC basically. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, I try restarting the camera and OBS, </joey>
<joey> I try turning the camera
physically on and off. </joey>
<joey> Nothing. </joey>
<joey> Nothing seems to be working. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck, I think I just need
to restart the computer." </joey>
<joey> I turned the computer off, </joey>
<joey> restart the computer. </joey>
<joey> For some reason, the computer's
not detecting cam link. </joey>
<joey> It's not detecting the cable. </joey>
<joey> So I go under. </joey>
<joey> Keep in mind, the fucking
chat it's just like, </joey>
<joey> "What the is going on?" </joey>
<joey> - It's the worst when
it's happening with a chat </joey>
<joey> getting on your ass about it. </joey>
<joey> - Look like log on, stream, </joey>
<garnt> it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is under like the time crunch of, </garnt>
<garnt> I just went live, people
already waiting for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I've tweeted this shit out. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so I go under the
table and I look out. </garnt>
<garnt> At this point, I'm in panic mode. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I just take out all
of my cable management, </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like just fucking explodes. </garnt>
<garnt> There's just like an explosion of wires. </garnt>
<garnt> And I have to like, </garnt>
<garnt> finding it like one strand of spaghetti, </garnt>
<garnt> in this the fucking sea of wires </garnt>
<garnt> to what this cam link wire is. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I find the cam link wire take it out, </garnt>
<garnt> plug it back in it doesn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> Take it out, plug it
back into another slot. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Okay,
well I'm out of options." </garnt>
<garnt> So, I go into my storage, </garnt>
<garnt> get out like my old Logitech camera. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like fucked, having to plug this. </garnt>
<garnt> - At the webcam. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, at this point
10 minutes have passed. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "I might not
even going to have any viewers." </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, "Whatever." </joey>
<joey> Plug it in, Webcam works. </joey>
<joey> Thank God. </joey>
<joey> Go live again. </joey>
<joey> And then OBS has reset all of my settings. </joey>
<joey> So, </joey>
<garnt> I go live, you see me on the camera. </garnt>
<garnt> No noise. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, no </garnt>
<joey> And then I realize, </joey>
<joey> I can't just turn on my mic anymore </joey>
<joey> because my mic is
plugged through my GoXLR, </joey>
<joey> which has about 10 different
mic settings on the stream. </joey>
<joey> So, like, here I am just fucking, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, you know, </joey>
<joey> when Homer Simpson is at work, </joey>
<joey> go through like nuclear breakdown. </joey>
<joey> He's just like pressing buttons. </joey>
<joey> That was just me, just like, </joey>
<joey> "Guys can hear me? Can you hear me?" </joey>
<joey> This is like the most stressful shit. </joey>
<joey> I empathize with any streamer </joey>
<joey> who goes through technical difficulty. </joey>
<joey> - It's awful.
- I've been there. </joey>
<garnt> I've been there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because there's nothing that
kills an energy of a stream, </garnt>
<joey> not just for the stream itself, </joey>
<joey> but for like your own energy, </joey>
<joey> quite like going through
technical difficulties. </joey>
<connor> - When you stream like crashes
and you like come back, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> you lose like half of
viewers, it's so depressing. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> It's not that you care about the numbers, </joey>
<joey> but it's just sad seeing like
you just gutted it in half </joey>
<joey> by just accidentally like </joey>
<joey> fucking something up. </joey>
<joey> - And fucking cam link
it's so temperamental. </joey>
<joey> I know that like, </joey>
<joey> it has to go in like a
certain USB port on my PC, </joey>
<joey> or it doesn't work.
Like that's weird. </joey>
<joey> I haven't even even figured
out what the issue I had is, </joey>
<joey> or why the camera just stopped
working all of a sudden? </joey>
<joey> - For me, it's so weird. </joey>
<joey> For me it's like, </joey>
<joey> if I want to like record
something through cam link, </joey>
<joey> it's like I opened OBS, right? </joey>
<joey> And then I turn the camera on, </joey>
<joey> and usually it'll like pop up if it works. </joey>
<joey> It just doesn't pop up
like 99% of the time. </joey>
<connor> So, I'm like, "What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Turn it off, turn it on. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, now it works." </connor>
<joey> Like what the? </joey>
<garnt> There's like a tech
goblin just being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Should I work today? Maybe not." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, every time you turn on cam link, </joey>
<joey> God flips a coin. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes it lands tails, </joey>
<joey> and sometimes it lands heads. </joey>
<joey> - Keep the settings or fuck it up, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, time to fuck it up," beep. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, apparently, even
if I keep the settings, </joey>
<joey> they still flips a coin. </joey>
<joey> So, I haven't debugs the problem is yet. </joey>
<joey> And I just have to like, </joey>
<joey> hope that God smiles on
me next time I stream, </joey>
<joey> and nothing goes wrong. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> the thing that's annoying about
like that kind of problems </connor>
<joey> and like tech and streaming
problems that you can't even </joey>
<joey> like throw money at the
problem to make it go away. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No.
- Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> You are like, it's you're problem, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and you got to learn how to fix it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's a pain in the ass.
It's so annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've had like every goddamn
issue under the sun. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> It's terrible.
Like, something always breaks. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Of course. </joey>
<joey> Like, especially now that we've
been doing more live action, </joey>
<joey> live action content. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you just call it
live action content? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On camera, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I don't know just content, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I love the live action
adaptation of content. </joey>
<garnt> - I love the live action remake of Gigguk. </garnt>
<joey> - The Netflix live action of Gigguk. </joey>
<joey> - It's so good. </joey>
<garnt> - "Trash Taste" is just a
live action anime adaptation. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you talking about? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck are you talking about? </garnt>
<joey> - I have no idea. </joey>
<joey> This is what happens when
you watch too much anime. </joey>
<garnt> It just fucking botch your mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - This says a lot about society. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like real life to me
now it's just live action. </garnt>
<joey> That's like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, I hang out with
someone on live action." </joey>
<connor> It's kind of nice. </connor>
<garnt> - He goes outside and looks at the grass, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, "Whoa, look at the graphics." </garnt>
<connor> - I went to the Colombini
live action, bro. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, what?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Went outside, I was like,
"Yo, look at this FPS, man," </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - It's at 144 hz, what is this? </joey>
<joey> - Supermarkets are just
live action, Amazon. </joey>
<joey> - But no, it's like, made me realize that </joey>
<joey> just making content isn't enough anymore. </joey>
<joey> Just worrying about making
good content is enough anymore </joey>
<joey> because you have to worry about </joey>
<joey> so much tech things that I just
never thought about before, </joey>
<joey> because before it was just
me, a mic and a script. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, YouTube is very
friendly with that, right? </connor>
<connor> - I can barely plugging a
fucking GPU two years ago. </connor>
<connor> Now, I have to like learn how to like, </connor>
<garnt> do all this like tech shit, </garnt>
<garnt> and like deal with cam link. </garnt>
<garnt> And like I'm thinking about
getting a second camera, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like terrified to even like, </garnt>
<connor> think of the possibilities </connor>
<connor> of how much that's going to fuck up </connor>
<connor> my already nice setup. </connor>
<connor> - You can't use two cam links in one PC. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - You can, you can though. </joey>
<connor> - Very temperamental there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, see, I'm like
scared to do that now. </connor>
<connor> So, it's like, fuck what do I do? </connor>
<joey> - No, because like,
yeah, before it was like, </joey>
<joey> before my entire YouTube career was, </joey>
<joey> me a script and an
editing software, right? </joey>
<joey> And now it's just like, </joey>
<joey> me, a concept, maybe a script, </joey>
<joey> and then lighting, camera, audio, </joey>
<joey> is the light flickering? No. </joey>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<joey> Got to change the ISO settings, no. </joey>
<joey> I've got to change the frame rate. </joey>
<joey> Okay, no. </joey>
<connor> Is the audio? </connor>
<connor> No, it's peaking. </connor>
<connor> Why is it peaking? </connor>
<joey> Because the settings got changed, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "I just
want to make content." </joey>
<joey> - This is why people have
production companies. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - They don't want to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like impossible to
focus on what you're doing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worrying about how all the tech works. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - [Joey] Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - And by the time all the tech get sorted, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "I've wasted like two hours, </connor>
<joey> and I haven't even done anything. </joey>
<joey> There's nothing I can monetize
because I haven't recorded. </joey>
<joey> Haven't even started recording yet. </joey>
<connor> What is this?" </connor>
<connor> - That's the one thing I think
you really gained from being </connor>
<connor> like YouTube or Twitch or any of shit, </connor>
<joey> is that my God, do you learn
how to like fucking adapt fast. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You've got to learn or you're fucked. </joey>
<joey> - Your MacGyver skills
go through the roof. </joey>
<connor> - You have to, man. </connor>
<connor> If you have to kind of person
who panics and calm focus </connor>
<joey> when shits going wrong, </joey>
<connor> then a RIP. </connor>
<joey> - I like to say my
engineering skills have like, </joey>
<joey> been really useful in terms
of just problem solving. </joey>
<joey> Because there's so many
small problem solving things </joey>
<joey> you have to do every time you're on a set, </joey>
<joey> or you're doing something, </joey>
<joey> and you're making content </joey>
<joey> because something inevitably </joey>
<joey> goes wrong and there is no manual </joey>
<joey> or playbook about what's
going to go wrong. </joey>
<joey> But something new is going to go wrong, </joey>
<joey> and you're going to </joey>
<joey> figure out how to sort it out on the fly. </joey>
<joey> - Do you think they'll ever be like, </joey>
<joey> I remember seeing an article
about this on Japanese Twitter </joey>
<joey> of Japan was thinking
about like starting like </joey>
<joey> university courses for like YouTube, </joey>
<joey> and like online content creators. </joey>
<connor> - I think maybe. </connor>
<connor> But I think there's
definitely room for like </connor>
<connor> someone to be like, "Hey, I'm a guy. </connor>
<joey> I will come to your house and
set everything up for you, </joey>
<joey> and tell you how to use it. </joey>
<joey> And you pay me a lot of money." </joey>
<joey> - We're actually looking
for that right now. </joey>
<joey> If someone wants to help us
set up our tool Twitch sets up </joey>
<joey> in our Trash Taste office, </joey>
<joey> we were trying to find a specialist. </joey>
<garnt> We actually can. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we've had to figure it out ourselves. </garnt>
<garnt> And we always get comments
about how junk our set up is, </garnt>
<joey> that's because we made it, </joey>
<joey> and we don't know what
the fuck we're doing. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's like a
decent setup for live. </connor>
<joey> Like it's not perfect, </joey>
<joey> but I think we just want it
to be like more professional </joey>
<joey> and it's like impossible
to find someone who's like </joey>
<garnt> knowledgeable about this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And normally if they
are knowledgeable about </garnt>
<joey> broadcasting, they're not on Twitch then, </joey>
<joey> they don't know like
an actual TV and shows. </joey>
<joey> - But like wouldn't it
be interesting with like, </joey>
<connor> 10, 20 years down the road, </connor>
<joey> if YouTube just keeps
going up and up and up, </joey>
<joey> that I don't know, </joey>
<joey> maybe like our kids
will end up being like, </joey>
<joey> "So what, university degree
you going to go into son?" </joey>
<joey> It's like, "I'm going to go
into YouTube and Twitch." </joey>
<joey> - I mean, the way YouTube is evolving now, </joey>
<joey> is that the quality of
content just keeps increasing. </joey>
<joey> It's getting harder and harder </joey>
<joey> to compete with the larger creators </joey>
<joey> because the barrier of entry
is just so much higher now. </joey>
<joey> Like even talking about, </joey>
<garnt> an anime podcast, which
is what we started. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, </garnt>
<garnt> we put in like thousands
and thousands of dollars </garnt>
<garnt> just to get the basic
setup in our old studio. </garnt>
<garnt> And now we've like, </garnt>
<garnt> we have gone as professional as we can be, </garnt>
<garnt> but that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> after having like a surprise success </garnt>
<garnt> with what we were able to do. </garnt>
<garnt> But before that it was like a
lot of money that we invested, </garnt>
<garnt> and we didn't know if it was
going to turn into anything, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we were in the red
for a while, that's the truth. </garnt>
<joey> Thank God. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so, now I just think, </joey>
<joey> well, if you're a new content creator, </joey>
<joey> and you're trying to make a podcast, </joey>
<joey> or compete with some of the content </joey>
<joey> that's is already established
by a lot of larger creators, </joey>
<joey> there's so much you have to do. </joey>
<joey> There's so much you have to worry about, </joey>
<joey> and it's getting harder and harder to, </joey>
<joey> not only distinguish
yourself but make content, </joey>
<joey> which for the average viewer </joey>
<joey> they feel is like of a high
enough production level. </joey>
<garnt> - It's about like doing
what's in your means, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I've had friends who are like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, I want to do this
thing and this thing," </joey>
<joey> it's like, "Yeah, well that's good. </joey>
<garnt> But like, you don't have the
ability to do that right now. </garnt>
<garnt> So, like scale it down." </garnt>
<garnt> Like Mr. Beast was counting to $100,000 </garnt>
<garnt> because he could do that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure Mr. Beast had some
grand visions of giving away, </garnt>
<garnt> like $20 billion or something. </garnt>
<garnt> But you know, </garnt>
<connor> you have to start where you can. </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of people as well, </connor>
<connor> they want to be on a higher level, </connor>
<connor> but you just need to work your way up, </connor>
<connor> especially if you're solo, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and I would argue
that in the case with YouTube, </joey>
<joey> it's not always like TV, </joey>
<joey> or it's not that, </joey>
<joey> just because you have TV quality, </joey>
<joey> it's going to make you
successful because I feel there's </joey>
<joey> still plenty of room,
especially on YouTube for, </joey>
<joey> "Less lower quality content" that is still </joey>
<joey> just as enjoyed as the
higher quality shit, right? </joey>
<connor> - Some of those popular
content on YouTube, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> without a doubt, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> is people just screen recording Minecraft. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It speaks volumes about, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> it says a lot about society </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're just playing a game, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's still going to be king. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think no matter how insane it gets, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like people at the end of the
day are going to want to watch </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> people fuck around and
playing video games. </joey>
<joey> Because there's just
something fun about it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I like it, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like, I know people always say like, </joey>
<connor> "Why do they always talk about
being a YouTuber and stuff?" </connor>
<connor> And it's like, fuck man, it's almost. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, it's
almost like, it's our job. </joey>
<joey> - It's tough because like, </joey>
<connor> I also want to talk
about other things too, </connor>
<joey> but it's like, </joey>
<connor> man, like 99% of my day </connor>
<connor> is me doing content creation. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What's do guys talk about
when they go to the pub? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> They talk about the
hard day at the office. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Their work. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> This is exactly what we're doing. </joey>
<joey> I was like, </joey>
<joey> "You guys have aneurysm when
you try like to sort out stream </joey>
<joey> setups and stuff?" </joey>
<joey> I do.
- I do that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel you bro.
- Right? </joey>
<joey> I do that. </joey>

<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, Trash Taste Studio tour. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Back to the show. </joey>
<joey> Going back to what you're talking about, </joey>
<joey> how you're just bored
of the anime archetype, </joey>
<joey> or the anime character archetype. </joey>
<joey> What's like the last character
you would say from like, </joey>
<joey> any medium that you were just like, </joey>
<joey> "Yes." </joey>
<joey> I fuck with that. </joey>
<joey> - Not an archetype.
- I fuck with that. </joey>
<connor> - "Squid Games", right. </connor>
<connor> - For real? </connor>
<joey> - I was actually, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Every character from "Squid Game". </joey>
<joey> - Well, every character is
like flawed from "Squid Game". </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they're all pretty flawed. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but I would argue, </joey>
<connor> that's what made this
show so great, right? </connor>
<connor> Yes, because everyone sucked. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What I enjoyed about "Squid Game" </joey>
<joey> compared to like every other </joey>
<joey> let's say death game is, </joey>
<joey> a lot of other death games is that, </joey>
<joey> yeah, a lot of the death games </joey>
<joey> just run on complete archetypes. </joey>
<joey> Like this person's the asshole, </joey>
<joey> this person's the good guy. </joey>
<joey> - We did have the
asshole and the good guy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we did, we did. </joey>
<joey> - But you would have bare minimum, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but the thing is, </joey>
<joey> at least I think why "Squid Game" worked, </joey>
<joey> is that they gave more time to develop </joey>
<joey> part of their characteristics </joey>
<joey> rather than them just being the archetype. </joey>
<joey> Right?
- True. </joey>
<joey> - There were entire
episodes of "Squid Game" </joey>
<joey> that didn't have any like death
game shit involved at all. </joey>
<joey> It was just, the characters,
getting to know each other, </joey>
<joey> knowing about the whole light backstory </joey>
<joey> of some of the characters. </joey>
<joey> One of my favorite episodes
of "Squid Game" is when, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if there's
going to be spoilers. </joey>
<joey> But it's like halfway
through when you know, </joey>
<joey> they all decide to quit "Squid Game" </joey>
<joey> and they all go back to the society. </joey>
<joey> - That's the second episode actually. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally second episode. </joey>
<joey> - It's like second episode, okay. </joey>
<garnt> Spoilers for the second episode, </garnt>
<garnt> is when they all decide, </garnt>
<joey> to massive vote to quit
and go back to society. </joey>
<joey> And then they realize how much </joey>
<joey> they go back to. </joey>
<joey> It really says a lot about society, </joey>
<joey> when they decide to go back
into the "Squid Game"s, </joey>
<joey> after how much they realize that </joey>
<joey> how much they life fucking sucks, right? </joey>
<joey> Like that episode is great because </joey>
<joey> you not only get to know
about all the characters, </joey>
<joey> and their backstories and
their relations to one at all, </joey>
<garnt> but it also just like
puts into a situation of, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, this world must really suck to them </garnt>
<garnt> that they have to resort
to going back," right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like that was great. </garnt>
<joey> - It wasn't a perfect show by any means. </joey>
<joey> - No, definitely not. </joey>
<joey> - And I find a lot of
things wrong with it, </joey>
<joey> and I understand why it's so popular. </joey>
<joey> Like it's very engaging. </joey>
<joey> It's got a pretty good premise, </joey>
<joey> and the characters like, </joey>
<joey> you hate some of them, </joey>
<connor> which is saying more than a
lot of shows can get, right? </connor>
<joey> A lot of characters. </joey>
<joey> I felt strongly that I disliked. </joey>
<connor> And a lot of shows like anime. </connor>
<joey> I barely feel fucking anything </joey>
<connor> about these fucking character. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I would argue is that, </joey>
<joey> I think it really says
a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> - I can't fucking stop. </joey>
<garnt> I swear, am not. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like heard you
processing that in your mind. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you're just like,
"I'm not going to say it. </garnt>
<joey> I'm not going to say," </joey>
<joey> and then you said, "It really,"
and then you were just like, </joey>
<joey> fuck, fuck, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - I swear I'm not saying it on purpose. </joey>
<joey> I say that a lot. </joey>
<joey> I just say that a lot. </joey>
<joey> - You're like, "It really,
abort, abort, abort, </joey>
<joey> says, abort, abort, abort, a lot," </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "Oh, it's
too late, it's too late." </joey>
<joey> - About society. </joey>
<garnt> - I say it so naturally
in my speech, fine. </garnt>
<garnt> This meme has ruined me. </garnt>
<joey> What was I even saying? I don't even know. </joey>
<joey> - "Squid Game". </joey>
<joey> - I was saying like how
the characters are boring. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, I was going to say that </joey>
<joey> I think a character that you end </joey>
<joey> up absolutely fucking hating </joey>
<joey> is a way better character </joey>
<joey> than a character you feel nothing towards. </joey>
<joey> - Right, 100%.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> And so many people think like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this character sucks
because I hate him." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Well, no, that
makes him a good character </joey>
<joey> because you feel something
towards that character." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like a ""Game of
Thrones"" and Joffrey. </joey>
<connor> I found it so interesting. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen like
interviews of the actor? </connor>
<garnt> Of Joffrey?
- I felt so sorry for him. </garnt>
<connor> - He's like such a cool guy. </connor>
<connor> He's like one of the nicest guy </connor>
<garnt> I've ever seen.
- He quit acting. </garnt>
<garnt> - He quit acting, right? He quit acting, </garnt>
<garnt> - Did he actually? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he quit
acting after "Game of Thrones". </garnt>
<garnt> And it just shows like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it was his first role, </garnt>
<garnt> but he was definitely like, </garnt>
<garnt> not an experienced actor, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But it just surprise, surprise, </garnt>
<garnt> a good actor, </garnt>
<garnt> makes a hateable character
even more hateable, </garnt>
<garnt> and I felt really sorry for
him hearing stories about </garnt>
<garnt> how kids. </garnt>
<garnt> Kids watch "Game of Thrones". </garnt>
<garnt> - Kids watch "Game of Thrones". </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, surprise. </garnt>
<garnt> But like people actually thought
that he was his character, </garnt>
<joey> and people thought he was like an asshole. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "What?" </joey>
<connor> - That blows my mind. </connor>
<joey> How people can like
actually look at an actor, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> and think, "Bro, I bet Leonardo DiCaprio </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> says the N word all the time, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> And I saw him in "Django",
he said it, man, bro." </connor>
<joey> - That's like the same
people who are like, "Wow, </joey>
<joey> did you know that Joji </joey>
<joey> is just anime shitty of
a person as Filthy Frank. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, it's the same thing. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, "I can't believe
he's like that in real life." </joey>
<joey> It's definitely not a
character at this point. </joey>
<garnt> - So, who just discovered "Filthy
Frank" for the first time? </garnt>
<garnt> - I love that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's fucking hilarious. </garnt>
<joey> - They try to fucking cancel him. </joey>
<joey> Just cause like, "Did you
know that five years ago </joey>
<joey> he was this Filthy Frank
character whose making fun of </joey>
<garnt> like mentally, disabled people?" </garnt>
<garnt> Yes, yes, internet, we
did know, thank you. </garnt>
<joey> - What kind of amusing
period to be on internet. </joey>
<joey> - How long ago was that? </joey>
<joey> Because it felt like yesterday. </joey>
<joey> - It was last year. </joey>
<joey> - It's about a year or two
ago and this is very funny. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, times change, </joey>
<joey> and definitely something
like "Filthy Frank." </joey>
<garnt> "Filthy Frank," transitioned to Joji. </garnt>
<joey> - "Filthy Frank." </joey>
<joey> - I'm fucking I'm lisping like crazy, now. </joey>
<joey> - This says a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> - I've completely forgot my point, now. </joey>
<connor> - "Filthy Frank." </connor>
<joey> - Fuck, you've just like,
Derren Browned my mind. </joey>
<garnt> - Am sorry.
- Fucking hacked my mind. </garnt>
<joey> - This says a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> I'll stop, I'll stop. </joey>
<garnt> - Now that I look back at it, </garnt>
<garnt> it really is an interesting
period that "Filthy Frank" </garnt>
<garnt> was living in </garnt>
<garnt> because for one, my God,
that shit would not fly. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's a good reason why he quit. </garnt>
<joey> - It is strange how rapidly it changes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I also remember as well at the peak of, </joey>
<joey> Joji's career as Filthy Frank, </joey>
<joey> how there was so many
kids that thought that </joey>
<joey> that was just him. </joey>
<connor> - It was, that he was
so good at keeping up. </connor>
<joey> - Because he was so good at just acting </joey>
<joey> as the character and you know, </joey>
<joey> any normal person who'd
watched "Filthy Frank" </joey>
<joey> would know that, of course
that was an over-exaggeration. </joey>
<joey> That was a character. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I remember at a time, </joey>
<joey> Joji just didn't exist. </joey>
<joey> I remember once </joey>
<joey> didn't he like make a video
about him coming out as Joji. </joey>
<joey> And then he actually
deleted that or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> He made a vlog as George Miller. </joey>
<joey> Who's you know, </joey>
<joey> his real name as like himself, </joey>
<joey> and how he said that </joey>
<joey> he absolutely hated his fan base. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I guess the weird thing is that, </connor>
<connor> is tough to talk about is that, </connor>
<joey> I guess when you are hired
to play like Joffrey, right. </joey>
<joey> The actor didn't make this character. </joey>
<joey> The actor didn't make this story. </joey>
<joey> I just think that it's kind of difficult </joey>
<joey> to talk about with "Filthy Frank" is that, </joey>
<joey> okay, he chose to make this character, </joey>
<joey> this is entirely his thing. </joey>
<joey> So, it's like, </joey>
<joey> how does that play an effect into </joey>
<joey> how much of the character </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> do you excuse, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really give a shit about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> but it's interesting seeing
how other people talk about it, </joey>
<joey> and how much they think, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this is appalling. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> This is him doing it, " </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because he does have control
over the character, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> He makes the creative decisions. </joey>
<joey> So, I do wonder, </joey>
<joey> how much valid criticism
you can give him that </joey>
<connor> from that position, right? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's the same criticism
you'd give to any writer, </joey>
<joey> or anyone who writes a
script or a character. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Why not just cancel George RR Martin? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why not cancel Quentin Tarantino </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> for some of the stuff he scripts, </connor>
<joey> and some of the characters he writes. </joey>
<connor> - I agree, </connor>
<connor> it's one of the things. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Quentin Tarantino says
the N word all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's like we're
in the YouTube era, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I feel like the rules
have like kind of changed. </joey>
<joey> - Why though?
They shouldn't change. </joey>
<joey> - I know why, I agree with you. </joey>
<joey> I want to talk about it. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's because YouTube </connor>
<connor> just seem more personable than say </connor>
<connor> someone like Quentin Tarantino. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not saying that's how I think, </joey>
<joey> but I think it's worth discussing. </joey>
<joey> - I think a lot of the people </joey>
<joey> who try to cancel other people </joey>
<joey> are, you know, a younger generation. </joey>
<joey> It's going to take a
learning experience of </joey>
<joey> when this younger generation </joey>
<joey> who are now in their teenage years. </joey>
<joey> When they grow up, </joey>
<joey> five, 10 years in the future, </joey>
<joey> and realize some of the
shit they're saying now </joey>
<joey> are things that can get them canceled </joey>
<joey> when they're an adult,
they realize, "Oh, okay, </joey>
<joey> maybe society just
changes as time goes on." </joey>
<joey> What's socially acceptable changes, </joey>
<joey> and you know, maybe we
should give some people </joey>
<joey> the benefit of the doubt. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes when things happen </joey>
<joey> 10 years, five years ago. </joey>
<joey> - I guarantee you go back 10 years ago </joey>
<garnt> like any Newgrounds comments, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And you see the amount of
people throwing the R word, </garnt>
<joey> and the F word and the N
word around in comments. </joey>
<joey> Like it means nothing </joey>
<joey> because back then on the internet, </joey>
<joey> it was just a general understanding that </joey>
<garnt> none of that meant anything
because it was the internet. </garnt>
<garnt> Now, you look at it now and, </garnt>
<garnt> if you wrote any kind of
comment or tweet like that, </garnt>
<joey> it's insta canceled. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Two points, two points, two points. </connor>
<connor> First of all, </connor>
<joey> why do you think that some
people would then try and cancel </joey>
<joey> someone like "Filthy Frank", right? </joey>
<joey> Who's a YouTuber and playing a character. </joey>
<joey> Why do you think they were
trying to cancel it him? </joey>
<connor> But not say someone else </connor>
<connor> who's just like playing a character. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's because now </joey>
<joey> the younger generation </joey>
<joey> who don't know about
"Filthy Frank", right. </joey>
<joey> They only know George as Joji, </joey>
<joey> who was this innocent guy
who just makes music, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, it's to them, </joey>
<joey> "Filthy Frank" is like
his dark past, you know, </joey>
<garnt> it's something. </garnt>
<garnt> It really is, it is. </garnt>
<garnt> It's his dark past. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, " Wow, </joey>
<joey> I can't believe he
changed identities online </joey>
<joey> to try and hide the fact </joey>
<joey> that he did some dark shit in the past." </joey>
<joey> - That has a fucking villain
backstory, you know that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it does, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like his evil upbringing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like that's how some
people perceived it though, </joey>
<joey> which just made it so funny </joey>
<joey> because I think to a lot of
these people who try to cancel </joey>
<joey> Georgie as "Filthy Frank" </joey>
<connor> thought that he changed his name </connor>
<connor> to hide the "Filthy Frank" era. </connor>
<connor> Everyone who grew up with "Filthy Frank" </connor>
<connor> knows that, "No, that's not the case." </connor>
<connor> He just didn't want to keep
making content like that. </connor>
<connor> It didn't make him any money </connor>
<connor> because of the changing
landscape of YouTube. </connor>
<joey> And he just wanted to focus on music. </joey>
<connor> - I'll save my other question for later. </connor>
<joey> But next question then
following up on that. </joey>
<joey> - Question to you guys. </joey>
<joey> - Question to you guys, right. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so, if we had a "Filthy Frank" now, </joey>
<connor> that came out now, </connor>
<connor> do you think it would be any different? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Totally. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you think it would never be a thing? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> Dude. </connor>
<joey> I'm sure you've seen enough
"Filthy Frank" videos </joey>
<joey> to know that 90% of the shit
he made would not fly today. </joey>
<connor> - Right, but like, why is it that </connor>
<connor> we look back at that fondly, </connor>
<connor> and we look back at these
videos and then we have. </connor>
<joey> - It's because we lived through them. </joey>
<connor> - True, true, true.
- Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> And we know that it wasn't serious. </connor>
<connor> We knew that it was a caricature. </connor>
<joey> It wasn't over-exaggeration. </joey>
<connor> - I always wonder as well, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, okay, </connor>
<connor> you have to play a character, right? </connor>
<connor> And you get to do this stuff. </connor>
<connor> I wonder though like, </connor>
<connor> how much are you allowed to do? </connor>
<connor> As said character? </connor>
<connor> Where does it stop? </connor>
<connor> Where you're like,
"Okay, this is too much." </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it all depends on the time. </joey>
<joey> And what's acceptable at the time. </joey>
<joey> - I remember, back when
our parents growing up, </joey>
<joey> it was cool to look up to rock
stars who trashed hotel rooms </joey>
<connor> did fucking drugs until, </connor>
<connor> they were more cocaine
than bloods, you know? </connor>
<connor> That was what was cool at the time. </connor>
<joey> It was what was acceptable at the time. </joey>
<connor> - I just imagined </connor>
<connor> it's like a TikToK of someone being like, </connor>
<connor> "I worked at the hotel that </connor>
<joey> Who stayed at and it was
like really fucked up. </joey>
<joey> They've trashed the room
and everything. And like, </joey>
<joey> you shouldn't support them." </joey>
<joey> Because I can just envision it. </joey>
<joey> - The Who is canceled
for being rock stars. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the thing though.
I understand time has changed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, like we joke about that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it might honestly be the case. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - That's what's would happen nowadays. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you don't hear about </garnt>
<joey> like rock bands anymore
doing shit like that, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel they're scared now </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> that the possibility of that happening. </joey>
<connor> - The rock star of then is dead. </connor>
<joey> - The repercussions just like, </joey>
<joey> at the time they could get away with it </joey>
<connor> without repercussions. </connor>
<connor> And that was just what was
like accepted at the time, </connor>
<connor> I'm not saying it's right. </connor>
<connor> - It was rock and roll. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was rock and roll. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, obviously, </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I don't know how some
of these fucking rock stars </joey>
<joey> are still alive honestly, </joey>
<joey> hearing some of the fucking thing stories. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Like Keith Richards. </garnt>
<garnt> He should have died like 50 years ago </garnt>
<garnt> from the amount of cocaine he did. </garnt>
<joey> He's still playing with
the Rolling Stones. </joey>
<garnt> It's like actually amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he's actually like, </garnt>
<garnt> he's Dio. </garnt>
<garnt> He's 100% Dio. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love talking about all that stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> And like considering it </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's just so difficult to like, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> get anyone to like give you
a good definitive answer </connor>
<joey> of where they think things lie. </joey>
<connor> It's so up to interpretation. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is up to
interpretation and I think </connor>
<joey> it really just depend on the person. </joey>
<connor> - I think there's probably </connor>
<connor> a lot of people watching this podcast </connor>
<connor> who have probably watched "Filthy Frank" </connor>
<joey> and think the shit like cringe
or like too much, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's some videos
where I look back, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> "Okay." </joey>
<connor> - There was some videos where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, that's a little too far." </joey>
<joey> - Right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think part of it is
just acknowledging that, </joey>
<joey> society changes. </joey>
<joey> Especially things that are comedic, </joey>
<joey> a lot of comedy pushes the
edges, pushes the edge. </joey>
<joey> A lot of the times in what is acceptable </joey>
<joey> in that time period, </joey>
<joey> and just because like, there is shit </joey>
<joey> I found funny 10 years ago </joey>
<joey> that is very cringe or like very like, </joey>
<joey> "Sh, uh, I don't know
about that on, chief." </joey>
<joey> - Bottles to Newgrounds Animation. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> But like, I acknowledge
that part of that is just </joey>
<joey> because the times were different, </joey>
<joey> and it's not that I was a bad person, </joey>
<joey> it's not that we were bad kids </joey>
<joey> or the type of people
there were, inherently bad. </joey>
<joey> It was just, </joey>
<joey> what is acceptable changes </joey>
<garnt> as time goes on as different issues, </garnt>
<garnt> different social issues get
brought up to the limelight, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, well now that's say the
social issue is brought up. </garnt>
<garnt> I do no longer find this one thing funny." </garnt>
<garnt> And then, that's part
of how society evolves. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, you know, </joey>
<joey> I still fondly remember </joey>
<joey> when I was growing up with Newgrounds, </joey>
<joey> and just seeing so many
Newgrounds animations, </joey>
<joey> which at the time </joey>
<joey> I thought was like the
funniest on the planet. </joey>
<joey> Like the first time I watched </joey>
<joey> "Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny", </joey>
<joey> I thought that was the funniest
I've ever seen in my life. </joey>
<joey> And I watch it now and
I'm like, "That's cute." </joey>
<joey> It's like, I can't laugh at it. </joey>
<garnt> I can reminisce about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But I try to like throw my head back, </garnt>
<garnt> and loft around it anymore </garnt>
<garnt> because it's just something, </garnt>
<garnt> as you said, </garnt>
<joey> it's just completely changed </joey>
<joey> with not just how I perceive
comedy, but just how society. </joey>
<joey> - Can we stop saying society. </joey>
<joey> - I can't, it's in my mind now. </joey>
<joey> - It's such a power. </joey>
<joey> But like, you know, </joey>
<joey> how the world perceives comedy all like, </joey>
<joey> the barrier for comedy, right? </joey>
<joey> - Another thing that
I wanted to talk about </joey>
<joey> I wanted your opinion on </joey>
<joey> is that you were mentioning about, </joey>
<joey> how you could say anything you
wanted to say in the comments </joey>
<joey> and the people don't give a shit. </joey>
<joey> In the UK, </joey>
<joey> did you see that they were
trying to get a law past, </joey>
<joey> to like, </joey>
<joey> have it so that you
need your like public ID </joey>
<joey> to sign up to websites. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Then you could be like
criminally charged if you </joey>
<joey> bully people online. </joey>
<joey> They were trying to get that in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Really. </joey>
<joey> - There was a similar
law like that in Japan </joey>
<joey> actually years ago. </joey>
<joey> - Really. </joey>
<connor> - With 2chan. </connor>
<joey> When 2chan was a thing. </joey>
<joey> Well, I mean, 2chan
started to become a thing, </joey>
<joey> and it started to get really serious </joey>
<joey> is that there were many
politicians that were like, </joey>
<joey> "If you want to use 2chan
or any kind of message board </joey>
<joey> in Japan, you need to put
like your real identity, </joey>
<connor> and get like properly ID and
scans to avoid cyber bullying. </connor>
<connor> - Turn off all site
which haven't an ID card. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> And the, I remember the
founder of 2chan, Hiroyuki, </connor>
<joey> he went on TV campaigning against it </joey>
<joey> because he was like,
"That's just censoring." </joey>
<joey> Like that goes completely against </joey>
<joey> the whole point of sites, </joey>
<joey> like 2chan and just internet
and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> I mean, he was ruthless about it. </joey>
<connor> He basically said, "If he can't
handle it, then fuck off." </connor>
<connor> In some aspects, </connor>
<connor> yes, I agree with, but in
other aspects I do see like, </connor>
<connor> especially nowadays with kids who- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, shit can get hard. </connor>
<connor> - ...have no show whatsoever, right? </connor>
<connor> They just think they can go ham </connor>
<joey> on everything without thinking
of any repercussions, right. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's weird, man. </connor>
<connor> Obviously, I can sympathize with people </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> who have had some really awful experiences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with public shaming and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I imagine it's not easy to deal with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But on the other hand, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like, all right, I get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But come on, anonymity
is an amazing thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it empowers a lot of people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like when you try
and take away anonymity </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it disproportionately
affects people who are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in worse positions. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> So, </joey>
<joey> it's weird. </joey>
<joey> And also I thought, okay, </joey>
<joey> so let's say I have to make
ID to join Twitter in the UK, </joey>
<joey> bra, am just boot up that VPN, </joey>
<joey> and to go to America, </joey>
<joey> I'm not signing up with my ID. </joey>
<joey> Are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> Even as a public figure, </joey>
<joey> I do not want to give
my ID to like Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I do not want to do that. </connor>
<joey> - But that's the thing where I was like, </joey>
<joey> anonymity is such how- </joey>
<joey> - Have you not?
- No. </joey>
<joey> - Do you not need to
give it for verification? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wait, you do. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, yeah, you do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Checkmate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't want to. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I don't want to, but I have to. </joey>
<garnt> - Twitter's like checkmate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Checkmate we have your shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck, I just realized it. </garnt>
<garnt> - We know who you are. </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor, "I would never
give up my ID for Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> I would rather go to war," jokes. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that tick mark though. </garnt>
<connor> - But the verification. </connor>
<joey> - That tick mark dome, enticing. </joey>
<connor> - I can't wait for this
fucking Garnt enthusiasm thing. </connor>
<joey> - Poorly aged things. </joey>
<joey> - Literally, took like five seconds. </joey>
<joey> As just like a general user. </joey>
<joey> - I get what you mean
though, I get what you mean. </joey>
<connor> - It's stupid. </connor>
<joey> - No, but that's the thing
is like I was saying, like, </joey>
<joey> I think that's, what's so powerful </joey>
<joey> about anonymity is that I think </joey>
<joey> true anonymity is so difficult to achieve </joey>
<joey> outside of the internet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's impossible. </joey>
<joey> - That that's what makes it
so powerful on the internet </joey>
<joey> because it's really the
only place on the planet </joey>
<joey> where you can really just
be completely anonymous. </joey>
<joey> And do and say shit. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I hate the fact that some
people are just really appalling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to me online sometimes
for no particular reason, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I'm not going to
sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yo, people that means
nobody gets to enjoy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the freedoms of the internet." </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> And there's a lot of countries </joey>
<joey> where that's like life or death. </joey>
<joey> Anonymity is very important. </joey>
<joey> Like I would never, ever
want to take that away. </joey>
<joey> And for a blue check marks, okay. </joey>
<joey> - I can just imagine someone's
like talking shit to me, </joey>
<joey> right? </joey>
<joey> Like quote retweeting
saying something mean. </joey>
<joey> And I be like, "What's your identity? </joey>
<joey> Show me how old you are.
Where do you live?" </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me contact the internet police. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, wait, that's a thing now. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - The cyber police. </joey>
<joey> - So, what are you going do? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Go to prison because you
fucking racialed someone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Calling on my cyber lawyer. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - How are you going to
define bullying like that? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the reason why
bullying laws have never, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ever worked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How the fucking do you define bullying? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Like one men's insult is
another men's like Peppy laugh. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> What some people may
find funny and jovial, </joey>
<joey> other people might find
like deeply offensive. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But half the time, </joey>
<connor> if you're super offended
by something like that, </connor>
<connor> it's probably on. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, no, </joey>
<joey> I get like the whole thing of like, </joey>
<joey> cyber thing is like a real thing. </joey>
<garnt> It's not just a simple matter of, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, just, just close
your eyes or," you know, </garnt>
<garnt> "Just get off the internet." </garnt>
<garnt> - "Just don't look, right." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, "Just don't look at it," right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's obviously not that simple. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time it's like, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> People's thresholds of
what they're offended by </joey>
<joey> is very different. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think there
is a perfect solution </joey>
<joey> because yes, I do think people would need </joey>
<joey> to like chill out online. </joey>
<joey> And I don't agree that
the right solution to that </joey>
<joey> is by monitoring everyone, </joey>
<joey> and kind of having to </joey>
<joey> make it like a default thing </joey>
<joey> where you have to give up your ID, </joey>
<joey> any your anonymity and stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> - They already have that shit anyway. </connor>
<joey> Why do they need it? </joey>
<joey> They already Know that, </joey>
<joey> like the government doesn't fucking </joey>
<joey> already know everything about this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's not like they're
tracking you everyday. </joey>
<joey> - They know what Hentai am watching. </joey>
<joey> They don't need to put
cookies on my browser. </joey>
<joey> I'll straight up tell them
bro, "Leave me alone." </joey>
<joey> - I know, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, I guess, </joey>
<joey> my philosophy behind it </joey>
<joey> is just like to keep
your manners in check. </joey>
<joey> If you do see someone
acting like a dick head, </joey>
<joey> it's kind of a social thing now. </joey>
<joey> - You just say, "Oi,
stop being a dick head. </joey>
<joey> - Stop being anime dick head, dick head. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not hard. </garnt>
<joey> - I need to piss quickly. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my god, </joey>
<connor> this man needs to piss
every two damn seconds. </connor>
<joey> - He has downed like half of the bottle. </joey>
<connor> - One thing that me off
about this debate, right, </connor>
<connor> is that they always just
piggyback off of like, </connor>
<joey> really tragic events
to push their agenda of </joey>
<joey> we can't have anonymity
with people dying out here </joey>
<joey> from an anonymity and it's like, </joey>
<connor> you're just using like </connor>
<connor> really tragic events to push your agenda. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, how are people
dying from anonymity? </joey>
<connor> - Like cyber bullying people, </connor>
<joey> like the very famous one
with the terrace house girl. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I forget the name. </joey>
<joey> I remember that that whole
started a debate as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then I know that </joey>
<joey> with the English football players, </joey>
<joey> people have been like
super racist towards them. </joey>
<joey> It's very fucked up. </joey>
<joey> And then that's when the
debate really started going. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, yeah, this is horrible. </joey>
<joey> But like the bigger picture is like </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> they're trying to like take away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I sound like American. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Freedom, freedom. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Freedom. </joey>
<connor> - Your already resigned so much. </connor>
<connor> Why you just like giving it to them? </connor>
<connor> Like, "Hey, take it, please, please." </connor>
<garnt> - And it's like people are still racist. </garnt>
<garnt> Whether there are anonymous or not, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like we're not getting
to the root of the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Go to the Facebook groups. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> They literally got that
whole family tree on there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they're saying the worst shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they ain't going to change anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - It was like, "Oh cool. </joey>
<joey> My uncle just joined the
KKK fan club on Facebook." </joey>
<joey> It's like, great. </joey>
<joey> It's not anonymous.
It's still racist. </joey>
<joey> That's the problem, right? </joey>
<joey> As you said, </joey>
<joey> it's like the using the
anonymous excuse to cover up </joey>
<joey> the actual root of the problem, right. </joey>
<joey> It's like the root of the
problem is not this anonymous </joey>
<joey> person saying racist shit. </joey>
<joey> It's the problem that,
that person is a racist. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes I wish one
of those was just like </connor>
<connor> fucking weird as fuck. </connor>
<connor> So, you would just be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, dude, I'm like,
anti-vax, 5G hater." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just so that we'd have
like more interesting debates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - More interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Just because I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Why are you going to be sensible? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> Like stop agreeing with me for a change." </joey>
<joey> - God forbid we have common sense. </joey>
<joey> - God fucking damn it. </joey>
<joey> - God fucking damn it. </joey>
<connor> Like, I don't want it to be
in like conspiracy theory. </connor>
<joey> - Why are you not like
part of the KKK fan club? </joey>
<joey> - Let's just invite Alex
Jones to "Trash Taste". </joey>
<joey> Just balance it out. </joey>
<connor> - A question for you. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - We wouldn't be able to
contain Alex Jones, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Who are we kidding? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Why are you going to be so
damn sensible all the time? </joey>
<joey> Fuck you guys. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, God.
- Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - I guess this is like </connor>
<joey> piggyback on like the discussion
we had last week about, </joey>
<joey> about hearing what the other
sides has to say, right. </joey>
<joey> And I can't remember exactly what I said </joey>
<joey> to like end of the podcast. </joey>
<joey> Because that's how it is
on "Trash Taste" podcast. </joey>
<joey> I do remember thinking one
thing I actually like doing, </joey>
<joey> is actually, I like going to- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we follow people
from the other side. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we like following
people from the other side </joey>
<joey> just to see </joey>
<joey> what they're thinking or
what their argument is. </joey>
<joey> So, one thing I actually liked doing, </joey>
<joey> is I like to see what some of like, </joey>
<joey> say the craziest people
are thinking, right? </joey>
<joey> Not because I want to believe them, </joey>
<joey> just because I'm like, </joey>
<joey> so curious about how they
got to that point, right. </joey>
<joey> So, one thing I like doing
is just listening to like </joey>
<joey> flat-earthers </joey>
<joey> defense what they believe. </joey>
<joey> Defend flat-earther, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you seen how weird the flat earth, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like online presence is though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how much like
anti-Semitism there as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> Like weirdly, yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's really bizarre. </connor>
<joey> - I did see a video of a guy. </joey>
<joey> I think it was a vice documentary of a guy </joey>
<connor> going to like a flat earth convention. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe it was all gas, no brakes. </connor>
<connor> - No, it wasn't all gas, no brakes. </connor>
<connor> It was like a proper like documentary </connor>
<connor> of a guy going to flat earth convention. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't even get mad </connor>
<connor> at the stuff that we're talking about. </connor>
<connor> Because like anyone sensible can tell you </connor>
<connor> that what they're saying
is just dudu kaka. </connor>
<joey> But like at the same time I
was so fascinated being like, </joey>
<joey> I genuinely wonder how
you got to this point. </joey>
<joey> Like not even to like hate. </joey>
<joey> Like psychologically, </joey>
<joey> I'm just curious. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - What you had to input, </joey>
<joey> and what you had to be surrounded by, </joey>
<joey> in order for you to truly
believe that the earth is flat. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And like looking into it and
seeing like so many different, </joey>
<joey> like fucking flat-earthers
as in different videos </joey>
<joey> about flat-earthers, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, a lot of this just comes down to like </joey>
<joey> a core distrust of the government, </joey>
<joey> and a system." </joey>
<joey> Like a systematic distrust. </joey>
<joey> It's so much of a distrust that, </joey>
<joey> they would rather believe
that the earth is flat, </joey>
<joey> than believe what scientists say </joey>
<joey> and what an organization like NASA says. </joey>
<joey> It's fascinating. </joey>
<joey> And it's also hilarious that, to them, </joey>
<joey> NASA is basically just like
the fucking Illuminati. </joey>
<connor> - The problem is that </connor>
<joey> we've actually had real
conspiracies happen. </joey>
<joey> So, people just have like
this weird confidence </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> that like it's happened before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We've proven that these
some conspiracy theories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It has happened in the past. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> And so they get like
weirdly confident about it. </joey>
<joey> I think in a sense from
some stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> I don't know.
I don't have this mindset. </joey>
<joey> Stuff like that is so far from </joey>
<joey> where I have a view of things. </joey>
<joey> I can't even begin to, like. </joey>
<joey> - I can't even begin to like dive in that. </joey>
<joey> - No, I can't.
- No. </joey>
<connor> - I don't even understand like how. </connor>
<connor> And I think this is the problem is that </connor>
<joey> like a lot of people
just cannot even remotely </joey>
<joey> see where they're coming from. </joey>
<joey> Like with politics sometimes, </joey>
<joey> you can kind of understand, right. </joey>
<joey> You disagree, </joey>
<joey> but you can somewhat
understand very readily online, </joey>
<joey> but with stuff like this , </joey>
<joey> it's so in like to us,
it's so insane, right? </joey>
<joey> I don't even know how to begin to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, you have a point." </joey>
<connor> I don't even know how to entertainment it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - I know, to me. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, it's
not about entertaining. </joey>
<joey> I'm just genuinely curious. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like genuinely. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, not even trying
to change your mind. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like genuinely curious. </joey>
<joey> How the fuck did you get to this point. </joey>
<connor> - Is it something that
starts from like a young age? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, yeah.
- For me, </connor>
<joey> it's not even the point of
like me trying to figure out </joey>
<joey> if I can even say, "Yeah,
you've got a point." </joey>
<joey> For me, all the time, it's just "Go on." </joey>
<joey> I'm listening, </joey>
<connor> but I'm not going to like
take in anything you say. </connor>
<joey> I am just listening. </joey>
<joey> - It's weird because my
whole life growing up, right? </joey>
<joey> I've never met anyone </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> who's been into like really bizarre </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff like that well, not openly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, it's kind of like weird for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've expressed my whole life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I understand now as an adult, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can kind of have my own circles, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> but I wonder why I was like
growing up and like university, </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> how I've never really met anyone </connor>
<connor> who's been very hardcore into
this, at least in the UK. </connor>
<joey> I don't know about elsewhere. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's maybe because </joey>
<joey> they kind of come dime a dozen, right? </joey>
<connor> I think media just makes it so out </connor>
<connor> that there was this like </connor>
<connor> massive large community that
flat-earthers or whatever. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's getting bigger. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is getting bigger.
- It is getting bigger. </garnt>
<connor> - I still don't think
it's to the point where </connor>
<garnt> it's become noticeably bigger, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I still think at the end of the day, </garnt>
<joey> it is still very, very tiny population </joey>
<joey> that actually is involved in this. </joey>
<joey> - It's hard to say, right? </joey>
<joey> It's hard to say. </joey>
<joey> - At least to the point where, </joey>
<joey> they're willing to go to
a convention about it. </joey>
<joey> - It definitely feels
like it's getting bigger. </joey>
<joey> Before I remember hearing
about flat-earthers, </joey>
<joey> and I would just laugh, </joey>
<joey> like that was just like an
urban legend or something. </joey>
<joey> And then you realize that people </joey>
<joey> like this actually exists. </joey>
<joey> They're getting larger </joey>
<joey> because they have a platform
to be able to get larger on, </joey>
<joey> which is, you know, the internet. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I guess the fact that </joey>
<joey> an entire convention exists about this. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, right. </joey>
<connor> - The thing that I hate about it as well, </connor>
<connor> is I hate talking about it, </connor>
<connor> because the more you talk about it, </connor>
<joey> the more you like give them a
strange sense of confidence. </joey>
<joey> Because we're so sure. </joey>
<joey> Because we're so sure that we
know that the earth is round. </joey>
<joey> We know that. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - And it's weird. </joey>
<joey> I feel like the fact that we
almost keep talking about it, </joey>
<joey> and being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, we know, we know it
is you're dumb, you're dumb." </joey>
<joey> They think, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's just adding to the conspiracy," </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's what I've been told to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That everyone's going
to tell me I'm stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone's against me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so it's this weird thing
where I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we just never gave them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any kind of credence before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we never paid any attention to them, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> hundreds of years ago when they said, </joey>
<joey> oh, hundreds years, I think it was fine. </joey>
<joey> But you know, like not 1930s, </joey>
<joey> what I don't know, they
didn't give fucking shit. </joey>
<joey> They were like, </joey>
<joey> "Whatever, you're crazy. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> You have a nice day." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They wouldn't talk about it, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now, because it's so well discussed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's our world spoken about, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I feel like it almost lends itself more </connor>
<connor> confidence on more avenues, </connor>
<connor> to people who are susceptible
to stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> to get into it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I feel the more we talk about it, </joey>
<joey> the more it just gives
that group of people power. </joey>
<joey> Like, "Oh, you finally recognized us. </joey>
<joey> Yes, we do exist." </joey>
<joey> - That's why I always
come from a place of, </joey>
<joey> I want to understand the other side </joey>
<joey> because I feel like it's- </joey>
<connor> - Do you, do you understand? </connor>
<connor> - I do. </connor>
<joey> I do kind of understand where they- </joey>
<joey> - Why do you think it comes from? </joey>
<joey> Why do you think it comes from? </joey>
<connor> How does the person get to like believing </connor>
<connor> in something like that? </connor>
<joey> - Well, a lot of it, like I said, </joey>
<joey> is such a distrust of the system. </joey>
<joey> - Where do you think it comes from? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, where does the distrust
of the system come from? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there's a lot of things </joey>
<joey> that it could come from. </joey>
<joey> A big thing is religion as well. </joey>
<joey> A lot of flat-earthers you see, </joey>
<joey> are very, very religious people, </joey>
<joey> not to say that religion
is the core cause of this. </joey>
<joey> I have to fucking preface that </joey>
<garnt> - Religion, bad. </garnt>
<joey> - I have to preface that as someone </joey>
<garnt> who is religious myself. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's people who are, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who distrust, like
distrust the government, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> distrust organizations so much that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> conspiracy theories to them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seem more palatable
than what everyone else </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is telling them, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> they've grown up in an environment </joey>
<joey> where it's like, </joey>
<joey> don't trust what everyone
else is telling you. </joey>
<joey> And because everyone around them </joey>
<joey> is telling them that they're wrong. </joey>
<joey> That only, like you said, </joey>
<joey> strengthens their views
and looks for more reasons </joey>
<joey> for them to like believe in the system. </joey>
<joey> Believe what they've come to believe. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sympathetic in some ways. </connor>
<connor> I feel like even though,
yeah, you're right. </connor>
<connor> Like, they don't trust in the systems, </connor>
<connor> almost because I think in a lot of ways </connor>
<joey> the systems have failed them, </joey>
<joey> like systems that, </joey>
<joey> we take for granted </joey>
<joey> because we had good upbringings, </joey>
<joey> we're very lucky </joey>
<joey> that we had very ordinary </joey>
<joey> "Lives," </joey>
<joey> had a good education, I suppose. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like, </joey>
<joey> if you're not unfortunate
enough to just kind of </joey>
<joey> not have access to a lot of things, </joey>
<joey> and you're told that certain organizations </joey>
<joey> or things should protect you, </joey>
<joey> or just to learn from these things, </joey>
<joey> and you don't, and they let you down. </joey>
<garnt> I can understand why you'd
almost not trust these systems. </garnt>
<garnt> They're supposed to be
put in place to help you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- So yeah. </garnt>
<joey> It's tough, it's tough. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, which is why </connor>
<connor> I like doing a show like this, </connor>
<joey> because especially on the internet, </joey>
<joey> with how online discourse is. </joey>
<connor> Like I said, last week, </connor>
<connor> people would know what they stand against, </connor>
<connor> but very few people know
what they stand for. </connor>
<joey> And that's just because
it's so much easier </joey>
<joey> to like prove someone else
wrong than prove yourself right. </joey>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<joey> It's come to a point
where I want to understand </joey>
<garnt> the other side, </garnt>
<garnt> because one thing that's missing from </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of online discourse
and online discussions </garnt>
<garnt> is people are trying to
fucking understand each other. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's just trying
to prove each other wrong </garnt>
<garnt> rather than having a healthy debate. </garnt>
<garnt> I think having an understanding
of the other side, </garnt>
<garnt> is the first step to
having a healthy debate. </garnt>
<garnt> And so if I can understand flat-earthers, </garnt>
<joey> then who the fucking on the
internet can't I understand, </joey>
<joey> and that's why I do this shit. </joey>
<joey> - If open conversations when
normalized on the internet, </joey>
<joey> we'd all be driving flying
cars, you know, like yeah, </joey>
<joey> exactly side. </joey>
<connor> But unfortunately we
are still on the ground. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It says a lot of our society. </connor>
<garnt> - It says a lot of our society. </garnt>
<joey> - It says a lot of our society. </joey>
<joey> - We can't even have an open conversation </joey>
<joey> about flat-earthers or not. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, okay, </connor>
<connor> people, </connor>
<connor> very dump. </connor>
<connor> But also extremely susceptible, right? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yes.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Any like war ever, right. </connor>
<connor> You have to convince your people </connor>
<connor> that you want to fight something. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How do you do that? </joey>
<joey> How do you convince a whole
population of people that. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, ask Hitler. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> But that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> And I believe this was
like really well-documented </joey>
<connor> after world war two. </connor>
<joey> - Well, what if there's a very small, </joey>
<connor> but possible chance that </connor>
<garnt> you have weapons of mass destruction? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm joking out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or, they've got a bit of oil. </garnt>
<garnt> They've got a bit of oil. </garnt>
<garnt> Stock prices go boom. </garnt>
<garnt> - You like cars? </garnt>
<connor> Do you like driving? </connor>
<joey> - I'll find the video link, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt asked me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched this video
and it was by this guy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was basically talking about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how we'll go to after world war two, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a few Jewish people who had fled, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and a few scientists who lived in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They wanted to study how
people could go along </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with like really bad atrocities
in like world war II, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What made your everyday
guy, like a normal dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> just kind of like sign up and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, we'll we'll do this." </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like the whole the Nazi party. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, how they just kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some of the really horrible stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how you could convince people </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> that this was the right thing to do. </joey>
<joey> And it was basically explaining how, like, </joey>
<joey> there was like certain
traits that one might have, </joey>
<joey> which would make you more
susceptible to end up doing </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some personality traits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was really interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's stuff that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> you wouldn't think correlates to you. </joey>
<joey> Like you think, "Oh, I'm
really strong-willed." </joey>
<joey> But maybe you like strong leaders, </joey>
<joey> strong leaders to ask
you to do bad things. </joey>
<joey> "Oh, maybe he's justified it
in a way that makes sense," </joey>
<joey> right. </joey>
<joey> I think we all like to
think that we are like this, </joey>
<joey> oh, what's the word? </joey>
<joey> - Impenetrable. </joey>
<joey> - Impenetrable, fortress of mind, </joey>
<joey> that nobody can affect our opinion </joey>
<joey> or woo us to do something
that we would never do. </joey>
<joey> I think in reality,
we're a lot more fickle. </joey>
<joey> - It happens all the time. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there is literally
a psychological experiment </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a details that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember the exact
name of the experiments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's on Josh's Podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't exactly remember it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I roughly went a long. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I know, Ashley, can you
search up the experiment? </joey>
<joey> It's fuck. </joey>
<connor> - [Ashley] That's the prisoner one, yeah? </connor>
<joey> - No, that one was bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - It's not the prison,
that's the Stanford one. </joey>
<joey> - Can you explain it?
- Is it the electricity one? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's the electricity one. </joey>
<joey> So, it's the one where. </joey>
<connor> - Authority. </connor>
<connor> Basically they'll tell that there's happy. </connor>
<joey> - Is it Milgram Experiment. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] I don't know </joey>
<connor> what experiment you're talking about. </connor>
<connor> - They'll turn up the electricity </connor>
<joey> because somebody tells them to do it. </joey>
<joey> Because they say that it's like a good, </joey>
<garnt> but then they have like
a fake person screaming </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> while they're turning up the electricity, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and someone keeps telling
them to keep doing it, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> and they keep doing it. </joey>
<joey> Because a doctor or an authority figure </joey>
<joey> is telling them to keep doing it. </joey>
<joey> - So it's basically like
fake "Squid Game", right? </joey>
<joey> So you're put into a room. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why did you have to bring, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> this is part of like the deepest
debate we were ever having. </connor>
<connor> And Garnt is like, "It's kind
of like a society we live in, </connor>
<joey> like "Squid Game". </joey>
<connor> - You could've just said liar game, </connor>
<joey> there's better examples. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, Ashley.
- Okay, Ashley. </joey>
<connor> - [Ashley] Ugh, I think it's
called the Milgram Experiment. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Milgram's Experiment, that's it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I said, Milner, it's Milgram. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> And basically the whole thing is framed </joey>
<joey> as a memory exercise, right? </joey>
<joey> So, you, the person </joey>
<joey> who's the being
experimented on, basically. </joey>
<joey> You're told that you're going to take part </joey>
<joey> in a memory exercise, </joey>
<joey> and you're going to sit in a
room with a person next to you. </joey>
<joey> And one of you is going
to be the person learning. </joey>
<joey> And one of you is going
to be the tester, right? </joey>
<joey> And so what you're told is that </joey>
<joey> if you are given an electric shock, </joey>
<joey> if you get an answer
wrong, then in theory, </joey>
<joey> then you should be a better learner </joey>
<joey> because your doing like shock therapy. </joey>
<joey> That's what you're told. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, that's complete bullshit </joey>
<joey> because this experiment's got nothing </joey>
<joey> to do with a memory, right. </joey>
<joey> So, one of you by chance, </joey>
<joey> is the learner. </joey>
<joey> One of you is the teacher, </joey>
<joey> or the experimenter or the teacher. </joey>
<joey> But in reality, </joey>
<joey> you're going to be given
the teacher, right. </joey>
<garnt> Because you're the only
person who's actually being </garnt>
<garnt> experimented on, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And so the other person who is the learner </garnt>
<garnt> goes in another room, </garnt>
<garnt> and you have to give them
a memory quiz, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And the problem is they're
going to get it wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's part of the design
of the experiments, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're shown, </garnt>
<garnt> you're given a taste of
what the electric shock </garnt>
<garnt> that they're going to be
feeling feels like, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And this like on the lowest level, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And so as this experiment goes on, </garnt>
<garnt> originally, they get the questions, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they get one answer wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> And so you have to administer
them an electric shock, </garnt>
<garnt> and they feel like pain, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And you hear them feel pain. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't see it, but you
hear them in another room, </garnt>
<garnt> even though it's just a prerecording. </garnt>
<garnt> And then as they get more questions wrong, </garnt>
<garnt> the scientist tells you </garnt>
<garnt> to up the voltage and
administer the shock, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And they keep getting it wrong, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And so the scientists keeps
telling you to up the voltage, </garnt>
<garnt> and keep administering this
electric shock until to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where like, they are fucking
screaming out in agony, </garnt>
<garnt> or you can hear them on the
speaker screaming out in agony. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it gets to a point
when it's just silence, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just silence, </garnt>
<garnt> and then the scientists keeps telling you, </garnt>
<garnt> "Just up the voltage. Up the voltage. </garnt>
<garnt> Keep going, keep going." </garnt>
<garnt> And like the amounts of people who, </garnt>
<garnt> even though they were totally
uncomfortable with the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that they could hear someone
screaming from the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> they were administering
this electric shock, </garnt>
<garnt> and it still went silent, </garnt>
<garnt> they went all the way up to the end. </garnt>
<garnt> And they still administered
like the most high voltage in </garnt>
<garnt> their mind electric shock to this person. </garnt>
<joey> - What a big brain experiment? </joey>
<connor> - Because we trust authority figures. </connor>
<garnt> - And like, it just proved that </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of people, </garnt>
<garnt> the majority of people
will be willing to listen </garnt>
<joey> to a person who they view </joey>
<joey> as an authority figure to
tell them to do something. </joey>
<joey> Even if it's like a bad thing. </joey>
<joey> - Even if it goes against
what they believe, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Even if it's a horrible act. </joey>
<joey> It's a very interesting
psychological experiment. </joey>
<joey> - Scam. </joey>
<joey> - It could be turned into a "Squid Game". </joey>
<joey> That's what I said, </joey>
<joey> this kind of sounds like
a "Squid Game", right? </joey>
<joey> - It's literally has nothing to do with. </joey>
<joey> - It kind of sounds like a "Squid Game". </joey>
<joey> - The writers for season two
are like, "Write that down." </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - This literally has nothing
to do with "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - "Squid Game" season
two Milgram's experiment. </joey>
<joey> - This literally has nothing
to do with "Squid Game". </joey>
<joey> - I want to see Milgram's experiment, </joey>
<joey> and "Squid Game" season two. </joey>
<joey> - The shock game. </joey>
<garnt> But it's like actually a
shock, they actually die. </garnt>
<garnt> See, that's just goes to show how, </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many people who
say like I'm not gullible. </garnt>
<garnt> But we all are to a certain degree. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel, we constantly get told </garnt>
<joey> to do things that originally
go against what we believe in, </joey>
<joey> or very easily persuaded by just someone, </joey>
<joey> even if they don't have that
much of an authoritative, </joey>
<joey> vibe about them to just be
like, "Oh, well, I mean, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> this person who in my mind is
more authoritative about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> particular subject than I am, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is saying something." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - That's the point, yeah,
you just trust them. </connor>
<connor> - Like the whole fact that, </connor>
<garnt> we have a literal audience
of people who will probably </garnt>
<garnt> change their mind about
something we say on the show </garnt>
<garnt> or something we say on our own channels. </garnt>
<joey> - Animes maybe. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I say so-and-so anime sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, there's probably a number
of people who are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, you're probably right." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though I have zero authority
over that person, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> And I know that happens </joey>
<joey> because it's the opposite
has happened to me as well. </joey>
<connor> - It's happens to all of us. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it happens to all of us. </joey>
<connor> - It's the reason why we have conflict. </connor>
<connor> People are good at persuading people. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like we're just breaking
down the most fundamental </joey>
<connor> problem about humanity. </connor>
<joey> It's like, "You are not me." </joey>
<joey> - We've got like three deep conversations </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> on three episodes in a row now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is deep taste now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like deep talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Deep taste.
- Deep taste. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Deep taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Why you going to word it like that? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - We went from shitty to this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why you going to word it like that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Deep taste, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Is deep in fancy font? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor And Garnt] Deep taste. </connor>
<connor> - No wonder that sounds so gross. </connor>
<connor> - It's not gross. </connor>
<connor> It's only gross if you make it gross. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you played Metal Gear Solid 1? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you played Metal Gear Solid 1? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never like caught on to this as a kid. </garnt>
<garnt> But remember when Snake gets a call </garnt>
<garnt> from like a random person, </garnt>
<garnt> at the time, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't know who it is,
it's just static on screen. </garnt>
<garnt> He tells Snake to call him, </garnt>
<garnt> "Just call me Deep Throat." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, how's
did I never registered that </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> as a kid. </joey>
<garnt> - What was the content? </garnt>
<connor> Why did he tell him the
call him Deep Throat? </connor>
<garnt> - Because he has a deep voice, </garnt>
<joey> and that's the reason. </joey>
<joey> As a kid playing I'm like,
that's a cool name, Deep Throat. </joey>
<connor> - It's like the dominatrix
thing all over again. </connor>
<joey> It's just going to be another thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Hideo Kojima, do you
know what you're doing? </garnt>
<joey> Or are you just like is your
mind is built differently? </joey>
<joey> - He definitely plan that out for sure. </joey>
<garnt> Remember when he went
around to everyone to calm </garnt>
<garnt> and he was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Check this out." </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe it was a mistranslation. </garnt>
<joey> - I came up with the best idea. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe it was a mistranslation who knows? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - I mean, if anything, </joey>
<joey> it's probably not even a mistranslation. </joey>
<joey> It's probably a direct translation </joey>
<joey> because we don't call it that in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> So, it was probably like
to a Japanese audience. </joey>
<joey> So it was like, Deep Throat, </joey>
<garnt> it was like, "Wow." </garnt>
<garnt> - "Wow, that sounds cool."
- That's fucking cool. </garnt>
<joey> Hell yeah, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Deep Throat.
- Deep Throat. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey speaks in Japanese) </garnt>
<connor> - You sound like Japanese
Harry Potter, bro. </connor>
<joey> - That is my favorite thing though. </joey>
<joey> When they take like just
ridiculous English words, </joey>
<garnt> and just like directly say it in Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> The Japanese think it's the
coolest sounding thing ever, </garnt>
<joey> even though it sounds
goofy as fuck in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - It's always also just Hideo Kojima, </joey>
<connor> - That man is on one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. He's on one. </connor>
<connor> Has any of you played a
"Death Stranding" yet? </connor>
<connor> - No.
- I really want to, </connor>
<connor> and then I also really don't want to, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's one of those games where, </connor>
<joey> I see so many clips out of context. </joey>
<joey> I want to play this just
to see this in context. </joey>
<joey> - This is like the first
trend type of game. </joey>
<joey> - I just couldn't fucking believe </joey>
<joey> that the final cuts
scene is two hours long. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you have to understand, right? </connor>
<joey> You guys know, I don't like cut scenes. </joey>
<joey> I actually like, I cannot play that game. </joey>
<connor> - I can just imagine you getting </connor>
<joey> to that final cut scene, </joey>
<garnt> and the moment you press the skip button, </garnt>
<garnt> you miss about 5% of the game. </garnt>
<joey> - Can you even skip? </joey>
<joey> - I can just imagine
you starting the game, </joey>
<connor> and you're just like,
where's the gameplay start. </connor>
<connor> You just walk in. </connor>
<joey> Where's the gameplay?
Where's the gameplay? </joey>
<connor> - That would be the angriest livestream </connor>
<connor> I'd have probably ever had to. </connor>
<joey> - I would love to watch
your play "Death Stranding". </joey>
<connor> I was going to say deep straining. </connor>
<joey> - Deep. </joey>
<connor> - Deep straining. </connor>
<connor> - Deep straining.
- Deep straining. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - It didn't look very good. I don't think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dunkey enjoyed it, the
third time he played it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Third time.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Third time.
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> and his like the most
monkey brain game after. </joey>
<joey> - No his not. </joey>
<connor> - He has more patience than me. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, </joey>
<connor> I think it says a lot that
Dunkey enjoyed a game like that. </connor>
<garnt> - It says a lot.
- Like he hates. </garnt>
<garnt> - It says a lot about Dunkey.
- It says a lot about Dunkey. </garnt>
<garnt> - It says a lot about Dunkey, </garnt>
<garnt> when he enjoys the "Death Stranding" </garnt>
<joey> but he can't stand a single JRPG. </joey>
<connor> - I understand though.
JRPG are mind numbing. </connor>
<joey> - I don't want to get into that topic. </joey>
<joey> - We've already spoken about
that like a million times. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to.
JRPG is bad. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, he ruined it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's all. </connor>
<connor> I was saying like, I love like, </connor>
<connor> the whole thing about like Japanese, </connor>
<joey> just like directly translating
English names into Japanese, </joey>
<joey> and then the Japanese thinking it's cool. </joey>
<joey> Like Harry Potter characters
are a perfect example of that. </joey>
<joey> - Okay.
- Like Dumbledore, right? </joey>
<connor> Really cool English name. </connor>
<connor> Dumbledore is not a cool man. </connor>
<connor> - I kind of fuck with it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Every time I hear a Harry Potter character </joey>
<joey> said in a Japanese
pronunciation, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "How did that sound 10 times
goofier than the English name?" </joey>
<connor> - I can't think of Dumbledore now </connor>
<joey> without thinking about the meme of like, </joey>
<joey> - I can't either. </joey>
<garnt> Of like the Dumbledore said calmly meme. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you write your name
on the Goblet of Fire? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That meme has physically
ruined those movies to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I literally, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I cannot watch the "Goblet of Fire" </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> because all I will be doing
is waiting for that scene. </joey>
<joey> - And then the moment it
gets to that scene you just </joey>
<joey> turn it off.
It's like, am satisfied. </joey>
<joey> - I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. </joey>
<joey> - I'll be like giggling away. </joey>
<joey> And someone be like,
"What's wrong, Connor?" </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "Nothing, you
wouldn't understand this." </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - He said it so calmly.
- He said it so calmly. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> In case you didn't know. </connor>
<connor> There's this meme where like in the book </connor>
<connor> it's like Stephen Fry's
narrating it going, </connor>
<connor> "And Dumbledore said calmly," </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it cuts to the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like someone edit it and then
it's just Dumbledore again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Did you write your name
on the Goblet of Fire?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like, so fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - [Stephen Fry] Did you put your name </connor>
<connor> into the goblet of fire, Harry? </connor>
<joey> - [Dumbledore] Harry,
did you write your name </joey>
<connor> into the Goblet of Fire? </connor>
<joey> Please go and watch it. </joey>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<joey> - It's kind of like the equivalent, </joey>
<joey> of a "Trash Taste" viewer saying, </joey>
<joey> "And then Garnt said, he prefers
bone on chicken, calmly." </joey>
<garnt> - Calmly. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cut to the "Trash Taste" clip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was having a discussion yesterday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've spoken a lot about
good Japanese food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can we speak about Japanese food that </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> fucking straight up sucks? </joey>
<joey> - Be my guest. </joey>
<joey> - First of all. </joey>
<joey> - What do you think sucks? </joey>
<joey> - You go to the user card, right? </joey>
<joey> You boys are ordering, you
all like ordering, right? </joey>
<joey> You're getting Gyoza. </joey>
<joey> Gyoza is good. </joey>
<joey> You're getting maybe some Yakiniku, right. </joey>
<garnt> Meat on a stick, right?
Great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yakitori, you mean?
- Yakitori, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you can get some Yakiniku, </joey>
<joey> maybe I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - And an Isekai, some fancy ass Isekai. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe you get some fried
chicken with the bones. </joey>
<joey> Maybe someone orders
something and you're like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, this is fried chicken, right?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're like, "Why is it tastes like bone?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, it's Tendons. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - It's like </joey>
<joey> - [All] Cartilage. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - For some reason they just
like deep fried cartilage. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> And it's like the worst eating experience. </joey>
<joey> - I love that shit, dude. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, imagine greasy bones. </joey>
<joey> It's literally greasy bones
is what it feels like. </joey>
<joey> - I love that shit. </joey>
<connor> It's like your crunching a
small animals, bones with oil. </connor>
<joey> Like it's awful. </joey>
<joey> - You got insert dominance. </joey>
<joey> - I agree with you, Connor. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - Put it there, Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> Gentleman's agreement. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a historical moment right there, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> ladies and gentlemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> They agree on something. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so bad. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't know how you like it. </connor>
<joey> - I used to hate it. </joey>
<joey> If that's any consideration. </joey>
<joey> - What happened to you? </joey>
<connor> - This is the man who would eat anything. </connor>
<connor> This is the man who will eat anything. </connor>
<joey> - I understand you'll eat anything. </joey>
<joey> But there has to be some
dishes where you got like, </joey>
<connor> "I'll eat it. But life
is kind of whack." Right? </connor>
<connor> - Olives. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- [Connor And Garnt] - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey's like fermented fish shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> chopped with fermented soybeans, </connor>
<connor> love it can't get enough. </connor>
<connor> But Joe he's like, "Olives." </connor>
<joey> - I do not like olives. </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Bro, Italians a crying, right now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean like I like olive oil. </connor>
<joey> I like olive on pizza. </joey>
<connor> - Why, what part is it? </connor>
<connor> Is it the seed? </connor>
<joey> - It's just too strong of a flavor. </joey>
<joey> - You like olive oil?
- Oh, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I don't like fucking
down a pint of olive oil </garnt>
<garnt> on my spare time. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you Italian? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> No, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shocker. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I am wearing a lot of
references to an Italian guy, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> but, no, am not Italian. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - It just came out of nowhere. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - So Joey, he doesn't olives. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll eat any kind of fermented shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> but I draw the line on olives. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> One green boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey, the man who tried, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> who tried like bird fetus. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "I kind of fuck with it." </garnt>
<garnt> Olive, "No, get that shit out of here." </garnt>
<joey> - When I say I don't like olives, </joey>
<connor> - Green or black, both? </connor>
<connor> - Green, mostly I don't. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Black olives I like actually. </connor>
<connor> - Green are stronger, normally. </connor>
<connor> - Green is a little stronger. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, and when I
say I don't like olives, </connor>
<joey> it's not that if I get
a plate of green olives, </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to eat it at all. </joey>
<joey> - Have you seen that clip? </joey>
<joey> Sorry to interrupt but, </joey>
<joey> I just have this image
of Joey being that person </joey>
<joey> where it's shows a clip of
like a talk show or something. </joey>
<joey> And the host goes, "Bring
out the olives," and like, </joey>
<joey> they bring out a jar of olives, </joey>
<joey> this woman just starts fucking losing it. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, it's the peaches, right? </garnt>
<joey> - No, it's olives, it's olives. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw another one of like this woman </garnt>
<joey> who had like a deathly
phobia towards peaches. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I didn't see that one. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like an Ellen
show and they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, so you'll definitely
afraid of peaches." </garnt>
<garnt> And then she says like
the scientific phobia </garnt>
<garnt> word for someone who's afraid of peaches. </garnt>
<garnt> And then behind them on the giant screen </garnt>
<garnt> is just a picture of a peach. </garnt>
<joey> And this woman just
screams out of the room, </joey>
<joey> and the audience is laughing. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "This is horrible." </joey>
<joey> She literally just said
she doesn't like peaches. </joey>
<joey> - I got a clip. </joey>
<garnt> - Mary, you're let go of me. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I can't. </garnt>
<garnt> - [TV Host] Bring out the olives. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Mary] No. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - I just imagine that. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey screaming) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so, finish your
point, finish your point. </joey>
<joey> - So, my point was, when I
said I don't like a food, </joey>
<joey> there is very rarely a food
that I will just straight up, </joey>
<joey> not eat. </joey>
<joey> Like I said, I don't like a food. </joey>
<joey> I mean, like, it wouldn't be
my first choice of eating it. </joey>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> But if I'm at like a
house party or something, </connor>
<connor> or like wine and cheese party
and I see some olives there, </connor>
<connor> I'll fucking eat it </connor>
<connor> because it comes with the thing, right. </connor>
<connor> But if someone just gave
me some fucking olives, </connor>
<joey> and was like, "Eat it
now," and I'll be like- </joey>
<connor> - I don't know why this makes me so angry, </connor>
<joey> I have to say this, right. </joey>
<joey> - No, I mean, it's not my first choice. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I can live the rest of my life, </joey>
<joey> not eating it and be completely fine. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I'd rather eat
olives than most Isekai food. </joey>
<joey> I think I've realized that. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, yeah.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - I think now that I've
lived in Japan for a year, </joey>
<connor> I've kind of come to like,
"Nobody likes Isekai foods." </connor>
<connor> - It's very limited. </connor>
<connor> - Williams are crying now. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember when I first moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I would never
get fucking bored of this. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> And now two years in, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Can I have a proper meal please?" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it just kind of suck. </connor>
<connor> Because sometimes you just want to, like, </connor>
<connor> you want to eat healthy, but
it's impossible with Isekai. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, I think </connor>
<connor> before anyone starts the think so </connor>
<connor> I don't go to like
Isekai every fucking day. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - I'm also like to the
point now where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I could go an entire month
without eating Isekai food, </joey>
<joey> like easily,
- We have. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but like every now and then, </joey>
<joey> if I go to Isekai with
some mates, then yeah, </joey>
<joey> I'll eat the food there. </joey>
<joey> It's not going be the
greatest meal of my life. </joey>
<joey> - Because the issue is right. </joey>
<joey> Let's say you got a
British eating culture. </joey>
<joey> You have a meal and then
you have the drinks, right. </joey>
<joey> And I thought, what was
cool about these Isekai </joey>
<joey> is that there is a whole
eating culture around it. </joey>
<joey> Where you go to Isekai
you have a meal there, </joey>
<joey> and you can drink
shocker at the same time. </joey>
<joey> Until I realized that
most easy kind of food </joey>
<joey> is just basically snacks. </joey>
<joey> So, you're having a meal
basically just on like snacks </joey>
<joey> or like meat. </joey>
<joey> It's not like a meal, meal, </joey>
<joey> but it's still enough to fill you up. </joey>
<joey> I never go to an Isekai and get like, </joey>
<joey> satisfied with the meal. </joey>
<joey> It always feels like you just
ate like a bag of like Doritos </joey>
<joey> or something and that was
like your meal for the day. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of what it feels like. </joey>
<joey> - You don't come out of Isekai going, </joey>
<joey> "I had a great meal." </joey>
<joey> You come out full. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> You come out full, you
come feeling disgusting, </connor>
<joey> and you come out like, "Sh, I don't know." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. There's so many foods down there. </connor>
<joey> They're just like, "This is bad." </joey>
<joey> I don't know what fish it is, </joey>
<joey> but it's just a toenail. </joey>
<connor> Like it's literally a toenail. </connor>
<joey> Like it's the one thing
that Yaki always orders. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What is it? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck are they called? </joey>
<joey> - The Scaped Fin. </joey>
<joey> Scaped Fin is it? </joey>
<connor> - I just call them flat flops. </connor>
<joey> What are they called? </joey>
<joey> - The stingrays.
- Stingrays. </joey>
<garnt> - The rays, the rays.
- Stingrays. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, not stingrays. </garnt>
<garnt> Just rays.
- Rays. </garnt>
<garnt> - Flat flops. </garnt>
<garnt> - They are the ones that
fly like this, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - They bring this out, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> It looks like a toenail, right. </connor>
<joey> - Steve Owen like fucking
rolling in his grave. </joey>
<joey> - Steve Owen die from
a poisonous flat flop. </joey>
<connor> - It's like this fucking toenail
ass looking thing, right. </connor>
<joey> What does it, dry. </joey>
<joey> - It's dried stingray.
it's dried ray. </joey>
<joey> - It comes out and you
have it and your like, </joey>
<joey> it literally tastes like nothing. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't taste of anything. </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean? It tastes like fish. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't even taste like fish. </joey>
<joey> It tastes like nothing. </joey>
<connor> And it's just chewy really hard. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, why? </connor>
<connor> Why? Why are they storing it? </connor>
<joey> - That's most like dried fish snacks here. </joey>
<connor> - Some are more way
flavorful and nice though. </connor>
<connor> - Same with like the
shredded fish as well. </connor>
<connor> - I like the squid, "Squid Game". </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - The fried squid. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - It's kind of like a "Squid Game". </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - The fried squid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because you can get a
convening like 20 different </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> variations of squid. </joey>
<joey> Squid tastes good. I like squid. </joey>
<joey> - I like squid.
- It's good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, squid is good. </joey>
<joey> And then there's another
thing that's like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is. </joey>
<connor> It's like octopus. </connor>
<connor> It's gooey. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, Takowasa? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that stuff is, oh. </connor>
<joey> - There's like it's octopus with Wasabi. </joey>
<connor> You just put it in a blender. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's rough.
Oh, it's rough. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I love it. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's rough.
Oh, it's so rough. </joey>
<joey> And Joey of course the,
first time I came here </joey>
<joey> made me fucking eat it. </joey>
<joey> It's terrible.
- It's great, I love it. </joey>
<connor> - And then half the menu you look at it, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> am not eating this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's talk about fish semen. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Have we talking about fish semen yet? </joey>
<connor> What's it called again? </connor>
<connor> - No, it's the sperm sack.
- It's the sperm sack. </connor>
<connor> - Shirako.
- Shirako. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, fucking awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the thing is </garnt>
<garnt> every Japanese person will order Shirako </garnt>
<joey> for you to like try out, </joey>
<joey> but no one is going to tell you what it is </joey>
<joey> until you take your first bite. </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure that's
what I did with you too. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>

<connor> I prefer anything other

<joey> It's not that it's a sperm sack, </joey>
<joey> is that it tastes like shit. </joey>
<connor> If sperm sacks tasted
good, I'd chow down on one. </connor>
<joey> I got no resume. </joey>
<joey> - He's a Jojo fan. </joey>
<joey> - His just used to drinking sperm. </joey>
<connor> - It's practically my job. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thing with Shirako. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> It's the same thing with me. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I like it. </connor>
<connor> - Which fish it from, by the way? </connor>
<joey> - I couldn't tell you what one of them. </joey>
<connor> - Who did this? </connor>
<connor> This is some foods I'm like, "Who? Who?" </connor>
<connor> - The Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - Who opened this fish up, saw
like the reproductive organ, </connor>
<connor> was like, "Bro, are
you going to eat that?" </connor>
<joey> - Japan is a country that's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this fish is poisonous, bet." </joey>
<joey> And then they spend
the next hundreds years </joey>
<joey> training to eat </joey>
<joey> the tiny little pod that
tastes like nothing. </joey>
<joey> Do you like sea urchin? </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<connor> - I don't like sea urchin, right. </connor>
<connor> - You don't? </connor>
<joey> I don't, it's really strong flavor. </joey>
<joey> - To be fair sea urchin </joey>
<joey> is like one of the most like- </joey>
<connor> - It's not strong flavor.
- It's very strong. </connor>
<joey> - sea urchin is one of the
most polarizing Sushi, I think. </joey>
<connor> - It's like the Wasabi of fish. </connor>
<garnt> It feels like a gas attack
went off in your mouth. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really.
- What are you talking about? </garnt>
<connor> - For me, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally called
the butter of the sea. </connor>
<connor> It's smooth as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - It is so strong. </connor>
<connor> - What are you actually talking about? </connor>
<connor> - I don't think you ate sea urchin. </connor>
<joey> - I have. I had sea urchin. </joey>
<joey> - Are you sure just didn't eat Wasabi. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no.
I had a sea urchin. </joey>
<joey> - You know you eat the
inside of the sea urchin, </joey>
<joey> not the outside. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that the reason why I
didn't understand the sea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, auh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't understand what sea urchin was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Why is it
a paste? That's weird." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Until I went to a place
where they like crack </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that bad boy open in front
of me and scooped it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Oh, mouth watering right now. </joey>
<joey> - Connor, I can only
get so erect, come on. </joey>
<joey> - Again, I had reservations against it. </joey>
<joey> I'd had sea urchin before. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't a fan. </joey>
<garnt> It's a cool name. </garnt>
<garnt> One of the coolest fishes
names out there in English. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sea urchin.
- Sea urchin. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> It sounds like some Norse
god, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, oh, like salmon, I sleep, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sea urchin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like something died
to make this fish, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> So, they crack it open. </garnt>
<garnt> Again, like with Wasabi, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't typically like Wasabi. </garnt>
<garnt> It's horseradish. </garnt>
<garnt> It's horseradish Wasabi. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not a big fan of it. </garnt>
<garnt> When I went to a place
and that gave real Wasabi, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "Okay, I'll give it a chance." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was insanely different,
amazing, actually amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you don't like Wasabi,
try the real stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's insanely expensive. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But if you get a chance, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how it, it just came up. </joey>
<joey> - You're not going to get the chance. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how it came up. </joey>
<joey> It was just in a course and
they just brought it out, </joey>
<connor> and they were like, you grind it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I don't know what am doing. </connor>
<joey> - It's very expensive. </joey>
<connor> - Asked me to grind a diamond. </connor>
<connor> They crack it open. </connor>
<connor> They put it on. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "okay." </connor>
<joey> I try it. </joey>
<joey> It tastes like shit still. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't enjoy it. </joey>
<connor> And I wanted to like it so badly. </connor>
<connor> - What is it that you don't like about it? </connor>
<connor> I've given sea urchin to bunch of friends </connor>
<connor> who've come here because I'm like, </connor>
<joey> whenever friends come over and they say, </joey>
<joey> "I want to go eat some real Sushi". </joey>
<joey> I'm like, all right, </joey>
<joey> but you have to be open
to trying some shit </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're not going to get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, please, yeah.
- Thank you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You like sea urchin, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - [Meilyne] I love sea urchin. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, okay, I'll take
you to a Sushi place, </connor>
<connor> but you have to be open </connor>
<joey> to not just trying a
fucking California roll. </joey>
<joey> Like you have to try like some weird shit. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> So, are you prepared for that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I always give them sea urchin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like so far, </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> I think in my well with
my group of friends, </garnt>
<garnt> it's been a 50/50. </garnt>
<garnt> Half of them, love it and the other half </garnt>
<joey> say that it's like two fishy. </joey>
<joey> - I think the problem with sea urchin </joey>
<joey> is that it's really easy to
get bad quality sea urchin. </joey>
<connor> - It's notoriously like one of the fish </connor>
<joey> that can make you like sick and throw up. </joey>
<connor> It's really easy to get bad quality. </connor>
<connor> - I've had bad sea urchin before, </connor>
<connor> and it tastes bad. </connor>
<joey> But like, if it's like really
good quality sea urchin. </joey>
<joey> Like the fresher shit. </joey>
<joey> - Like bad oyster is really bad, </joey>
<joey> but good oyster is like. </joey>
<joey> - What I love about-
- Okay, go ahead. </joey>
<joey> - No, you go ahead, you
can finish what you had. </joey>
<joey> - What I love about sea
urchin is that it literally, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how I can describe it, </joey>
<joey> but it literally feels like
you are eating the sea. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of what it
feels like to me, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, no.
- The whole ocean and all. </joey>
<garnt> - I agree.
- The whole of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because it's fishy, </garnt>
<garnt> but it also has like a salty texture too. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a bit sweet as well.
- It's a little bit sweet. </joey>
<joey> - It's like really good sea urchin. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of like downing some sea water, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> but it tastes actually nice.
It's really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never heard somebody describe it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in such unappetizing way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you could take
the essence of the sea, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> and put it into a food
that would be sea urchin. </joey>
<joey> - That's weird, right?
What his saying, right? </joey>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, see Meilyne agrees.
- Meilyne hears me. </garnt>
<joey> Meilyne is a real one.
Meilyne is a real one. </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne is just inclined
to just disagree with me </connor>
<joey> I think on a professional basis. </joey>
<joey> When I go to like a Sushi restaurant, </joey>
<joey> where the Sushi chef. </joey>
<joey> What is it you call the Sushi chef? </joey>
<joey> Sushi chef? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Sushi chef. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you master that?
Master Meilyne. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sushi chef are masters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When you go to restaurants where, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> you can go to the conveyor
belt ones, which are good, </joey>
<joey> they are too cheap,
pretty easy with the guys. </joey>
<joey> Or you can go to ones
where it's like a course. </joey>
<joey> You sit in front of it. </joey>
<joey> And at lunch menu, it's
only pretty cheap in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And when I've gone there, </joey>
<joey> always when sea urchin comes up. </joey>
<joey> Okay, first of all, I
never ever waste the Sushi, </joey>
<joey> especially if the guy's right there. </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't dare be like, "No, I'm okay." </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like that is like a sin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you can not look this guy in the eye </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> who is been there like 20 years. </connor>
<connor> - I think I'd rather like
slap his wife in the face </connor>
<joey> that refuse the Sushi, honestly, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, like the sea urchin comes out, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> and the thing is sometimes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if it's a really small restaurant, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> they watch you eat it and they
want to hear you say like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's amazing." </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's it's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't mind because most of the time, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> shit slaps and I'm like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, there's another one. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> This is a good one. Keep it coming." </connor>
<connor> - He don't miss. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, this is good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that macro.
(Connor grunting) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> "Bring up the next one. Like I'm ready." </joey>
<joey> Oh, fuck, oh, it's sea urchin, okay. </joey>
<joey> All right, well, get the water ready? </joey>
<joey> Get the green tea ready? </joey>
<connor> I just like put it all in
one and I'm like, "Mm-hmm." </connor>
<connor> (Connor speaking in Japanese) </connor>
<joey> - But most places like that,
they tell you beforehand, </joey>
<joey> what fish you like and
what fish you don't like. </joey>
<connor> - Bro, shit going so fast. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know what
they're saying half the time. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so, life hacks for
people coming to Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I don't even want what's the
sea urchin name in Japanese. </connor>
<joey> I forgot.
- [Joey and Garnt] Uni. </joey>
<joey> - Uni, that's it. </joey>
<connor> - Uni, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Most places that
aren't conveyable Sushi, </joey>
<joey> and it's like a set course. </joey>
<joey> The chef will usually, if
it's a good restaurant, </joey>
<joey> they'll come out and tell you
what fish do you not like, </joey>
<joey> because they're not
going to fucking waste it </joey>
<connor> on someone who doesn't like that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm wasting this man's ingredients. </connor>
<joey> - So next time just say like, "No uni." </joey>
<connor> - Part of me is like,
I paid for this course. </connor>
<joey> I'm eating this. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even give a
fucking if I don't like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm eating this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to show full appreciation
to this guy and his craft. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> Even if I don't like it. </joey>
<joey> - But you can, by telling them that like, </joey>
<connor> "I don't know if am
going to eat this fish." </connor>
<joey> - I just think there
was no bigger compliment </joey>
<joey> than me being like, "Boss man, </joey>
<joey> the rest of this food was banging. </joey>
<joey> If you have faith in this, am eat it." </joey>
<connor> - If I was a chef, I've
rather you just straight up, </connor>
<joey> tell me what fish you don't want. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe am too British.
I don't know, man. </garnt>
<joey> Am too British. </joey>
<connor> - Rather than sitting
there and watching you go. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I wouldn't dare pull a face, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a face. It's mild discomfort </garnt>
<connor> before the moment I put it in my mouth, </connor>
<connor> it's stone-cold face. </connor>
<garnt> (Connor speaking in Japanese) </garnt>
<connor> - I kind of have that
with Shirako as well? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you got it. </joey>
<connor> As a British person. </connor>
<connor> It is not an option to be like, </connor>
<joey> "I don't want that." </joey>
<connor> Or like "I don't eat that." </connor>
<connor> - I remember because </connor>
<connor> I was in this restaurant. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> We missed the fact that
Shirako was part of the course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like this like seven course meal. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - And the sperm sack, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it was a sperm sack in
the hotel we were staying at. </connor>
<connor> We missed the part that was Shirako there. </connor>
<connor> And they put it in front of
us to like with me and Sydney. </connor>
<garnt> And I was just like, "Oh,
oh no, it's this thing." </garnt>
<garnt> And Sydney doesn't know what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Let her eat it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like, do I tell her? </garnt>
<garnt> Or do I not? </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a loving partner. </garnt>
<garnt> I did tell her. </garnt>
<connor> - No, she's not going to eat it 100%. </connor>
<joey> - She's not going to eat it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I thought she was like me, right. </joey>
<joey> I thought she'd be like, "You know what? </joey>
<joey> I'll still eat it because
it's Japanese culture. </joey>
<joey> I want to show respect." </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "I'm
not fucking eating it." </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - I told you. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Throws the chopsticks on the ground. </joey>
<garnt> Fuck this. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is after me
psyching myself up, right. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> And, I'm just like, "Okay,
I can deep throat this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm a deep throat this
fucking sperm sack right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> My favorite Metal Gear Solid character. </connor>
<connor> - That will be a solid music
playing in this man's ear. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor singing guitar rhythm) </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Garnt just turns to Sydney goes like, </joey>
<garnt> "Call me Deep Throat." </garnt>
<garnt> - So, I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt breathing heavily) </joey>
<joey> I take it. </joey>
<joey> I like swallow it in one. </joey>
<connor> - Isn't it like a string? </connor>
<connor> Like, isn't it like a bunch? </connor>
<joey> - It's like a bunch, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like swallowing a fallopian tube. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's basically what you're swallowing. </joey>
<joey> - So, it is like a bunch. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> I found a way to like
fucking expand my throat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I channeled all my inner Jojo
fandom at that point, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I'm just like, " I'm a
deep throat this in one." </joey>
<joey> And I fucking did like. </joey>
<joey> All right. It's done. Sydney. </joey>
<joey> All right, you do yours. </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "Have it." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Sydney eat it." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I'm not going
to fucking eat it." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "You want to tell the
people I'm going to eat it." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I'm not telling the people. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> We're going to finish our fucking food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're not going to show disrespect." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She was like, "Do it. You can do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, "No,
I'm not going to do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just like a game of chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sydney, do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Sydney, eat the sperm sack. </joey>
<garnt> Garnt, you eat it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then in the end I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fine. I'll fucking do it." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> And on that day, I deep
throated two fish sperm sacks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a two loads now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a PV bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I never want to do it again. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> Because you know what? </joey>
<joey> That shit did not sit
right in my stomach, man. </joey>
<joey> - But okay. Here's the question though? </joey>
<joey> Are you the type of person who gets </joey>
<joey> conceptually grossed out by food? </joey>
<connor> - No, I don't. Just off the premise alone. </connor>
<connor> I won't ever have like a
yes or no answer to eating. </connor>
<joey> - If I never told you ever
that Shirako was sperm. </joey>
<joey> - It's slimy.
It's too slimy. </joey>
<connor> I can't do slimy and it's a problem. </connor>
<connor> - It's too creamy. </connor>
<connor> It has this really weird after taste. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> That is what like set my stomach up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it creamy, Garnt?
Is it creamy? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's creamy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was really creamy. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Shirako surprisingly, is
really, really fucking creamy. </joey>
<garnt> - It's creamy.
It's viscous. </garnt>
<joey> It's Sikhye. Yes, yes, yes. </joey>
<joey> You know what the taste
and the texture of Shirako </joey>
<garnt> is exactly what you think it is. </garnt>
<garnt> What can I say, it's creamy,
it's slimy, it's viscous. </garnt>
<joey> - Shirako is the fancy name. </joey>
<garnt> It's fish nut. </garnt>
<connor> - The thing that I have
just realized is my weakness </connor>
<joey> is slime. </joey>
<joey> Like anything that's slimy. </joey>
<joey> I really struggled with. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not the first person though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Am just saying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I don't know like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clearly I just haven't been raised to eat </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> slimy things. </joey>
<joey> Like I never had slimy things in my life. </joey>
<connor> I wish I did. I feel
like I've been debugged. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I don't blame anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who doesn't like things like </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> Okra or Natto or Shirako
anything like that. </joey>
<joey> Because if you didn't
grow up with that shit. </joey>
<joey> It's like eating snot. </joey>
<joey> - So to me, </joey>
<connor> it is like too close to
the consistency of snot. </connor>
<joey> And semen. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - We get it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You deep throat. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> You deep throat two sperm sacks. </joey>
<joey> So, when you go to a ryokan, right, </joey>
<joey> you get a meal, like a
set meal in Japan, right. </joey>
<joey> You get a lot of food. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to just call it
like levels, not courses. </joey>
<joey> It's like level one through three, right. </joey>
<joey> It's always the most painful. </joey>
<joey> It's always cold and
it's always slimy food </joey>
<joey> that counts first. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why they've done this. </joey>
<joey> - Not all of it is slimy. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Some of it's slimy. </joey>
<joey> I've been to some places where </joey>
<joey> they were like, for some reason, </joey>
<connor> some guy woke up and was like,
"Every meal must have slime." </connor>
<joey> Like I went to one ryokan, </joey>
<joey> and I was like every meal. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I can't wait for the next. </joey>
<joey> And I wonder what it will be. </joey>
<joey> Turns out more slime stuff. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "Come on.
I can't get a win man." </connor>
<joey> But like always there's at least </joey>
<joey> you get like four little dishes. </joey>
<connor> Two of them will be cold,
jelly, slimy, guaranteed. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why they're obsessed </joey>
<joey> with putting slimy stuff there. </joey>
<joey> What's with that? </joey>
<joey> - Japan is weirdly
obsessed with the jelly. </joey>
<connor> - They're like a Nickelodeon kid, bro. </connor>
<connor> It's like, they have more slime than them. </connor>
<connor> Like I don't understand. </connor>
<joey> Japanese are the ones who watched </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Nickelodeon Guts went
and, "It looks delicious." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They like seeing this Nickelodeon slim </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> being poured out, they're like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> "Fuck, they're wasting so much food." </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - "Eating it." </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's like we do have like very
traditional Japanese foods </joey>
<joey> are either slimy or gelatinous. </joey>
<connor> - And it's a shame. </connor>
<connor> I really want to give it a good go, </connor>
<joey> and I eat it most of the time, </joey>
<connor> but with much pain with great difficulty. </connor>
<joey> - And again, </joey>
<joey> I absolutely do not blame anyone who </joey>
<joey> doesn't like that side of Japanese cuisine </joey>
<joey> because it is a tall hurdle, </joey>
<joey> especially if you weren't raised on it. </joey>
<joey> I can confidently say
that I would not like </joey>
<garnt> Natto or Okra or anything
gelatinous or anything like that </garnt>
<joey> if I didn't grow up with it. </joey>
<joey> It just because yeah, </joey>
<joey> the first time you put it in your mouth, </joey>
<joey> it's like, "This
shouldn't be in my mouth." </joey>
<joey> This should be up someone's nose. </joey>
<joey> It is like discomforting at times. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird. </connor>
<connor> Because it's like
something, am like, "No." </connor>
<connor> Something grilled, "Okay." </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I like cold things. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just cold slimy things, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - And the only thinks that I don't like. </joey>
<joey> - What's worse a hot slimy
thing or a cold slimy thing? </joey>
<connor> - Hot slimy thing. </connor>
<connor> - What's hot slimy thing? </connor>
<joey> What is the hot slimy thing dish? </joey>
<joey> - You put Natto on a microwave. </joey>
<joey> - That just like accentuates
the fucking smell. </joey>
<joey> That sounds horrible. Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Can you imagine microwaving Natto? </joey>
<connor> - You do, isn't like Natto
come in microwave packs, right? </connor>
<connor> - Because it comes frozen. </connor>
<joey> So you have to microwave. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] What? You like frozen Natto? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey and Garnt] What? </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Frozen Natto? </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne's angry because
someone bought frozen matter. </connor>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's why I put
it in a microwave Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] You don't microwave it, oh. </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne is really angry. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Meilyne is really angry at Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - Something has just sent Meilyne off. </connor>
<connor> - I've never heard of Meilyne
interrupted an episode. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor And Garnt]
That is the first time. </connor>
<connor> - I've heard Meilyne interrupted. </connor>
<connor> If she wants to interrupt, </connor>
<connor> she'll hold a sign that says, "Incest," </connor>
<garnt> but microwave Natto, </garnt>
<garnt> that's where she draws the line. </garnt>
<joey> - That's where she has to step in, </joey>
<joey> "I'm a let you finish?" </joey>
<joey> - Man, fuck, I wish I liked Natto. </joey>
<joey> - Why?
- I wish I do. </joey>
<joey> Because it's like healthy food. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is extreme health. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I want to get it on that one. </joey>
<joey> The thing is that most
of these like gelatinous </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> or slimy dishes are so goddam healthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they have so much good stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I wish I could eat this. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - How'd you feel about insects then? </joey>
<joey> - I feel that's an incest. </joey>
<connor> - Question to you Connor, </connor>
<connor> how do you feel about incest? </connor>
<connor> - Speaking of slimy things. </connor>
<connor> - Insects, </connor>
<joey> that water bug smelt vile. </joey>
<joey> - That's because it was viral. </joey>
<joey> - I've no qualms about eating it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'll try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you didn't try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. You didn't try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I had to I'll try it.
I'm not going to like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I'll try it. </connor>
<joey> - But when Garnt had to do the forfeit, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Let me
try," you didn't try it. </joey>
<joey> - Am not going to if I don't need to. </joey>
<joey> - You literally just said,
"If given the opportunity </joey>
<joey> I will try it." </joey>
<joey> - If I was in a spot where you're like </joey>
<joey> "Connor, on this course, </joey>
<connor> is a the sandwich of locust." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "All right, I'm
going give it a shot." </connor>
<joey> - What's the difference between that, </joey>
<joey> and someone next to you
having a water bargain. </joey>
<joey> - Social pressure. </joey>
<joey> - It might be the only time. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Social pressure. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the reason why most
people make most mistakes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in their lives, social pressure. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Basically it's the British in you </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> who isn't capable of saying, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 100%. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - And in front of someone </joey>
<joey> and you'd rather just do
it, even though you're </joey>
<connor> like uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no, God, no. </connor>
<connor> I'd rather eat my own toenail </connor>
<connor> than appear socially awkward
for more than four minutes. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's not even a question in my mind. </connor>
<joey> There's something about table manners. </joey>
<joey> I think it's very British, isn't? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - It is very British. </joey>
<joey> - There's something about </joey>
<joey> not being rude at the table especially, </joey>
<connor> like big in my mind that I'm like, </connor>
<connor> you can not be rude at a table. </connor>
<joey> - Is that a British thing? </joey>
<joey> Or is that just like a sensible thing? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I do because in my head,
like I'm not British, </joey>
<joey> but I have the exact same thought of like, </joey>
<joey> don't be rude at the dinner table. </joey>
<connor> - But like doing things
like correctly as well. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> Whenever I meet like
friends parents or stuff, </joey>
<joey> I'll always make like quadruple sure </joey>
<joey> I'm like dinner polite. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like that as well. </joey>
<garnt> - It doesn't matter what
they put on my plate. </garnt>
<connor> If I'm dying, I will eat it just to. </connor>
<joey> I don't it's a British. </joey>
<joey> I think it's just common sense. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, okay. </joey>
<joey> Say you're at a restaurant
and the waiter is rude </joey>
<joey> or the waiter makes the wrong order </joey>
<joey> or something happens in
that restaurant experience </joey>
<joey> that is unpleasant. </joey>
<joey> Do you say something to the waiter? </joey>
<joey> - No.
Do you call management? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - It really depends on how bad it is. </connor>
<connor> - That's my least favorite thing, </connor>
<connor> is making a scene in a restaurant. </connor>
<connor> That is the one thing you
will never catch me on. </connor>
<connor> - There's nothing that will
make me dislike a person more </connor>
<connor> than if they have a complaint </connor>
<garnt> that I feel is like completely invalid. </garnt>
<connor> And they're getting the waiter
over to like do something. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, if you're getting the waiter over, </garnt>
<joey> someone better have shit
on your fucking dish. </joey>
<joey> They'd better be something
wrong with the fucking dish. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I have like a limit. </joey>
<connor> Like if there's more flies
in my soup than soup, </connor>
<joey> then yeah I'll obviously
fucking say something. </joey>
<connor> - You get a meal, there's
a hair on your food. </connor>
<connor> What are you doing? </connor>
<joey> - Just take the hair out. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I do. </connor>
<joey> - Same here. </joey>
<joey> - Because in my head I'm like, </joey>
<joey> okay, I'll call the waiter, right. </joey>
<joey> I'll say to the way that
there's a hair in my soup, </joey>
<joey> the fucks waiter going to do about it. </joey>
<connor> Be like, "Oh my bad, </connor>
<connor> let me get it for you." </connor>
<connor> - As much as I want to be like okay. </connor>
<joey> I mean, I wouldn't lie. </joey>
<joey> It makes me a slightly
uncomfortable, even to think. </joey>
<connor> And that's part of the dining experience. </connor>
<joey> - Once you find a hair
and your soup, that's it. </joey>
<joey> There's no going back. </joey>
<joey> There's no saving the fact that </joey>
<joey> there is hair in your soup. </joey>
<joey> - Calling the waiter isn't
going to make the situation. </joey>
<connor> - All right, POV another scenario, right? </connor>
<joey> You're at the dinner table. </joey>
<joey> Two of you have hair in your food. </joey>
<joey> Now what? </joey>
<connor> Both of you tell waiter? </connor>
<connor> I feel like that ups
the ante a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - And I'll just look and being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my hair is a little bit longer." </joey>
<joey> And just making like a joke out of it. </joey>
<joey> - Also it depends on like
the restaurant, right? </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you have these kinds of things. </joey>
<connor> - If am at McDonald's I'll
just buy another burger. </connor>
<joey> I'm not going to ask them. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes you're at a restaurant, </connor>
<joey> and the restaurant's busy as fuck. </joey>
<joey> And you're just like, well, </joey>
<joey> this doesn't excuse it. </joey>
<joey> But it seems it's going to be more effort </joey>
<joey> to call someone over
and complain about it. </joey>
<joey> Than just try and enjoy the fucking meal. </joey>
<joey> - If it's like an empty restaurant. </joey>
<joey> And I'm the only one in there. </joey>
<joey> And there was a hair
on my soup or whatever, </joey>
<garnt> like something horrible happened. </garnt>
<garnt> Then maybe I might call the waiter, </garnt>
<garnt> because I know that the
waiter is more free. </garnt>
<garnt> But if it's a packed restaurant, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not going to be like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh yeah, stop everything you're doing. </joey>
<joey> I have a hair on my soup." </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to do that. </joey>
<joey> - There are some times, right? </joey>
<joey> Pretty common mistake. </joey>
<joey> The waiter get your order wrong. </joey>
<joey> Now do you say that you, </joey>
<joey> they got your order wrong
or do you just eat the food, </joey>
<joey> and be sad that they got your order wrong. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey and Garnt] It depends. </joey>
<garnt> - Now it depends. </garnt>
<garnt> If you waited 15, 20 minutes for the food, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, excuse me, I got
the wrong food, unfortunately. </garnt>
<joey> If you like at some of these
restaurants where you like </joey>
<joey> there for half an hour to 45
minutes, you're just like, </joey>
<joey> "I am not waiting another
fucking half an hour." </joey>
<joey> I'm just going to eat this
food and leave a bad review </joey>
<joey> and just be done with it. </joey>
<connor> - Again, that heavily depends for me. </connor>
<connor> Okay, how different is
this to what I ordered? </connor>
<connor> If we're talking like $50 steak, </connor>
<connor> and they bring out a $10
appetizer, that's your meal. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "Hold up, hold up." </joey>
<joey> - But if it's like a $50 steak
versus like a $45 burger, </joey>
<connor> then I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "You know want, maybe I was
in the mood for a burger." </connor>
<joey> - It's not inherently value. </joey>
<joey> It's more like, do I
feel like proportionally, </joey>
<joey> I'm getting something
that I would also enjoy. </joey>
<joey> And it's also have the same capacity. </joey>
<joey> If I order the steak or a burger </joey>
<joey> and you bring out the soup
of the day or whatever, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "We are not the same." </joey>
<joey> - We have a fundamental problem. </joey>
<connor> - Because also another thing is like, </connor>
<connor> if are you with a group
of friends as well? </connor>
<connor> Because sometimes it happens. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes someone gets
the order wrong, right. </connor>
<connor> And you have to like, </connor>
<connor> wait for that guy to also get his order, </connor>
<connor> and then finish his food. </connor>
<connor> And then like at that point
you don't enjoy the meal. </connor>
<connor> Because everyone's sitting there, </connor>
<connor> staring you to finish your meal </connor>
<connor> because everyone's already finished. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's true. </connor>
<joey> - These are all the things to consider. </joey>
<joey> - Just read the room and you'll know </joey>
<joey> if it's right to call the waiter or not. </joey>
<joey> - The British way is 99% out of 100. </joey>
<joey> 99 out of 100 times, </joey>
<joey> you don't call it the waiter over. </joey>
<connor> You just sit down and deal with it. </connor>
<connor> And then you set the restaurant </connor>
<joey> on fire afterwards or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Easy, just don't go
back to that restaurant. </joey>
<connor> - Back when you were like single, right. </connor>
<connor> And if you could go on a date, </connor>
<connor> did you eat stuff like
wings in front of your date? </connor>
<joey> Like stuff that gets like a little messy? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You would like no fucks given. </joey>
<joey> - No.
- Okay, I thought so. </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - I just wanted to make sure. </connor>
<joey> - Do I seem like a guy </joey>
<joey> to not eat wings in front of my date? </joey>
<connor> - No, you seem like you. </connor>
<joey> - I would.
- You would eat wings. </joey>
<joey> - I'd eat wings of the
ground in front of my date. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - And be like totally oblivious
to the fact that she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Wow, he looks like a toddler." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you like me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Joey is just like bibed up,
like fucking sauce all over. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Joe's like, "So, what
do you do for a job?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You strike me as that guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - I am that kind of guy. </joey>
<garnt> - We need like a fucking alignment chart </garnt>
<garnt> of like trash. </garnt>
<joey> Members of "Trash Taste", </joey>
<joey> who would eat wings in front of that date? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like on far end
of the spectrum be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yes, I would absolutely." </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't give a fuck who you are. </joey>
<joey> If I'm in the mood for wings, bro. </joey>
<joey> I eating fucking wings. </joey>
<garnt> - Like Connor orders,
wings, and doesn't eat it. </garnt>
<joey> So, I'm just going to enjoy the smell. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - At best I would get a
tissue and hold the end of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like a hamster holder, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she's trying to like get the meat off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without making like lip contact. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Garnt, </connor>
<connor> breaks out the knife
and fork to eat wings. </connor>
<joey> - I would try and do that too. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I would get frustrated, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> and I'd be like tissue time. </connor>
<connor> We'll get a tissue on
the source on the end, </connor>
<joey> and am I'll try. </joey>
<joey> - Meanwhile, the most common courtesy </joey>
<joey> I'll give to my date is, </joey>
<joey> I'll give them a word of
warning before hand and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Can I start eating these
wings? All right. Cheers." </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I've definitely </connor>
<connor> had an experience where </connor>
<connor> I've been eating something
with a knife and fork, </connor>
<joey> and then I've had like a mental breakdown. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Listen, I'm I can't do this. </joey>
<joey> I'm just going to do it with my hand. </joey>
<joey> Are you okay with that?" </joey>
<joey> It might get a little messy, all right. </joey>
<connor> I'm doing it fuck you. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I'm fine eating my
wings with a knife and fork. </joey>
<joey> I actually prefer to eat a lot of wings </joey>
<joey> with knife and fork.
- What? </joey>
<connor> How can you get in there
and get the the shit off? </connor>
<joey> - That is like chaos. </joey>
<joey> - I've perfected the technique. Right? </joey>
<connor> - Just some anime fucking power move. </connor>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I've been
eating wings all my life. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I just don't like
getting my hands dirty. </connor>
<garnt> Especially with like wings
that have a lot of sauce on it. </garnt>
<garnt> Right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have some wings with
a lot of sauce in there. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't get that smell off your fingers. </garnt>
<garnt> Even if you like wash it off. </garnt>
<garnt> I love that smell. </garnt>
<garnt> - It feels sticky. If
you go to the toilet, </garnt>
<joey> you wash your hands with soap, </joey>
<joey> you all have that like feeling. </joey>
<joey> - It reminds me of a good time. </joey>
<garnt> - Little sticky fingers. </garnt>
<garnt> - That meal was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking hell, disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> When I get a little bit
of sauce on my face. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "All right,
now the shackles are off. </garnt>
<connor> There's no holding back." </connor>
<connor> I'm going all in. </connor>
<connor> I'm not holding back. </connor>
<connor> I don't care how much mess
gets on my face anymore. </connor>
<joey> - I say, if the girl gets put off </joey>
<joey> by the fact that you got
some wing sauce on your face, </joey>
<joey> she wasn't right for you to begin with. </joey>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> - Off your Jojo fantast.
The guy gets put off. </connor>
<joey> - The best girl will be like, </joey>
<joey> "I still like him, even
though he's like a animal," </joey>
<joey> just saying. </joey>
<garnt> - Find the one that is
right for you gentlemen. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what is weird? </garnt>
<garnt> When I'm eating. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously, I was always told </garnt>
<connor> it was rude to put your
elbows on the table. </connor>
<joey> Is it something you were told as well? </joey>
<connor> - Yes.
- Is it? </connor>
<joey> - That's what I was told. </joey>
<joey> - I wasn't told that.
- Oh my God, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe I was and I just didn't listen. </joey>
<joey> - If you're eating, like this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's rude. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I mean, I've just never done that. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt's like, "I was born civilized." </connor>
<joey> - I eat with my elbows. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I would always like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what I do is normally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I'm meeting with like
a fork or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I just like keep my hand
on my lap or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, in Japanese cuisine </joey>
<joey> you have to put your hand on the table. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was told in Japan is rude. </joey>
<joey> It has something to do with like old </joey>
<joey> back in the day with
concealed weapon or something. </joey>
<joey> - Put your lap. </joey>
<joey> - When I eat, right? </joey>
<joey> I've got my hand like this
and I got my hand down here </joey>
<connor> under the table on my whatever. </connor>
<connor> But I was told that it's
rude to do that in Japan. </connor>
<connor> You have to have your hand like this </connor>
<connor> while you eat on the table. </connor>
<connor> - I constantly got told by my mom </connor>
<joey> to put my hand on my table </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it goes back to that whole thing </joey>
<joey> of back in the old age where like, </joey>
<joey> if you had your hand under the table, </joey>
<joey> then you could hide a concealed weapon. </joey>
<joey> And you can just have. </joey>
<joey> So, when you're eating with someone. </joey>
<joey> - A modern problem. </joey>
<joey> - Not a modern problem, obviously, </joey>
<joey> that's why you'll see in a lot of like, </joey>
<joey> scenes in anime or Japanese
TV or like old movies, </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> That's why the other hand </joey>
<joey> they usually holding the
rice ball or holding a bowl, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> having their hand on the table </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> because of that whole tradition. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why? </joey>
<joey> It's not really a modern problem nowadays, </joey>
<joey> but you know. </joey>
<joey> - Well, it's like having tattoos in Japan, </joey>
<joey> that are like indicative
of the Yakuza, right? </joey>
<joey> - Supposedly, even though it
didn't start with the Yakuza. </joey>
<joey> It started with firefighters. </joey>
<joey> - What?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, when I interviewed
the ex Yakuza member, </joey>
<joey> obviously, we go onto the
topic of tattoos, right? </joey>
<joey> Because the guy's
fucking covered in tatts. </joey>
<joey> And he told me that originally, </joey>
<joey> firefighters during the Edo
period would get tattooed. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, why firefighters? </joey>
<joey> And it's like, so that
if they die in a fire, </joey>
<joey> it's easy to identify the body. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, they put it in there. </joey>
<joey> - That took a fucking dark turn. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I'm like, that
took a fucking dark turn. </joey>
<joey> But then he put it into
perspective being like, </joey>
<joey> it's also just a matter of like </joey>
<joey> you having that tattoo
back in the older days, </joey>
<joey> that was an honor because that just showed </joey>
<joey> undying proof that you are doing </joey>
<joey> a very dangerous job to
save other people's lives. </joey>
<joey> And for some reason
over the course of time, </joey>
<joey> with the Yakuza, </joey>
<joey> and like how you'd get tattooed </joey>
<joey> when you enter jail and
stuff like that, as a mark </joey>
<joey> it just slowly turned into
like a negative connotation </joey>
<joey> to the point where now today, </joey>
<joey> any Japanese person </joey>
<joey> with like a fucking
little tiny star tattoo </joey>
<joey> on the back of their palm </joey>
<joey> is considered a Yakuza member. </joey>
<joey> And it's gone to the point where like, </joey>
<garnt> you can't obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> hot springs it's like a common one, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can't even into like public pools. </garnt>
<joey> You can't go to some
beaches if you have tattoos. </joey>
<connor> - My gym like I mentioned
is Anytime Fitness, right. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. You can't go to gym. </joey>
<connor> - And the only sign on the wall </connor>
<connor> that is an English is, </connor>
<joey> "Dear all international members." </joey>
<joey> Not even like Japanese. </joey>
<joey> "Dear all international members, </joey>
<connor> please cover up any tattoos
that you might be showing." </connor>
<joey> - And it's weird because, </joey>
<joey> think about it logically, </joey>
<joey> just because you have a tattoo, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't mean that
person is a psychopath </joey>
<joey> or the Yakuza and all that. </joey>
<joey> But it's that whole mental image of, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, they're such a bad person </joey>
<joey> because they put some ink in their body." </joey>
<garnt> It's this weird stipulation
of tattoo equals Yakuza now. </garnt>
<garnt> Which is so dumb,
especially when it comes. </garnt>
<joey> The one I don't understand
is when that same rule </joey>
<joey> applies to foreign here. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that is kind of odd. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> you do realized Yakuza was
like a Japan thing only, </joey>
<joey> right, guys? </joey>
<joey> - It say a lot about Japanese society. </joey>
<joey> - It say a lot about Japanese society. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - It say a lot about society. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - The absolute state of Japanese society. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt said this meme wasn't funny, </joey>
<connor> yet here he is giggling
away to himself saying it. </connor>
<joey> How the tables have turned. </joey>
<joey> - We know what this episode
is going to be called now. </joey>
<joey> - Because we've said it
about 5 million times. </joey>
<joey> - This is what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> The memes that aren't funny, </joey>
<joey> become funnier the more
you just keep saying it. </joey>
<joey> "Squid Game", see you just laughed </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> He just laughed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's pretty funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Like the Yakuza guy was
saying that it's, what? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was just laughing at "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - The Yakuza guy was just saying </garnt>
<garnt> that he put into like really interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I asked him like, </garnt>
<garnt> what do you think about the
whole light tattoo stigma? </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "Oh,
it's fucking stupid." </garnt>
<joey> It's like, because the whole
point of a Yakuza tattoo </joey>
<joey> is we put in tattoos not to show people, </joey>
<joey> but to conceal it, </joey>
<joey> it's like a massive difference. </joey>
<joey> The people who want to show tattoos, </joey>
<joey> that's got nothing to
do with fucking Yakuza. </joey>
<joey> Yakuza isn't going to go around, </joey>
<joey> fucking being like
check out my tatts, bro. </joey>
<joey> Like, they don't do that. </joey>
<joey> And until Japanese people understand that, </joey>
<joey> I don't think the stigma's
ever going to go away. </joey>
<joey> I'd like to think it's starting to go away </joey>
<joey> because young people now
in Japan are getting tatts </joey>
<joey> and they don't give a fucking. </joey>
<joey> - Do you think the new generation of Japan </joey>
<joey> are more open to the idea of like, </joey>
<joey> foreigners and just, things like. </joey>
<joey> - Very mush so.
- Yeah. It's very much so. </joey>
<joey> I mean, Japan has been
Americanized for decades now. </joey>
<joey> Almost centuries now. </joey>
<joey> But like, I feel it's only just recently </joey>
<garnt> where they look at American
celebrities and singers </garnt>
<garnt> who are covered in tatts and they go, </garnt>
<garnt> if they can do that,
maybe we can do that too. </garnt>
<garnt> Who the knew that maybe
just because you have </garnt>
<joey> a Justin Bieber tattoo, it
doesn't make you a Yakuza member. </joey>
<joey> - Most of our exposure
to like Japanese society </joey>
<joey> comes from the older generation, right. </joey>
<joey> Because they have all
the power in government. </joey>
<joey> So, I actually have no idea
about what the youths in Japan, </joey>
<joey> are like thinking and
how much of an effect. </joey>
<joey> - I mean you walk down, </joey>
<joey> shinjuku Shibuya anytime
of the day or night. </joey>
<connor> And you'll see young people
covered in tatts all the time. </connor>
<connor> Japanese people covered
in tatts all the time. </connor>
<connor> - I know this is kind of off topic. </connor>
<connor> I remember like someone told me that </connor>
<garnt> when Avengers came out, right, </garnt>
<joey> and you do press tours. </joey>
<joey> Apparently it was really
difficult for Robert Downey Jr. </joey>
<joey> to come here because he had
a criminal record in the US. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like, okay. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I get it. </joey>
<joey> - But he's not doing it now. </joey>
<joey> - It just kind of shows that it's like, </joey>
<connor> there's no room for it. </connor>
<connor> I think other countries
are similar as well. </connor>
<connor> If you have a criminal
record, they won't let you in. </connor>
<connor> but it's just kind of like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like Japan is definitely
the type of country </connor>
<connor> where you make one mistake. </connor>
<connor> You are dead to the world. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's shocking. </joey>
<connor> - It doesn't matter how much you do </connor>
<joey> to try and redeem it </joey>
<joey> or try and like change your image. </joey>
<joey> that you're better person
and your a fixed person now. </joey>
<joey> You make one mistake you're fucked. </joey>
<connor> - The one thing that is really worrying </connor>
<connor> is that like a lot of the laws, </connor>
<connor> and like punishments
was vividly surrounding </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> like creep crimes I'll say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Creep crimes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know like being a Sukebe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or being a pervert, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or being caught taking
pictures of people in places. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Punishment. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> Have you seen how little you have to pay? </joey>
<joey> Some of them are like $20 fines. </joey>
<joey> $20, what's the point? </joey>
<connor> That's a Saturday night out with the boys </connor>
<garnt> if they're going to do that. </garnt>
<joey> - They have so many stalkers here </joey>
<garnt> because they just face no repercussions </garnt>
<joey> for like stalking someone. </joey>
<joey> - It's because unfortunately
in a lot of cases in Japan, </joey>
<joey> if it's not physical harm, </joey>
<joey> that is a result of the crime, </joey>
<joey> then it's not even considered. </joey>
<joey> They don't take into consideration that, </joey>
<joey> you can be mentally scarred for a crime, </joey>
<joey> and that's still having
real life repercussions </joey>
<joey> because they just think, </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, but did he touch
you? Did he stab you? </garnt>
<garnt> Did he hurt you in any way? </garnt>
<garnt> You'll get over it." </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, well, </garnt>
<garnt> no, because some people
don't fucking get over it. </garnt>
<joey> Like it's pretty fucking traumatizing </joey>
<joey> for some young women to get creeped on, </joey>
<joey> getting their photos taken. </joey>
<joey> Most likely being </joey>
<joey> leaked on the internet
without them knowing. </joey>
<joey> And then for the fucking law
system to turn around and go, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, you'll get over it." </joey>
<connor> - Nearly every single Japanese woman </connor>
<joey> I've spoke to had some horrible experience </joey>
<joey> of someone being a pervert. </joey>
<connor> - Nearly every Japanese woman, </connor>
<connor> and nearly pretty much </connor>
<joey> every foreign woman as well. </joey>
<garnt> - In Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Has had a creepy experience. </garnt>
<joey> I'm pretty sure Sydney has some as well. </joey>
<joey> - Aki definitely had
some and it's horrible. </joey>
<joey> - It's actually like terrifying. </joey>
<joey> It's fucked up and I don't
know how to change it </joey>
<joey> it's not even our country to change. </joey>
<joey> - But I mean, </joey>
<joey> it was so weird for me
hearing the first time, </joey>
<joey> you go to Japan and if
you buy a phone in Japan, </joey>
<garnt> there is no silent option
when you take a picture. </garnt>
<garnt> If you buy a phone in Japan,
no matter what handset it is, </garnt>
<joey> if it's a Japanese handsets, </joey>
<joey> you cannot turn off the
sound of the shutter </joey>
<joey> when it takes a picture. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, my phone is that, right. </joey>
<joey> My phone's on silent right now. </joey>
<joey> (phone beeps) </joey>
<joey> It made just like that sound. </joey>
<connor> - In many ways you hear
about that in isolation, </connor>
<connor> you think, "" Well, that's
good, you're protecting people," </connor>
<connor> but it's like, </connor>
<connor> what did it take for it
to get to that point, </connor>
<connor> where we had to then keep the shutter on. </connor>
<connor> How rampant was it? </connor>
<connor> The fact that Japan, as far as I know, </connor>
<connor> is one of the only countries
on earth that has widespread </connor>
<connor> adoption of female only carts. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Only during a certain time though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I feel completely
takes away the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of a female only cart. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> If you ask me, because it's like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, then I just have
to avoid these times." </joey>
<connor> - And am sure in other countries </connor>
<joey> that women would welcome that. </joey>
<joey> For it to be done, </joey>
<joey> and have to be done,
says a lot about society. </joey>
<joey> Like me personally, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't want to raise
a daughter in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would be scared to death
of like letting her go </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> on the train or something. </joey>
<joey> - I think the other problem as well </joey>
<joey> is that a lot of the parents here, </joey>
<joey> and not that I'm trying </joey>
<joey> to tell Japanese parents
how to be parents, </joey>
<joey> considering I'm not one myself, </joey>
<joey> but I think the problem is
that a lot of the parents </joey>
<joey> also just don't teach their daughters </joey>
<joey> what to do during those situations, right. </joey>
<joey> Because I feel like you, </joey>
<joey> you ask any American
parent or Western parent, </joey>
<joey> like if their daughter </joey>
<joey> were to get into a horrible situation, </joey>
<joey> like teach them some self-defense, </joey>
<joey> or like trying to defend
themselves in any way that </joey>
<joey> they possibly can, to make a statement, </joey>
<joey> and be like, </joey>
<garnt> "I'm not fucking afraid
of you. Like back off." </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<joey> In Japan though, they don't do that. </joey>
<joey> Because there's no repercussions, </joey>
<joey> even if they get caught. </joey>
<joey> So, they're just like,
if I just ignore it, </joey>
<connor> then maybe it'll go away. </connor>
<joey> But it doesn't. </joey>
<joey> - If a guy is jacking
off to you on a train, </joey>
<joey> and you punch him in the face in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Then you're the one
that gets into trouble. </joey>
<connor> - Then you're the asshole because </connor>
<joey> you're the one who
initiated physical violence. </joey>
<joey> So, in the eyes of the police, </joey>
<joey> you're the one who initiated it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's weird. </joey>
<joey> - Like you can make the argument of, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's self-defense," </joey>
<joey> but then the law will turn around and go, </joey>
<joey> "Well, he wasn't technically hurting you." </joey>
<joey> - And also do you have proof
that he was doing these acts? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's sad, man. </joey>
<connor> It's really sad. </connor>
<joey> - There is a fundamental problem. </joey>
<joey> And just, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Like maybe they're
trying to change the law. </joey>
<joey> Maybe they don't give
a fuck. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> But either way it's messed up, </joey>
<joey> and it's more messed up that </joey>
<joey> again, the parents are not teaching. </joey>
<joey> - I think there definitely </joey>
<joey> needs to be more
protection for women here. </joey>
<joey> It is the thing. </joey>
<joey> - Women only carts is minimum protection. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> The fact that we have
to have women only carts </joey>
<joey> it shouldn't have got to that point. </joey>
<joey> - And even then it's
not solving the problem. </joey>
<joey> - That's not a solution. </joey>
<joey> Pretty much every female I've
talked to has had a story, </joey>
<connor> has a story now? </connor>
<connor> - There was a TV show </connor>
<joey> I was watching and it was </joey>
<joey> like literally called
Chikan Hunters or something. </joey>
<joey> And it was literally like a show </joey>
<joey> where like four undercover
cops would just go on a train. </joey>
<joey> This is just real cameras
and was like GoPro footage. </joey>
<joey> But of course, because it's in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - So, Chris Hans in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - But of course in Japan, right. </joey>
<joey> So everything is censored. </joey>
<joey> You, literally cannot see anything. </joey>
<joey> Because they're on a train with a GoPro. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Because of Japan they don't
like to show people on TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You can't see anything in this train. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They've blurred it out, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But to distinguish who the pervert is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and who the victim is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're just blue blurs and a pink blur. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> And you can't see what's going on. </garnt>
<garnt> It's absolutely shitty TV. </garnt>
<garnt> - What channel is this? </garnt>
<joey> - I think it was maybe 3 Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - TBS? </joey>
<joey> - TBS? Don't know which channel it was. </joey>
<joey> I only really watch like three, </joey>
<joey> I don't watch NHK.
NHK is boring. </joey>
<joey> First of all, I was like,
this is a terrible production. </joey>
<joey> This is awful. </joey>
<joey> But they found like four dudes doing this </joey>
<joey> in like one day and
like the same like cart. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> They would have to get camera
footage of them doing it, </joey>
<joey> like multiple times </joey>
<joey> to prove that it wasn't accident </joey>
<joey> because they could do the whole bump </joey>
<joey> and touch some ass. </joey>
<joey> But they would have to like
catch them multiple times. </joey>
<joey> And then I didn't know what they did. </joey>
<joey> I assume they just gave him
like a slap on the wrist </joey>
<joey> or something, </joey>
<joey> but they wouldn't show
their face or anything. </joey>
<joey> And it was just like, you wonder, </joey>
<connor> well, clearly like this
punishment isn't effective. </connor>
<connor> Like if you've shamed them for doing it, </connor>
<connor> would it help a little bit? </connor>
<connor> But it's also like, is it fair </connor>
<connor> to ruin someone life over that? </connor>
<connor> I don't know, probably not, it's weird. </connor>
<connor> Also there was like 20 cops </connor>
<connor> for like one dude touching a girl's ass. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "I think you
don't need this many cops." </connor>
<joey> - No, I think one, maybe two is enough. </joey>
<connor> - I think two cops can handle </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> one pervert. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think you need,
like a whole entire. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - The dude is not like 9
ft tall and like 500 lb. </joey>
<joey> - It's crazy. </joey>
<connor> - I think one person can handle it. </connor>
<joey> - It's crazy, right. </joey>
<connor> So they have the four undercover
detectives on this train, </connor>
<joey> right. </joey>
<joey> Then they find the guy, they come out, </joey>
<joey> and then it was like eight more police, </joey>
<joey> escorting this one guy. </joey>
<joey> I get it. </joey>
<joey> Like yeah, you got to arrest him. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> If you want some backup,
I totally understand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like how much do you need? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like how much tax payer
money is going towards </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> those 12 dudes arresting that one guy. </connor>
<joey> - To some of those cops, it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh finally, my first actual job." </joey>
<connor> - The fine doesn't even cover </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> his walk from the train
to the train holding room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the police time wasted </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> doesn't even cover the
fine they gave this dude. </joey>
<joey> - It's a joke. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking stupid as fuck. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure if we went through UK police, </joey>
<joey> or any UK laws or Australian laws, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure we could find another </joey>
<joey> 10,000 million things to criticize about. </joey>
<joey> But we're in Japan and </joey>
<joey> this is what's on our mind. </joey>
<connor> Well, that was a societal
deep conversation. </connor>
<joey> I just want be dumb. </joey>
<joey> - This episode did say
a lot about society. </joey>
<connor> - This one said a lot about how society </connor>
<connor> is kind of like "Squid Game", huh? </connor>
<joey> - Who knew that one of
the deepest "Trash Taste" </joey>
<garnt> episodes to date started
with a shitty meme. </garnt>
<garnt> That makes no sense. </garnt>
<joey> - It says a lot about society. </joey>
<garnt> - It says a lot about society. </garnt>
<garnt> - It says a lot about society. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dear viewers, </garnt>
<garnt> do you like it when we talk about </garnt>
<joey> #deep stuff?
- #Deep stuff? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - #Less surface level debates. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Do they enjoy? </connor>
<joey> - I think #real stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, real stuff. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> do you like it when we
talk about real stuff? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think we have a nice balance now. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> We started talking about animes, </joey>
<joey> talking about food. </joey>
<joey> - That lasted what? Five minutes? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I like that "Trash Taste"
is lighthearted and fun, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but sometimes I do like talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> some things that are not so fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - I'm human. </connor>
<joey> - It's an interesting
conversation to have I think. </joey>
<joey> And especially when done it in. </joey>
<joey> - We need more people
to talk about society. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- We need more society. </joey>
<garnt> - Because society is
saying a lot right now. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what else
says a lot about society? </joey>
<joey> - What?
- Our patience. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Our patience says a lot about society. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - It really says lot of our society </connor>
<connor> that we have all these
wonderful supporters </connor>
<joey> supporting the show. </joey>
<joey> - This guy, this goes hard. </joey>
<connor> Feel free to screenshot Garnt. </connor>
