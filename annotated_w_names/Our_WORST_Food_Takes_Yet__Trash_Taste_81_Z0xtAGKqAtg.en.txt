<garnt> beans </garnt>
<garnt> you know i didn't know what an americano </garnt>
<connor> is until i moved to japan and you find </connor>
<connor> this watered-down coffee </connor>
<connor> yeah because i i you know i only started </connor>
<connor> caring about coffee after i moved to </connor>
<connor> japan because before i moved to japan it </connor>
<connor> was so easy to get reasonable coffee </connor>
<garnt> right and i was like why is the why is </garnt>
<garnt> the japan coffee like so watered down </garnt>

<connor> let's </connor>
<connor> if this was something else right like </connor>

<joey> months they were like you can yeah we </joey>
<joey> have an excuse to borders oh [ __ ] yo </joey>
<connor> close them well they didn't do that with </connor>
<joey> the olympics did they oh well i mean you </joey>
<joey> know i i i think that like when i saw </joey>
<joey> online that the prime minister was like </joey>
<joey> you know i think it was like two days </joey>
<joey> prior that like the news strain had been </joey>
<joey> announced right yeah and then everyone </joey>
<joey> on twitter was like oh [ __ ] it only took </joey>
<connor> the government two days to act upon this </connor>
<connor> and i'm like oh no they didn't why is </connor>
<connor> this like a rare event isn't that </connor>
<connor> shouldn't that be normal they decided </connor>
<connor> like the moment of they just took them </connor>
<connor> two days to approve it </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> they they knew what they were doing yeah </joey>
<joey> but anyway current events bad </joey>
<joey> tournaments </joey>
<joey> new year it's over new year new me it's </joey>
<joey> 2022 guys </joey>
<joey> did we did we okay i actually do </joey>

<connor> resolution i think we did because chris </connor>
<connor> was on right we said what we wanted to </connor>
<connor> do remember what you said </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i remember what i said </garnt>
<connor> well last year yeah i i don't know the </connor>

<connor> sarcastically saying to chris i want to </connor>

<garnt> yeah yeah it did oh you actually uh got </garnt>
<garnt> through with your new year's resolutions </garnt>
<joey> what was yours the rubik's cube </joey>
<joey> was that 2019. i think that was 2019. </joey>
<joey> i've been able to do a rescue for the </joey>
<joey> past two years now at least yeah every </joey>
<garnt> time like we have a rubik's cube in the </garnt>
<garnt> office now the old joey just goes ahead </garnt>
<joey> and solves it so </joey>
<joey> he's been able to do it for a while yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't know i do not remember you </joey>
<garnt> saying that as a new year's resolution i </garnt>
<joey> don't think i gave a new year's </joey>
<joey> resolution because i haven't really been </joey>
<garnt> a guided like </garnt>
<garnt> choose new year's resolutions because </garnt>
<joey> for the past like three or four years i </joey>
<connor> just haven't been able to do that yeah </connor>
<connor> it must be like i feel bad for the </connor>
<connor> viewers who probably think that we have </connor>
<connor> like dementia or something that we can't </connor>
<connor> remember anything what we've said and </connor>
<connor> then we're like and we've probably had </connor>
<connor> this conversation last year we were like </connor>
<connor> oh yes so uh we just don't like them so </connor>
<connor> we just decided i know i remember i must </connor>
<connor> have said something along the lines of i </connor>
<connor> just prefer like small goals that i just </connor>
<garnt> yeah bro i don't even remember what i </garnt>
<garnt> say like a week ago like sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes i have a conversation with my </garnt>
<garnt> mum and she was just like oh yeah when </garnt>
<garnt> you were talking about this i can't </garnt>
<garnt> believe you said that and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> mom i do not remember saying those words </garnt>
<joey> at all i didn't even remember what i had </joey>
<connor> for like dinner like three days ago </connor>
<joey> right so it's like you can't expect me </joey>
<garnt> to remember after like was like a </garnt>
<joey> hundred plus hours of us talking on this </joey>
<joey> show but you just like remember this one </joey>
<joey> little details like nah it's not gonna </joey>
<garnt> happen no because like i remember </garnt>
<garnt> talking about current events uh joey's </garnt>
<joey> channel right now was uh he's in the </joey>
<joey> dire strike it's in the dire straits and </joey>
<joey> of course he uploads to a second channel </joey>
<joey> and i i see it's blown up right because </joey>
<garnt> yeah even my mom my mum sends me a </garnt>
<garnt> message and she's like i just saw that </garnt>
<garnt> joey's channel is in trouble have you </garnt>
<garnt> given him a phone call to make sure he's </garnt>
<joey> okay and i'm just like just breaking </joey>
<joey> down crying you know like in my bed just </joey>
<joey> sleeping into my pillow </joey>
<joey> no i mean like as of right now uh it </joey>
<joey> still hasn't been resolved but luckily i </joey>
<connor> have contacted youtube and i'm pretty </connor>
<connor> confident it's going to get resolved so </connor>
<connor> that's why i'm not like too stressed </connor>
<connor> about it but uh it was it was very </connor>
<connor> humbling when i made that video and like </connor>
<connor> so many people came to me and was like </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i'll subscribe and all that so </joey>
<connor> thanks if you did yeah in some ways i </connor>
<connor> really like </connor>
<connor> you know if i like a situation that i </connor>
<connor> know is going to be resolved but i can </connor>
<garnt> still make a video complaining you know </garnt>
<garnt> because it's you know it it just you get </garnt>
<joey> you because you can monetize it yeah you </joey>
<joey> can market </joey>
<joey> but also it's basically like a week off </joey>
<connor> work because i don't have to upload that </connor>
<joey> one week i'm like fantastic right so i </joey>
<joey> can't upload for two weeks right because </joey>
<connor> guys i i just want to bring you this </connor>
<connor> content i really do i just oh i just </connor>
<joey> can't </joey>
<joey> well you know it's like it is </joey>
<joey> bittersweet to be fair because it's like </joey>
<joey> i i you know it's cool that there's been </joey>
<joey> like this explosion and subs on the </joey>
<joey> second channel but it's like i wish i </joey>
<joey> didn't have to resort to this you know i </joey>
<joey> wish i wish it like to my chat my main </joey>
<joey> channel literally on life support wasn't </joey>
<joey> the reason why i was getting all these </joey>
<garnt> subs but you know like i mean your </garnt>
<garnt> second channel has basically been </garnt>
<garnt> becoming your anime channel for the long </garnt>
<joey> time for the longest time so what if </joey>
<joey> you're just like migrating the anime man </joey>
<joey> to just now it's just joey that's just </joey>
<garnt> exactly what you wanted all your career </garnt>
<joey> right it could happen but at the same </joey>
<joey> time it's like you know i don't want to </joey>
<connor> lose nine years ago what if you're an </connor>
<connor> epic prank right yeah right you just </connor>
<connor> change the names and pictures of both </connor>
<connor> channels </connor>
<joey> well like so joey has a 3.1 million yeah </joey>
<joey> have you thought about it really like i </joey>
<joey> mean it could work maybe for like an </joey>
<garnt> hour </garnt>
<joey> yeah the good old dayton switch </joey>
<joey> it's like yeah guys up to my second </joey>
<garnt> channel </garnt>
<joey> jk this was the uh </joey>
<joey> and then like anime like tell everyone </joey>

<garnt> days it will get resolved </garnt>
<garnt> you can't upload for two weeks i can't </garnt>
<joey> upload for two weeks no right but um </joey>
<joey> which sucks because it's like i have to </joey>
<joey> like because you know this especially </joey>

<connor> to tell them like oh sorry uh </connor>
<connor> youtube did a did a big [ __ ] and now </connor>
<connor> i can't upload it's very annoying having </connor>
<joey> to explain that to companies who clearly </joey>
<joey> don't understand like you just upload </joey>
<joey> yeah what's </joey>
<joey> your channel's still there just upload </joey>
<garnt> it no no that's not how it works it's </garnt>
<garnt> just the life of the of a youtuber where </garnt>

<garnt> and you just find out that uh maybe your </garnt>
<garnt> career is in danger and you're like oh </garnt>

<garnt> like get get in contact with someone </garnt>
<garnt> just know that you're in the process of </garnt>

<garnt> times you just gotta wait and you just </garnt>
<garnt> gotta make noise and you just got to </garnt>
<garnt> like hope that someone can sort this out </garnt>
<connor> for you yeah i've ever told this story </connor>
<connor> about what happened with all that </connor>
<joey> the world they're called the copyright </joey>
<joey> club i think i mean </joey>
<joey> they're not on trash </joey>
<joey> oh okay so yeah like twice now all of my </joey>
<connor> channel has been claimed </connor>
<connor> the same reason twice yeah right right </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> i was using this outro song </connor>
<connor> that i think i heard what did i get i </connor>
<joey> think i put it on skye williams's </joey>
<joey> channel which is like that's a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> he used it as his outro yeah i thought i </joey>
<joey> liked that and also i was like i had </joey>
<joey> like 100 subs so i thought it's okay if </joey>
<connor> i just like take the same outch </connor>
<connor> of course because no one's gonna see it </connor>
<joey> and then obviously like people saw </joey>
<connor> william i loved it because he was a </connor>
<connor> banger </connor>
<connor> such a banger in fact that i had to buy </connor>
<connor> a license </connor>
<connor> and i didn't know there was an original </connor>
<joey> original song i just thought it was just </joey>
<joey> this one song right so you had the remix </joey>
<connor> version so i had the remix version right </connor>
<connor> and i didn't know that it was uh a remix </connor>
<connor> right so i went to the artist who made </connor>
<connor> it and this song had a lot of views it </connor>
<connor> was called like uh </connor>
<connor> uh do it for love or something all right </connor>
<connor> and um </connor>
<joey> i had this and i used this on every </joey>
<joey> single video oh yeah it's your outro </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and of course </joey>
<joey> i i this this come to bite me in the ass </joey>
<joey> i i didn't just play it when the video </joey>
<joey> ended it was like it would like fade </joey>
<joey> into the video yeah yeah yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> this will come back to bite me later </joey>
<joey> um so </joey>
<joey> i got in like 2000 maybe 17 or 16 i got </joey>
<connor> i want to say 80 of my channel copyright </connor>
<connor> claimed yeah and this is on the old </connor>
<connor> system as well where </connor>
<connor> it wouldn't tell you which i think it </connor>
<connor> didn't tell you which time it was </connor>
<connor> copyright claimed it would just say </connor>
<joey> you've been copyright claimed this is </joey>
<joey> the thing yeah </joey>
<joey> and it was by a company that was on </joey>
<joey> behalf of the artist who i purchased the </joey>
<joey> license from for 50 right i bought this </joey>
<connor> license back then i thought holy [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> this is so much money oh my god is how </connor>
<joey> much licenses cost </joey>
<joey> it's like a whole month on youtube for </joey>
<joey> me i was on my well basically at that </joey>
<joey> time it was like it was like a lot of </joey>
<joey> money you know and this is back when i </joey>
<joey> you know i was terrified of everything </joey>
<connor> and i remember i bought </connor>
<connor> licenses to fonts and [ __ ] i'm pretty </connor>
<connor> sure i'm the only person on earth who </connor>
<connor> paid for a license for a font yeah have </connor>
<connor> you paid for winrar </connor>
<garnt> though </garnt>
<joey> just to tell the guy i appreciate it </joey>
<joey> yeah i wouldn't </joey>
<garnt> i want to meet a single person who has </garnt>
<garnt> paid for windows i'm going to do it on </garnt>
<garnt> live stream i'm going to do it live and </garnt>
<garnt> just see what happens i just want to see </garnt>
<garnt> what happens i'm just going to be the </garnt>
<garnt> computer just explode </garnt>
<connor> we weren't designed for this stream just </connor>
<garnt> ends yeah i buy wrong it's like a test </garnt>
<joey> you you win life at that point you know </joey>
<connor> this is like congratulations the </connor>
<connor> simulation shuts down and you just see </connor>
<garnt> like the congratulations the entire </garnt>
<garnt> world just like disintegrates around you </garnt>
<joey> yeah you just wake up </joey>
<connor> you know you know the bible story from </connor>
<connor> like like 100 episodes again yeah it's </connor>
<connor> just that </connor>
<connor> there are people who pay for winrar and </connor>
<joey> there are people who don't </joey>
<joey> god comes </joey>
<connor> so i paid for this license and whatnot </connor>
<connor> right and uh i i angrily emailed the guy </connor>
<connor> bear in mind i was like 19 so i was like </connor>
<joey> trying to conduct myself as a </joey>
<joey> businessman but i didn't know what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i was doing yeah so i angrily </joey>
<joey> emailed him from my my hotmail account </joey>
<joey> and i instructed him that i'd purchased </joey>
<joey> this license please tell this person to </joey>
<joey> stop and so this whole thing where the </joey>
<joey> guy wrote me an email being like </joey>
<connor> uh hey you have my word that you bought </connor>
<connor> the license and i had like paypal </connor>
<connor> receipts so then i had to email this </connor>
<connor> company that was claiming on behalf </connor>
<connor> which i think was distrokid </connor>
<connor> so he had put this song in a copyright </connor>
<connor> claiming thing all right so it went </connor>
<connor> around so i had a bit of difficulty it </connor>
<joey> took a while but i eventually got distro </joey>
<joey> kid to like stop claiming my stuff right </joey>
<joey> right they stopped claiming it all and </joey>
<joey> it was good i remember how i did it it </joey>
<joey> was like this long whole process was </joey>
<connor> awful </connor>
<connor> and then all good all good i kept using </connor>
<connor> the outro </connor>
<connor> after that this is where i should have </connor>
<connor> learned my lesson and changed the actual </connor>
<connor> but i thought i'd won the battle i've </connor>
<connor> done it i've done it also the song is a </connor>
<joey> banger so the song kind of slaps right </joey>
<connor> you know i i'd thought okay i'd proven </connor>
<joey> to some entity that this is legit and i </joey>
<joey> have the artist who you know says that </joey>
<joey> it's all good and i thought okay this is </joey>
<connor> this is it i'm good to use this now like </connor>
<connor> i paid for it i i got like proof and </connor>
<connor> we're all gucci yeah and so i carry on </connor>
<connor> using it </connor>
<connor> and then maybe a year later i want to </connor>
<connor> say i don't know how long exactly there </connor>
<connor> is a there was a timeline i get claimed </connor>
<joey> again this time like two-thirds of my </joey>
<joey> channel i want to say </joey>
<joey> and this is right before they added the </joey>
<joey> option to mute </joey>
<joey> right right </joey>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> like now if so you get copyright claimed </connor>
<connor> because sometimes there are still </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] claims they'll claim like one </connor>
<connor> second and then they'll say we hope </connor>
<connor> we're on the entire video so just just </connor>
<connor> mute it for one second yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> you can mute it or delete the segment </garnt>
<connor> which is one of the more positive </connor>
<connor> changes youtube has made you know </connor>
<connor> definitely and unfortunately this </connor>
<connor> situation happened i want to say like </connor>
<connor> one month before they introduced that </connor>
<connor> tool yeah so i got all of my thing </connor>
<connor> claimed and i was kind of like what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] do i do because two-thirds of my </connor>
<connor> revenue just like got fanossed away yeah </connor>
<connor> and this this was this happened to my </connor>
<connor> channel for about i want to say two </connor>
<connor> months straight all right so for two </connor>
<connor> months straight my earnings were like </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and i lost so much money that i never </connor>
<connor> got back so it's very very i've still to </connor>
<connor> this day quite annoyed about that um </connor>
<connor> and i i went on this whole thing of like </connor>
<connor> all right what the [ __ ] is going on so </connor>
<garnt> it was like warner brothers or something </garnt>
<garnt> had claimed it on behalf of uh some </garnt>
<garnt> artists that i'd never heard of </garnt>
<garnt> i go and i find out that this was a </garnt>
<garnt> remix and i'm like oh [ __ ] i didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> and apparently this is like a big artist </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm an idiot cause i didn't know who </garnt>
<connor> this person was but i never thought i </connor>
<garnt> was a banger yeah right that's why i was </garnt>
<connor> a banger </connor>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> and so i was like okay </garnt>
<garnt> so this is weird so i i thought that he </garnt>
<garnt> he sold me this license and it and it </garnt>
<garnt> was good so i i i very confidently </garnt>
<garnt> counter every single claim thinking i've </garnt>
<garnt> got the license it's all good and they </garnt>
<garnt> get denied and then i appeal them as </garnt>
<garnt> well which is like if you lose all these </garnt>
<connor> appeals your channel gets deleted yeah </connor>
<connor> so i appealed a bunch of them and for </connor>
<connor> some reason i just got denied the appeal </connor>
<connor> but nothing happened right so i just </connor>
<connor> couldn't appeal again it was weird and </connor>
<connor> so now now i was starting to be like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] like what's going on like </connor>
<connor> i i counted all these claims and stuff </connor>
<connor> and nothing happened and i don't really </connor>
<connor> know what to do now so i remember i got </connor>
<connor> in touch with the guy who i bought the </connor>
<connor> license from who is the artist who made </connor>
<connor> this song i was like hey what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what's going on man </connor>
<connor> you sold me a license is it good or is </connor>
<connor> it not and he's like </connor>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> i have the license to make the remix but </connor>
<connor> i don't think and then he was like i'm </connor>
<connor> not sure what i can and can't and i'm </connor>
<connor> like oh </connor>
<connor> wow i'm like what what and then i asked </connor>
<connor> i asked a youtube man who is a lawyer </connor>
<connor> man who gave me advice that was not </connor>
<connor> legal advice every single sentence ended </connor>
<connor> with this is not legal advice yeah he </connor>
<connor> basically informed me that yeah this </connor>
<joey> license was like no good yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> nothing </joey>
<joey> whether the whether the artist knew that </joey>
<connor> or not i don't know he might genuinely </connor>
<joey> not have known mm-hmm um </joey>
<joey> so basically if he's like an indie like </joey>
<connor> artist as well </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i assume that he didn't fully </connor>
<joey> just doing some stroke i don't think he </joey>
<connor> did i don't know i it was it was a weird </connor>
<connor> thing and i was like and so i asked the </connor>
<connor> guy i i went had like really angry dms </connor>
<connor> with him back in full flight like so </connor>
<connor> can i use this did you [ __ ] me over like </connor>
<connor> you know how much </connor>
<connor> how much this [ __ ] me like what am i </connor>
<connor> supposed to do and so in the end it </connor>
<connor> turned out yeah like i was in the wrong </connor>
<connor> because i'd been sold this bogus license </connor>
<connor> that was like not real yeah and so then </connor>
<connor> i was like well [ __ ] what do i do now </connor>
<connor> like i've just lost like </connor>
<connor> three or four i think it's three years </connor>
<connor> of like youtube work it's just gone yeah </connor>
<connor> like just can't use any of it it's so </connor>
<connor> scary right yeah and so and so i made </connor>
<joey> this video like ranting being like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like what do i do that's just so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i've been wronged et cetera et </joey>
<joey> cetera and you know and i i asked </joey>
<connor> youtube for help at the time they just </connor>
<connor> didn't help me and i was like what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] am i doing yeah and then </connor>
<connor> funny enough </connor>
<connor> i had a youtube partner manager before </connor>
<connor> all of this went down it was really good </connor>
<connor> surprisingly because normally they don't </connor>
<connor> talk to you right and then that person </connor>
<connor> left the company and then i got someone </connor>
<connor> new and they introduced themselves </connor>
<connor> through an email and they never heard </connor>
<connor> from them again as you know that's how </connor>
<connor> it always is </connor>
<joey> yeah and so i i went on like a mini rant </joey>
<joey> in this video being like yeah youtube's </joey>
<joey> useless they don't do anything i have </joey>
<joey> this youtube person they never talk to </joey>
<joey> me they don't help me at all after that </joey>
<joey> video goes live i got an email from a </joey>
<joey> youtube person who's like hey of course </joey>
<joey> hey i'm that person that you were like </joey>
<joey> was saying </joey>
<joey> and they were like yeah i'd actually </joey>
<joey> like to help your situation out and i </joey>
<joey> was like oh okay </joey>
<joey> great awesome </joey>
<joey> so they basically said hey so what we </joey>
<joey> can do is we can go through every single </joey>
<joey> video </joey>
<joey> and if you send me the file again </joey>
<joey> without the music in it we can replace </joey>
<connor> the video </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> so i had to go through 200 videos and </connor>
<joey> re-render them or just cut out the music </joey>
<joey> because some of the files i didn't have </joey>
<joey> the original files anymore yeah like the </joey>
<joey> the adobe file or whatever like yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah luckily a lot of the more recent </joey>
<garnt> ones the ones i liked and was more proud </garnt>
<garnt> of like yeah at that time the original </garnt>
<joey> original file yeah so we like 200 videos </joey>
<connor> on google drive linked in like an excel </connor>
<connor> spreadsheet and then we had to one by </connor>
<connor> one like swap them but this process </connor>
<connor> wasn't even wasn't like perfect either </connor>
<connor> because videos got uploaded to the wrong </connor>
<joey> video all right </joey>
<connor> so like so you'd click on a certain </connor>
<joey> thumbnail and title and it took you to a </joey>
<joey> different video right it was like that </joey>
<connor> was the original video yeah and then </connor>
<joey> they replaced it with another video that </joey>
<connor> got put there yeah like i did like uh </connor>
<joey> there was like a i remember it was a </joey>
<connor> attack on an attack on titan impressions </connor>
<connor> and euro nice impressions yeah they both </connor>
<connor> got swapped so when people went to yuri </connor>
<joey> on ice impressions it was just me doing </joey>
<joey> attack on type of things and then when </joey>
<joey> it was when it was the other one </joey>
<joey> it was it was the other video and yeah i </joey>
<joey> sat there with youtube for like an hour </joey>
<joey> trying to explain to them what was </joey>
<joey> happening because the subtitles also got </joey>
<joey> swapped </joey>
<joey> so they were looking at the video only </joey>
<joey> in the subtitles like the raw subtitle </joey>
<joey> data yeah and they were like no no it's </joey>
<joey> the right one you're talking about yuri </joey>
<joey> on ice in the subtitles or something and </joey>
<joey> i was like no no no no the video the </joey>
<joey> video is wrong yeah and i was like </joey>
<connor> panicking and i was like i'm getting </connor>
<connor> tons of comments being like what the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] is going on and i'm like fix this </garnt>
<garnt> did you not just like swap the titles </garnt>
<connor> around </connor>
<connor> it was just weird because all the entire </connor>
<garnt> videos see what joey's gonna do with his </garnt>
<joey> channel yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm like i wonder what the side effects </connor>
<connor> are of this like so eventually we got </connor>
<garnt> all sorted yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you just go on the channel and like why </garnt>
<connor> is this attack on titan video got yuri </connor>
<garnt> nice comments yeah like what's going on </garnt>
<connor> there exactly so all the comments are </connor>
<joey> like that i remember yuri in an attack </joey>
<joey> on </joey>
<joey> right it's all weird and then so yeah </joey>
<joey> like again like two months later it </joey>
<joey> finally all got done yeah yeah and we </joey>
<joey> did it some of the videos like i said </joey>
<connor> they couldn't be salvaged and the reason </connor>
<connor> why it came to bite me back later was </connor>
<connor> because some outros in my videos now are </connor>
<connor> just mute yeah yeah you can't hear </connor>
<joey> anything i'll see because like i had the </joey>
<connor> exact same thing uh but after youtube </connor>
<connor> introduced the whole muting thing yeah </connor>
<connor> so i had my old old intro uh so my </connor>
<garnt> current intro now is made by my friend </garnt>
<garnt> from uni yeah who used to be like a </garnt>
<garnt> music producer and it's like not even </garnt>
<joey> out on like any website yeah so i know </joey>
<joey> it's like good it's like all you know </joey>
<joey> copyright free because </joey>
<joey> i had the exact same thing where like i </joey>
<joey> saw like i went on to like soundcloud </joey>
<joey> and i found like this really like bang a </joey>
<joey> song yeah um </joey>
<joey> and uh and i was like i'll call use it </joey>
<joey> as a as an outro because it's like kind </joey>
<joey> of wacky goofy like you know all the </joey>
<garnt> gaming youtubers are using it at the </garnt>
<garnt> time and then of course uh that artist </garnt>
<garnt> got really popular on soundcloud </garnt>
<garnt> because every youtuber was using it got </garnt>
<garnt> a major record label because of it and </garnt>
<garnt> then the record label copyright claimed </garnt>
<garnt> all of my [ __ ] oh [ __ ] and uh and i had </garnt>
<garnt> and same thing i like dm the artist i </garnt>
<joey> was like yeah so what's happening uh you </joey>
<joey> said i could use it she's like </joey>
<joey> yeah but i'm like a big shot now </joey>
<joey> i'm like i've got a major record label </joey>
<joey> and i'm unfortunate i can't do anything </joey>
<joey> for you but luckily this was during the </joey>
<joey> time where again youtube introduced the </joey>
<connor> muting thing so shitty of them to not if </connor>
<connor> you asked did you ask them permission </connor>
<joey> initially yeah yeah so i asked the uh so </joey>
<connor> i dm the artist initially when she was </connor>
<connor> just on soundcloud and she was like yeah </connor>
<joey> please go for it like i love that like </joey>
<joey> just just you know obviously just the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] just like just like just link it in </joey>
<joey> the description you'll be all good i was </joey>
<joey> like oh sorry that's very nice of her </joey>
<connor> and uh and then yeah she was like oh </connor>
<connor> sorry that's uh my that's not that's not </connor>
<connor> my decision that's my labels decision so </connor>
<connor> sorry </connor>
<connor> so then i had to yeah so like if you go </connor>
<joey> back to like videos from like 2017 the </joey>
<joey> way i use that outro oh they're all mute </joey>
<connor> at the end yeah i've got a lot of videos </connor>
<joey> where i just me talking at the end i </joey>
<joey> still got comments to say being like why </joey>
<connor> does it like just go silent </connor>
<garnt> yeah man </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean i've had to use that feature </connor>
<connor> for like some of my videos but like i </connor>
<connor> don't mute it i just like cut out like </connor>
<connor> the yeah now you can replace the music </connor>
<connor> yeah you can replace the music because i </connor>
<connor> believe i had to do that for trash taste </connor>
<connor> or something right because that got </connor>
<connor> copyright claimed or something </connor>
<connor> one of the specials or something oh yeah </connor>
<connor> and after dark as well for some reason </connor>
<connor> our intro for trash chase called </connor>
<joey> copyright claims and after that on </joey>
<connor> twitch on twitter </connor>
<joey> free song yeah it's a royalty-free song </joey>
<joey> but which is like no no no no </joey>
<connor> well a couple right the corporate </connor>
<connor> systems unfortunately like are really </connor>
<connor> easy to abuse like you can stick out the </connor>
<garnt> old [ __ ] piece of music and start </garnt>
<connor> claiming [ __ ] and it's only until </connor>
<connor> somebody like stops you yeah yeah so you </connor>
<garnt> know it was really like the weirdest </garnt>
<garnt> copyright claimed i've gotten is like </garnt>
<garnt> for like anime music that i've put into </garnt>
<garnt> my videos like like before like anime </garnt>
<garnt> osc's were just like free game because </garnt>
<garnt> japan the anime industry didn't really </garnt>
<garnt> give a [ __ ] and now they're slowly </garnt>
<garnt> coming to realize wait a minute </garnt>
<garnt> youtubers use our music </garnt>
<garnt> how can how can this be so like now </garnt>
<garnt> anime osts are starting to be claimed as </garnt>
<garnt> well but i didn't get claimed by one of </garnt>
<garnt> the anime companies so i in one of my </garnt>
<garnt> videos i had you save run on on it um </garnt>
<garnt> and i got claimed and you say ryan gold </garnt>
<garnt> claimed but it didn't get claimed it got </garnt>
<garnt> claimed by a cover of you save run what </garnt>
<garnt> so a youtuber </garnt>
<garnt> a youtuber who i believe is signed with </garnt>
<garnt> a record label or made a video where </garnt>
<garnt> they made a cover of you say run and </garnt>
<garnt> that got like the original you say run </garnt>
<garnt> that i used in my video got claimed by a </garnt>
<garnt> cover of you save right um and yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's i i'd like where do i even begin </garnt>
<garnt> with that you know like that's uh </garnt>
<joey> i mean yeah like super early in my </joey>
<connor> youtube channel i used to do like covers </connor>
<connor> of anime songs like on guitar and piano </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that yeah reason why i </connor>
<connor> don't do that anymore is because the few </connor>
<joey> times i ever got a copyright strike yeah </joey>
<joey> not a claim a strike was from a cover i </joey>
<connor> did i did a cover of um i did a cover of </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] paranoid android by radiohead </connor>
<connor> because it was the ending to ergo proxy </connor>
<connor> right and at the time it was like i </connor>
<connor> really liked it yeah and uh yeah i got a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] strike on it and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> not sure if that can also be a humble </garnt>
<garnt> brag because that's like saying like you </garnt>
<garnt> are so good </garnt>
<garnt> literally i thought it was the real </garnt>
<joey> thought it was the original song i was </joey>
<joey> like thanks youtube but also what the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] i've had my voice claimed a few </connor>
<joey> times actually really yeah my own videos </joey>
<connor> people trying to claim my like they're </connor>
<garnt> like well i'm just talking there's </garnt>
<garnt> nothing is that so you know va i've seen </garnt>
<connor> a tick tock of </connor>
<connor> as one dude on youtube one time he he </connor>
<joey> uploaded this original song and then got </joey>
<joey> claimed by someone yeah someone claimed </joey>
<joey> his original song right right that he </joey>
<joey> uploaded to his own channel </joey>
<connor> well because anyone anyone could put </connor>
<connor> anything called </connor>
<connor> like these companies are given like you </connor>
<joey> know free reign yeah remember remember </joey>
<joey> there was like i forgot when it was like </joey>
<garnt> maybe 2018 there was like that copyright </garnt>
<garnt> armageddon that was happening where yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah all these like fake companies were </garnt>
<garnt> like going around </garnt>
<joey> i mean it's still happening because like </joey>
<joey> it's not as bad as it used to be though </joey>
<joey> it's not it definitely isn't and i'm </joey>
<joey> glad like one of the positive things </joey>
<joey> youtube has done is given creators tools </joey>
<joey> like for example cut or mute the segment </joey>
<garnt> that has been copyright claimed out </garnt>
<garnt> which we just didn't have before so if </garnt>
<garnt> we got a copyright claim before for like </garnt>
<garnt> a second of music then there was just </garnt>
<garnt> like nothing we could do it was just </garnt>
<connor> like a dead video yeah man you know what </connor>
<connor> companies suck well there's [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> viral hog in all those dudes the ones </connor>
<connor> that like buy viral videos oh </connor>
<connor> just go around claiming them like </connor>
<joey> armageddon they're [ __ ] awful like </joey>
<joey> nine gag and stuff like that no no no </joey>
<garnt> they're like these you know you see </garnt>
<joey> those watermarks on facebook you know </joey>
<garnt> remember that video of that dude </garnt>
<garnt> punching the kangaroo yeah bible uh kind </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like that but a bit different </garnt>
<connor> because live bible they don't really </connor>
<connor> they don't normally go around copyright </connor>
<connor> claims yeah like that that video right </connor>
<joey> the the person who had that video sold </joey>
<joey> it to this company right and then what </joey>
<connor> they do is everyone who's then </connor>
<joey> uh talking about it or showing it </joey>
<joey> they'll just go around copyright </joey>
<joey> claiming everything and any of these </joey>
<connor> news networks </connor>
<connor> well that's what it's the business model </connor>
<connor> like they they buy these videos for like </connor>
<connor> very cheap </connor>
<connor> even like have you have you never had </connor>
<connor> offers from people who want to buy your </connor>
<connor> videos </connor>
<connor> they'll go around buying them and then </connor>
<garnt> just claim everything and it's just yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's really [ __ ] because people react to </garnt>
<garnt> stuff on stream as well </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's true and also the worst </garnt>
<garnt> thing is about that luckily 99 cents you </garnt>
<garnt> will never have to experience is that </garnt>
<joey> these copyright claims right sometimes </joey>
<joey> they're like really [ __ ] generous </joey>
<joey> with the timing on the video like so </joey>
<joey> they have to say what time in the video </joey>
<joey> they copyright collection yeah and </joey>
<joey> sometimes they'll add on like five or </joey>
<garnt> ten seconds oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like a piece of [ __ ] now i've got </garnt>
<connor> to like this there's like a clear edit </connor>
<joey> and everything i've gotta edit out or </joey>
<joey> mute [ __ ] because yeah because you don't </joey>
<connor> get to contest no time so whatever the </connor>
<joey> time is that's like if you want to mute </joey>
<connor> the the copyrighted content you don't </connor>
<connor> get to say where it is yeah whatever </connor>
<connor> they submitted is it so one time on one </connor>
<connor> video i remember i reacted to like a </connor>
<joey> clip or something on like on a live </joey>
<joey> stream or something on connor talk and </joey>
<joey> uh they claimed it and i was like yeah </joey>
<joey> it's fair enough but then they claimed </joey>
<joey> like 40 seconds extra i have nothing to </joey>
<connor> do with said clip wow and i was like wow </connor>
<joey> dude like really like like a force they </joey>
<joey> own your reaction as well apparently no </joey>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] my </connor>
<connor> videos like that where i react shadow </connor>
<connor> and i don't give a [ __ ] but yeah it's </connor>
<connor> like bro what are you doing don't claim </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that isn't the video like come on </connor>
<joey> you're just lazy </joey>
<joey> that's the problem right it's like i </joey>
<joey> feel like youtube has done a really good </joey>
<joey> job of like trying to make the playing </joey>
<joey> field as fair as possible right like </joey>
<joey> yeah only recently they added that whole </joey>
<joey> thing of like </joey>
<joey> how uh during an appealing process the </joey>
<connor> money that the video accumulates goes </connor>
<connor> into what's called escrow which is like </connor>
<connor> kind of what you should have done yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah which is kind of like it doesn't go </connor>
<connor> to the </connor>
<connor> person who is the supposed copyright </connor>
<joey> holder or the video owner it kind of </joey>
<joey> like is floating in the cloud until it's </joey>
<joey> resolved yeah it's it's just great it's </joey>
<garnt> like being put in the pool yeah no one </garnt>
<garnt> can get that until the uh copyright </garnt>
<joey> situation is resolved which is fantastic </joey>
<joey> but like at the same time even today i </joey>
<joey> feel the </joey>
<joey> you know the advantage is still in the </joey>
<joey> claimant yeah like clearly youtube is </joey>
<joey> like yeah you know obviously if you're </joey>
<joey> gonna go out of your way to claim </joey>
<joey> something copyright wise then you must </joey>
<joey> have a good reason for it but yeah a lot </joey>

<garnt> i literally looked at [ __ ] videos </garnt>
<garnt> yesterday and i was just like where does </garnt>
<garnt> the dislike channel go when is the </garnt>
<joey> dislikes going </joey>
<joey> it was yeah it was like it's getting </joey>
<joey> like slowly implemented i think so not </joey>
<joey> all channel owners can see it but like </joey>
<joey> at least with your own content you can </joey>
<joey> still see your dislikes which goes </joey>
<joey> completely against the argument that </joey>
<joey> youtube made as to why they wanted to </joey>
<joey> get rid of the dislikes because i </joey>
<joey> remember i made a video on a second </joey>
<joey> channel and one of the youtube's </joey>
<joey> reasonings for getting rid of the </joey>
<joey> dislike button was that like oh it you </joey>
<joey> know if you see dislikes on your videos </joey>
<joey> it discourages smaller creators you know </joey>
<joey> like perhaps you know they're getting </joey>
<joey> dislike bomb perhaps they're getting </joey>
<joey> bullied and no one likes to see a bunch </joey>
<joey> of dislikes </joey>
<joey> yeah you can still see dislikes on your </joey>
<joey> own videos so what the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> you know i'm just glad they're standing </garnt>
<garnt> up for the small creators all two of </garnt>
<joey> them or something that exists on the </joey>
<joey> entire platform of youtube um that have </joey>
<joey> ever complained about this because like </joey>
<joey> i was talking to this about with a bunch </joey>
<joey> of other youtubers and i was i asked </joey>
<joey> them do you know a single creator in </joey>
<joey> your field that has ever complained </joey>
<garnt> about disliked bombs like whatever size </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and not a single person i know has </garnt>
<garnt> ever been like </garnt>
<garnt> ever been like a target of dislike bombs </garnt>
<garnt> to the point where it actually actively </garnt>
<connor> ruins their channel yeah you know have </connor>
<connor> you ever received a lot of dislikes yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean yeah for i mean because i feel me </joey>
<joey> and god make more opinionated videos </joey>
<joey> yeah right so you know obviously there </joey>
<joey> are some opinions i've said in the past </joey>
<joey> that people yeah i'm very happy with you </joey>
<connor> had a lot of dislikes on one video i've </connor>
<joey> had some videos that didn't do as well </joey>
<joey> what what do you classify as a lot of </joey>
<joey> dislikes </joey>
<connor> more than like 10 percent yeah 10 is </connor>
<joey> quite a lot yeah okay yeah i've had a </joey>
<joey> few videos but not that much i don't </joey>
<garnt> have that much most of it is like the </garnt>
<garnt> more the more controversial opinion </garnt>
<joey> videos yeah um but in people who didn't </joey>
<garnt> like watch the videos </garnt>
<garnt> i think the only one was the </garnt>
<garnt> christian one yeah yeah understandable </garnt>
<connor> but uh yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but yeah yeah no i've had a few </connor>
<connor> where it's like it's but it you know </connor>
<connor> when i look back on those videos or like </connor>
<connor> how i presented them i can see why they </connor>
<connor> got dislike bomb and i don't really </connor>
<connor> blame them for it i guess like i </connor>
<connor> remember like i think one that really </connor>
<connor> blew up recently that got quite a few </connor>
<connor> dislikes i think it is like yeah nine to </connor>
<garnt> one is uh it's an old let's fight </garnt>
<garnt> episode where the title of it is uh </garnt>
<garnt> berserk is not a masterpiece </garnt>
<garnt> i think he's just like and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> right now i think it's like 10 yeah 15 </garnt>
<garnt> dislike and it only blew up after miura </garnt>
<garnt> sensei's passing right because obviously </garnt>
<joey> people were searching </joey>
<garnt> and obviously if you watch the video i </garnt>
<garnt> argue against you you'd know that joey </garnt>
<garnt> is like the biggest berserk simp yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like ever </garnt>
<joey> that was the title i used that because </joey>
<connor> that was one of the opinions i got and i </connor>
<connor> fought against it but clearly people you </connor>
<connor> know don't watch it all the way through </connor>
<connor> or up to that point so they just see the </connor>
<connor> title and they think oh this guy hates </connor>
<connor> berserk dislike in some ways i you know </connor>
<connor> i personally like the dislike button but </connor>
<connor> in other ways i think it doesn't really </connor>
<connor> do anything and it doesn't serve </connor>
<joey> the only place you actively dislike the </joey>
<connor> video yeah yeah yeah okay </connor>
<connor> but here's the problem right for what </connor>
<connor> reason yeah this is this is the problem </connor>
<connor> right there's no agreed-upon consensus </connor>
<connor> on when you dislike right it's you could </connor>
<connor> dislike because you disagree with the </connor>
<connor> opinion you could dislike because you </connor>
<connor> didn't enjoy the video as much as </connor>
<joey> another one you could dislike because </joey>
<connor> you just don't like the person yeah i </connor>
<joey> feel like it's the dislike although is </joey>
<joey> sometimes helpful on a tutorial yes it's </joey>
<joey> very black and white is the tutorial not </joey>
<connor> good dislike yeah right when it comes to </connor>
<connor> like your videos i feel like the dislike </connor>
<connor> bar </connor>
<connor> doesn't serve the same purpose as it </connor>
<connor> does on a tutorial where information is </connor>
<garnt> actually important i i think it serves a </garnt>
<garnt> purpose when you know like you really </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] up you know again yeah again yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah you've like purposely made like a </joey>
<connor> very controversial yeah yeah yeah the </connor>
<connor> more i think about it the more i think </connor>
<connor> yeah okay in some ways the dislike </connor>
<connor> dislike unlike bar is [ __ ] useless </connor>
<connor> like it doesn't mean anything it doesn't </connor>
<connor> with 99 of videos i think is completely </connor>
<connor> useless and only with tutorials and </connor>
<connor> knowing when you [ __ ] up that's </connor>
<garnt> literally the only reason well i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> mean there is also some catharsis to </garnt>
<garnt> being able to dislike a video and just </garnt>
<garnt> like you see sometimes you see a video </garnt>
<garnt> and it's so outrageous and you want to </garnt>
<connor> know that you're not the only [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> person who thinks that this video is a </connor>
<connor> like this is a shitty video or something </connor>
<connor> right and you go to the dislike bar and </connor>
<connor> you're like thank god i'm not the only </connor>
<connor> one you know there is some catharsis </connor>
<connor> it's like going on to a video and seeing </connor>
<connor> comments are disabled and i'm just like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] you </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] you but that's that that's way no </connor>
<joey> balls </joey>
<joey> the likes of this like bar is like </joey>
<joey> nothing it's the comments that matter i </joey>
<connor> think that and and when they come to </connor>
<joey> disabled they get way more likely right </joey>
<joey> like to me it's like i i don't mind if </joey>
<joey> you disagree with an opinion i make on a </joey>
<joey> video but i would much rather you leave </joey>
<joey> a comment </joey>
<joey> explaining why you dislike it or why you </joey>
<joey> are against whatever i said in that </joey>
<connor> video rather than just like leaving a </connor>
<joey> dislike because as you said a dislike </joey>
<joey> can mean a million different things </joey>
<connor> because you know sometimes people will </connor>
<connor> be like this video wasn't as good as </connor>
<connor> another one does that mean that that </connor>
<connor> person disliked it and is that is that </connor>
<joey> like fair because if i didn't like a </joey>
<joey> video that someone made or i liked </joey>
<joey> another one more i wouldn't personally </joey>
<joey> dislike no i mean but that's how i do it </joey>
<joey> right so </joey>
<joey> to me trying to like extrapolate any </joey>
<joey> information from this random just metric </joey>
<connor> that doesn't mean [ __ ] like it just it </connor>
<connor> doesn't help me like when i see a video </connor>
<connor> that has 99.9 percent likes i'm like </connor>
<connor> okay now i see a video with 99.8 likes </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> what's the difference here </connor>
<connor> like did they get just more likes than </connor>
<connor> previously or like less dislikes i don't </connor>
<garnt> really understand yeah but i mean like i </garnt>
<garnt> think it is useful not in like the small </garnt>
<garnt> percentages but in like the large </garnt>
<garnt> percentages right because most videos on </garnt>
<garnt> youtube should have like an above ninety </garnt>
<connor> percent like ratio like like to this i </connor>
<connor> think it's actually 99 it's like the is </connor>
<connor> like normally good 95 is where you're </connor>
<connor> getting to like all right maybe you've </connor>
<connor> said something like a little bad if it's </connor>
<connor> 10 if you have nine to one ratio you're </connor>
<garnt> probably [ __ ] up oh no you haven't </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up you've just pissed off </garnt>
<joey> my experiences you've probably pissed </joey>
<joey> off </joey>
<joey> a group a certain community or a certain </joey>
<joey> group you know and then you get to like </joey>
<garnt> the 50 percent and that's when you know </garnt>
<garnt> that something big has like yeah because </garnt>
<connor> your core audience will always like </connor>
<joey> that's yeah i mean that's really but </joey>
<joey> that doesn't necessarily like for </joey>
<connor> example like you know a channel i like </connor>
<joey> to watch a lot of needle draw who does </joey>
<connor> like a lot of music reviews right yeah </connor>
<joey> he's had a couple of recent uh before </joey>
<joey> the dislikes disappeared he's had a </joey>
<garnt> couple of videos </garnt>
<garnt> that were like you know 40 likes yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but it was still uh like a good video it </garnt>
<joey> was just the thing his opinion about it </joey>
<joey> obviously didn't you know coincide with </joey>
<connor> the general public about it right so but </connor>
<joey> like what does that as a viewer what do </joey>
<connor> i then gather from that video like right </connor>
<connor> i'm like is this a bad video yeah is it </connor>
<connor> does it does he say something that's </connor>
<connor> flat out wrong did you say something </connor>
<connor> that a lot of people just don't agree </connor>
<connor> with like it doesn't really tell you </connor>
<joey> anything it's a mixture of all those </joey>
<joey> right yeah and that's why you have to go </joey>
<joey> down into the comments after that to be </joey>
<joey> like okay what is the reasoning behind </joey>
<garnt> this massive dislike yeah but like i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like youtube removing this way for </garnt>
<connor> viewers to express themselves or like </connor>
<connor> the distaste of a video they're going to </connor>
<joey> find other ways to express their </joey>
<joey> distaste towards a video well yeah like </joey>
<joey> i'm sure like rationing is just right </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's going to now be a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> thing in the youtube sphere it's like it </joey>
<joey> wasn't already [ __ ] annoying yeah i i </joey>
<joey> can't wait to like comments to like </joey>
<garnt> ratio youtube videos now because that's </garnt>
<garnt> just that's what's going to happen you </garnt>
<connor> know it's it's </connor>
<connor> viewers always find out like audiences </connor>
<joey> always find a way to show their dislike </joey>
<joey> yeah it's either the youtube comments </joey>
<joey> are going to get more toxic or other </joey>
<joey> social media platforms that that </joey>
<joey> particular youtuber is known to be on is </joey>
<garnt> going to get more toxic because like the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest thing that annoys me is you know </garnt>
<garnt> the tutorials and stuff because that you </garnt>
<garnt> know you are very much removing an easy </garnt>
<garnt> way to discern whether a tutorial is </garnt>
<garnt> right or whether a certain video is </garnt>
<garnt> right because let's say let's say you </garnt>
<garnt> upload a shitty tutorial or you upload a </garnt>
<garnt> scam right you disable comments but </garnt>
<garnt> likes and dislikes are still available </garnt>
<garnt> are still up in the open so you you're </garnt>
<garnt> kind of just like you you're just kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like taking a risk on whether you </garnt>
<garnt> should listen to them right because you </garnt>
<garnt> don't know how many people are disabled </garnt>
<connor> but also likes are very easy to </connor>
<connor> manipulate as well like that's another </connor>
<connor> thing well but like the i would argue a </connor>
<joey> smaller level yeah </joey>
<joey> but i would argue that now that you </joey>
<joey> can't even see the dislikes anymore </joey>
<joey> there's not even a point of like </joey>
<joey> disabling likes and dislikes anymore </joey>
<joey> right because it's just in a constant </joey>
<joey> disabled state right because it's like </joey>
<joey> you can only say like say for example </joey>
<joey> there was a scam video yeah if they </joey>
<joey> disable the comments now what's the only </joey>
<joey> thing you can see is the likes it's like </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean you can't do anything about </garnt>
<garnt> it because like i i think youtube were </garnt>
<garnt> trying to go with something </garnt>
<connor> similar to what instagram did with their </connor>
<connor> likes about making like likes not public </connor>
<connor> except for the poster and like for </connor>
<connor> instagram i get it for that you know for </connor>
<garnt> that platform i think it made sense </garnt>
<garnt> because they reverted it hmm they </garnt>
<connor> reverted it did they yeah when i can see </connor>
<joey> all the likes yeah they reverted yeah </joey>
<joey> they reverted it </joey>
<garnt> since how long like a long time now holy </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] okay </garnt>
<connor> under the impression that that was yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah well we can see how often </joey>
<garnt> god goes on instagram it's no big secret </garnt>
<garnt> that i don't go on instagram so uh i </garnt>
<garnt> guess my point is now mute </garnt>
<garnt> well [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> i'm glad you guys stopped me before i </garnt>
<garnt> was starting before i was going to start </garnt>
<joey> spewing a lot of balls </joey>
<joey> no they shot for me they shot for me </joey>
<connor> yeah they shot for me </connor>
<connor> i think they might be slowly rolling it </connor>
<connor> back out or you have to like </connor>
<connor> maybe opt into it or something i don't </connor>
<connor> know but let's see okay that must be </connor>
<connor> data that's [ __ ] that on their end right </connor>
<connor> that like says hey you know when people </connor>
<connor> see likes it's good for us yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> i i don't know what that is i can only </connor>
<garnt> probably it's probably if people can see </garnt>
<garnt> like it just keeps them on the platform </garnt>
<garnt> because viewers want to feel like </garnt>
<garnt> they're having some like like they can </garnt>
<garnt> contribute in some way shape or form </garnt>
<joey> well they want to see a metric and they </joey>
<joey> want to see that metric go up with the </joey>
<connor> with the youtube one the main </connor>
<joey> speculation was that brands weren't </joey>
<connor> happy with the dislike bar yeah now i'm </connor>
<joey> i in some ways i feel like that's too </joey>
<connor> easy of an explanation yeah i feel like </connor>
<connor> youtube in the past hasn't i i don't </connor>
<connor> think they've been that catering of </connor>
<connor> brands </connor>
<joey> i don't know i could be wrong here i </joey>
<joey> feel like they must have some data that </joey>
<joey> backs up that removing dislikes will </joey>
<joey> lead to better views or something yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean because there's no way that </joey>
<joey> you should each team seems too selfish </joey>
<connor> to yeah to do something for brands it </connor>
<joey> seems like i feel like it just happens </joey>
<joey> to be no so uh so the youtube creators </joey>
<connor> uh channel on youtube made a video it's </connor>
<connor> like a three minute video that was like </connor>
<joey> very concise saying why they were moving </joey>
<connor> it yeah was it the dude who's like uh is </connor>
<connor> that the one that the guy was like </connor>
<connor> sitting there yeah yeah the guy's just </connor>
<joey> like sitting there being like this is </joey>
<joey> the reason why we're gonna do it nice </joey>
<joey> and quick you know i give him props for </joey>
<connor> that at least it wasn't like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> 30 minute explanation video yeah but </connor>
<connor> like they gave him another [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> nick over yeah exactly exactly it was </connor>
<connor> nice and concise which is nice but um </connor>
<connor> yeah one of the reasons they gave was </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah we saw a metric uh that uh </connor>
<connor> we tested upon millions of users don't </connor>
<connor> know how true that is that uh apparently </connor>
<connor> the amount of dislikes does not change </connor>
<connor> uh the watch time of that video i </connor>
<joey> believe that no i believe that yeah and </joey>
<connor> i'm like yeah i mean of course i don't </connor>
<connor> you that's not a reason though to get </connor>
<connor> rid of it with dislikes yeah exactly </connor>
<joey> because i argued being like well yeah </joey>
<joey> what if you're watching like an apology </joey>
<connor> video that's like 40 minutes long right </connor>
<joey> this i'm sure there's a lot of dislikes </joey>
<joey> on it but people want to see it until </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah i mean youtuber has one </connor>
<joey> priority it's making people watch longer </joey>
<joey> yeah there must be some some evidence to </joey>
<connor> to prove that i do getting rid of it </connor>
<joey> makes people watch that i did find it </joey>
<joey> funny though that the last point they </joey>
<joey> gave that was like and the last question </joey>
<joey> is did we get rid of the dislike button </joey>
<joey> because of youtube rewind they brought </joey>
<joey> that point yeah </joey>
<joey> and dude i've never seen a guy say no </joey>
<joey> with such copium in my life </joey>
<joey> he was like no no </joey>
<garnt> you can see the copy i mean </garnt>
<garnt> you could see how many times he had to </garnt>
<garnt> film that to not to like sound genuine </garnt>
<garnt> to like get the most genuine take that </garnt>
<garnt> he could </garnt>
<joey> because he knew like people were going </joey>
<joey> to be watching this under a microscope </joey>
<joey> yeah at like 0.25 speed or something to </joey>
<joey> be like well the inflection in his voice </joey>
<garnt> kind of leads me to believe that youtube </garnt>
<joey> made himself i heard a slight vibrato in </joey>
<joey> his voice meaning he is about to start </joey>
<joey> crying at any minute </joey>
<connor> i just wish they would uh tell us the </connor>
<connor> truth and give us some data but they're </connor>
<garnt> not going to do that why would we no no </garnt>
<garnt> no i mean i mean what like </garnt>
<garnt> what no not not annoyed me but the way </garnt>
<joey> what uh </joey>
<joey> really made me suspicious was the way </joey>
<joey> they framed it to like oh we're doing </joey>
<joey> you guys yeah you asked for this </joey>
<joey> don't don't thank us later please please </joey>
<joey> hold the applause but we are helping you </joey>
<garnt> for your mental health and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like literally no creator i have talked </garnt>
<garnt> to or ever heard of like ask youtube to </garnt>
<garnt> do this and they framed it in a way that </garnt>
<joey> they're doing it for their creativity </joey>
<joey> ever seen a youtube creator make a video </joey>
<joey> in front of the camera going guys my </joey>
<joey> mental health is deteriorating from all </joey>
<joey> these dislikes i'm getting man [ __ ] no </joey>
<joey> of course not it's the [ __ ] algorithm </joey>
<joey> that's like demanding youtube's to not </joey>
<garnt> take a break it's the one time a </garnt>
<garnt> corporation has said don't worry guys </garnt>
<garnt> we've heard you and the cr the the the </garnt>
<joey> audience didn't actually say anything </joey>
<joey> yeah we have been silent </joey>
<joey> you've had </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> it's literally the i've saved the day </garnt>
<garnt> but you haven't done anything they just </garnt>
<joey> leave </joey>
<joey> you're welcome i'll see ya </joey>
<connor> oh my god so i've uh finally started to </connor>
<connor> settle in my new place now oh yeah um </connor>
<connor> yeah we are 20 years later 20 years </connor>
<connor> later you know </connor>
<connor> um you know hosted uh the house warming </connor>
<joey> unfortunately joey couldn't make it </joey>
<joey> because you were busy with the uh </joey>
<joey> yeah i will say yeah lovely lasagna yeah </joey>
<joey> i will say ever since that day so okay </joey>
<joey> so i don't know if i've told the story </joey>
<joey> of the world famous lasagna yeah which </joey>
<connor> it's it's not world famous but it's </connor>
<connor> about to be okay it's now it's about to </connor>
<joey> be so </joey>
<connor> um so in japan i don't know why but you </connor>
<joey> can get a lot of good italian food in </joey>
<connor> japan but for some reason you just can't </connor>
<joey> get lasagna like no italian restaurant </joey>
<joey> in japan for some reason serves lasagna </joey>
<joey> and the few that they do they definitely </joey>
<joey> don't serve good lasagna yeah so because </joey>
<joey> of this i would just like look i've been </joey>
<joey> living in japan for a year i'm craving </joey>
<joey> lasagna so what better way to do it then </joey>
<joey> just learn how to do it yourself absorb </joey>
<joey> myself [ __ ] uh literally [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> thanos i'll [ __ ] do it myself right </garnt>
<joey> so about a year ago i didn't even </joey>
<joey> realize i was a fan of reference i just </joey>
<garnt> said it is it a thanos reference yeah i </garnt>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<connor> it's the one where he takes a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> and says fine i'll do it myself yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i haven't seen the movie i just see </joey>
<connor> that it's a pretty famous music this is </connor>
<joey> the most generic line that could be </joey>
<joey> attached to any character i could say </joey>
<joey> anything i could be like oh my penis is </joey>
<joey> a little lychee's like i remember that i </joey>
<connor> said </connor>
<garnt> i'll do it myself after myself </garnt>
<connor> so about a year ago i learned how to </connor>
<connor> cook lasagna and i cook it once right i </connor>
<joey> i cook it once and it was like it was </joey>
<connor> like mediocre lasagna all right and uh </connor>
<joey> it's a difficult dish right yeah i mean </joey>
<connor> kind of </connor>
<connor> lego but with pasta yeah it's it's like </connor>
<connor> it's cool it's it's a it's a pasta cake </connor>
<connor> right it's just it's just concentrated </connor>
<connor> pasta with meat sauce </connor>
<garnt> that's kind of that's kind of what it is </garnt>
<connor> it's like all the flavor of pesto bowl </connor>
<connor> layers very precisely right yeah right </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<garnt> deep doing quarantine uh sometimes we </garnt>
<garnt> would you know have have dinner parties </garnt>
<garnt> where we we would invite people over or </garnt>

<connor> it but i'm just like i can do better i </connor>
<connor> need to do better </connor>
<connor> i make something let's go further beyond </connor>
<connor> i make some mental notes before the </connor>
<connor> before the day about what i'm about like </connor>
<connor> the small changes i'm going to make to </connor>
<connor> the recipe like the small changes are </connor>
<garnt> going to make to the preparation and </garnt>
<garnt> everything and so the day comes it's </garnt>
<joey> like you're going to like a bake-off it </joey>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<connor> this is </connor>
<connor> a joke like imagine cooking for maelyn </connor>
<joey> you know but it's like your own i would </joey>
<joey> never dare to but it's your own personal </joey>
<joey> recipe like i i think i would actually </joey>
<joey> rather cook for gordon ramsay at this </joey>
<joey> point um and so </joey>
<joey> everyone comes everyone comes and you </joey>
<connor> know everyone has all the different you </connor>
<connor> know side dishes we have some meatballs </connor>
<connor> we have some other things </connor>
<connor> but the lasagna is the main dish and </connor>
<connor> like everyone's everyone's having a </connor>
<connor> merry time i'm [ __ ] sweating not just </connor>
<connor> because of the heat from the oven but </connor>
<connor> i'm sweating out of nerves man i look </connor>
<connor> very nervous i do remember you looking </connor>
<connor> really nice yeah i remember like i </connor>
<connor> remember everyone coming in everyone </connor>
<connor> coming in like sydney just like greeting </connor>
<joey> everyone everyone's being social and i </joey>
<joey> was like don't talk to me don't talk to </joey>
<joey> me i'm making like i'm standing right </joey>
<joey> now i'm making lasagna connor's like yo </joey>
<joey> go on can i see your office and i'm just </joey>
<joey> like no connor i'll show you after i </joey>
<joey> finish this [ __ ] lasagna </joey>
<joey> and then and then i'll be social and </joey>
<joey> i'll be a good host yeah but until the </joey>
<joey> design is done nothing is happening and </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<connor> um and so i cooked this on lasagna it's </connor>
<connor> an hour after sydney had said that the </connor>
<connor> designer would be finished i don't care </connor>
<connor> you can't rush perfection </connor>
<connor> and then i and then i and then i finish </connor>
<connor> it and then i take it out </connor>
<connor> and then this is a really weird </connor>
<connor> experience people start crowding around </connor>
<connor> this lasagna right it's like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> people started crowding that around this </connor>
<connor> design and you know i'm gonna say it </connor>
<garnt> looks [ __ ] good right no it's like i </garnt>
<connor> mean i saw the photos it looks good </connor>
<connor> there's the thing about lasagna right </connor>
<joey> that you know anyone who loves lasagna </joey>
<joey> will understand is it the first </joey>
<connor> spatula the first serving is always the </connor>
<connor> best one yeah because the more the more </connor>
<connor> people start chunking out that lasagna </connor>
<connor> the more sloppy it becomes yeah don't </connor>
<connor> get me wrong it's not like lasagna is </connor>
<joey> the cleanest thing on earth yeah but the </joey>
<joey> first the first spatula scoop is the </joey>
<connor> best one yeah so you get the perfect </connor>
<garnt> ratio yeah yeah yeah because like you </garnt>
<garnt> know i needed to make sure like the </garnt>
<garnt> cheese was like perfectly toasted </garnt>
<joey> because it can't be like raw cheese and </joey>
<joey> like the edges need to be like a little </joey>
<joey> bit crispy a little bit burnt right </joey>
<joey> that's that's to me that's a good </joey>
<connor> lasagna you can't have like a completely </connor>
<joey> raw but not too overburnt lasagna and so </joey>
<connor> i remember i remember finishing it </connor>
<garnt> everyone's taking a picture i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> melin </garnt>
<garnt> have the first taste </garnt>
<garnt> the spotlight comes on silent the room </garnt>
<garnt> is silent right i give her the dish </garnt>
<garnt> she like she like takes one bite right </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like the longest [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> few seconds of my life right i see you </garnt>
<garnt> chewing this lasagna and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> my life is like flashing before my eyes </garnt>
<garnt> right now and she's just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> you've leveled up </garnt>
<garnt> i can't explain the [ __ ] euphoria </garnt>
<connor> that just went over my body man </connor>
<garnt> it was very good it was like it was </garnt>
<connor> literally that japanese going </connor>
<connor> it was good </connor>
<connor> very good i have to say i can confirm </connor>
<joey> it's great </joey>
<joey> it's like a lost food wars episode it </joey>
<connor> was to be honest i don't remember any of </connor>
<joey> the other food that was there yeah i </joey>
<connor> remember the ladies yeah it must be good </connor>
<joey> there were sandwiches there was there's </joey>
<joey> alright </joey>
<connor> i don't know i don't even i i know there </connor>
<connor> was a menu but i can't remember anything </connor>
<garnt> else on the menu i mean </garnt>
<garnt> what what what does it matter when you </garnt>
<garnt> had the world famous lasagna i just i </garnt>
<joey> just wanted to be like really </joey>
<connor> pretentious about it just be like </connor>
<garnt> like a childhood flashback </garnt>
<garnt> maybe i hope so but like ever since that </garnt>
<joey> point i'm just like </joey>
<joey> damn cooking's fun cooking for other </joey>
<joey> people can be fun so </joey>
<joey> who would have thought yeah so uh ever </joey>
<joey> since ever since then ever since then me </joey>
<joey> and sunny have been cooking almost like </joey>
<connor> every day so we used to like uber eats </connor>
<connor> almost every day and a big a big thing a </connor>
<connor> big deal is because we do have a </connor>
<connor> dishwasher now so uh we don't have to </connor>
<connor> wash dishes ourselves anymore and that </connor>
<connor> takes so much of the effort out in the </connor>
<connor> cooking process because right you know i </connor>
<connor> like i find i find like i find cooking </connor>
<connor> relaxing you know i actually find it </connor>
<garnt> relaxing to chop up the onions or chop </garnt>
<garnt> up the vegetables or whatever prepare </garnt>
<garnt> the dish cook the dish it's the it's the </garnt>
<garnt> clearing up that is always put me off </garnt>
<garnt> cooking all right ever since i've gotten </garnt>
<garnt> the dishwasher cooking has actually been </garnt>
<joey> an enjoyable experience for me yeah i </joey>
<joey> feel the more i'm doing it now like i </joey>
<joey> used to [ __ ] dread it like i it was </joey>
<connor> just like stressful even like following </connor>
<connor> the menu or the recipe </connor>
<connor> somehow i [ __ ] it up in some regard i </connor>
<connor> don't know i was like i'm following the </connor>
<connor> recipe how does this taste like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and but like now the more i'm </connor>
<connor> like slowly sounds like hell bucky cook </connor>
<connor> and like you know trying out like really </connor>
<joey> easy like pastas and like you know </joey>
<joey> something that is very difficult to [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> up kind of thing i'm like oh </joey>
<joey> wow </joey>
<joey> it's kind of fun what the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> is this what is this what it feels like </garnt>
<garnt> to be like good at something yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like when you when you see </garnt>
<garnt> people eating your meal and they're just </garnt>
<connor> enjoying it and feeling happy i'm like </connor>
<connor> oh this is how chefs feel oh my god oh </connor>
<connor> my god i think i think i found like a </connor>
<connor> new hobby or something because it's uh </connor>
<connor> genuinely like a good feeling to cook </connor>
<joey> something that you're proud of and </joey>
<joey> people also enjoy your cooking i get it </joey>
<joey> now mom i get it okay i guess i am i get </joey>
<joey> why you was always like eagle-eyed on me </joey>
<garnt> whenever i'd like eat any of your meals </garnt>
<connor> okay i get it now i like cooking it's </connor>
<connor> just a lot of work but also </connor>
<connor> um i i'm also really bad with portion </connor>
<connor> control </connor>
<connor> right when i make food i make food like </connor>
<joey> a lot like a feast yeah </joey>
<joey> i used to make a lot of lasagna from </joey>
<garnt> walls is that i would then eat lasagna </garnt>
<garnt> you make a little lasagna you know yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah but is it world famous </joey>
<connor> nobody's had it that's it </connor>
<joey> well no no i'm curious now i'm curious </joey>
<joey> we're about to have a lasagna </joey>
<joey> one time i made a lasagna right i was </joey>
<joey> like oh i totally forgot to make the </joey>
<joey> white sauce layer wherever right right </joey>
<joey> and i was like why does this taste like </joey>
<connor> bricks </connor>
<connor> because there was like no like white </connor>
<joey> layer to balance out the tomatoes yeah </joey>
<joey> but yeah so i i would have make lasagna </joey>
<connor> i always liked leftover lasagna more </connor>
<joey> than lasagna </joey>
<connor> really something about lasagna sometimes </connor>
<joey> that like the next day when you when you </joey>
<joey> heat it up it's like perfect yeah it's </joey>
<joey> cause it's so thick right yeah it's so </joey>
<connor> thick it kind of gets i don't know try </connor>
<joey> it guys it's like i i have tried it it's </joey>
<garnt> like it's like how leftover deep dish </garnt>
<joey> pizza tastes better than the fresh deep </joey>
<connor> sometimes yeah sometimes i don't know </connor>
<connor> why but at least at least the lasagna </connor>
<connor> that i made i don't know maybe it was </connor>
<garnt> like are you talking about microwaved </garnt>
<garnt> lasagna or do you just eat it straight </garnt>
<garnt> out of the [ __ ] fridge </garnt>
<joey> uh i don't know like properly made </joey>
<joey> lasagna and then i would like put it </joey>
<garnt> back in the next day yeah i'll put it </garnt>
<garnt> back in the oven yeah yeah oh okay </garnt>
<joey> it's good yeah i think maybe it's </joey>
<joey> because like the the the juices like </joey>
<connor> coagulate yeah like solid it like seeps </connor>
<connor> in right like you could like cut through </connor>
<connor> it like a cake yeah </connor>
<joey> whereas lasagna that goes [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> everywhere yeah i think we're wrong i </joey>
<joey> might i generally prefer normal lasagna </joey>
<connor> but about when i used to make it that </connor>
<connor> for some reason i liked it the day after </connor>
<joey> more no i get that i don't know why it's </joey>
<connor> like a hurry </connor>
<garnt> no i've heard that that's like the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest fallacy i've ever heard because </garnt>
<garnt> i've had i've had day old curry it </garnt>
<joey> definitely doesn't taste as good as like </joey>
<joey> what kind of curry though indian curry </joey>
<garnt> right because i understand why okay </garnt>
<joey> indian curry may not be the same because </joey>
<garnt> in with japanese curry it's definitely </garnt>
<garnt> better the day after yeah because it's </garnt>
<connor> it's taken the time for like everything </connor>
<connor> to like </connor>
<connor> sarah are you uh sorry okay hong kong </connor>
<garnt> but like i was telling japanese curry </garnt>
<connor> tastes to say no matter what i feel </connor>
<connor> so yeah i i feel like i've never had bad </connor>
<garnt> curry but i've never had curry that's </garnt>
<garnt> like made me like [ __ ] amazed about </garnt>
<joey> how good it is it is the most like six </joey>
<connor> out of ten cups there's some like </connor>
<connor> gourmet ones where they use like really </connor>
<connor> rich stock and they have like really </connor>
<connor> like uh good quality beef bites yeah at </connor>
<connor> the end of the day it's still generally </connor>
<joey> it's still a japanese car yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> um with pizza </joey>
<joey> i do do you like i was wondering about </joey>
<connor> this because you know there's people who </connor>
<connor> like purists they're like stone-baked uh </connor>
<connor> uh what's uh where was it from uh napoli </connor>
<connor> napoli like that's the only style that's </connor>
<connor> the correct style which type of pizza is </connor>
<connor> your favorite style i was just curious </connor>
<connor> yeah i do like stone base stone bait is </connor>
<connor> the only pizza where i can eat the crust </connor>
<connor> okay because okay because like some like </connor>
<joey> sourdough stone bay pizza oh my god okay </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm a crust i'm a cross hater but </joey>
<connor> i'm like i'm gonna eat that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> crust i'm gonna enjoy it okay american </connor>
<joey> pizza is the best pizza i think like </joey>
<joey> what like what kind of american pizza </joey>
<connor> like a new york pizza that's like the </connor>
<joey> best to be fair new york pizza is pretty </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] bomb they i think american style </connor>
<joey> of making pizza is the best way </joey>
<joey> i uh i love stone bake i love stone bake </joey>
<connor> right i love it don't get me wrong but </connor>
<connor> like there i don't know what it is about </connor>
<joey> americans italians italians i i hear you </joey>
<joey> italians like i thought </joey>
<joey> a whole generation just like died </joey>
<garnt> here's my argument right the thing with </garnt>
<garnt> the thing with stone baked pizza that </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes kind of pisses me off why are </garnt>
<garnt> they so goddamn light with the toppings </garnt>
<joey> like they put like one pepperoni on it </joey>
<joey> and call it a day you know which i get </joey>
<connor> it you don't you don't like submerge it </connor>
<connor> but also everything falls off like </connor>
<joey> immediately as well i think it's awesome </joey>
<connor> nothing stays in place </connor>
<connor> isn't that based off </connor>
<connor> isn't that based off like the it's </connor>
<connor> either napoli or the other type of uh </connor>
<connor> italian pizza but like it's not supposed </connor>
<joey> to be a heavy meal yeah it's supposed to </joey>
<connor> be very very lovely i don't know which </connor>
<joey> one it is yeah i love the heaviness of </joey>
<joey> american pizza right right like it's </joey>
<joey> like a it's all like a nice why american </joey>
<garnt> pizza what do you mean because there's </garnt>
<connor> so many different types well the </connor>
<connor> american style of making pizza is like </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> from what i understand like new york </connor>
<connor> where it's like dominant yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> perfectly constructed right where it's </connor>
<connor> like this it's this slice that like is </connor>
<connor> very solid on its own like when it's cut </connor>
<connor> up nothing like falls off nothing like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] slips off or anything it's a </connor>
<connor> nice solid bit of pizza i love it also </connor>
<connor> one thing i tried which i thought was </connor>
<connor> going to be disgusting right this is </connor>
<connor> this is vile i know it sounds gross hear </connor>
<garnt> me out right </garnt>
<garnt> i had this do you like the grease do you </garnt>
<joey> like the grease yes so </joey>
<garnt> hold on hold on </garnt>
<connor> okay i'm listening i tried the hot dog </connor>
<joey> in the crushed pizza and i [ __ ] loved </joey>
<connor> it hot oh like a like a hot dog in the </connor>
<joey> crust all right i [ __ ] i really </joey>
<joey> enjoyed it do you like cheesy crust </joey>
<connor> yes but i like the hot dog one more </connor>
<joey> really </joey>
<joey> what about an extra meal but what if you </joey>
<joey> put the cheese inside of the hot dog and </joey>
<garnt> then you put that in the crust oh that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's just not even a crust </garnt>
<garnt> anymore like whenever whenever whenever </garnt>

<garnt> eat stuffed crust stuffed brush is good </garnt>
<joey> stuffed crust is what you eat when </joey>
<joey> you're like when you don't want to </joey>
<joey> actually eat crust okay it's a </joey>
<joey> mozzarella stick okay and this is this </joey>
<joey> is just a [ __ ] hot dog okay </joey>
<garnt> you're eating you're eating a pizza with </garnt>
<connor> a hot dog at the end i like it </connor>
<joey> i like the hot dog you get it in japan </joey>
<joey> oh really yeah pizza hut do it oh </joey>
<joey> you're not going to pretend that this is </joey>
<joey> better than stone baked pizza or like a </joey>
<joey> fresh honestly fresh [ __ ] pizza okay </joey>
<joey> but okay but in japan no way </joey>
<garnt> no [ __ ] way am i listening to this </garnt>
<joey> right now in japan </joey>
<joey> there's in japan okay there's two types </joey>
<joey> of pizza in japan right yeah there's </joey>
<joey> pizza and then there's pizza yeah all </joey>
<joey> right two different things no i'm not </joey>
<connor> you guys are but it is </connor>
<joey> like an hour left on this recording can </joey>
<joey> we order a pizza hot pizza with sausage </joey>
<joey> in the crunch i actually want to try it </joey>
<joey> i'm just saying we should do it we </joey>
<connor> should all have a live reaction yeah why </connor>
<connor> why not because i want to see your </connor>
<garnt> reaction i want to see your hot dog </garnt>
<garnt> crust pizza it's a hot dog crust pizza </garnt>
<joey> camera have your head on i've never </joey>
<joey> tried it yeah i want to see how have you </joey>
<garnt> never tried it because i barely eat </garnt>
<joey> cheesy crust i just want like a regular </joey>
<joey> crust i'm pretty sure they have it man </joey>
<joey> i'm telling you why do you like cheesy </joey>
<connor> crust it's too heavy </connor>
<connor> and you want a hot dog crust no honestly </connor>
<connor> it's like it's so good it's like a very </connor>
<joey> tight hot dog it's like so it's like </joey>
<joey> wrapped around it's like a bite-sized </joey>
<joey> hot dog it's like a hot dog burrito bro </joey>
<connor> it's so good </connor>
<connor> i need to check if they still have yeah </connor>
<joey> so so in japan right there's there's two </joey>
<connor> types of pizza there's pizza which is </connor>
<connor> like stuff like pizza hut domino's </connor>
<connor> american pizza basically right and then </connor>
<connor> there's pizza which is the italian pizza </connor>
<connor> yeah right so like when if you ever go </connor>
<connor> to like a an italian like restaurant or </connor>
<connor> whatever or establishment </connor>
<garnt> you'll be able to know the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between like the italian like </garnt>
<garnt> stone-baked stuff that god likes and </garnt>
<garnt> then the american stuff that conor likes </garnt>
<garnt> so at least gusting at least japan has </garnt>
<garnt> like made a distinction being like you </garnt>
<joey> know at least they're not one of those </joey>
<garnt> countries that are like all pizza is the </garnt>
<garnt> same like i remember when i first went </garnt>
<garnt> to new york right and i had my first </garnt>
<garnt> like new york pizza and the selling </garnt>
<connor> point of this pizza uh was that you </connor>
<connor> could literally just kill your face you </connor>
<connor> could literally tilt the pizza and you </connor>
<connor> could see the oil dripping off it and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like how is this a selling </connor>
<connor> point you're meant to make this </connor>
<garnt> appetizing </garnt>
<garnt> this is just pure fat that's like </garnt>
<joey> rolling off now i i but i went to a </joey>
<joey> place in new york that was like i guess </joey>
<joey> like kind of famous in new york i forgot </joey>
<joey> what it was but like </joey>
<garnt> it's they're famous for like dabbing the </garnt>
<garnt> oil off pizza off the pizza so it's a </garnt>
<garnt> really really it's it's a massive pizza </garnt>
<garnt> but it's really thin and really light </garnt>
<joey> yeah so like i don't know about like the </joey>
<joey> full or like oil dripping off thing like </joey>
<garnt> if that was a good point </garnt>
<garnt> but like the point is you're still </garnt>
<joey> dabbing off the oil because there is so </joey>
<connor> much oil on the pizza right right and to </connor>
<joey> me that's that's not that's not </joey>
<connor> appetizing i don't know like when i see </connor>
<connor> that much oil on anything that just i </connor>
<connor> don't want to eat it you know i i can i </connor>
<garnt> can feel i can feel my arteries just </garnt>
<joey> clogging up as much as like you know </joey>
<joey> there's a place called pizza slice in </joey>
<joey> shibuya that's really good that does uh </joey>
<joey> new york style pizza [ __ ] bomb i can </joey>
<joey> only go there maybe like once a month </joey>
<joey> though because my god after two slices i </joey>
<garnt> am like about to explore look look i i </garnt>
<garnt> get it where you know i i get that it's </garnt>
<garnt> a nice fast meal it feels good it feels </garnt>
<garnt> unhealthy but to say that it is better </garnt>
<garnt> than stone baked pizza that's where i </garnt>
<joey> draw the line man no [ __ ] way if i </joey>
<joey> had to choose oh god so hard i just i </joey>
<joey> just like pizza in general yeah </joey>
<connor> it's all delicious </connor>
<connor> i'm not saying that stone bait is not </connor>
<garnt> delicious yeah it is yeah i'm not i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not saying that new york pizza is not </garnt>
<joey> delicious as well in its own way because </joey>
<joey> like both types of pizza have their </joey>
<joey> benefits because because like the only </joey>
<joey> thing can be an everyday meal the the </joey>
<joey> only pizza that i'd say the americans do </joey>
<joey> the best is chicago pizza she can't push </joey>
<joey> stuff </joey>
<connor> but like that's like that's not even </connor>
<connor> that's not even nowhere else even does </connor>
<garnt> it not a pizza it's a pie no no yeah </garnt>
<joey> exactly it's it's not a pizza it's a </joey>
<connor> pizza lasagna but it's a pizza lasagna </connor>
<connor> that's what that's what chicago deep </connor>
<connor> dish pizza is and that's why it's </connor>

<connor> the show you know for me there's </connor>
<connor> something about the filling-ness of an </connor>
<garnt> american pizza style american pizza </garnt>
<garnt> style that i i love so much yeah i get </garnt>
<garnt> that like i love i really really miss </garnt>
<connor> domino's pizza in the uk it was so good </connor>
<joey> i love that pizza what's different about </joey>
<connor> it in the uk </connor>
<connor> i don't know i don't know why it's so </connor>
<garnt> good i i don't know i think it's just </garnt>
<garnt> biased i think it just tastes the same </garnt>
<joey> that's that's me i i did you like i've </joey>
<connor> had dominoes around like lots of </connor>
<connor> different places and they all kind of </connor>
<connor> taste so i i had little caesars pizza in </connor>
<joey> america right and i thought it was </joey>
<joey> delicious </joey>
<joey> the mini pizzas the bigger ones are the </joey>
<joey> bigger ones like five dollar for like a </joey>
<joey> large right and everyone was saying like </joey>
<joey> bro it's like the worst pizza on earth </joey>
<joey> yeah i actually like like it i like oven </joey>
<joey> pizza it's not really great i had it i </joey>
<joey> liked it i liked it i'd much rather </joey>
<connor> dominos than literally i like little </connor>
<connor> caesars it was and also i'm just </connor>
<garnt> convinced you don't have taste buds no </garnt>
<connor> i'm like the the more the more you talk </connor>
<garnt> the more i'm just like no no no </garnt>
<connor> also </connor>
<connor> my enjoyment of it also increases </connor>
<garnt> knowing that for all of that for five </garnt>
<garnt> dollars that's insane </garnt>
<garnt> what </garnt>
<garnt> the taste is good and it's only like </garnt>
<garnt> it's only heightened by the fact that </garnt>
<joey> it's simply five dollars </joey>
<joey> for this massive like this could feed </joey>
<joey> the entire [ __ ] last supper this </joey>
<joey> little caesar pizza yeah because it's </joey>
<joey> not that good that doesn't affect the </joey>
<garnt> taste i don't know it does it most come </garnt>
<garnt> on dude you go to a place right the </garnt>
<connor> price affects the way you see the food </connor>
<joey> it does yes like when you get that's </joey>
<joey> exactly why little caesars taste like a </joey>
<connor> five dollar pizza it's not that great </connor>
<connor> you get a dollar slice in new york yeah </connor>
<joey> it is foolish of me to act like knowing </joey>
<connor> it was one dollar didn't contribute to </connor>
<connor> my enjoyment of that yeah of course but </connor>
<joey> it was amazing you don't go to a new </joey>
<joey> york pizza place and be like i would </joey>
<joey> like an exquisite meal right now please </joey>
<joey> one dollar oh what a steal is it because </joey>
<connor> stone bay pizzas are not big enough </connor>
<joey> that is one big factor is that it yeah </joey>
<connor> it's not okay so </connor>
<connor> so hypothetically if you found a </connor>
<connor> restaurant here in japan or wherever </connor>
<joey> that does stone-baked sourdough pizza </joey>
<joey> but it was the size of a new york pizza </joey>
<connor> but also they skimp out on the toppings </connor>
<connor> a lot right no i mean the problem with </connor>
<garnt> in japan they definitely do but if </garnt>
<garnt> you've had if you've had like stone bait </garnt>
<connor> in england like in europe and a lot of </connor>
<connor> the time they skimp out they're like i'm </connor>
<connor> like you don't put enough toppings on </connor>
<connor> there's not like there's like the sauce </connor>
<connor> is generous enough i'd say but like </connor>
<connor> cheese like come on man you know i i had </connor>
<joey> stones in italy and they stacked that </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] because i haven't i haven't been to </garnt>
<garnt> italy but like the best stone baked </garnt>
<garnt> pizzas places i go to they don't skimp </garnt>
<garnt> on the cheese they don't scream pound </garnt>
<garnt> the toppings because you're in like a </garnt>
<connor> british british version of it so they're </connor>
<connor> like they fix it </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> the one i had in northern italy was </joey>
<connor> packed was it really yeah it was like </connor>
<connor> every time i've had one in italy it's </connor>
<connor> it's been like </connor>
<connor> like very lacking in toppings really </connor>
<joey> yeah and i think you're going to the </joey>
<garnt> right places yeah i don't know like and </garnt>
<garnt> like as the person who is like the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest simp for bread like how does </garnt>
<garnt> that not play a factor in how these </garnt>
<connor> pizzas taste oh so that's more of a i </connor>
<connor> would say stone baked in many aspects in </connor>
<connor> my mind it's more about enjoying the </connor>
<connor> bread than it is about the pizza like i </connor>
<connor> don't even consider it like right right </connor>
<connor> to a point where i'm like it's flavored </connor>
<connor> bread i'd rather just get like bread </connor>
<connor> like at this point you know just give me </connor>
<connor> the give me a real [ __ ] pizza bro if </connor>
<connor> it doesn't give me like five spots the </connor>
<connor> next day it isn't a pizza bro i want to </connor>
<connor> be [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] me up with this pizza </connor>
<garnt> you know what you know what the world's </garnt>
<garnt> right british people don't have taste no </garnt>
<connor> i'm just like you know what's confirmed </connor>
<connor> i'm too american with this one man </connor>
<connor> i'm american all the way on this one </connor>
<connor> from american pizza it goes hard it </connor>
<joey> doesn't it doesn't look like there's a </joey>
<connor> there's a time and a place for an </connor>
<joey> american pizza every time hands down </joey>
<garnt> every day there is there is a time and a </garnt>
<connor> place for american pizza but every day </connor>
<connor> it is not the superior people it is not </connor>
<joey> the city it is not the superior period </joey>
<connor> sir america i salute you with your pizza </connor>
<joey> okay then your pizza slaps keep doing it </joey>
<joey> okay let's see how okay then question </joey>
<joey> which one's better japanese sushi or </joey>
<connor> american sushi right </connor>
<connor> well no obviously like japan does it </connor>
<connor> better </connor>
<connor> well then sushi yeah yeah so like would </connor>
<joey> you if if if i was to give you a choice </joey>
<connor> of like just standard like nikon of like </connor>
<joey> just regular tuna that you get like a </joey>
<joey> cup position here or california raw </joey>
<connor> which one would you shoot but i feel </connor>
<connor> like comparing like i feel like at the </connor>
<connor> end of the day a pizza a stone baked </connor>
<connor> pizza and a pizza are like the same [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> right what you've said but like like </connor>
<connor> the a sushi roll is not even remotely </connor>
<connor> like sushi come on you cannot see me </connor>
<garnt> dead in the eye </garnt>
<garnt> okay connor what you've basically said </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like is basically like oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> sweet and sour chicken is the best </joey>
<joey> chinese food </joey>
<joey> you know orange chicken </joey>
<joey> orange orange chicken is the best </joey>
<joey> chicken tikka </joey>
<joey> and listen to this [ __ ] okay i've </joey>
<garnt> had okay right i've had both both i'll </garnt>
<garnt> become an honorary italian for like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> you guys have [ __ ] pizza compared to the </connor>
<joey> americans come on </joey>
<joey> i just i just can't get over the fact </joey>
<connor> let's trace it back to </connor>
<connor> you know it's like with sushi and stuff </connor>
<joey> like that there's like a lot of the like </joey>
<joey> the sushi is not even close i don't even </joey>
<joey> think that's how is it all close it's a </joey>
<joey> same ingredient </joey>
<connor> no it's not yeah a lot of the time the </connor>
<joey> ingredients aren't even similar </joey>
<joey> everything inside of a california roll </joey>
<joey> they use in regular sushi here they look </joey>
<connor> really just not together what's in the </connor>
<connor> california room </connor>
<joey> california what are the ingredients of </joey>
<connor> california </connor>
<connor> it's salmon you sounded so confident </connor>
<joey> it's salmon cucumber yeah </joey>
<joey> well rosie </joey>
<joey> but japan has roles as well </joey>
<connor> do they really yeah no but they don't </connor>
<garnt> have the same kind of role not the same </garnt>
<joey> kind of fried [ __ ] right no no no no no </joey>
<joey> no no nothing like from what i've seen </joey>
<garnt> japan japanese rolls are just like one </garnt>
<garnt> fish in a row and that feels like that's </garnt>
<connor> it yeah right like this is a dumb </connor>
<connor> argument but i'm ready to die for it </connor>
<joey> okay that's trash taste there right yeah </joey>
<joey> okay it ain't a food </joey>
<garnt> i'm watching a man commit suicide and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like all right connor you jump </garnt>
<garnt> off the cliff </garnt>
<garnt> don't don't say i didn't try to like </garnt>
<garnt> grab you and warn you that you this is a </garnt>
<connor> cliff you're jumping off i think a lot </connor>
<connor> of the viewers will agree with me that </connor>
<connor> american pizza is better than italian </connor>
<joey> first of all we have american audience </joey>
<joey> it's yeah and it's because i guarantee </joey>
<joey> that there are more americans watching </joey>
<joey> this than italians and there are more </joey>
<joey> people who have been to america than </joey>
<joey> italy </joey>
<garnt> i've been to both </garnt>
<garnt> yes yes yes ashley yes </garnt>
<connor> california roll is not japanese yeah i </connor>
<connor> know we know yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> what are the ingredients these are the </connor>
<joey> imitation crab </joey>
<joey> which they have </joey>
<connor> which they have you'll get crab on sushi </connor>
<joey> normally though really yeah of course </joey>
<joey> you do not that often i get all the time </joey>
<connor> really well i've never seen in any sushi </connor>
<joey> train you get like the crab head in the </joey>
<connor> thing but you never get like crap you </connor>
<joey> can crab on it yeah you can really you </joey>
<garnt> ever seen this yes the man who just said </garnt>
<garnt> that meat sushi didn't exist even though </garnt>
<garnt> he's had it so you know </garnt>
<connor> to this day i still don't view it when i </connor>
<joey> go to get sushi no he's not exactly the </joey>
<joey> most reliable narrator this man </joey>
<connor> doesn't matter america pizza is better </connor>
<connor> than stone baked i'll die on the hill oh </connor>
<connor> my god this is just like uh the a bad </connor>
<connor> person making a good argument like </connor>
<connor> people just gonna disagree with me </connor>
<joey> because i'm [ __ ] dumb it's not a good </joey>
<joey> argument it's a great answer it's not a </joey>
<connor> great argument </connor>
<joey> it's quite in fact the opposite you're a </joey>
<joey> good person with a [ __ ] this is a </joey>
<connor> preferential thing i just think the </connor>
<connor> pizza is better it's not flat out not </connor>
<joey> saying okay look i'm not saying american </joey>
<garnt> pizza is bad i love this this is not </garnt>
<joey> what we are doing both pizzas are </joey>
<connor> fantastic right in their own unique </connor>
<connor> place like it is so far beyond belief to </connor>
<connor> even insist that america pizza could be </connor>
<connor> interpreted as better than stone baked </connor>
<joey> you mean like that's just a wild clay </joey>
<joey> it's not wild </joey>
<joey> people like american pizza more than </joey>
<connor> stone babies because they've never had </connor>
<joey> stone baked they have had stone bags </joey>
<joey> i remember </joey>
<joey> i want to see how many people i think </joey>
<connor> you'll be shocked by the amount of </connor>
<connor> viewers that actually think america i </connor>
<joey> want to set up how many people how many </joey>
<joey> of our viewers who have had both can </joey>
<connor> agree with you and say that the </connor>
<connor> americans your head your head's in the </connor>
<garnt> cloud would you would you say domino's </garnt>
<garnt> is better than stone bay pizza then </garnt>
<connor> in my in my mind i would rather a </connor>
<garnt> domino's pizza than stone baked pizza </garnt>
<connor> and i have seen right i remember i </connor>
<joey> remember as well i thought i felt so </joey>
<joey> gratify like like hey i'll get this man </joey>
<joey> some taste buds i felt i felt so </joey>
<joey> relieved </joey>
<joey> who's that guy who's like 1500 netflix </joey>
<joey> shows the uh i think he's a chef from uh </joey>
<joey> i think japan but he's he's american the </joey>
<joey> bearded guy yeah yeah i forgot his name </joey>
<connor> there was like one one scene right where </connor>
<connor> he was doing a whole thing about pizza </connor>
<connor> and he went around reviewing all </connor>
<connor> different types of pizza and there's one </connor>
<connor> time one scene where he's like you know </connor>
<connor> at the end of the day though there's </connor>
<joey> just something about a domino's pizza </joey>
<joey> that'll just go so hard and i was like </joey>
<joey> yes yes that's probably a reason why we </joey>
<joey> don't remember his name pretending like </joey>
<joey> domino's pizza or these like fast food </joey>
<connor> pizzas taste like [ __ ] you just clean i </connor>
<garnt> never said that we never said we never </garnt>
<joey> said that it's it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> saying a mcdonald's burger is better </joey>
<connor> than like a gourmet freshly made burger </connor>
<garnt> at a burger joint you know like yes </garnt>
<connor> there's a place for it but to to say </connor>
<connor> that is better is like i've had many </connor>
<joey> burgers where i would prefer the </joey>
<joey> mcdonald's burger over said burger well </joey>
<joey> yes of course because a lot of the time </joey>
<joey> they're just like yeah let's just get </joey>
<joey> some like good beef i should like not </joey>
<connor> consider the ratios or anything let's </connor>
<connor> put like [ __ ] let's put like 500 no no </connor>
<joey> what i'm saying what the argument we're </joey>
<joey> making is think of the best burger </joey>
<joey> you've ever had that wasn't mcdonald's </joey>
<joey> and put that next to a mcdonald's burger </joey>
<connor> which one would you like i've had a lot </connor>
<connor> of pizza uh in italy that wasn't stone </connor>
<joey> baked that i think was much better than </joey>
<joey> stone baked </joey>
<joey> there was more yeah </joey>
<garnt> i mean weird style it's like it's like </garnt>
<joey> the heaviness of it yeah stone baked </joey>
<connor> isn't the only type of pizza but to me </connor>
<joey> definitely it is like the pinnacle i i </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] i [ __ ] love stone cakes </connor>
<joey> it's the best bread and you know what </joey>
<connor> it's because it's like the best bread </connor>
<connor> the best cheese used to come from a man </connor>
<connor> who can't appreciate the crust like this </connor>
<garnt> comes from like i feel like you've </garnt>
<garnt> already tasted the pizza it's because </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] tastes like because i don't eat the </garnt>

<garnt> good stone break because it's the only </garnt>
<garnt> pizza that i eat the crust okay you have </garnt>

<connor> good chicken you don't even appreciate </connor>
<connor> bread so how can you even have an </connor>
<connor> opinion on what's better pizza like you </connor>
<connor> know what i mean like you don't have a </connor>
<garnt> coffee no no no it's it's like i don't </garnt>

<garnt> to me 90 percent of bread taste the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] same you know that's but it's </garnt>
<joey> like when i i'm afraid i don't have to </joey>
<joey> get you to stop writing you cannot say i </joey>
<joey> was on your side until you said that </joey>
<connor> that's like that's like me going bro </connor>
<connor> every [ __ ] rice and noodle is the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] same yeah like it's like that's </joey>
<joey> just yeah udon is exactly the same as </joey>
<connor> the little bro it's like no different </connor>
<connor> from instant noodles both ninety </connor>
<garnt> percent's the same okay it's like ninety </garnt>
<connor> percent of the ramen noodles i didn't </connor>
<connor> think you could be racist towards white </connor>
<connor> people but in that moment i think you </connor>
<connor> genuinely were i think that was actually </connor>
<joey> racist towards white people bro french </joey>
<joey> people clutching their baguettes right </joey>
<connor> now french bro germans are losing it </connor>
<connor> right now that's half of german food man </connor>
<connor> dude </connor>
<connor> we got to do a trash taste special we </connor>
<connor> just take gantt to a german bakery and </connor>
<connor> he just is like what the [ __ ] i don't </connor>
<connor> know you could have 15 different types </connor>
<joey> are you saying okay yeah are you saying </joey>
<joey> that a pretzel tastes the same as a </joey>
<joey> baguette </joey>
<connor> it's pretzel bread oh what's going on </connor>
<joey> this is bread </joey>
<connor> not the little [ __ ] hard like </connor>
<garnt> cookie-esque ones like like bristles a </garnt>
<connor> pretzel yeah all right i'm gonna be </connor>
<connor> honest okay what are you about to say </connor>
<joey> i'm gonna be honest </joey>
<connor> a pretzel to me is just a salted </connor>
<connor> paquette </connor>
<connor> that's what that's what it tastes like </connor>
<connor> to me </connor>
<connor> right that's that's kind of what it </connor>
<connor> tastes like to me okay </connor>
<connor> like to me to me bread </connor>
<connor> okay to me like to me i can't i can't </connor>
<connor> eat this that's how world war three </connor>
<connor> began to me i can't eat bread by itself </connor>
<garnt> a lot of times it needs to be flavored </garnt>
<garnt> okay it needs to have some butter on it </garnt>
<garnt> like for example a baguette i need some </garnt>
<garnt> butter with that baguette a lot of the </garnt>
<garnt> times okay pretzels they have salt okay </garnt>
<connor> no you can't just eat a baguette like a </connor>
<joey> good baguette with butter no just a </joey>
<garnt> bigger just eat a bite i can't [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> hear but get by itself </joey>
<garnt> that's just like you've just lost all </garnt>
<connor> your weight this episode gone you like </connor>
<connor> won the italians and then threw them </connor>
<joey> away </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] god even the attacker </joey>
<joey> even the italians are doing this right </joey>
<connor> how can you go on a european tournament </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] action </garnt>
<garnt> okay with the crust you know with the </garnt>
<garnt> crust you're not eating you know it's </garnt>
<garnt> not like you have the pizza part with </garnt>
<garnt> the cheese and you know and the toppings </garnt>
<garnt> and everything and then you have the </garnt>
<garnt> crust part right that's a very small </garnt>
<garnt> ratio to the whole pizza itself i can't </garnt>
<garnt> eat a pizza sized crust no matter how </garnt>
<connor> good like the [ __ ] stone baked crust </connor>
<joey> i can just chow down on the whole </joey>
<garnt> baguette like strawberry </garnt>
<connor> genuinely yeah i think you if you if you </connor>
<connor> had fresh bread like good bread i think </connor>
<garnt> you'd change your fresh bread is good </garnt>
<connor> but like like not like [ __ ] tesco </connor>
<garnt> bread no no no no no i've i've had fresh </garnt>
<garnt> bread but bread to me it's like fresh </garnt>
<connor> bread i'm i'm skeptical now where have </connor>
<joey> you had this fresh bread okay so you you </joey>
<joey> go you </joey>
<garnt> you had fresh bread yesterday no that </garnt>
<joey> was that was [ __ ] great could i eat </joey>
<joey> more than just the slice that we got no </joey>
<garnt> that was that was too much and with the </garnt>
<garnt> slice you know i i [ __ ] i gotta </garnt>
<joey> destroy that whole plate i cannot i </joey>
<connor> can't yeah i could have had that that's </connor>
<joey> like wait every time i go to an italian </joey>
<joey> restaurant </joey>
<connor> i've had many meals which i've enjoyed </connor>
<connor> the bread like an amount where honestly </connor>
<connor> if the rest of my food didn't come out i </connor>
<joey> would be happy every time i go to an </joey>
<joey> italian restaurant in america and they </joey>
<joey> always give you that like the plate of </joey>
<joey> bread i'm just like more i need more </joey>
<garnt> this is not gonna be enough bread to me </garnt>
<connor> is a starter it is a starter it is not </connor>
<connor> the meal you can't just have bread as a </connor>
<connor> meal this man would not know who i'm </connor>
<connor> offending with this take right now but </connor>
<joey> to me like the entire middle ages i </joey>
<joey> can't just have peasants in the 1800s </joey>
<joey> pure bread as a meal i'm pretty sure </joey>
<joey> like if you were born in the 1700s in </joey>
<joey> europe you would be so dead i didn't </joey>
<connor> think we're going to have enough </connor>
<joey> dinner </joey>
<connor> you guys made such you guys made such a </connor>
<connor> big [ __ ] deal about this pizza thing </connor>
<connor> that i didn't think was a big </connor>
<connor> deal man walks in here being like bread </connor>
<garnt> is [ __ ] okay okay like straight up like </garnt>
<connor> what like you don't even have like a </connor>
<connor> gluten allergy or something or something </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like that to like behind but i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't say bread was [ __ ] i said bread </garnt>
<connor> is not a meal he said 90 of bread and i </connor>
<connor> quote taste the same okay </connor>
<connor> okay i'm gonna go back on that statement </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> ninety percent of spread does not taste </connor>
<connor> the same how many percent huh how much </connor>
<connor> percent but i mean like 87 </connor>
<connor> with bread i can't have bread as a meal </connor>
<connor> that's like having pure rice as a meal </connor>
<connor> okay no </connor>
<joey> as an asian i can't just have rice as a </joey>
<connor> meal i know people can just have rice as </connor>
<connor> a meal but you need some stuff you need </connor>
<connor> some [ __ ] seasoning on the rice you </connor>
<joey> know you need some flavoring you need </joey>
<joey> something to go with the rice i can have </joey>
<garnt> rice as a meal yeah i know you can but i </garnt>
<garnt> know i know you can but </garnt>
<garnt> bread doesn't fill the same like role as </garnt>
<connor> rice right it literally does no it does </connor>
<joey> literally no it doesn't it doesn't yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean like i i'll completely disagree </joey>
<joey> that all bread tastes the same or </joey>
<joey> whatever but i can agree that all rice </joey>
<garnt> tastes the same yes okay i i would i </garnt>
<connor> would say most right really yeah really </connor>
<joey> that is that is there is different types </joey>
<connor> of rice yeah yeah but yeah like </connor>
<joey> obviously i can tell the difference </joey>
<joey> between like japanese rice and like </joey>
<connor> saffron but it's like rice pudding and </connor>
<connor> all that [ __ ] as well that's all </connor>
<joey> nonsense </joey>
<joey> i mean is rice pudding even rice said </joey>
<connor> that that's the point comparing the </connor>
<connor> roles that bread and rice phil is like </connor>
<connor> no it's completely different it's </connor>
<garnt> totally different i can't believe you </garnt>
<garnt> you're japanese joey you're going to say </garnt>
<garnt> that all rice tastes the same where a </garnt>
<garnt> huge part of japanese cuisine is like </garnt>
<garnt> the subtle differences in how the rice </garnt>
<garnt> tastes hey yo that's all [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> every time you go to a [ __ ] gyokan or </joey>
<joey> anything and you get like the massive </joey>
<connor> meal and they bring out the [ __ ] bowl </connor>
<joey> of rice and it's like this is the this </joey>
<connor> is the top branded rice of this </connor>
<connor> prefecture and i take a bite and i'm </connor>
<connor> like bro this tastes like you are wrong </connor>
<joey> it does not taste it tastes exactly the </joey>
<joey> same </joey>
<garnt> you're chowing down on it too [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> fast to appreciate the subtle [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> taste it's literally just carbs it's </connor>
<garnt> just that's what bread is that's what </garnt>
<garnt> bread is literally just calves it's </garnt>
<garnt> literally just carbs it's so much more </garnt>
<garnt> than that whereas rice is just pure </garnt>
<joey> starch right bread has so much more that </joey>
<joey> goes into making a good bread right </joey>
<joey> you've got all the different ingredients </joey>
<connor> anymore right rice is just like 100 </connor>
<garnt> starch right no because there is subtle </garnt>
<garnt> differences into how to cook </garnt>
<joey> but no no rice like if someone if if we </joey>
<joey> brought out two bowls of rice right and </joey>
<garnt> one was from like [ __ ] you know octa </garnt>
<garnt> prefecture </garnt>
<garnt> i could not tell you the [ __ ] no it's </garnt>
<garnt> not just about the type of rice it's how </garnt>
<garnt> you cook it as well which is why you </garnt>
<garnt> know sushi rice tastes different </garnt>
<garnt> depending on which sushi place you go to </garnt>
<garnt> because sushi rice tastes different </garnt>
<garnt> because it's got vinegar in it no but </garnt>
<garnt> that that it's cooked with vinegar it's </garnt>
<garnt> seasoned with vinegar yeah obviously </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so it's part of the cooking process </garnt>
<joey> but if </joey>
<joey> two if there was two bowls of sushi rice </joey>
<joey> one from akhtar and one from nagano you </joey>
<garnt> can't tell the difference that's like </garnt>
<garnt> saying if two pieces of bread were </garnt>
<garnt> cooked exactly the same then they you </garnt>
<garnt> know then they taste the same which they </garnt>
<garnt> would because they cooked exactly the </garnt>
<garnt> same way </garnt>
<garnt> that's </garnt>
<connor> i feel like both of these arguments are </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] stupid yeah they are </joey>
<connor> i just realized both arguments here i </connor>
<garnt> just realized i'm losing my brain </garnt>
<garnt> i'm losing my mind in this [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> conversation now </garnt>
<connor> i i think i i do agree though rice is </connor>
<connor> less uh what's the word diverse diverse </connor>
<connor> than bread like the bread has </connor>
<connor> way too many i'm saying but like my core </connor>
<garnt> argument is that i can't eat bread as a </garnt>
<garnt> meal it's the same way </garnt>
<connor> that's the same way as eating rices and </connor>
<garnt> i genuinely believe you haven't had good </garnt>
<garnt> bread like genuinely i have had good i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think you had was the bread we had </garnt>
<connor> yesterday good that was even compared to </connor>
<connor> german bread that's mid </connor>
<connor> was that was it good bread yesterday i </connor>
<connor> thought it was kind of good it was good </connor>
<connor> it was good it was good right don't get </connor>
<connor> me wrong it was good bread but i'm </connor>
<joey> telling you man i i i've been i've never </joey>
<joey> been to germany so i don't know like </joey>
<joey> yeah i spent a lot of a lot of my </joey>
<joey> childhood in germany and i can tell you </joey>
<joey> man it's [ __ ] good it's so good like </joey>
<joey> every time i go to german restaurant </joey>
<joey> it's like amazing because it's like the </joey>
<connor> only thing that germany does well right </connor>
<connor> is the three foods that german like </connor>
<joey> specialize in beer which is food there </joey>
<connor> it's not a drink it's food </connor>
<joey> you have bread and then you have meat </joey>
<garnt> like just the meat is good right </garnt>
<connor> sausages right right yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> amazing yeah right great sausages and </connor>
<connor> there's a reason why they stick to three </connor>
<connor> things because they [ __ ] do it </connor>
<connor> amazing the bread is insane everyone's </connor>
<joey> like french baguettes no french </joey>
<joey> baguettes can like [ __ ] themselves bro </joey>
<connor> german bread is like 20 000 light years </connor>
<joey> ahead right of it it's it's not even </joey>
<garnt> comparable so could you what if you </garnt>
<garnt> could have bread as a meal why don't you </garnt>
<connor> then you're saying you're on variation </connor>
<connor> right you want like different things </connor>
<connor> like if you just have bread every day </connor>
<joey> yeah you'll get bored but i can easily </joey>
<joey> have bread occasionally as a full meal </joey>
<connor> if i needed to really if i if it was </connor>
<connor> german bread yeah no qualms about it </connor>
<joey> yeah of course german bread like a fresh </joey>
<connor> pretzel yeah if you give me like three </connor>
<connor> brittles just by itself not like no no </connor>
<connor> mustard or anything give me a beer too </connor>
<garnt> give me a beer with that i need i need a </garnt>
<joey> stronger taste than just bread you know </joey>
<connor> because you haven't had good bread you </connor>
<joey> haven't had i have a good product </joey>
<connor> no matter how good the bread is i can't </connor>
<connor> eat a bread as an entirely new we're </connor>

<connor> the lasagna arc the the lasagna story </connor>
<joey> arc well it's not it's not even like a </joey>
<joey> it's like a side story now yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> after our housewarming party </joey>
<joey> um you know we we got a pretty merry and </joey>
<joey> there was one thing i had forgotten </joey>
<garnt> about japan because in my previous place </garnt>
<garnt> i lived on like a high enough floor that </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't need to worry about bugs or </garnt>
<garnt> wildlife or that kind of thing because </garnt>
<garnt> uh because you know nothing could ever </garnt>
<garnt> reach yeah reach the top floor of my </garnt>
<garnt> apartment at the time </garnt>
<garnt> so i forgot that uh japan has </garnt>
<joey> cockroaches </joey>
<garnt> right i sure do guys </garnt>
<joey> i had completely forgotten that japan </joey>
<joey> had cockroaches right and </joey>
<joey> what we found out was uh during the </joey>
<joey> party we didn't close one of like our </joey>
<joey> windows fully so the window was slightly </joey>
<connor> ajar and we had left the food out </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> um unlike in thailand where we were </connor>
<connor> taught to you know clean up everything </connor>
<connor> every day because cockroaches can come </connor>
<connor> living in a house we had forgotten that </connor>
<connor> cockroaches can come because we are </connor>
<connor> living on the bottom floor yeah where a </connor>
<connor> lot of cockroaches are unfortunately i </connor>
<connor> mean it's a pretty new house so we </connor>
<connor> didn't have any we didn't have to worry </connor>
<connor> about that before um and i didn't notice </connor>
<connor> this or i didn't know this </connor>
<connor> until me and sydney were having dinner </connor>
<connor> the next day you know we kicked a nice </connor>
<connor> meal sydney had kicked a nice meal um </connor>
<garnt> and we were enjoying this curry that she </garnt>
<garnt> had cooked and we were like chowing down </garnt>
<garnt> um and then i look over and in the </garnt>
<garnt> corner of my eye i see a black speck </garnt>
<garnt> move about right and i and i move over </garnt>
<garnt> and i look over and there's a fat </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] cockroach </joey>
<garnt> how fat are we talking it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> about it's about that size okay that's </garnt>
<joey> pretty easy that's a decent size it's </joey>
<garnt> it's a it's a decent it's a decent-sized </garnt>
<garnt> cotton crush moved in yeah i i had just </garnt>
<joey> moved in and i literally got i i i got </joey>
<joey> ptsd because if if if you don't remember </joey>
<joey> i had had a previous experience with a </joey>
<joey> cockroach in thailand the famous </joey>
<joey> cockroach yeah if uh if you want to </joey>
<joey> check that out there's a clip where i </joey>
<joey> tell the story but i i had had a </joey>
<joey> previous experience with thailand in </joey>
<joey> thailand with a cockroach um and it </joey>
<joey> wasn't a pleasant experience at all </joey>
<joey> right and i remember seeing this </joey>
<joey> cockroach and sydney was like see sydney </joey>
<joey> was like chatting away to me and uh she </joey>
<joey> was like gone </joey>
<joey> gone and i just like i was just silent i </joey>
<joey> was just staring at this cockroach </joey>
<garnt> and then she she like starts getting </garnt>
<garnt> angry go on listen to me and before and </garnt>
<garnt> she says that and then she looks over </garnt>
<garnt> and then we're just both staring in </garnt>
<garnt> silence and then and then it's as if the </garnt>
<garnt> cockroach knew that we were looking at </garnt>
<garnt> it it was it was it was flexing because </garnt>
<garnt> we lo as soon as sydney looked over it </garnt>
<garnt> just crawls away into the air </garnt>
<garnt> conditioning in one of the holes and it </garnt>
<garnt> just disappears </garnt>
<garnt> and we and me and sydney are just like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> how do we burn this entire house down we </garnt>
<garnt> can't burn this entire house down we </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] moved into this place right </garnt>
<joey> the cockroach literally did an </joey>
<joey> understandable habitat </joey>
<joey> and discovery and me and sydney were </joey>
<joey> just sitting here in silence we were </joey>
<joey> like war veterans right because we were </joey>
<joey> just like we we literally escaped again </joey>
<joey> yeah we literally escaped this country </joey>
<joey> uh we literally escaped thailand so we </joey>
<joey> didn't have to experience this again </joey>
<joey> yeah and here we are moved into our new </joey>
<garnt> place where it's we've been here for </garnt>
<garnt> like a month and we have a single </garnt>
<garnt> cockroach in our house </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] what do we do so um </garnt>
<garnt> so we sit there for about an hour being </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> well do we move out again um is is that </garnt>
<garnt> a viable option like how how what does </garnt>
<garnt> the contract say right and then </garnt>
<connor> eventually i'm just like i started going </connor>
<connor> on amazon and i buy like every cockroach </connor>
<connor> related </connor>
<connor> um products i can find in terms of like </connor>
<connor> cockroach traps cockroach sprays even </connor>
<garnt> though i've had previous experience with </garnt>
<garnt> cockroach phrase i started really never </garnt>
<connor> works i start reading </connor>
<connor> some of the [ __ ] are built like brick </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah you could put the whole thing </joey>
<joey> if terraformers have taught us anything </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] don't work yeah they are </joey>
<joey> invincible yeah so like i started doing </joey>
<joey> research about japanese cockroaches and </joey>
<joey> you know if sprays actually work or if </joey>
<joey> traps actually works because um </joey>
<connor> my experience with cockroaches in </connor>
<connor> thailand is that sprays don't work at </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] all and uh it can actually make </connor>
<connor> the situation worse yeah um and just </connor>
<joey> like scream yeah they just they just </joey>
<joey> scream they're gonna go in </joey>
<joey> yeah and so that was so i order </joey>
<joey> everything and i just try to forget </joey>
<joey> about the cockroach but like but like </joey>
<joey> that night me and sydney slept with like </joey>
<connor> one eye open like we could we couldn't </connor>
<joey> sleep that night because we were just </joey>
<connor> like how can we sleep knowing that there </connor>
<connor> is a [ __ ] cockroach </connor>
<connor> downstairs you know what what happens if </connor>
<connor> i go to the toilet and i see it or i </connor>
<connor> just hear it scuffling about you know </connor>
<connor> like so dark yeah so in the dark so </connor>
<connor> so uh we finally go to sleep and then </connor>
<connor> first thing in the morning i go </connor>
<connor> downstairs to go to my office because my </connor>
<connor> office is on the bottom floor and my </connor>
<connor> living room dining room is on the second </connor>
<connor> floor </connor>
<connor> um and i go downstairs and what do i see </connor>
<connor> it's the [ __ ] it's right in the center </connor>
<connor> of my living room it's got a lot of </connor>
<connor> balls </connor>
<connor> it has got a lot of balls right on the </connor>
<connor> kitchen and i [ __ ] freeze up i'm just </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> how do i get rid of this cockroach what </connor>
<connor> would i do now i don't have my spray i </connor>
<connor> don't like i don't know i'm kind of </connor>
<connor> scared that it's just gonna like run off </connor>
<connor> maybe it's gonna fly and like like me in </connor>
<connor> the face again like maybe it's going to </connor>
<connor> be my similar experience to what </connor>
<connor> happened in thailand yeah i'm getting </connor>
<connor> out the shoes yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm getting it yeah and i and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like i don't understand </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm like i'm like looking around </connor>
<connor> what do i do do i do i try and kill it </connor>
<connor> do i chase it away what do i do and then </connor>
<connor> i like trying to like ninja my way down </connor>
<connor> right and as soon as i try to do that it </connor>
<connor> sees me and then it starts running right </connor>
<connor> it starts running and then i look at it </connor>
<connor> and i realize wait a minute this is it's </connor>
<connor> running so [ __ ] slowly because my my </connor>
<connor> experience was with thailand cockroaches </connor>
<connor> is that like they're like [ __ ] sonic </connor>
<connor> they're like [ __ ] like speedy </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] this cockroach is running </connor>
<connor> at full speed and it was just running </connor>
<connor> like this </connor>
<connor> and i'm like and and then and then i </connor>
<connor> like i corner it so it runs the other </connor>
<connor> way because i'm still afraid that he can </connor>
<connor> fly and i chase it towards the stairs </connor>
<connor> right and i assume that it's just gonna </connor>
<connor> get to the stairs and fly off it it goes </connor>
<connor> to the edge of the stairs right and this </connor>
<connor> stupid [ __ ] right it it tries to </connor>
<connor> go on the side of the stairs and it just </connor>
<connor> drops </connor>
<connor> right it just drops right and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like wait a minute these [ __ ] can't </connor>
<connor> fly </connor>
<connor> they can't fly and they're slow as [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> and then suddenly i'm like i'm starting </joey>
<joey> to feel myself i'm like all right all </joey>
<joey> right maybe i got a chance here maybe i </joey>
<joey> don't need the cockroach spray i can get </joey>
<joey> rid of this by myself so eventually like </joey>
<joey> this the cockroach right now is on the </joey>
<joey> bottom floor so it's like it just it's </joey>
<joey> it's not even flying it didn't even like </joey>
<joey> fly down it just like it just walked to </joey>
<joey> the edge of the stairs stumbled down </joey>
<joey> like landed on his back </joey>
<joey> like uh went downstairs and they kept </joey>
<joey> going downstairs so </joey>
<connor> i run down the stairs and i go into my </connor>
<connor> office and i try to grab the closest </connor>
<connor> thing i could find to like [ __ ] slam </connor>
<connor> this thing right and so by the closest </connor>
<connor> thing i could find in this rush happened </connor>
<garnt> to be </garnt>
<garnt> a mouse pad </garnt>
<garnt> a booby mouse pad right </garnt>
<connor> what is that gonna do why i don't you </connor>
<connor> literally could have got anything else i </connor>
<joey> think your fist would have been more of </joey>
<garnt> like yeah okay because i did i didn't i </garnt>
<connor> didn't want to i didn't want to like i </connor>
<joey> didn't want to stain myself okay so </joey>
<joey> there's going to stay in the booby mouth </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah okay we used to crying right </joey>
<garnt> it was the it was the fastest thing i </garnt>
<joey> could find in the rush </joey>
<connor> this thing you can find do you guys </connor>
<joey> because i was looking for something like </joey>
<joey> a shoe or something but everything in my </joey>
<joey> office like i can't i can't grab it is </joey>
<garnt> it in your office right next to where </garnt>
<garnt> you keep your shoes </garnt>
<garnt> um so my shoes were like in the cupboard </garnt>
<joey> right so about the slam dunk shoes </joey>
<joey> usually </joey>
<joey> i am not </joey>
<joey> so like most of the things in my office </joey>
<joey> like figures or most of the things i see </joey>
<joey> like figures or like glass or like like </joey>
<joey> solid [ __ ] so the only thing that was </joey>
<connor> like i felt that you know was close the </connor>
<joey> closest nasty city yeah elasticity the </joey>
<connor> best thing i could like slam this thing </connor>
<garnt> without having to worry about it </garnt>
<garnt> breaking happened to be the booby </garnt>
<joey> mousepad right </joey>
<connor> why was that i wasn't thinking okay </connor>
<joey> there's nothing else in your room is </joey>
<joey> this the domestic girlfriend one that </joey>
<connor> you got yeah oh no </connor>
<connor> okay so this is my [ __ ] signed piece </connor>
<garnt> of memorabilia it wasn't signed it </garnt>
<joey> wasn't signed i i have my signed piece </joey>
<joey> of memory it was the worst girl yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so so okay so this was just like i </joey>
<joey> explained this like i thought about this </joey>
<joey> consciously no i just ran in my room </joey>
<joey> just like grabs grab this mouse pad that </joey>
<joey> was the closest thing and just ran back </joey>
<joey> out and um by instinct or maybe not by </joey>
<joey> instinct so i grabbed like the booby </joey>
<joey> side of things right </joey>
<joey> i grabbed the tit side of things right </joey>
<connor> and but like this this mouse pad it's </connor>
<connor> like you've you felt like a blue mouse </connor>
<connor> pad it's flimsy but it still has like </connor>
<joey> some weight to it right so it's not </joey>
<joey> exactly like it's i'm hitting it with </joey>
<garnt> paper it has like a little bit of weight </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like it's like it's like </garnt>
<connor> slapping someone like that i failed to </connor>
<connor> see how you you picked this up you're </connor>
<connor> like yes this </connor>
<connor> is </connor>
<joey> dancing like the [ __ ] gladiator </joey>
<joey> stadium like gonz you may choose a </joey>
<connor> weapon of your choice picks up a rock </connor>
<joey> picks up the booby mouse pad i'm ready </joey>
<garnt> look i had picked it up i had committed </garnt>
<joey> to whip because i was scared that i </joey>
<joey> would run back out and the cockroach </joey>
<joey> would be gone right but i thankfully i </joey>
<joey> ran back out it was still there i'm like </joey>
<garnt> great i [ __ ] wham it once okay we're </garnt>
<garnt> at full strength slap it doesn't do </garnt>
<joey> anything yeah yeah yeah yeah you hit it </joey>
<garnt> with makes it like an air cannon yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> i so so i'm just like whammy ones didn't </garnt>
<garnt> work whammy twice didn't work so i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't like like </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] quentin tarantino scene honestly </connor>
<garnt> it was it was like you know it was like </garnt>
<garnt> a scene from a gangster movie or </garnt>
<garnt> something he said like i don't have a </garnt>
<garnt> hammer i'm not bashing someone's head in </garnt>
<garnt> i'm bashing this [ __ ] cockroach in </garnt>
<garnt> with like with a movie booby mousepad </garnt>
<connor> and like this thing okay so i hit it it </connor>
<connor> it like falls over runs back again </connor>
<connor> flips over runs back again </connor>
<connor> but like after after about after about </connor>
<connor> five slams it starts slowing down this </connor>
<joey> thing was like [ __ ] boss battle yeah </joey>
<connor> it had like a [ __ ] health bar right </connor>
<connor> but like i could see his health bar like </connor>
<joey> he's whistling down right sydney's like </joey>
<joey> gone what's going on god i don't say </joey>
<joey> anything i need to concentrate on </joey>
<joey> keeping silence </joey>

<joey> hear is the [ __ ] dark souls boss </joey>
<connor> battle music i like i like i go for it </connor>
<connor> for another like three times it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like crawling now but i still can't </connor>
<connor> i still can't do the finishing like the </connor>
<connor> i can't i still can't deal the finishing </connor>
<garnt> blow so i'm just like finally after it </garnt>
<garnt> starts crawling i start using my head </garnt>
<joey> i'm like wait a minute this isn't the </joey>
<joey> heavy side i thought you made like </joey>

<joey> he went from dual blade to a broad suit </joey>
<connor> i don't know if you're framing this </connor>
<connor> story like some kind of victory it </connor>
<connor> sounds like the most pathetic thing i've </connor>
<garnt> ever heard </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<connor> when it's like when i saw it belly up </connor>
<joey> right i literally was like panting right </joey>
<connor> that's the soft spot </connor>
<joey> i was like ah </joey>
<garnt> sydney runs down right she's like </garnt>
<garnt> panicking because she thought i just </garnt>
<garnt> fell down the [ __ ] stairs or </garnt>
<garnt> something because she all she heard was </garnt>
<garnt> like wham wham and me just like heavy </garnt>
<connor> breathing and </connor>
<connor> all sydney witnesses it's just me </connor>
<connor> standing over the standing over the dead </connor>
<connor> corpse of this cockroach with like a </connor>
<connor> booby mouse pad in her in hand and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> in my mind i was like do you see what </connor>
<connor> you get </connor>

<connor> this [ __ ] up there's so much crap the </connor>
<joey> only place actually that i get pigeons </joey>
<joey> is the window in my office which is like </joey>
<connor> on the edge of the building i think </connor>
<connor> because there's like it my balcony is </connor>
<joey> like in wood so it's like there's no </joey>
<joey> like wind or anything right right i </joey>

<connor> dead as soon as it goes outside that's a </connor>
<connor> pro right there as soon as it goes </connor>

<joey> a bit that's when stuff crusts i don't </joey>
<joey> like starch why is it what is it like </joey>
<connor> outside well normally sometimes it's </connor>
<connor> inside but i like it i think it's good </connor>

<joey> how you normally would and then when you </joey>
<joey> get to the cross just like leave a </joey>
<connor> little bit of the pizza yeah and then </connor>
<connor> just go from the side john's like left </connor>
<connor> on his pizza can you please oh we did it </connor>
<garnt> later i died [ __ ] you </garnt>

<joey> pizza for america i'm not that hungry </joey>
<joey> i'll be what am i american </joey>
<connor> i'm not american but god damn sometimes </connor>
<connor> i wish i was maybe that's why i'm so </connor>
<connor> angry about them all the time because i </connor>
<connor> i just want to be an american maybe </connor>
<joey> i wish he was angry at something he </joey>
<joey> can't be i just i wish i could be </joey>
<connor> american honest opinion well it's an </connor>
<joey> option i mean it's fine it's with dip </joey>
<joey> it's way better like maybe </joey>
<connor> when you get some dip on it man it's it </connor>
<joey> oh yeah is it optional </joey>
<joey> if you put something like if you put </joey>
<connor> some ranch on that [ __ ] oh my god bro </connor>
<garnt> it's different oh </garnt>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<connor> no i'd rather cheese in a crust okay </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<garnt> i would i would prefer cheese in the </garnt>
<connor> crust as well it's like you get a pizza </connor>
<joey> and then at the end you're like oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you get like a little meal at the end </joey>
<joey> yeah okay </joey>
<joey> i like it i like it i never i'd never go </joey>
<joey> to a restaurant and look look a waiter </joey>
<connor> in the eye and be like can i have the </connor>
<connor> option with the hot dog in the class but </connor>
<connor> if i can if i can call up a pizza place </connor>
<connor> and tell them hey can you send it with </connor>
<garnt> the cr for some reason </garnt>
<joey> i think i've figured out your taste </joey>
<joey> which is you need some like variety in </joey>
<joey> it you can't just have like even if </joey>
<garnt> something tastes amazing you can't just </garnt>
<connor> have that same thing no i mean i i can </connor>
<connor> eat bread like straight up just say that </connor>
<garnt> except for bread apparently yeah it's </garnt>
<joey> it's like two ends of the spectrum </joey>
<joey> there's either no variety or too much </joey>
<connor> variety this is what half and half is </connor>
<garnt> amazing as well like i love half and </garnt>
<garnt> half like who doesn't want half and half </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know one half i don't like half </garnt>
<connor> and half i don't like why would you not </connor>
<connor> want like two different flavors because </connor>
<garnt> because because why not why not just </garnt>
<connor> order the superior flavor yeah and just </connor>
<connor> stick on the two flavors are amazing and </connor>
<garnt> i want to experience both </garnt>
<garnt> one one flavor is always the best so i </garnt>
<joey> ordered that flavor yeah and that's all </joey>
<joey> i need because </joey>
<joey> i agree because because like because if </joey>
<joey> you have half an hour half and half </joey>
<garnt> never very rarely </garnt>
<garnt> never by choice it's always at a party </garnt>
<connor> right because you need variety at a </connor>
<connor> party right yeah but like i often find </connor>
<connor> that halfway through a pizza especially </connor>
<joey> a heavy one i kind of need something </joey>
<joey> else to kind of mix it up so that i'm </joey>
<joey> not tasting just the same same same same </joey>
<joey> thing but that's what dip is for right </joey>
<joey> yeah well different i mean i love dip </joey>
<joey> too when i have pizza i want like every </joey>
<connor> dip on the table like yeah and i'm like </connor>
<garnt> dunk dunk exactly well for me if i have </garnt>
<garnt> the same thing but it's an amazing same </garnt>
<garnt> thing then i can just eat that endlessly </garnt>
<connor> until i'm sure but because pizza is like </connor>
<garnt> that style of pizza we just had is quite </garnt>
<garnt> heavy like getting four or five slices </garnt>
<connor> of that in you're like all right i need </connor>
<garnt> a chicken no it's not </garnt>
<connor> stone babies yeah yeah yeah but i'm not </connor>
<connor> i'm not saying that stone baked is is </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> better it's like god was waiting for him </joey>
<joey> now is the time to strike that's right </joey>
<joey> if you fold up a stone baked pizza into </joey>
<joey> one into like one little ball it's like </joey>
<joey> one slice of a normal american pizza and </joey>
<joey> dinner what </joey>
<joey> do you fold up your pizza into a bowl </joey>
<connor> yo could we do that can we roll up a </connor>
<connor> stone-baked pizza into a bowl and just </connor>
<connor> like take a bite out of it it's like </connor>
<joey> kind of wrap it around yeah yeah it's </joey>
<joey> just like turning it's like a dim sum </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah like a dim sum yeah it's like </connor>
<garnt> wrapping it around </garnt>
<connor> i think </connor>
<joey> i'm like i'm just speechless i think i </joey>
<garnt> actually got the italian mafia on me for </garnt>
<connor> saying that you just lost any right to </connor>
<garnt> go to italy yeah i can't i think we've </garnt>
<garnt> all lost some sort of right to some sort </garnt>
<joey> of uh </joey>
<garnt> i mean yes you have yeah yes you are </garnt>
<joey> yeah you have definitely really just i'm </joey>
<garnt> pretty sure you just declared war </garnt>
<connor> against italy i'm i'm willing to give </connor>
<connor> credit where credit to italy you know </connor>
<joey> create a way credit is due to italy like </joey>
<joey> like they were the ones that kind of </joey>
<joey> came in and was like you guys have it </joey>
<joey> good </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> british man </joey>
<joey> all right hear me out right </joey>
<joey> let me out here the italians are gone </joey>
<joey> coffee they're doing that right </joey>
<connor> they got something right you know </connor>
<connor> pasta all right they got that on </connor>
<connor> lockdown no no one can even pretend to </connor>
<joey> have like any claim over here </joey>
<joey> okay yeah so like okay for example right </joey>
<joey> like american pasta is like a little bit </joey>
<joey> different to like the standard italian </joey>
<connor> pasta right italian pasta is like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] drenched in uh sorry uh um </connor>
<joey> american is like [ __ ] heavy it's like </joey>
<joey> so much sauce like that's a lot of oil </joey>
<connor> yeah okay i don't [ __ ] with that that's </connor>
<joey> just too much yeah it has a time in </joey>
<joey> place yeah yeah like like a magiano's is </joey>
<joey> like every now and then i'll go there if </joey>
<joey> i want to feel like i want to destroy my </joey>
<connor> stomach yeah like i understand how olive </connor>
<connor> garden can do like bottomless of stuff </connor>
<connor> like oh it's the way they do bottomless </connor>
<connor> bread down there yeah it's bottomless </connor>
<joey> breast sticks yeah that's true which is </joey>
<joey> like the bird sticks aren't even that </joey>
<joey> good </joey>
<joey> it's like i don't want bottomless or </joey>
<garnt> something that's mid would you have a </garnt>
<joey> entire an entire meal of breadsticks it </joey>
<connor> depends how good the best breadsticks </connor>
<connor> are good </connor>
<joey> not all of garden bread sticks though no </joey>
<connor> that's just like bread flavored </connor>
<joey> cardboard </joey>
<garnt> sorry i'll have gone but </garnt>
<connor> i'm just i'm just wondering when we </connor>
<connor> ordered um we ordered uh it was napoleon </connor>
<joey> style pizza from around uh not too far </joey>
<joey> away there's a few chains of them around </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> and it was awful oh yeah yeah really </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] it wasn't that great they're so bad </joey>
<joey> yeah well i mean it's japan right and i </joey>
<connor> don't even know that i was going for </connor>
<connor> like that was going for like stone baked </connor>
<connor> but not stone baked that was a really </connor>
<connor> weird hybrid remember that it was like </connor>
<joey> it looked like it looked like a stone </joey>
<connor> bake but it didn't taste like it was </connor>
<connor> actually yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like it looks stone-baked </joey>
<joey> but here's an oven </joey>
<connor> a lot of pizzas i find don't have a very </connor>
<joey> discernible cheesy taste and i l i want </joey>
<joey> to be able to taste the cheese right </joey>
<joey> yeah same that like a lot of pizzas </joey>
<joey> either either because that's also when </joey>
<joey> you put too much topping on the pizza </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah like you can't taste anything </joey>
<garnt> because you taste like meat </garnt>
<joey> it's too much i need to taste all the </joey>
<connor> flavors in unison yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> so like </garnt>
<connor> there needs to be like a right ratio of </connor>
<connor> like crust yeah sauce and cheese and </connor>
<connor> toppings as well yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> otherwise otherwise </connor>
<connor> there are some pizzas i see where like </connor>
<garnt> it's basically just you know cheesy </garnt>
<garnt> bread and </garnt>
<garnt> i know that's a type of pizza i'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> get a pizza that's just cheese right oh </garnt>
<garnt> and you can also get margaritas and </garnt>
<garnt> cheese pizza yeah which is just which is </garnt>
<garnt> just uh sauce yeah cheese yeah yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> don't understand the [ __ ] with that yeah </garnt>
<connor> i don't [ __ ] with that i don't get that </connor>
<joey> i guess that's if you're like i want to </joey>
<joey> have a pizza but i don't i don't feel </joey>
<joey> too bad about it it's like the people </joey>
<connor> who get a pizza and they just scrape the </connor>
<joey> toppings off right now </joey>
<joey> actually i'm like what happened to you </joey>
<garnt> in your childhood yeah just get a pasta </garnt>
<garnt> see if sydney does that i die a bit </garnt>
<garnt> inside every time i see you just like </garnt>
<connor> dunk your bread in some pasta sauce like </connor>
<garnt> just bring like </garnt>
<joey> just bring like a [ __ ] pasta like one </joey>
<joey> of those sauce pots with you like </joey>
<joey> why ruin some pizza like don't do that </joey>
<connor> this is not how i intended the new year </connor>
<connor> for to start by the way i did not think </connor>
<joey> i'd be honest i i intended to start this </joey>
<joey> like it's not trash taste without an </joey>
<joey> argument about food like i i don't know </joey>
<joey> who had the most clown opinion this </joey>
<joey> episode </joey>
<connor> no 90 percent of bread taste the same </connor>
<garnt> all rice tastes the same bro come on </garnt>
<garnt> italian pizza american american pizza </garnt>
<joey> everyone was a clown today ladies and </joey>
<connor> gentlemen </connor>
<connor> was a clown i'm glad we called this </connor>
<joey> trash taste it shields us from a lot of </joey>
<connor> criticism oh yeah let's just say that </connor>
<joey> yes because we say something </joey>
<joey> you can say all you want guys but we're </joey>
<joey> trash days </joey>
<joey> what did you expect i i like how we made </joey>
<garnt> the name in preparation of us having </garnt>
<garnt> like shitty anime takes and like none of </garnt>
<connor> us intended to ever talk about food </connor>
<connor> online right everyone is so scared to </connor>
<connor> give their like genuine opinions on </connor>
<connor> stuff yeah </connor>
<connor> like i'm talking like not just like </connor>
<connor> politics and all that yeah [ __ ] whatever </connor>
<joey> i don't give a [ __ ] about like </joey>
<connor> unimportant tell me your weird food </connor>
<connor> taste that you have that is really </connor>
<garnt> honestly it's quite bizarre but you die </garnt>
<garnt> by it like like everyone has these </garnt>
<connor> things yeah everyone everyone has a </connor>
<garnt> weird taste because they were they were </garnt>
<connor> you know brought up in a certain way or </connor>
<garnt> they're not so familiar with a certain </garnt>
<garnt> type of cuisine or you know sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> taste buds don't always make sense you </garnt>
<garnt> can't have there's no there's no such </garnt>
<garnt> such thing as objective taste buds one </garnt>
<connor> of my favorite dishes as a child that's </connor>
<connor> the most british thing i'm about to say </connor>
<connor> okay my mum would just make mashed </connor>
<connor> potatoes and spam </connor>
<connor> just mashed potato in the spam and then </connor>
<connor> just mash it all up and just give it to </connor>
<connor> me that's it like the whole place should </connor>
<joey> that be fair it does </joey>
<connor> sound like oh it could be good but </connor>
<joey> that's really [ __ ] i don't think i </joey>
<joey> could eat that like repeatedly i can </joey>
<garnt> well yeah of course you can it sounds </garnt>
<garnt> like something where if you didn't eat </garnt>
<joey> it as a kid but you wouldn't like maybe </joey>
<joey> she couldn't eat that just </joey>
<joey> the only reason i like is because i had </joey>
<joey> it since i was a baby </joey>
<connor> can you convince kids to like any food </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> i believe you can how do they convince </garnt>
<connor> you to like natto but they can't </connor>
<connor> convince kids to like broccoli and stuff </connor>
<joey> and because the people who don't like </joey>
<joey> broccoli are babies they are they are </joey>
<joey> actually absolutely yeah they're </joey>
<joey> actually babies </joey>
<joey> how can babies like natto i don't know i </joey>
<joey> i like it maybe honey you know what it </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<connor> big brain what kids love slime </connor>
<joey> kids [ __ ] love slime think about it </joey>
<joey> think about it yeah every single youtube </joey>
<joey> channel for kids is slime i mean </joey>
<joey> it's a conspiracy i'm getting the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] red bull bro that's why kids in </connor>
<garnt> japan that's why they love nacho because </garnt>
<joey> it's slime i mean baby food no it's it's </joey>
<joey> it's not so is baby food with beans in </joey>
<garnt> it it's slime look but like yes he's </garnt>
<connor> always the slime right in front of us </connor>
<joey> this whole time right under our nose </joey>
<garnt> like maybe </garnt>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> broccoli or were we talking about </connor>
<connor> broccoli yeah yeah maybe broccoli just </connor>
<garnt> doesn't taste good as like the main part </garnt>
<joey> of the world the case with broccoli </joey>
<joey> isn't it the fact that like because kids </joey>
<garnt> taste buds are more receptive to like </garnt>
<garnt> bitter flavors </garnt>
<joey> as an adult and then and then as you get </joey>
<garnt> you like broccoli yeah i love broccoli </garnt>
<joey> do you like do you like i like broccoli </joey>
<garnt> i love i love broccoli you give me like </garnt>
<garnt> a plate of broccoli and i put some mayo </garnt>
<joey> on that [ __ ] and i can just eat it white </joey>
<joey> white </joey>
<connor> wait you didn't have broccoli </connor>
<joey> to be like controversial i thought this </joey>
<connor> was like normal </connor>
<connor> you just said that like it was like bro </connor>
<connor> i just like i just like grabbed the poop </connor>
<joey> out of the toilet just grab it i </joey>
<joey> actually eat it </joey>
<joey> it's good </joey>
<connor> try it </connor>
<connor> get some get them down to try this get </connor>
<connor> some like steamed broccoli right let's </connor>
<connor> get some cupid mayonnaise and then dip </connor>
<connor> it wait wait it's very common in japan </connor>
<connor> okay okay here's why i i recoiled for a </connor>
<connor> moment i had an image of you with a bowl </connor>
<connor> of broccoli and just pouring a bunch of </connor>
<connor> mayo but i've ordered from that chicken </connor>
<connor> and broccoli place it's all over japan </connor>
<connor> yeah it literally gives you it's awful </connor>
<connor> it's so bad it's like non-seasoned </connor>
<connor> boiled chicken right boiled broccoli </connor>
<joey> yeah and it's all prepared so they just </joey>
<joey> heat it up and send it to you yeah and </joey>
<joey> they charge you like 30 bucks yeah but </joey>
<joey> one of the dips they give you is low </joey>
<connor> calorie mayonnaise yeah i got to tell </connor>
<joey> you it goes hard doesn't it yeah </joey>
<joey> actually it's actually good like i just </joey>
<connor> realized i love yeah it's yeah you know </connor>
<joey> what actually friendship again yeah </joey>
<joey> thank you thank you that's good </joey>
<garnt> exactly attained once again i think </garnt>
<connor> god's the weird one yeah he definitely </connor>
<garnt> yeah have you had it huh we should have </garnt>
<connor> it well no he doesn't like condiments i </connor>
<garnt> will say </garnt>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> no i i [ __ ] hate mayo normally but </joey>
<joey> living in japan keeping me alright well </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] keeping mayo [ __ ] is </joey>
<garnt> amazing yeah and like it's me it's </garnt>
<garnt> because i've just had shitty mayo my </garnt>
<garnt> entire life what do you put it on what </garnt>
<garnt> do you what do you mail with so whenever </garnt>
<joey> it's in a sandwich right yeah yeah okay </joey>
<connor> next time you ever have steamed i feel </connor>
<connor> like i'm asking mark zuckerberg what is </connor>
<connor> being happy like uh in a sandwich </connor>
<connor> initiate happy process </connor>
<connor> no okay next time you have chicken and </connor>
<connor> broccoli just get some cupid mayo and </connor>
<joey> just like don't even have to drench that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] just like a little bit is enough </joey>
<joey> because the mayo is already powerful </joey>
<connor> right you have a flavor just a little </connor>
<connor> bit wait wait wait when we get uh fried </connor>
<garnt> chicken do you not like it with mayo </garnt>
<garnt> no because i like the taste of fried </garnt>
<connor> chicken </connor>
<connor> i mean i was really good at like uh kind </connor>
<joey> of combating the oiliness of it and then </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah somehow that's why a lot of like </joey>
<connor> another oily heavy liquid yeah </connor>
<joey> kind of mitigates yeah that's why like </joey>
<joey> with karaoke for example you always dip </joey>
<garnt> it in mayo all right </garnt>
<garnt> i don't because just because i like the </garnt>
<joey> taste of fried chicken oh with the mayo </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] it's kind of nice it's </joey>
<garnt> amazing i don't know there are some </garnt>
<garnt> things where i i said i just like if </garnt>
<joey> it's seasoned correctly then i i enjoy </joey>
<joey> that right because then then i enjoy the </joey>
<joey> taste of the seasoning rather than the </joey>
<garnt> taste of the condiments you can't expect </garnt>
<joey> but it's like it's like it's like you </joey>
<joey> have i'll have some of the chicken on </joey>
<joey> its own yeah i also have some of it with </joey>
<joey> the mess yeah just </joey>
<garnt> try it out all right i did it </garnt>
<garnt> in the palette like i've said if </garnt>
<garnt> something tastes [ __ ] good i can eat </garnt>
<garnt> that thing infinitely that's like what </garnt>
<garnt> children do yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah sorry my taste buds actually work </garnt>
<connor> on her so no no no no i would argue they </connor>
<connor> don't work because you're able to eat </connor>
<garnt> the same thing over and over again </garnt>
<garnt> if it's good not if it's bad if if </garnt>
<garnt> something tastes good </garnt>
<connor> you can't eat it over and over again eat </connor>
<garnt> every day i can't i can't just go back </garnt>
<garnt> to it like you know so how like why do </garnt>
<garnt> you think it's so easy for me to eat </garnt>
<joey> like i can easily eat the same meal </joey>
<joey> every day right now i'm like eating a </joey>
<garnt> salad every day and it's fine it's </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] easy because salad tastes great </joey>
<joey> and like salad is like inoffensive it's </joey>
<joey> like it's like it's like saying oh i can </joey>
<garnt> have water every day </garnt>
<garnt> i do have water every day </garnt>
<connor> i'm not gonna lie i'm not really on </connor>
<connor> board with that argument i'm gonna </connor>
<joey> distance myself from that argument </joey>
<joey> that's this [ __ ] salad you know you </joey>
<joey> can't expect like the most like </joey>
<connor> grandiose like combination of flavors </connor>
<joey> unless you like drench that [ __ ] in </joey>
<joey> dressing well i mean i mean </joey>
<connor> other than that it's just like standard </connor>
<connor> vegetables i can eat the thing is i can </connor>
<connor> eat like some foods </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> i i found this salad place and i really </connor>
<connor> liked it and i ordered it like maybe 10 </connor>
<connor> days in a row i want to say the salad </connor>
<connor> and then now for some reason when i try </connor>
<connor> and eat it i know it's really good but i </connor>
<connor> just don't like it anymore why is that </connor>
<joey> because you got you got bored of it yeah </joey>
<joey> but isn't that sad well that's why you </joey>
<joey> don't eat the same thing every [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> day you're so damn good if it's </joey>
<joey> something that i [ __ ] love i </joey>
<joey> purposely try not to eat it often but </joey>
<connor> the reason i think the reason why i went </connor>
<connor> because there's nothing because there's </connor>
<joey> nothing because there's nothing that </joey>
<joey> terrifies me more than one day </joey>
<joey> sitting in front of my favorite meal </joey>
<joey> having a bite and going [ __ ] it doesn't </joey>
<connor> taste as good i just i i just i the </connor>
<connor> reason why right here's why his wife </connor>
<joey> okay if it was a pizza i wouldn't do it </joey>
<joey> every day you know why pizza is bad for </joey>
<joey> you oh yeah salad's good for you so i </joey>
<connor> was like don't mind if i do round eight </connor>
<connor> okay and then yeah i got bored of it and </connor>
<connor> i regret it because now i have a harder </connor>
<connor> time fighting healthier food that i like </connor>
<connor> eating so i really [ __ ] myself over </connor>
<joey> yeah that's like that's that's the real </joey>
<joey> problem when you can't have a salad </joey>
<connor> anymore </connor>
<garnt> well that one type of salad that one </garnt>
<joey> type of thing because because like my </joey>
<joey> biggest issue is that you know i have to </joey>
<joey> force myself to have a balanced diet </joey>
