<garnt> - Question for you, Connor, </garnt>
<garnt> have you noticed that since you moved to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> you just start bowing for everything? </garnt>
<connor> - No, but you know what I do do? </connor>
<garnt> I do one of anime reaction noises. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I do the same thing as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you put a thing, what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> That's weird as fuck, Connor. </garnt>
<connor> Why would you do that? </connor>
<connor> - Like a, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, okay this is why I make so much sense now, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause whenever they ask me </connor>
<connor> for like anything at the supermarket </connor>
<connor> I'm like caught off guard, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It makes total sense while I do it in anime now. </connor>
<connor> - No, because I've noticed when Japanese people </connor>
<joey> when you're talking to them </joey>
<joey> they need to make it known that they're listening. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - In England, people kind of just stand there or just nod. </connor>
<connor> Japanese like hi, hi. </connor>
<connor> And I've started doing the same thing as well. </connor>
<joey> Whenever someone is talking </joey>
<garnt> I'm always having to make it known that- </garnt>
<joey> - I do that in interviews and people like, </joey>
<joey> "Can't you just shut up for five seconds? </joey>
<connor> And just let the other person talk?" </connor>
<joey> But I have to. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> Damn. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I guess we're putting that at the beginning. </connor>
<connor> - And that's the intro, go and take it away, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Take it away. </connor>
<connor> (soft music) </connor>
<joey> - What's up you naughty Neanderthals. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<joey> I am not gonna stop doing this. </joey>
<connor> - How long were you sitting on that for? </connor>
<connor> Was that like- </connor>
<connor> - Like two seconds. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I bet you have a fucking script </garnt>
<garnt> or just go through the alphabet. </garnt>
<joey> - Excel sheet. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, I'm like I have to make an alliteration somehow. </joey>
<connor> So let's just pick a letter </connor>
<connor> and just roll with it. </connor>
<connor> Well, welcome to Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> the show where we talk </connor>
<joey> about a trash taste and everything else in the world. </joey>
<joey> I'm your host for today, Joey, </joey>
<joey> And as always I'm with Garnt and Connor. </joey>
<joey> - We were doing this now. </joey>
<joey> We're probably doing this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. </joey>
<joey> So, this episode I thought we would </joey>
<joey> maybe talk about something, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it's gonna get a little too personal. </joey>
<garnt> We'll try not to go too personal route, </garnt>
<garnt> but to go back to the whole thing </garnt>
<garnt> about how we first started talking about anime </garnt>
<garnt> and how we got into anime. </garnt>
<garnt> We've already done that episode on that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we've already done our origin story. </garnt>
<garnt> - But how did we meet? </garnt>
<joey> Or how did we make our first, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how to say it, anime friend? </joey>
<joey> Is that a thing? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, so I have a question for you guys. </garnt>
<joey> Okay, to start this off because we talked about </joey>
<joey> our anime origin story </joey>
<garnt> like how we got into anime, </garnt>
<joey> but when you guys were anime fans, </joey>
<joey> did you have any friends in school or anything? </joey>
<joey> Or how did you guys deal with that? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was a cluster anime fan. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was a complete cluster anime fan. </connor>
<joey> - For all of school? </joey>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's a British thing though. </connor>
<connor> Like I got rinsed for playing video games. </connor>
<joey> So imagine if I came out and was like this. </joey>
<joey> I like this, </joey>
<joey> - I like anime too. </joey>
<joey> - This is my new thing now. </joey>
<connor> - It like those drawn. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, can you believe I got mocked </connor>
<connor> for playing video games in school? </connor>
<connor> And now it's just like the accepted past time. </connor>
<connor> I got so much shit for that. </connor>
<joey> - That's weird because in my school, </joey>
<joey> video games were quite normalized. </joey>
<joey> Or was it just your school maybe? </joey>
<garnt> - Did you? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, I got rinsed in my school as well. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Unless you're playing FIFA or chords- </connor>
<connor> - Which I was and I still got rinsed. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - I would be sitting in my room in university </connor>
<joey> playing some GRPG hoping that nobody opens the door </joey>
<joey> to discover the fact that I was playing GRPG </joey>
<garnt> not any other kind of a game. </garnt>
<connor> - I think if I come out saying that </connor>
<connor> I was a massive GRPG fan where I was you </connor>
<connor> playing Persona 3 or something. </connor>
<joey> Then I probably would've gotten beaten up as well, but- </joey>
<connor> - I got so much shit for playing RuneScape. </connor>
<joey> And I still, to this day- </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I think I love RuneScape. </joey>
<joey> I remember some videos pop up in my recommended recently </joey>
<connor> and I had a great time watching them. </connor>
<joey> - Because in my school, </joey>
<joey> I think my group of friends, </joey>
<connor> we were more so than not </connor>
<connor> I guess like the nerdy group of friends. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was too, I was too. </connor>
<connor> - So a lot of my friends from high school </connor>
<connor> got means a games like RuneScape, like Star Croft. </connor>
<joey> other just like land games, like Civilization, </joey>
<joey> those games back in the day. </joey>
<joey> But when it came to anime, </joey>
<joey> I think I had a really tough time </joey>
<joey> because I was literally the only Asian kid in my school. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh no, same to me. </garnt>
<joey> I was the only Asian kid in my school. </joey>
<joey> - With like any amount of Asian blood. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm not even like full-blood Asian. </joey>
<joey> But they just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this boy's a little bit oriental." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - He's nice? </joey>
<joey> What the hell? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, so I think I was a closet anime fan for, </joey>
<joey> man, I wanna say like majority of my high school life </joey>
<joey> but then my group of friends who got me </joey>
<joey> into like Star Croft and Rune Scape I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, you guys are nerdy enough. </joey>
<joey> "Maybe I can try and convince them to watch something." </joey>
<joey> And I convinced one of my friends to watch Ava. </joey>
<garnt> So I was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Why Ava? </garnt>
<garnt> That's not already the gateway anime I will think off. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Maybe because I was recently rewatching Ava. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, this is probably normie enough." </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - That they can be maybe get into it. </joey>
<garnt> - Recommending Ava as someone's first anime. </garnt>
<joey> That could go one of two ways. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's gonna be no middle grounds </garnt>
<garnt> either he's gonna think this is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's a fan for life. </garnt>
<joey> - But the thing is I didn't want to get them </joey>
<garnt> into like Natto or One piece or Dragon Ball </garnt>
<garnt> to start with because we all know </garnt>
<joey> if your to gateway anime is One Piece, Natto </joey>
<joey> or Dragon Ball. </joey>
<joey> That's all you're gonna be talking about </joey>
<joey> for the rest of your career so- </joey>
<garnt> - Hey man, I don't know man. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I got in for Natto, </garnt>
<connor> but I mean I remember the point when- </connor>
<garnt> - You got out. You got out. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got out, I got out. </garnt>
<garnt> There was the point when I would only watch Shounen </garnt>
<garnt> and I know the exact phase you're talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you figure out that there's other things </garnt>
<garnt> outside of Shounen that are pretty cool in this medium. </garnt>
<garnt> And some people, I guess just never figured that out. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like Natto fans, </connor>
<connor> I like the British with food. </connor>
<connor> It's like, no, no, no potatoes is all we need. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Spice what is- </joey>
<joey> - What is it about like it's not obviously not all </joey>
<connor> Shounen fans, but a lot of Shounen fans who are </connor>
<connor> as you said, like get into say, Natto, </connor>
<connor> and then just exclusively talking about Natto. </connor>
<connor> What is it... </connor>
<connor> I wanna know what their mentality is with anime </connor>
<joey> where it's like, </joey>
<joey> do they just think that everything that's not Natto, </joey>
<joey> it's just anti? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> There's like, no, no, no, </joey>
<joey> there's no in between. </joey>
<joey> It's either Shounen or just like straight up R18 and shit. </joey>
<garnt> - They're like, what is this high school romance shit? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna feel. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna feel one emotion and that's hype. </garnt>
<connor> - Show Jo, is that a type of Shounen? </connor>
<joey> - It must be the thing of like, </joey>
<joey> "I get it. </joey>
<joey> It's hype as fuck." </joey>
<connor> But they just must want hype their whole life, </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, your like a crack addict, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You only wanna feel that high you get from crack. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like steroids. </joey>
<connor> - There're the same people and you're like, </connor>
<garnt> "Yo, E3 is crazy this year." </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Every game, every game. </connor>
<connor> I'm hyped for every game </connor>
<connor> and then they don't play any of them. </connor>
<connor> They like the next Modern Warfare. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but in the moment there's </joey>
<joey> a bad news article about the game </joey>
<joey> that just came out in E3 and they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I knew it was shit. </joey>
<joey> "The whole time. </joey>
<joey> "The whole time." </joey>
<joey> Yeah, no. </joey>
<connor> So like my anime friend, so there was a group of them. </connor>
<connor> It was like me and maybe like, </connor>
<connor> I'd say like six or seven guys who I used to </connor>
<connor> really, really, closely hang out with in high school. </connor>
<connor> And I got, one of my friends who got me </connor>
<connor> into like Star Croft. </connor>
<joey> I got him to watch Ava </joey>
<joey> and I wanted to try that just with one person </joey>
<joey> I didn't I wanna like bring in </joey>
<joey> a whole group of people into it. </joey>
<joey> - It's group viewing. </joey>
<joey> - So I kind of was just like eeny, meeny, miny, moe, </joey>
<joey> okay, I add you watch Ava and he was like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, I'll give it a go." </joey>
<joey> And he was kind of mad about it at first. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I liked anime and I was like at points kind of like, </connor>
<joey> "What the fuck." </joey>
<connor> - And that was the Memorial was like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, gateway anime important." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And Ava is not bad. </joey>
<connor> - Always Death Note, you can never go wrong with Death Note. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah so I think that one friend he watched Ava </joey>
<connor> and then he eventually found Death Note and Onepiece </connor>
<connor> and those like the two shows that he heavily gone into. </connor>
<connor> So he was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay then maybe I can try it out with the other boys. </connor>
<connor> "Hey, watch Death Note, watch Onepiece. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - There was boys before us? </joey>
<connor> Joey, what do you mean? </connor>
<joey> - This were the OG boys. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know what the name of that like... </joey>
<joey> This is gonna be really cringy but... </joey>
<joey> We had like a group. </joey>
<garnt> - What was the name Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was the... </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> We were called HBK because we were... </joey>
<garnt> Did you guys ever play handball in school? </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<garnt> - I think that's an Australian thing. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that's an Australian thing. </joey>
<connor> So in Australian schools we play handball </connor>
<connor> but not like the Olympic sport handball </connor>
<connor> like school grounds handball </connor>
<connor> but usually most kids in Australia stop playing handball </connor>
<joey> by around like sixth grade. </joey>
<joey> - So its very rare that you going to middle school </joey>
<joey> or high school and play handball. </joey>
<joey> We played handball all the way until high school graduation. </joey>
<joey> And we were the only ones. </joey>
<joey> And so from no where we were called HBK, </joey>
<joey> which is the Hand Ball Krew. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Krew with a K? - Krew with a K. </connor>
<joey> - Of course </joey>
<joey> - And it was just out of nowhere. </joey>
<joey> One day just the other boys in our year </joey>
<connor> just saw us playing hand ball and they were like, </connor>
<connor> "HBK." </connor>
<connor> And we're like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck does that mean?" </connor>
<connor> And then we later found out it meant handball krew </connor>
<joey> and normal people would be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, that's fucking cringy." </joey>
<joey> And we were like, </joey>
<joey> "Handball Krew." </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Hell yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I think handball is something I've only </garnt>
<joey> heard Australians play in their school </joey>
<joey> 'cause obviously you've seen handball in the Olympics </joey>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> - When we had like a British team </connor>
<connor> like when did they play that? </connor>
<connor> - I know right. </connor>
<connor> - But it's completely different to the Olympic sport. </connor>
<joey> So when I saw handball, 'cause I'd always known </joey>
<connor> handball as that thing that you play in school, </connor>
<connor> where it's like four white squares </connor>
<garnt> and you kind of like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's basically just tennis but with your hand </garnt>
<joey> and a tennis ball in a really confined space. </joey>
<joey> So when I saw handball in the Olympic sport I was like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck is this? </joey>
<garnt> "This isn't handball." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really interesting to hear you say going back to the </garnt>
<garnt> anime conversation that we were having </garnt>
<connor> because I didn't even make my first anime friends, </connor>
<connor> till I started YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - That was years after I started YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - So I didn't start talking to other people </connor>
<connor> who liked anime until the age of the internet. </connor>
<joey> Well, I literally started talking to other people </joey>
<joey> who reviewed anime because back when I was in school </joey>
<joey> and especially when I was in university </joey>
<joey> I did everything I could to keep it under wraps. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Even in uni? </garnt>
<garnt> - Even in uni. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like top secret confidential. </garnt>
<garnt> If you find this out, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna change my identity or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember someone walked into my room of me watching </connor>
<connor> No game No life in university. </connor>
<connor> And it was the moment of like, </connor>
<connor> "How do I explain what's going on here?" </connor>
<connor> It was one of the bad scenes as well. </connor>
<connor> I'm like... </connor>
<connor> - I have a really similar story. </connor>
<connor> So in uni first year of university </connor>
<connor> in England at least we have this thing called freshers week. </connor>
<connor> Where you basically go out every night and get pissed- </connor>
<connor> - Very, very drunk. </connor>
<connor> - Get very, very drunk and just go clubbing. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds awesome. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so me being the </connor>
<connor> socially awkward nerd that I was back then </connor>
<joey> I would still try to go out as much as I could, </joey>
<joey> but I mean it can get tiring, </joey>
<connor> six or seven days of just pure clubbing every day </connor>
<garnt> man that shit gets to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's a lot man. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how people do it. </garnt>
<connor> And then people would like look forward to it the next year. </connor>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm like- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know how, </connor>
<garnt> I feel 30 already in this one week of freshers. </garnt>
<garnt> So this one night I was just in a club </garnt>
<connor> and I wasn't even that drunk. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'd been drinking five or six days before that. </connor>
<connor> I was just in the middle of this dance floor. </connor>
<connor> And I just had like this epiphany, </connor>
<joey> "I'm having a shit time. </joey>
<joey> "I'd probably rather be watching... </joey>
<joey> "I'd rather be watching anime right now." </joey>
<garnt> Like I was just that one guy who just dances in a club </garnt>
<joey> and just had the, this is shit. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Especially every time I go to the club, I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "I need more drinks." </connor>
<connor> - So instead of getting more drinks, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna fuck off and go home </connor>
<garnt> "and watch some bloody anime." </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't tell anyone that I was fucking off back home. </garnt>
<garnt> So I go of by myself- </garnt>
<connor> - You're that guy in uni. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm the lone wolf don't talk to me. </connor>
<connor> - I just wanted to watch some anime. </connor>
<joey> And what the fuck am I doing in a club </joey>
<joey> when I could be watching some big fat animated </joey>
<joey> which is exactly what I did. </joey>
<joey> - You got that on a T-shirt. </joey>
<joey> - I go back to my room </joey>
<connor> and as you do in uni you're... </connor>
<connor> Unlike Americans in England we have own private rooms </connor>
<garnt> so we don't room share. </garnt>
<connor> - The thought of having to share rooms with with someone </connor>
<garnt> I'd go fucking insane. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> So I have this remote to myself </garnt>
<garnt> and as you do I take off my trousers because as a guy </garnt>
<connor> you're just more comfortable in your boxers. </connor>
<joey> - It's true, the jeans are too restrictive. </joey>
<joey> - Jeans are way too restrictive. </joey>
<joey> So take off my trousers, start sitting down, </joey>
<garnt> turn on my laptop and put on the episode of Monogatari and- </garnt>
<connor> - The toothbrush scene is it gonna be? </connor>
<joey> - No, no it was the shower scene with Senjougahara. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So it was like episode two </joey>
<connor> and I was really getting into this. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, what do you mean getting into this? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Its Monogatari, its a good series. </connor>
<connor> - Its a good scene. </connor>
<garnt> - How sober are you at this point? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I fully sober? </garnt>
<connor> - I was like a little- </connor>
<connor> - Like that point you feel shitty, like? </connor>
<connor> - I was like a little bit tipsy, </connor>
<connor> but I was just having a good time because you know when </connor>
<connor> you haven't watched anime in a while </connor>
<joey> and it just feels good to watch anime </joey>
<connor> after that anime drought, that was just, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, man, this is just a nice break from all the </connor>
<connor> "drinking and clubbing and socializing and all that stuff." </connor>
<connor> And as soon as it gets to the shower scene, </connor>
<connor> I just hear this door creak open like, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> and then I look around and then one of my flatmates </connor>
<joey> is just staring at me and I turn round </joey>
<joey> and it's just me and my boxers watching. </joey>
<joey> And all he sees is just </joey>
<joey> Senjougahara massive tits on screen taking a shower. </joey>
<joey> And I try to eye him up to be like, </joey>
<joey> "This isn't what it looks like." </joey>
<joey> And he eyes me back saying, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, shit this is exactly what it looks like." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You should have asserted dominance just </joey>
<joey> to maintain eye contact. </joey>
<joey> - And then he just closes the door and I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, I'm moving to China now. </connor>
<connor> "He knows my secrets." </connor>
<garnt> And then he just never spoke to me again. </garnt>
<connor> - I have a way worse story than that. </connor>
<connor> It was again like during high school, </connor>
<connor> when I had gotten like the one friend </connor>
<connor> that I got him into Ava. </connor>
<connor> So he unlike everybody else, </connor>
<connor> like everybody kind of got into anime. </connor>
<connor> I was closeted for a while but I kind of was like, </connor>
<connor> "I needed to get out of the closet." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I need to try and convince my friends </joey>
<joey> that this is an okay thing to watch. </joey>
<garnt> So you need to make a YouTube video saying, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm coming out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm coming out. </garnt>
<joey> I like anime. </joey>
<connor> - You're exactly right. </connor>
<joey> - So the one friend, the guy I first experimented on. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Why are you gotta use this terminology Joey to explain? </connor>
<joey> - Because I was experimenting. </joey>
<garnt> - You're just like Light Yagami being </garnt>
<garnt> funny every step being like, </garnt>
<joey> "Okay, If I show them this anime maybe they'll like." </joey>
<joey> - It's like maybe one of them will like get into it. </joey>
<joey> And sure enough, one of them got into it. </joey>
<joey> So I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Kick off with Doughty." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So he, just my one friend, he really, really got into anime. </joey>
<joey> I'm talking like, him and I would come to school every week </joey>
<connor> and we would discuss the episodes that just came out </connor>
<connor> like the night before. </connor>
<connor> Like him and I were like full on like anime buddies. </connor>
<connor> And one night we were drinking at a friend's place. </connor>
<garnt> And, obviously as you do when you're in high school, </garnt>
<garnt> you get really shit faced, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was staying at his place </garnt>
<garnt> and I had missed the bus home and everything so I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "All right, I'm just gonna crash at yours." </joey>
<joey> And it was just him and I, and we were like, </joey>
<joey> "we should watch some anime, why not? </joey>
<joey> "Lets just watch some anime." </joey>
<joey> And I don't know how it came to it but </joey>
<joey> we were just kind of scrolling through </joey>
<joey> just looking for something to watch and he's like, </joey>
<joey> "You watched this no, </joey>
<joey> "you've watched this no." </joey>
<joey> And I just kind of slowly turned to him, </joey>
<joey> just as a gag goes like, </joey>
<joey> "You ever heard of QC's? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<joey> - He's like, </joey>
<garnt> "No, what's that?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We should check it out. </garnt>
<joey> "We'll just watch one episode just for shits and giggles. </joey>
<joey> "Let's watch an episode of QC's." </joey>
<joey> So imagine me and my friend sitting in a room, </joey>
<joey> six feet apart because we are not gay, just watching... </joey>
<garnt> - Just bonding over an episode of QC. </garnt>
<connor> - Just bonding over an episode of QC. </connor>
<joey> - It just sound like every incest moment </joey>
<joey> happened to like porn. </joey>
<joey> - And it was worse because I dunno how long </joey>
<joey> he was standing at the door but his little brother </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> was standing at the door just watching us, </joey>
<joey> watch QC and we were like into it too. </joey>
<joey> We all like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, hell yeah." </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This kids are like Michael Jackson like- </connor>
<connor> - Mind you we were very drunk. </connor>
<connor> We were like, </connor>
<connor> "Who's your favorite?" </connor>
<connor> And he's like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh man, they're both really cute." </joey>
<joey> Just full on like, you would've thought we were </joey>
<joey> like making a reaction video. </joey>
<joey> We weren't like full on commentating the entire thing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - And what was supposed to be just for shit and giggles. </joey>
<joey> Just one episode of QC we finished </joey>
<joey> the entire series in one night. </joey>
<joey> - What? - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. Did he enjoy it? </garnt>
<garnt> - He loved it. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And that was the moment where I was like, </joey>
<joey> "This guy's a (indistinct)." </joey>
<joey> - Don't go home with Joey drunk </joey>
<connor> he'll try and show you shitty anime. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I've done that. </joey>
<garnt> - I like the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> you had to wait until he was alone. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah because, this other boys were like discussing </joey>
<joey> how good the Alabaster Arc in Onepiece was and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't think these boys are ready QC's yet." </joey>
<joey> These guys are at level one thief </joey>
<joey> and this guys are level 10 mafia boss. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Let's experiment with y'all mafia boys." </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey is like the sensei who sees the hidden potential </garnt>
<garnt> in that one student he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I can teach you the way." </garnt>
<garnt> - I sense it in you. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you're ready to learn. </joey>
<joey> You're ready to upgrade. </joey>
<garnt> - So did he enjoy more of that kind of show afterwards? </garnt>
<joey> - So then that was the point where we basically </joey>
<joey> Him and I, we found out from each other that </joey>
<connor> we're into those kinds of shows and we're okay with it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We're just into each other. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - We were just into those kinds of shows. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause after we finished QC we're both just like, </joey>
<connor> "I just gotta let you know broad now that we've </connor>
<connor> "had this fucking like journey together that </connor>
<joey> "I'm like secretly into these shows." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Every single moment of this story you tell </connor>
<connor> could be like a coming out to each other. </connor>
<joey> - And he was like dude, </joey>
<joey> "I'm kind of into these shows." </joey>
<joey> And then from there- </joey>
<connor> - Are you doing this on purpose? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Dude I'm kind of into you. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Mike just had enough. </garnt>
<connor> - Mike's like, </connor>
<joey> "I gotta get the fuck out." </joey>
<joey> And yeah, so from that point on, </joey>
<joey> I became a lot more open with </joey>
<joey> my trashy taste in anime, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Joey is like, </garnt>
<connor> "Yes, I'm hentia sexual." </connor>
<joey> - Are you purposely picking words to do this? </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<connor> - Then stop this. </connor>
<connor> - I am writing. </connor>
<connor> Look, y'all re write this, this is free real estate. </connor>
<connor> All right, go for it. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, but that was the point where I slowly realized, </connor>
<connor> if I'm closeted then I'll obviously have a lot of fun </connor>
<connor> just kind of enjoying this medium for myself. </connor>
<connor> But there's a whole other enjoyment </connor>
<joey> when you get someone else into it as well. </joey>
<garnt> - I remember the first time I was able to have conversations </garnt>
<garnt> about anime with other people. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was just so liberating for me that </garnt>
<garnt> I had spent all of these years enjoying this medium </garnt>
<garnt> but have literally nobody to talk to about. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I made YouTube videos to be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Okay if I can't have anyone to talk to about </connor>
<connor> "I'm just gonna talk to the void </connor>
<connor> "and hopefully someone will listen." </connor>
<connor> And I remember having some of the first </connor>
<connor> genuine conversations online </connor>
<connor> 'cause it had to be online back then </connor>
<connor> about shows that I liked and I just felt free. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I don't know who your first friends </connor>
<connor> in like the anime YouTube sphere was? </connor>
<garnt> For me it was probably Holden reviews </garnt>
<garnt> and the people from PODTAKU </garnt>
<garnt> we going and going way back then. </garnt>
<joey> - I think mine might've been Misty, </joey>
<garnt> - Yours is Misty? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, except for the one in jail, </garnt>
<connor> I don't think there's anyone else </connor>
<connor> I would categorize like... </connor>
<connor> A lot of them were just like fleeting mutuals. </connor>
<connor> I'll tell you guys probably the first proper friends </connor>
<connor> that I made outside of that first- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah because it was strange for me because </joey>
<connor> I'm the complete opposite when it comes to </connor>
<connor> my friends circle on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> where you would think that I would be very quick </connor>
<joey> to bond with other animetubers, </joey>
<connor> the one's starting anime YouTube channel. </connor>
<joey> But weirdly enough for like the first two years or so, </joey>
<garnt> I was only friends with gaming YouTubers </garnt>
<connor> but that's also because I was doing </connor>
<connor> a lot of gaming stuff alongside anime stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I think it honestly might've been misty. </connor>
<connor> That was the first like proper animetuber. </connor>
<connor> And that was when I discovered this entire community </connor>
<connor> of animetubers I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, I'm not the only one. </connor>
<garnt> "There are other people who do this stuff as well." </garnt>
<connor> And then that's when I kind of to drift away </connor>
<joey> from more of the gaming stuff </joey>
<connor> and focus on what my channel was actually about. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I remember I realized we had comments sometimes </connor>
<joey> that are like me listening to the podcast and it's like, </joey>
<joey> "That guy sitting next to." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I love that feature. </joey>
<garnt> I love that anime, its so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember I was doing my A levels. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember listening to PodTaku actually, </garnt>
<joey> I remember I used to listened to it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I would do my... </joey>
<connor> I remember I have this distinct memory </connor>
<connor> of you guys arguing. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know over what, but I was doing my- </garnt>
<garnt> - We argue over a lot of things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was doing my math A levels, </garnt>
<garnt> I was, and I remember just listening to it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Man, and I wanna like be in that. </garnt>
<garnt> "Talk to them." </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna have friends, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna like talk to friends about anime </garnt>
<connor> even at that point when I was like, </connor>
<connor> what, like 17, I still had no one to talk to about anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I didn't really make friends until university </connor>
<connor> but I got banned from my anime club Facebook group. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they were talking about like Hellsing Abridged. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Shit, I've voiced in that." </connor>
<connor> I said in the comments, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yeah, I voiced in it." </connor>
<connor> And then they banned me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> They thought I was lying. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because they were like, </connor>
<connor> why would someone in our university first year </connor>
<connor> be voicing in Hellsing Abridged. </connor>
<connor> And then I went to the club and I explained, </connor>
<connor> like two months later I went, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I happened to go there anyway. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, can you unban me from the club? </connor>
<connor> "I don't know why you guys ban me." </connor>
<connor> And they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, we don't know." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "I know you fucking know why you banned me." </garnt>
<garnt> - We couldn't have someone having clouts. </garnt>
<connor> - I was in that group for like a year. </connor>
<garnt> And I had one comment about that. </garnt>
<joey> I got immediately banned. </joey>
<joey> Fuck you, Swansea Anime Club. </joey>
<joey> - They were just waiting for, </joey>
<garnt> a fucking ban have on that murmur. </garnt>
<garnt> - They were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Nope, no clout in this club." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - My God. </connor>
<garnt> - So you joined the anime club in your university then? </garnt>
<garnt> - I joined, I paid the two pound a year membership </garnt>
<garnt> and then all they did was watch Gigli movies </garnt>
<joey> and that's all they did and I'm like, this is- </joey>
<joey> - I joined the anime club in my university </joey>
<connor> it was the biggest mistake ever. </connor>
<connor> - Its like, its weird. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like a mixture of like... </connor>
<garnt> It's a mixture of people who don't really care about anime </garnt>
<garnt> and like one or two people who are way too into it </garnt>
<garnt> or into really different niches. </garnt>
<garnt> So I felt like, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> I couldn't really talk with... </connor>
<connor> None of them watched the same I watched. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it was the same with gaming. </connor>
<connor> The gaming club in my uni was supposed to be gaming </connor>
<connor> and it was Orchard Magic, The Gathering. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I mean it's type of gaming. </joey>
<connor> - It's type of game, but you think of gaming club. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, then diversify a little bit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah and I was like, </joey>
<connor> 'Well, guess I'm not joining any clubs in unis. </connor>
<joey> "Brony Club it is. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, go for it. </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna say, I made a whole video on it a while ago, </connor>
<connor> but I joined the anime club. </connor>
<connor> There was one anime club at Sydney Uni </connor>
<connor> and I joined it and I went to one of their events. </connor>
<connor> Just one, and it was a screening and it was off Paprika. </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay, it's a screening. </connor>
<connor> And it's all the non Ghibli movie. </connor>
<joey> Okay, whoever's picking it must know- </joey>
<garnt> - They have taste. </garnt>
<garnt> They know something outside of just, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, okay. </garnt>
<joey> And I wanted to watch Paprika 'cause I hadn't seen it yet. </joey>
<connor> And so I went to it and the club wasn't that big. </connor>
<connor> It was maybe I'd say 40 people in this room. </connor>
<connor> Which is quite small club for, especially Sydney Uni. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, these people all seem to be excited about this. </connor>
<connor> "Maybe let's watch it." </connor>
<connor> And this is the one thing I hate about anime clubs. </connor>
<garnt> And also this is the one thing I hate </garnt>
<joey> about cinemas in the U.S </joey>
<joey> is that they love to fucking commentate </joey>
<joey> on what's happening in the movie out loud. </joey>
<garnt> - I cannot stand that. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't stand, especially U.S cinemas. </joey>
<garnt> It's something that U.S cinemas where it's like, </garnt>
<connor> if there's like a big epic, right? </connor>
<connor> Like say you go watch fucking Avengers or something, right? </connor>
<connor> And something massive happens or some whatever. </connor>
<joey> There's always like at least 10 or 20 people </joey>
<joey> who were just like, yeah... </joey>
<joey> And they just go off about like... </joey>
<joey> They give like they're like fucking Rotten Tomatoes </joey>
<garnt> with you on the spot, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like I'm 80 years old </joey>
<joey> whenever I'm one of those screens. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Quiet down. </garnt>
<joey> "I'm trying to enjoy the film." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, can you shhh, shut the fuck up. </joey>
<connor> "I'm trying to watch the movie." </connor>
<joey> - That's like special occasions, </joey>
<joey> where it's kind of warranted, </joey>
<connor> like watching End Game. </connor>
<connor> All right, I get it. </connor>
<connor> You can shout. </connor>
<connor> I watch Chromat AIX, insane. </connor>
<connor> The hype made it amazing. </connor>
<connor> The worst thing was, </connor>
<connor> one of my exes I went to the cinema with, </connor>
<connor> they've never watched a movie in the cinema before </connor>
<connor> and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, cool." </connor>
<connor> And then she was one of those people. </connor>
<connor> Didn't know that? </connor>
<connor> How do you know that? </connor>
<connor> That's not like on a Tinder bio, right? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then she shouted during the first five minutes. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay." </connor>
<connor> In my head I'm thinking, </connor>
<connor> "All right, let's not make this a reoccurring thing." </connor>
<connor> And then like two minutes later, she shouts again. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Please, please don't do this, please. </connor>
<connor> "I'm British, you can't do this. </connor>
<connor> "I can't be seen with you </connor>
<connor> "if you're making a commotion in public." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then that's how I realized that she wasn't right for me. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I liked Japanese cinemas, man </joey>
<connor> because like it's- </connor>
<connor> - No. Okay. </connor>
<connor> Okay, go ahead, go ahead, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, no. </connor>
<connor> I know how you feel about Japanese cinemas, </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - There's a part of it that I like. </connor>
<connor> And there's a part of it that I don't like. </connor>
<connor> The part that I like about it </connor>
<connor> is that people aren't fucking shouting </connor>
<connor> there rotten tomatoes reviews during the movie. </connor>
<connor> - No one says anything. </connor>
<connor> - No one says anything but- </connor>
<connor> - I liked that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I like that too. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause especially if it's a movie </connor>
<garnt> that you need to immerse yourself in, </garnt>
<garnt> like fucking Paprika, for instance, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like I want it to be just quiet </garnt>
<connor> and I wanna get into it. </connor>
<connor> But the bad thing is that </connor>
<connor> I went to go see the corner Super Movie. </connor>
<garnt> Which is easily one of the funniest anime movies </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever seen. </garnt>
<connor> But I felt really bad laughing out loud </connor>
<joey> because I was literally the only person </joey>
<joey> laughing out loud in the cinema. </joey>
<joey> And every time I was like, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think that's was supposed to be funny. </joey>
<joey> - Did anybody else find that funny? </joey>
<joey> - I've had similar experiences in a time movies </joey>
<joey> or going into time cinemas where I remember watching </joey>
<connor> Yuni cinemas. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know if it's just a cultural difference </connor>
<connor> but there would be times when they were laughing </connor>
<joey> and I would be like, </joey>
<joey> "Why is this funny?" </joey>
<connor> And there'd be a really funny joke. </connor>
<connor> And then I'd be the only guy laughing. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Am I the asshole here? </garnt>
<garnt> Do I just have a really weird sense of humor." </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, I felt so bad because I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Is anyone genuinely not finding this movie funny? </connor>
<connor> "Am I the only one?" </connor>
<joey> Yeah, I hated it. </joey>
<connor> - I've been going to the cinema at least before COVID. </connor>
<connor> I was going like pretty much every week. </connor>
<connor> And like there's some of the things they do great. </connor>
<connor> I showed you guys this in the cinema. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When you buy popcorn and the drink </connor>
<connor> they give you this tray. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh that's cool." </connor>
<joey> And then you realize </joey>
<joey> you can put it in the cup holder and it sticks. </joey>
<connor> So you have a whole tray that's in the cup holder. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking genius. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No one would have to hold this shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You just put it on the tray. </joey>
<joey> - You don't have to put </joey>
<joey> fucking greasy thing on your lap. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Put your popcorn on your tray </connor>
<connor> and the person next to you can have it, whatever. </connor>
<connor> Amazing, right? </connor>
<connor> Amazing. </connor>
<connor> And then the thing that I hate... </connor>
<connor> Also, yeah, no noise. </connor>
<connor> The only time I've ever seen them make noise </connor>
<joey> in a Japanese cinema, </joey>
<joey> I was watching the movie and it was about a bomb </joey>
<joey> that was gonna go off in one of the Olympics, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And this police officers accused... </joey>
<joey> Anyway, they go to his house to search his house </joey>
<joey> and they ask him, do you have any guns? </joey>
<joey> He's like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I have guns." </joey>
<joey> And he shows his, under his mattress </joey>
<connor> and he has like a 100 guns and the whole cinema goes, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Every Japanese was like- </connor>
<joey> - Meanwhile, if they show them in the US cinema, </joey>
<joey> there's like- </joey>
<garnt> - Second Amendment. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Weak sauce. </connor>
<joey> - I realized I said the wrong amendment. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then also one really annoying thing, right? </connor>
<joey> When the movie ends, </joey>
<joey> the credits come. </joey>
<joey> All right, see you guys, I'm off, </joey>
<connor> Japanese cinemas you cannot leave. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Until the credits are over. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And some of these credits go on </connor>
<connor> for like 20 fucking minutes. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like the first few times I was like, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I'll respect the culture, I'll wait. </garnt>
<garnt> Now I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Credits? </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm going, fuck you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm avoiding credits." </garnt>
<garnt> - Caveman brain activates again. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't care about the seven people </joey>
<joey> that did costume design. </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> I'm not sticking around for that long. </joey>
<connor> - And then I'm the asshole </connor>
<joey> who in front of a 100 thing is like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, see you guys." </joey>
<joey> I'm just walking, </joey>
<joey> I don't give a fuck. </joey>
<connor> I'm not waiting 30 minutes- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I found that aspect to be cool. </joey>
<joey> Because obviously the people go to the cinemas, </joey>
<connor> they respect them. </connor>
<connor> I wanna know who did. </connor>
<garnt> And who worked on this movie? </garnt>
<garnt> But as you said, </garnt>
<garnt> I think the Japanese like film industry is aware </garnt>
<joey> that people have to stick around to the credits </joey>
<joey> so they're like, </joey>
<joey> "How do we extend this as long as we can?" </joey>
<joey> Its like in YouTube, </joey>
<connor> we're trying to extend a video 10 minutes, right? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Its like, </garnt>
<garnt> "How do we extend this credit to 10 minutes </garnt>
<joey> "to get that mid rolling?" </joey>
<garnt> - I don't dunno like, I used to be the same where </garnt>
<connor> I would think, </connor>
<connor> why the would anyone stay when the credits rolling? </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit about this. </connor>
<connor> And then I remember </connor>
<connor> I did it once for a movie that just blew me away. </connor>
<connor> I think... </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the exact name. </connor>
<connor> - Paul Block. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But I remember most recently I did it </connor>
<connor> after watching Your Name and A Silent Voice. </connor>
<connor> And it's actually just a really nice feeling </connor>
<connor> to just to absorb everything you just watch </connor>
<connor> and just sit there in silence. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, when a- </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes, I'm gonna go there. </joey>
<joey> - When a movie hits really deep, </joey>
<joey> I can't... </joey>
<joey> "We're doing this again, </joey>
<connor> we're doing this again." </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - But when a movie affects me that way </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - He got it. </joey>
<garnt> He got it, buddy. </garnt>
<joey> He got it. </joey>
<garnt> - Then it's just nice just to absorb everything </garnt>
<garnt> you just watch instead of just being like, </garnt>
<joey> "All right, boys. </joey>
<joey> "I'm off, I'm off. </joey>
<joey> "We'd be good." </joey>
<joey> I go. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's good, that's good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the one thing I appreciate </joey>
<joey> about some film credits, right? </joey>
<joey> If it's like, I really enjoy watching, </joey>
<garnt> the toy story credits </garnt>
<garnt> because they do the behind the scenes bloopers real shit. </garnt>
<garnt> That shit's fucking cool. </garnt>
<garnt> But when it's a black screen </garnt>
<joey> and just white text scrolling for 10 minutes- </joey>
<joey> - Which often is. </joey>
<joey> - Which often is. </joey>
<joey> Then I'm just like, I mean you guys know </joey>
<joey> we have to stick around for the credits. </joey>
<connor> Can you at least make it entertaining in some fashion? </connor>
<connor> And even isn't it the worst? </connor>
<connor> Well, when the credit song is just like, </connor>
<connor> I'm not digging this credits at all. </connor>
<joey> And I have to sit here and listen to the whole goddamn song. </joey>
<joey> - I was too lazy for that. </joey>
<joey> I just leave and then I watch </joey>
<connor> the after scene credit on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's gonna be on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - But you can use the gauging, Connor, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I normally catch, </connor>
<connor> sometimes when I do it </connor>
<connor> the Japanese were like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, we can do that?" </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then they'll get up too. </connor>
<joey> - Follow the white man. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait. </joey>
<connor> No one is stopping me here. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't wanna- </garnt>
<garnt> - "He just cheating the system. </garnt>
<garnt> "I never thought you could do that." </garnt>
<connor> - When I do it, I notice I'll get a few looks, </connor>
<connor> and then I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> two of the people who stand up and go as well. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, join me. </joey>
<joey> "Join me." </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It is freedom. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the trust isn't that Japan runs on, </garnt>
<connor> like buying alcohol. </connor>
<connor> - I'm slowly breaking that trust system. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> The more, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I'd say the older I get, </connor>
<connor> the more I have less time </connor>
<connor> the more I just don't appreciate the waste of my time. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Nope, I'm not waiting for your credits. </connor>
<joey> "Goodbye." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So speaking of Gaijin combo, </joey>
<joey> have you guys ever used the Gaijin card, </joey>
<joey> in like funny situations? </joey>
<joey> Should we explain what the Gaijin card is? </joey>
<garnt> - Sure, you should probably- </garnt>
<joey> - Go for it, Joey. </joey>
<connor> - Go for it. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm sure everyone knows what the Gaijin card is. </garnt>
<connor> But basically the Gaijin card, </connor>
<connor> is Gaijin means foreigner in Japanese </connor>
<connor> but playing the Gaijin card basically means </connor>
<connor> you get away with shit that Japanese people </connor>
<joey> wouldn't be able to get away with in Japan. </joey>
<joey> But they forgive you </joey>
<joey> because you're supposed to be like a mindless foreigner. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I try not to actively take advantage of it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like it's not fair of me to use </connor>
<connor> being a foreigner 'cause everyone </connor>
<connor> goes through the same struggles, right? </connor>
<connor> That's hard enough. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, there's some stuff like, </connor>
<connor> apparently not supposed to eat and walk here, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I have like 10 minutes to get to my train </garnt>
<connor> and I haven't had breakfast, </connor>
<connor> I'm grabbing that sandwich and eating it. </connor>
<connor> I don't throw my shit away. </connor>
<connor> I don't make a mess. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, it's fine. </connor>
<joey> - I always wonder that, </joey>
<joey> why is it that a lot of convenience store food </joey>
<garnt> is so perfectly packaged for on the go. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right, right, right, right. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's like, but you can't eat on the go though. </joey>
<garnt> - Like Onigira, that's basically a rice sandwich. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's meant to be eaten as you're walking along, but, </connor>
<connor> "No, you can't while you walk." </connor>
<connor> - No one gives me looks or anything or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> It's just a, </connor>
<connor> I'm told I'm not supposed to do this </connor>
<connor> but fuck it, I'm gonna do it anyway. </connor>
<connor> But there's stuff I wouldn't dare do. </connor>
<joey> - I like doing the reverse Gaijin card. </joey>
<connor> I like playing the Gaijin card </connor>
<connor> and then immediately after I've committed the act </connor>
<joey> just bust out the Japanese. </joey>
<joey> Just like, </joey>
<garnt> "Psyke." </garnt>
<joey> - Reverse UNO. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Can you give us an example of a situation? </joey>
<joey> - So an example of a situation, </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to think what would be, </joey>
<connor> I mean, something like that, right? </connor>
<connor> Like you're not allowed to eat on the go, </connor>
<connor> like not allowed to eat on the train, for example, </connor>
<connor> where I would as you said, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I'm busy and sometimes I got to get something down </connor>
<connor> before I catch the train. </connor>
<connor> So I would eat on the go and people would kind of </connor>
<connor> just be like, whatever. </connor>
<connor> But then what I like to do just to fuck with people </connor>
<connor> is I like to, I finished the food and then </connor>
<joey> just 'cause I love seeing people's reactions to this. </joey>
<joey> I finished the food </joey>
<joey> and then I pretend to get in a phone call </joey>
<joey> and I just talk in Japanese a lot. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Because seeing the confused phases of Japanese, </joey>
<joey> they will be like, </joey>
<joey> "Is he Gaijin or is he not Gaijin? </joey>
<joey> "I don't even know anymore," </joey>
<joey> is my favorite pastime. </joey>
<garnt> - I've done the exact same thing. </garnt>
<joey> But just when I'm in Thailand </joey>
<joey> and you know when people gossip about you </joey>
<joey> in their native tongue </joey>
<joey> or they don't know that you understand them </joey>
<joey> and you just want to flex on them to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Bitch, I know exactly what you motherfucking said. </joey>
<garnt> "You better watch yourself, motherfucker." </garnt>
<joey> - I've had so many experiences like that. </joey>
<joey> Especially, when you're outside of Tokyo </joey>
<joey> where they're obviously not used to the foreigners. </joey>
<joey> I was in a supermarket once with my sister. </joey>
<joey> We were like really, really young. </joey>
<connor> We were maybe like, </connor>
<connor> I'll spin maybe like nine or 10 years old. </connor>
<connor> And we were just in the aisle </connor>
<connor> that has all like the snacks and stuff. </connor>
<connor> Because Japanese and snacks like fucking best. </connor>
<connor> And we were just picking stuff out </connor>
<connor> and there was this kid probably </connor>
<connor> around the same age as me, </connor>
<connor> who was just like staring at us </connor>
<connor> from down the aisle, </connor>
<connor> obviously because we looked foreign </connor>
<connor> and he'd obviously never seen a foreign kid in his life. </connor>
<connor> So he was a staring and then his other friend came up </connor>
<connor> and I could clearly hear that </connor>
<connor> they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, look at these fucking foreigners." </connor>
<connor> It was to that- </connor>
<connor> - These are nine year old's. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, legit. </joey>
<joey> They were like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh man, look at these foreigners. </connor>
<connor> "They look so weird." </connor>
<connor> Or something along that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I heard everything, and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, you prepare for my backhand. </joey>
<joey> "Prepare for my nine-year-old backhand." </joey>
<joey> - "I've never decked a nine-year-old before </joey>
<joey> "but today could be the day." </joey>
<joey> - I've never closed-line to anybody, </joey>
<joey> but man, you guys just put on some distance" </joey>
<connor> So just to with them, I was like, </connor>
<connor> (foreign language) </connor>
<joey> My nine-year-old mind was like, </joey>
<joey> "I'll show them." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So, out loud to my sister. </joey>
<joey> I said, in Japanese, I said, </joey>
<connor> have you finished selecting which one you want? </connor>
<connor> And I think my sister quickly picked up on it too </connor>
<connor> because I think she overheard it. </connor>
<joey> And so she was like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, I'll play you a game." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And back in Japanese, she was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I've almost finished." </joey>
<joey> And then she busted out this really </joey>
<joey> like specific Japanese reference. </joey>
<joey> And from my periphery, </joey>
<garnt> I'd never seen a nine-year-old </garnt>
<garnt> with a punk champ face in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What?" </garnt>
<garnt> You would have thought these kids </garnt>
<garnt> would have seen like the face of God. </garnt>
<garnt> They were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh my God, what the fuck is that?" </garnt>
<garnt> And just to fuck with them even further </garnt>
<garnt> when we finished selecting our shit, </garnt>
<garnt> I purposely went towards the kids. </garnt>
<joey> And as I passed by, I busted out a </joey>
<joey> (foreign language) </joey>
<joey> And that was just like the finishing brawl. </joey>
<joey> That might as well, </joey>
<joey> I just clothes line them with my warriors. </joey>
<connor> - Even a death note asking counter- </connor>
<joey> - I'll do it. </joey>
<joey> I'll fucking kicked the fuck out of it. </joey>
<connor> - That's so much more like passive </connor>
<connor> than what I think I used to do to kids. </connor>
<garnt> - Joey slammed down a nine year old </garnt>
<garnt> with Japanese and language, swish. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember we used to go camping </connor>
<connor> every year in France for like three weeks. </connor>
<connor> I was, okay, you're gonna think wild, Connor. </connor>
<connor> You're a violent like fucking 11 year old. </connor>
<joey> I fucking spent all my time in the arcades. </joey>
<connor> I remember this one time </connor>
<connor> this kid had been taunting me </connor>
<connor> I guess French kid. </connor>
<connor> I fucking hated him. </connor>
<connor> Even taunting me for like days. </connor>
<connor> And I'm playing Metal Slug. </connor>
<connor> And you know how you would put like two credits in? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You press the credit button? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, I'm playing and I put another one in for me </connor>
<connor> when I die, </connor>
<connor> this asshole, this 11 year old bitch </connor>
<connor> comes along presses the restart credit button, </connor>
<connor> and then walks away. </connor>
<connor> And then I immediately just turned around </connor>
<connor> and just fucking smacked him in the face. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I got in so much trouble. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I had like an angry French dad shouting at me. </connor>
<joey> I'm like 11, right? </joey>
<joey> His dad shouting at me. </joey>
<connor> So this kid's crying. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I'm gonna finish my game. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then I'll deal with this. </connor>
<connor> And my dad had such a fucking go at me. </connor>
<garnt> - You were that X-Box kid. </garnt>
<connor> - Which I definitely like. </connor>
<garnt> I was such an angry kid. </garnt>
<garnt> I've no idea why, but I'm glad though. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause now I just can't even get angry with- </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, I'd be pretty pissed off too. </joey>
<joey> If some random fucking kid came up to me did that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, hen you were like 11, right? </connor>
<connor> This is also, </connor>
<connor> my parents didn't give me much money </connor>
<connor> and I would always use it on the games, right? </connor>
<connor> So to me, this kid has just taken like the only money </connor>
<joey> I was getting for like that whole trip. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, oh no. </connor>
<joey> Oh, no. </joey>
<joey> - We all know like two in 11 year old, </joey>
<connor> like two or three credits or the little Slug </connor>
<connor> is the equivalency of mom's credit card. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love Metal Slug </connor>
<connor> and that kid took my credit. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I can totally understand why you got angry. </garnt>
<connor> I just thought, </connor>
<garnt> man, there's a few steps </garnt>
<garnt> between taking someone's credit </garnt>
<garnt> and smacking someone in face. </garnt>
<joey> - He been giving me shit... </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> This kid have been giving me shit, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's like a campsite. </connor>
<connor> He'd been giving me shit for days. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I'm done, dude. </connor>
<connor> I'm done. I'm fuming. </connor>
<connor> I just straight up punched him. </connor>
<connor> I got so much shit for that. </connor>
<connor> And then like two days later, </connor>
<connor> the same kid who I punched </connor>
<connor> had a black eye, </connor>
<connor> he came while I was on my other fucking game. </connor>
<connor> Just pulls out the plug and I fucking chased him, </connor>
<connor> but he ran off. </connor>
<connor> I was gonna kill him. </connor>
<joey> I was gonna fucking kill him. </joey>
<joey> But he ran off. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Motherfucker just pulled out the plug </connor>
<connor> whilst I was mid Metal Slug. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, man. </joey>
<joey> - I don't even remember... </joey>
<joey> This is going to be a weird question, </joey>
<joey> but when was the first time you have a punched someone? </joey>
<connor> - But I got in so many fights in school. </connor>
<joey> - Was that the first time you ever punched someone? </joey>
<connor> - Did you don't fight with... </connor>
<connor> Oh wait, do you only have a sister? </connor>
<joey> - I only had a sister. </joey>
<joey> - Oh dude, I have three brothers. </joey>
<connor> - Dude, if I punched my sister, my dad would... </connor>
<connor> My dad used to say this one threat. </connor>
<connor> It's like a legit threat. </connor>
<garnt> Where if I did anything like bad in public </garnt>
<connor> he just grabbed my ear and just whispered being like </connor>
<joey> "I brought you into this world, </joey>
<joey> I can easily take you out." </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> My dad won't remember that. </joey>
<joey> But I specifically... </joey>
<connor> To an eight year old that's like, </connor>
<garnt> "I'm sorry father." </garnt>
<connor> - Parenting 101, dad. </connor>
<garnt> - Me and my brothers, </garnt>
<joey> so we had the three brothers, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So it was WrestleMania, </joey>
<joey> like fucking constantly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I bet. </joey>
<joey> - I must have been in fist fights </joey>
<garnt> like three days of the week. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was actually fist fights or was it like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, we got to the point we were like </garnt>
<garnt> actually start like full on punching each other. </garnt>
<garnt> - Holy shit, man. </garnt>
<connor> - We hated each other. </connor>
<connor> I love them now. </connor>
<connor> I love you guys. </connor>
<connor> But back then it was like, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause Oh God, so many fights. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, my dad had this thing we called it like, </connor>
<connor> he's pretty gonna kill me if I say this, </connor>
<connor> but he had the single, the murder stare. </connor>
<connor> And when you started fucking up </connor>
<connor> and he would look at you </connor>
<joey> and he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Bro, you're one step away from losing everything." </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I will end you right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was the look where he was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Don't do it. </connor>
<connor> "Don't do one more thing. </connor>
<garnt> "I'll end you." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I love you dad, by the way. </connor>
<connor> - I was an only child </connor>
<garnt> so I never had to grow up with any siblings. </garnt>
<garnt> Never had to share anything. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah, that was... </garnt>
<garnt> I had a fairly uneventful childhood because of that. </garnt>
<joey> - In 2020, we call that privilege. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I got bullied so much in school, </connor>
<connor> so I just started just fucking punching everyone back </connor>
<joey> - I guess yeah, </joey>
<connor> if you get bullied at school, </connor>
<joey> you put a lot of pain at young age. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean that's when I first started punching back </joey>
<joey> and actually get in fights. </joey>
<joey> People just left me alone 'cause they knew if... </joey>
<joey> They would go for someone else who wouldn't fight back. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Should have just challenged them to a chess game. </garnt>
<connor> - I should've, man, </connor>
<connor> that would have definitely worked to get the kids. </connor>
<joey> - We'll play chess game </joey>
<joey> and then the moment you win and you just punch him. </joey>
<joey> It's like double down on it. </joey>
<joey> Double check me. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, dude. </connor>
<connor> There so many times I got in fights with kids. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what stories I could tell </connor>
<connor> if you want any, I mean- </connor>
<joey> - I'm just trying to think when was the... </joey>
<joey> - Do you ever punch anyone at school? </joey>
<connor> Like full on punch someone? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I have. </joey>
<joey> - For what reason? </joey>
<joey> - Because this kid in my- </joey>
<joey> - It's always dumbest fucking the school. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's because this kid in my high school </joey>
<connor> was giving me shit. </connor>
<connor> He was the bully of that year. </connor>
<connor> But the thing is he was that one bully that, </connor>
<connor> you know how some bullies are kind of like popular </connor>
<joey> with the kids that they don't bully </joey>
<joey> this kid because he bullied everybody. </joey>
<joey> Like every single person, </joey>
<connor> everybody fucking hated this kid. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And of course eventually he the rounds </connor>
<connor> and the next target was me for whatever reason, </connor>
<joey> but and obviously going to a high school </joey>
<joey> where it's 99% white boys </joey>
<joey> and I'm the only one with a nonwhite bloodline. </joey>
<garnt> - Of course, he's going for blood. </garnt>
<connor> - He's going for the low-hanging fruit essentially. </connor>
<connor> So he would say all these late horribly racial slurs </connor>
<connor> at me and stuff </connor>
<connor> and just one day he was just really... </connor>
<connor> And I didn't mind the racial slurs, </connor>
<connor> it's when he got up to my face- </connor>
<joey> - I hate that so much. </joey>
<joey> - There's a difference between bully </joey>
<connor> shouting across the playground at you- </connor>
<garnt> - And I don't mind that stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is fine, </joey>
<joey> because that shit's easy to ignore. </joey>
<garnt> - But respect my personal space. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> the moment you cross into my personal space, </joey>
<joey> that's when the hands come out. </joey>
<connor> And I never punched anyone in my life up until that point. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, there's only one way that this kid is gonna stop." </connor>
<joey> - I gotta teach this kid a lesson. </joey>
<joey> - And in my head I was doing a KG episode </joey>
<joey> where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "If I punch him, I'm either going to die </joey>
<joey> or I'm gonna come out of this alive." </joey>
<joey> - Joey's like death-noting every action. </joey>
<joey> - But, this is like the total opposite </joey>
<garnt> of the way I used to think about it. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, just punch and figure it out later. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> I was always the person who was like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, what's gonna happen </connor>
<connor> if I go down this route?" </connor>
<joey> It was like a visual novel </joey>
<joey> where I was like, punch or not punch. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't know. </joey>
<joey> "I don't wanna have to ban. </joey>
<joey> "I don't wanna get the bad end, right?" </joey>
<joey> So I was always like, </joey>
<joey> there's a very good possibility that </joey>
<connor> if I punch I'm going to just like bad end. </connor>
<joey> It just came over. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<connor> "But this kid was just relentlessly </connor>
<connor> just shouting in my face and just like..." </connor>
<connor> And then the moment he started pushing me around as well </connor>
<joey> that's when I think I just snapped. </joey>
<joey> And I just weighed all back </joey>
<joey> and just knock this kid in the chin. </joey>
<joey> I threw the fucking barking move on him. </joey>
<joey> Just like, </joey>
<joey> knocked him in the chin </joey>
<joey> and he fell down on the ground </joey>
<connor> and he just kind of walked off </connor>
<connor> and then nobody in my year fucked with me. </connor>
<connor> - That's good. </connor>
<connor> - And I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, oh?" </connor>
<joey> All right, that was a good end. </joey>
<connor> - This is more like... </connor>
<connor> I'd never recommend fighting back </connor>
<joey> 'cause it can normally like, </joey>
<joey> it can go like two ways, right? </joey>
<joey> You can either fuck up </joey>
<joey> or everyone else will wanna challenge you. </joey>
<garnt> Everyone's like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, you think you're hot shit? </connor>
<connor> "All right." </connor>
<connor> - That's like the start of a anime. </connor>
<garnt> " Oh, the nerd fall back?" </garnt>
<connor> Dude, there were kids who would like </connor>
<connor> spit on each other at school. </connor>
<connor> That was the stuff that bothered me the most. </connor>
<joey> You can call me shit, but don't spit on me. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> I hated high school. </joey>
<connor> - Did you guys have this, I don't know if </connor>
<connor> this is only an Australian high school thing, </connor>
<joey> but the last year of 12th grade, </joey>
<joey> literally the day before graduation, </joey>
<connor> I forgot what it was called. </connor>
<joey> I think it was called like G12 free day </joey>
<joey> where basically the 12th graders </joey>
<joey> for the last day of high school </joey>
<joey> they can just run around the school </joey>
<joey> and do whatever the fuck they want. </joey>
<garnt> - I think we had something similar in our school. </garnt>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<garnt> You guys didn't have that? </garnt>
<garnt> Like our school took that free day literally </garnt>
<garnt> where some fucking crazy shit would happen. </garnt>
<garnt> We somehow... </garnt>
<connor> It started off quite innocently, </connor>
<connor> like putting lube all over the stair rails </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that so people would slip on it. </connor>
<connor> And another one was going into one of the teacher's offices </connor>
<joey> and filling his entire flow with cups full of water. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - So that he could like go into his... </joey>
<joey> And then it got too far when one of, </joey>
<connor> I think it was like a group of boys, </connor>
<connor> they got one of the teachers' cars </connor>
<connor> and I don't know how the they did it. </connor>
<connor> I think it was driving a mini. </connor>
<connor> So it was like relatively small car. </connor>
<connor> And they somehow put the car </connor>
<connor> on top of one of the school buildings, </connor>
<joey> like on the roof. </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - And I mean, that's too far </garnt>
<connor> but that's just sounds impressive. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, the engineering. </garnt>
<joey> These kids going places. </joey>
<joey> - I wasn't there to witness it, </joey>
<connor> but imagine just walking to school </connor>
<connor> and you're walking along the school wall </connor>
<connor> and you just look up and there's just a car sitting there. </connor>
<connor> I was like, </connor>
<joey> "Huh, how did that get there?" </joey>
<connor> - This must have been in the news or some shit. </connor>
<joey> - Non, no, no. </joey>
<joey> This is quite frequent. </joey>
<garnt> - That sounds like a scene from some American- </garnt>
<joey> - Frequent? </joey>
<joey> What do you mean frequent? </joey>
<joey> - This sounds like a scene </joey>
<joey> from some American high school movie </joey>
<garnt> that you watch and you're like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, this is so fucking stupid. </joey>
<joey> "This will never happen in real life." </joey>
<joey> I don't know if my high school still does it, but- </joey>
<connor> - That's newsworthy in the UK, I think. </connor>
<joey> That would be, </joey>
<connor> yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - Even the goal schools would go crazy </connor>
<connor> like that as well just- </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> We didn't have any of this. </joey>
<connor> - Because it was the last, last day of high school. </connor>
<connor> So it's like, do whatever the fuck you want while you can </connor>
<joey> because after this day you have adult responsibility. </joey>
<joey> So it's the Miley Cyrus effect, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, just get all that out of the way </joey>
<joey> once the contract has ended and you're good to go. </joey>
<garnt> - But like I said, he must've learned some good skills </garnt>
<garnt> from being able to fucking get a mini on a school roof. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - How would you do that even if- </garnt>
<joey> - It wasn't like a multi-story building, </joey>
<joey> it was like a demountable. </joey>
<joey> So it was just getting it up, but still. </joey>
<connor> - How? </connor>
<connor> Did like eight of them coordinate this lift? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I wasn't there to witness it, but it was awesome </connor>
<joey> just staring across the school grounds </joey>
<joey> and seeing a fucking mini on top of a demountable. </joey>
<joey> That was crazy. </joey>
<connor> - How do you convince kids to join, </connor>
<connor> " Yeah, so we gonna go lift the teachers mini. </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, you down?" </joey>
<joey> - "I need like five boys who's in." </joey>
<joey> It's like, </joey>
<garnt> "All right, let's fucking do it." </garnt>
<garnt> - Speaking of like high school, </garnt>
<connor> why is there so many high school anime? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Wow, that transition gone, damn. </connor>
<connor> - I was just mad- </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit, he's on it. </connor>
<joey> - I'm fucking on it. </joey>
<garnt> - What's the deal with high school anime? </garnt>
<joey> What's the deal with high school anime? </joey>
<connor> - Because that sounds crazier </connor>
<garnt> than any fucking high school anime </garnt>
<connor> I've ever heard of- </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, some crazy high school anime out there. </garnt>
<connor> - It's either one or two ways. </connor>
<garnt> It's either like the most vanilla- </garnt>
<joey> - Did you guys have school festivals in your high school? </joey>
<garnt> Like how they have in Japan? </garnt>
<joey> I think that's only Japanese high school thing, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - In Japan, they make school looks so fun. </connor>
<connor> And British school are the most depressing shit on earth. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh no, I like it. </garnt>
<connor> - They don't do anything. </connor>
<garnt> - You guys are here telling your high school stories. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't remember a fuck.. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember fuck off my high school. </garnt>
<connor> - All I remember is bad, bad, bad things. </connor>
<joey> - See, people always say that, I think I like the 1% </joey>
<joey> that actually had a good time in high school. </joey>
<connor> - I think I had a good... </connor>
<joey> I liked my friend group a lot </joey>
<joey> that I had those four of us </joey>
<garnt> and we were all really close, </garnt>
<garnt> but stuff that happened in school was just always awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like it was what? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I got in so many fights as a kid. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like there was one time as well, </joey>
<connor> this is one story I remember. </connor>
<connor> And this drove my blood life through the roof, dude. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So there's a day in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you do this in Australia </connor>
<connor> where the kids who are coming into high school </connor>
<connor> get like two days in like June, </connor>
<connor> before September starts. </connor>
<connor> Where they get to just come and see the school. </connor>
<connor> And my little brother was coming up, right? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, like an orientation. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I was showing my little brother around. </joey>
<joey> I'm one of the guys just, the bullies </joey>
<connor> just comes up to me while I'm talking to my little brother </connor>
<connor> just slaps me in the face. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Just slapped me in the face. </connor>
<connor> And I'd already been in multiple fights at this point. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And me, I get slapped down like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, it's go time." </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The hands are coming out. </joey>
<joey> - You slapped me first. </joey>
<connor> I'm not gonna get in shit now if I beat you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I started fighting him and I- </garnt>
<connor> - In front of your little brother? </connor>
<garnt> - This is so weird to me. </garnt>
<garnt> In what world is this just- </garnt>
<connor> - He literally- </connor>
<garnt> - Does this thing just happen? </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally just slaps me. </garnt>
<connor> And then I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Wait there." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was thinking, </connor>
<connor> I've got to show my little brother </connor>
<connor> I'm not a pussy, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - He's my little brother. </joey>
<joey> He looks up to me. </joey>
<joey> I've got to show him I'm not a bitch. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if he see we get slapped and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, sorry, sorry." </joey>
<joey> He's gonna think, </joey>
<connor> "Wow, my big brother is kind of wimp. </connor>
<garnt> " What's up with that?" </garnt>
<garnt> - It sounds like a inbetweeners episode or something. </garnt>
<connor> - It is, because then it turns to a tournament arc </connor>
<connor> where then all his friends the next day we're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh well, we want to turn now." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> And there was one time, </connor>
<connor> and this is pretty the one where I felt most bad </connor>
<connor> is that this guy came up to me. </connor>
<connor> He's like kind of chubby and I thought, </connor>
<connor> "What are you doing? </connor>
<connor> "What are you doing, man? </connor>
<connor> "What's up with this?" </connor>
<connor> He pushes me once. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, fine." </connor>
<connor> I grabbed his head and just fucking knee him. </connor>
<joey> Bear in mind... </joey>
<joey> Okay, I do not do not condone violence in any sense, but- </joey>
<joey> - But I loved it. </joey>
<joey> - I was such an angry 13 year old </joey>
<connor> 'cause I was getting bullied since like- </connor>
<joey> - You were 13 when you did this? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> You weren't even in high school, </joey>
<joey> you were like middle school. </joey>
<connor> - No, not like 13, like 15, 14, maybe 15. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, still. </joey>
<joey> - 15, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Then this guy didn't... </joey>
<joey> I've never had a problem with this guy. </joey>
<joey> I didn't realize why he was doing this to me </joey>
<joey> but I think I pissed off one of his friends </joey>
<joey> and then he was trying to act big. </joey>
<joey> I don't think he actually wanted to fight. </joey>
<connor> He was just pushing me around, but I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck it." </connor>
<connor> Anyway, so I did that and he just dropped and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh no. </connor>
<connor> "Oh no. </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble." </connor>
<connor> I don't think I did it that hard. </connor>
<connor> I just thought, </connor>
<connor> I saw it in a movie once it looked really fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I saw him do it once, I can do it too." </joey>
<garnt> - "Who gets hurt by getting kneeled in the face?" </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - He's was like, </connor>
<joey> he's smaller than me. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> So he pushed me and then I think I was gonna go push, </connor>
<connor> I just went like, </connor>
<connor> And he just dropped for like five seconds. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, shit, are you okay?" </connor>
<connor> And he was like, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine." </joey>
<joey> And I think he was so embarrassed, he didn't tell anyone. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - And then he came in the next day, two black eyes. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, how did he get to two black eyes? </connor>
<connor> - How wide is your kneel? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'cause I feel like I hit right here. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I was gonna say- </joey>
<connor> - So he came in with two black eyes. </connor>
<connor> Didn't tell anyone, but all my friends knew what happened. </connor>
<connor> No one said anything. </connor>
<connor> It was like that one week </connor>
<connor> where I had like three fights, right? </connor>
<connor> No one did anything for me. </connor>
<connor> The rest of my school life. </connor>
<connor> It was great. </connor>
<connor> Everyone was nice to me after that. </connor>
<joey> - You had more fights in that one week </joey>
<joey> than I think I have in my entire life. </joey>
<joey> - I think I had more fights in that one week </joey>
<garnt> than anyone else- </garnt>
<joey> - This is like fight club. </joey>
<connor> - In my school it wasn't about getting into fights. </connor>
<connor> It was about who did you know? </connor>
<connor> If you're cool with X person, </connor>
<connor> if you're cool with that person, he wouldn't fuck with you. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if it's 'cause it's like a small town thing. </connor>
<connor> It was such a small town thing </connor>
<connor> and where the teachers often forgave the shitty behavior </connor>
<joey> 'cause more often than not all the teachers were friends </joey>
<joey> with the kids' parents, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So it was kind of a thing of like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, don't do it again. </joey>
<connor> "Don't do it again." </connor>
<garnt> - You need someone in the face- </garnt>
<connor> - Every single time it was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Don't do it again. </garnt>
<garnt> "Don't do it again." </garnt>
<joey> - There wasn't a proper punishment? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it is what it is. </joey>
<joey> I don't really care now. </joey>
<joey> I dealt with it myself. </joey>
<connor> - Did you go to a boy's school? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> So maybe that's the aspect of it, right? </connor>
<connor> Because I feel that boys </connor>
<joey> will be more willing to get into fights </joey>
<joey> if it's a coed school </joey>
<joey> because they're trying to impress the girls. </joey>
<connor> - I never wanted to. </connor>
<connor> I just wanted to play my games and be- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but it just seems like fucking fight club. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, it was fucking awful. </garnt>
<joey> I joke about it, </joey>
<joey> but I remember hating it when I was in school. </joey>
<joey> - I probably fucking hate it too if it was that- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I remember there was one guy who would like... </connor>
<joey> He didn't wanna fight me. </joey>
<joey> He didn't want to fight me. </joey>
<connor> I think he knew that he'd get hurt. </connor>
<connor> So he would just, </connor>
<connor> or like I said, he would spit on me </connor>
<connor> and anytime I tried to like fight him, he just run away. </connor>
<connor> So what can I do? </connor>
<connor> It's like that one asshole </connor>
<connor> who like kites amazingly, he's like, </connor>
<garnt> "Come to me." </garnt>
<joey> - His torn games like on point. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And he'd just kite you and he- </garnt>
<connor> - He was just kitting me, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Fucking stop. </connor>
<connor> "Stop" </connor>
<connor> Actually he'd run to an area with teachers, </connor>
<connor> and I can't fucking punch him in front of a teacher. </connor>
<garnt> - He'd make a amazing ADC anime, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> He'd make a great one. </garnt>
<garnt> I swear. </garnt>
<connor> I'm behind, man. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Me fight? </connor>
<connor> "Don't think?" </connor>
<connor> But like no, I wouldn't... </connor>
<connor> Okay, if any 13 year old, 14 old kids, don't fight. </connor>
<connor> It's not a good solution. </connor>
<connor> - It's not worthy it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I was just lucky </connor>
<connor> that I was freakishly strong for a 12, 13 year old as well. </connor>
<connor> That helped a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, 'cause for me </garnt>
<connor> I've always gone through life being like, </connor>
<garnt> okay, physical interaction is always my last choice. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I have that now. </joey>
<connor> But as a kid, I felt like it was my only, you know? </connor>
<joey> - You went the hard way. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I'm glad that I was angry as a kid </connor>
<connor> 'cause now I have like zero anger at all. </connor>
<connor> I never get angry about shit now. </connor>
<connor> And I'm so glad that I just got that shit out, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if that's how anger works. </connor>
<joey> I don't know if this is science. </joey>
<joey> - Not sure about that, it's- </joey>
<joey> - But I feel like 'cause I've dealt with so much anger </joey>
<joey> in my past I've been able to really, </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking channel it right. </joey>
<joey> - It's like filled your anger quota of life </joey>
<joey> during your teens, and it's like- </joey>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<connor> - So I'm run dry now. </connor>
<joey> I genuinely think I have that. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know, I don't feel- </garnt>
<garnt> - You just go down the system now. </garnt>
<garnt> I get like mildly frustrated at things. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a British person would, </garnt>
<connor> but I never get angry at things. </connor>
<garnt> - Mildly frustrated is just the British... </garnt>
<garnt> That's just the default British emotion. </garnt>
<garnt> Anything can be mildly frustrate you, </garnt>
<garnt> and that's just the way we've just grown up. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'll be angry about shit now, </connor>
<connor> but I'll be like angry </connor>
<garnt> I play it up 'cause I liked your shouting, </garnt>
<garnt> but is like the chillest man on earth. </garnt>
<connor> Like it's impossible to get mad. </connor>
<connor> I've never actually seen you mad. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean that's the whole monk thing, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Do you want to talk about it? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Have we talked about that in a podcast? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> I guess I got to tell the story now. </joey>
<connor> - That was a smooth transition, you see that boys? </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna get to the toilet before. </connor>
<connor> - He needs to santa up. </connor>
<joey> (foreign language) </joey>
<joey> - Damn that was- </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Am I watching an anime right now? </joey>
<connor> Damn, son. </connor>
<connor> - What are we talking about today, Joe? </connor>
<joey> - We're talking about two particular series </joey>
<joey> that Book Walker is releasing on their website. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if you've heard of it, Connor? </joey>
<joey> I'm sure Garnt you've heard of it, but there is two series. </joey>
<connor> There's one called TenPuru, </connor>
<connor> which is about a temple. </connor>
<connor> Surprise, surprise. </connor>
<joey> - With a monk. </joey>
<joey> - With a monk. </joey>
<joey> Perfect segue into the next part of the show. </joey>
<joey> But also the other one is </joey>
<connor> (foreign language) </connor>
<connor> which I don't know what the English title of is- </connor>
<connor> - Why the Hell Are You Here Teacher? </connor>
<joey> - That's it. </joey>
<joey> - I've seen episode one of this show. </joey>
<connor> Oh my goodness gracious that is not Christian, </connor>
<connor> but I'm so glad I can read it on Book Walker </connor>
<connor> in the comfort of my home. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, 'cause on Book Walker, </garnt>
<garnt> the manga is completely uncensored. </garnt>
<garnt> You get full nibs and everything. </garnt>
<joey> If you've ever thought about getting with your teacher. </joey>
<joey> That's basically the show. </joey>
<joey> That's basically the manga. </joey>
<garnt> - I need no more. </garnt>
<joey> - You might need more </joey>
<joey> because the other manga that they have it is TenPuru, </joey>
<joey> which is illustrated by the same guy. </joey>
<connor> No, sorry, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Illustrated by the same guy who did Grand Blue. </connor>
<connor> You know Grand Blue? </connor>
<connor> - I do know Grand Blue. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so illustrated by the complete same guy </connor>
<connor> just different writer. </connor>
<connor> But essentially as the name suggests it's about this kid </connor>
<connor> who has these really dirty thoughts </connor>
<connor> but he wants to be a good Christian. </connor>
<joey> So he basically goes to it a temple </joey>
<joey> to get rid of this horny on main Christian thoughts. </joey>
<joey> But the problem is is that he becomes a monk </joey>
<joey> at a temple that is full of hot women. </joey>
<garnt> - That doesn't sound very monkly to me. </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't happen to you? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I wanna be a monk, I swear. </garnt>
<joey> - This was the real reason I became the monk. </joey>
<joey> - Hoping for that scenario. </joey>
<garnt> - That's sounds pretty good. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> But the thing is </joey>
<joey> because it's illustrated by the same guy </joey>
<connor> to Grand Blue, the type of comedy </connor>
<connor> is exactly the same as Grand Blue. </connor>
<connor> So you love the like really vulgar visual </connor>
<joey> that really made Grand Blue funny, </joey>
<joey> TenPuru is exactly the same way. </joey>
<joey> And the added bonus is that </joey>
<joey> it's way more hot girls ain TenPuru than Grand Blue so. </joey>
<connor> - Guys, I'm getting some breaking news from Book Walker here </connor>

<connor> Thank you. </connor>
<connor> Back to the video. </connor>
<garnt> - So yeah, it's a little known secrets </garnt>
<garnt> or it's a little known fact that I've been a monk in my life </garnt>
<garnt> but I've not just been a monk once. </garnt>
<joey> - Just saying that is so cool. </joey>
<garnt> - To me, this is just part of Buddhist culture. </garnt>
<connor> So in Buddhist culture, normally when you want to </connor>
<connor> give your family like good karma, </connor>
<connor> everyone in my family has been a monk </connor>
<joey> like twice in their life. </joey>
<joey> Once when they're a teenager. </joey>
<joey> And once when they're like an adult. </joey>
<connor> So you become a monk </connor>
<connor> once when you're like a teenager. </connor>
<connor> We call that (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> and then you become a full monk when you become an adult </joey>
<joey> and that's when you kind of hit like your early 20s. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - So yeah, so normally a lot of people would just do it </joey>
<joey> for like one or two days </joey>
<joey> 'cause we believe that it's good karma. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when I was about 12 or 13 </connor>
<connor> I was a monk for two weeks. </connor>
<garnt> And then afterwards, when I was about 22, 23 </garnt>
<garnt> I was a monk for a full month. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jeez. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you told me stories about </joey>
<joey> how you are a monk for an entire month </joey>
<joey> but I never knew that you did it twice. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, to me it's just part of like being a Buddhist </garnt>
<garnt> and trying to get... </garnt>
<connor> I was that good little Asian kid. </connor>
<connor> I was trying to give like my family </connor>
<connor> good karma and everything. </connor>
<connor> But I honestly liked the experience </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was... </connor>
<joey> I'm not joking when it was literally </joey>
<joey> the life changing experience for me. </joey>
<joey> That was me before being a monk. </joey>
<joey> And then there's me after being a monk </joey>
<joey> because normally people would just do it just to impress </joey>
<connor> their family and just give their family a good karma. </connor>
<connor> But I told my mom, </connor>
<connor> if I'm gonna do it, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go all the way. </connor>
<joey> There's some temples that you go </joey>
<joey> to that don't take it as seriously. </joey>
<connor> And then I went to a fucking hardcore temple </connor>
<connor> where we didn't have any technology, we had to... </connor>
<connor> Okay, so here here's my daily schedule. </connor>
<garnt> So I would have to wake up at around 4:00 AM. </garnt>
<joey> - That already sounds like torture. </joey>
<joey> That already sounds like torture. </joey>
<joey> - I have to be ready, </joey>
<joey> have to be completely ready by five. </joey>
<joey> And we didn't have any beds. </joey>
<joey> We had a concrete floor </joey>
<joey> and one little pillow to sleep on. </joey>
<connor> And we had the thinnest blanket in the world, </connor>
<connor> which wasn't so bad 'cause it's Thailand. </connor>
<connor> But when sometimes when you're sleeping </connor>
<connor> in the middle of the forest, </connor>
<connor> 'cause there would be times when we just go out </connor>
<connor> to your temple in the middle of the forest. </connor>
<connor> You can get fucking cold. </connor>
<connor> The temperature drops </connor>
<connor> to about two or three degrees sometimes. </connor>
<joey> And you just have this like tiny little blanket </joey>
<connor> on a concrete floor to keep you warm. </connor>
<joey> So we'd have to wake up by four, get ready by five. </joey>
<joey> And then we just be like meditating and praying </joey>
<joey> for a good two, three hours every day. </joey>
<connor> And then afterwards we would basically go out, </connor>
<connor> barefoot, go to whatever village </connor>
<connor> or whatever area around the temple. </connor>
<connor> And people would just donate the food to... </connor>
<joey> We would carry like these little baskets on our necks </joey>
<joey> and people would come over and they would donate food </joey>
<joey> or whatever they wanna donate because we believe </joey>
<joey> that if you give two a monk, that's a good karma as well. </joey>
<connor> So the food that we got donated, that's what we would eat. </connor>
<garnt> So we would walk around for a few hours- </garnt>
<garnt> - The entire day? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, For the entire day. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you get a lot of it or was it like just enough or? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, you get what you're given. </connor>
<connor> You have no choice about what you could eat. </connor>
<garnt> You could eat basically what you were given. </garnt>
<connor> Did you ever get anything like super nasty? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I mean, it's- </garnt>
<connor> - In the mindset, you're not like picky and like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh really? </garnt>
<garnt> "A Snickers? </garnt>
<garnt> "Really?" </garnt>
<joey> - No, because the whole point of being a monk </joey>
<connor> is that you live- </connor>
<connor> - You don't care. - You don't care. </connor>
<connor> You eat to survive. </connor>
<connor> I guess if you're caring about that that's like- </connor>
<connor> - That's the feet and the point of being a monk </connor>
<connor> So you get what you're given </connor>
<connor> and you live the simplest life </connor>
<connor> you can possibly live and you basically eat to survive </connor>
<joey> and you get one meal a day. </joey>
<joey> And you gotta be okay with whatever you get given. </joey>
<joey> So we would eat at around 11 to 12 o'clock </joey>
<connor> and that would be our first and only meal a day. </connor>
<connor> It was easier when you're a kid monk </connor>
<connor> 'cause kid monks would get two meals a day. </connor>
<connor> - But when you're grown. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, when you're adult </connor>
<connor> when you're more grown up </connor>
<connor> burning more calories, no you got to survive </connor>
<connor> on one meal a day. </connor>
<joey> And afterwards you could... </joey>
<joey> There was no cheesing. </joey>
<joey> So after that you couldn't have any milk </joey>
<joey> or any like liquids that had calories </joey>
<connor> you could only have water </connor>
<connor> or some kinds of fruit juices. </connor>
<connor> And that was it. </connor>
<connor> And, yeah, It was very... </connor>
<connor> I don't know really how to describe the experience. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause imagine if you just take </connor>
<connor> every distraction out of your life </connor>
<connor> and you just live the simplest life possible </connor>
<connor> you don't eat to enjoy your food. </connor>
<connor> You don't really get the pleasures in life </connor>
<connor> but at the same time, you just kind of </connor>
<connor> you're okay with everything </connor>
<connor> 'cause you have to be okay with everything. </connor>
<connor> And I remember for the first week of being a monk, </connor>
<connor> it's fucking hard. </connor>
<connor> It is so fucking hard to reprogram your brain </connor>
<joey> to not only be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, how do I distract myself with my phone? </joey>
<joey> "How do I not check Twitter? </joey>
<joey> "How do I not watch YouTube videos? </joey>
<joey> "How do I just be okay with my own thoughts?" </joey>
<joey> And it's so hard </joey>
<joey> because nowadays your brain </joey>
<joey> constantly looks forward to something. </joey>
<joey> It constantly needs something to distract itself. </joey>
<joey> And the first week I was just kind of </joey>
<joey> like a drug addict, right? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I should have tweaked. </connor>
<connor> Give me a tweak </connor>
<connor> - I'm sitting there trying to meditate </connor>
<connor> and my mind just going out a million miles an hour. </connor>
<connor> I haven't watched TV in a week. </connor>
<connor> I haven't seen a screen in a week. </connor>
<connor> It's very, very difficult. </connor>
<connor> But the more time you do it, </connor>
<connor> the more you kind of you realize that, </connor>
<connor> oh, these are all just distractions. </connor>
<connor> You can be completely okay with just yourself </connor>
<connor> and your own thoughts and just doing the simplest things </connor>
<connor> and life activities. </connor>
<connor> And then when I got to that point </connor>
<connor> I kind of just had time to just reflect on my entire life. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause what else are you gonna fucking do </connor>
<connor> when you have nothing to do </connor>
<joey> but literally think back about every decision </joey>
<joey> that you've made in your life. </joey>
<connor> And the way your mind works, </connor>
<connor> you know when sometimes you're lying in bed at 11:00 AM </connor>
<connor> and your brain reminds you </connor>
<connor> about the embarrassing thing you did when you were 12 </connor>
<connor> or maybe by that time when you punched a fucking kid? </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I gotta- </connor>
<connor> - So just imagine your entire day just being that </connor>
<connor> just being like, </connor>
<connor> "Ah, I wonder if I'd made the right choice </connor>
<connor> "at this point in my life." </connor>
<connor> And then what happened to me was that </connor>
<connor> I kind of just reflected on every little decision </connor>
<connor> that kind of led me up to this point in my life. </connor>
<connor> And what it made me, </connor>
<connor> what it forced me to do was really think, </connor>
<joey> "Huh, am I really happy about where I am now? </joey>
<joey> "What's my life gonna be like when this monk had ends?" </joey>
<joey> And I was at a really bad point in my life </joey>
<joey> before I became a monk, </joey>
<joey> which is kind of why I really wanted to commit </joey>
<joey> to the facts of being like, </joey>
<joey> if I was gonna be a monk, I'm gonna go all the way, </joey>
<joey> get the full detox, you know? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've seen some temples, you walk in </joey>
<joey> and they have like a 50 inch flat screen. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Does this-" </joey>
<joey> - The monk channel only. </joey>
<joey> We only have the monk channel. </joey>
<connor> - This doesn't seem very monkly to me. </connor>
<connor> I don't know about that. </connor>
<connor> - We accept PayPal transactions. </connor>
<connor> - It's on the TV, </connor>
<connor> on it's like a live stream of a different temple </connor>
<garnt> and then French. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Nice, nice content. </joey>
<joey> - So it forced me to just reflect on my entire life. </joey>
<joey> And it forced me to really think about </joey>
<garnt> what I wanted to do after my monkhood ended. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was truly a, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to say fucking... </garnt>
<garnt> It was a spiritual journey </garnt>
<garnt> and I really just discovered myself- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I think in this instance you can </joey>
<joey> because it nearly sounds like it. </joey>
<joey> - It kind of was. </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> You're like, it's- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like me when I go to the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> without my phone, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm free" </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Because people have talked to me about </connor>
<connor> how they've had similar experiences </connor>
<connor> when they just shut off social media </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - You don't even know. </connor>
<joey> You won't even know. </joey>
<joey> " Bruh, you don't even know." </joey>
<connor> - Get on my level. </connor>
<joey> - Get on my level, bro. </joey>
<connor> You didn't have any board games. </connor>
<connor> You didn't have any cards to just play around. </connor>
<connor> All you just had was just yourself. </connor>
<garnt> And I can't really convey how alien that is </garnt>
<garnt> because it was alien for me as well. </garnt>
<joey> - There is a part of me that just a vision, </joey>
<joey> 'cause as you said, </joey>
<connor> the only thing you had was just yourself and your mind. </connor>
<connor> And all I could imagine was just, a monk guy </connor>
<joey> just sitting there </joey>
<joey> and just thinking of a funny jokes in the locker room. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> That totally happened as well. </connor>
<connor> When I was a monk, that's when I thought about, </connor>
<garnt> "There's a series I wanna make called Anime in Minutes." </garnt>
<joey> - Are you serious right now? </joey>
<joey> - I'm totally serious. </joey>
<garnt> I'm totally serious. </garnt>
<joey> That came to me, </joey>
<joey> I remember the exact moment, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I was just walking around, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm walking around one of the Thai villages </garnt>
<joey> and it just fucking came to me. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember last, </joey>
<joey> not last week but a few weeks ago </joey>
<joey> I talked about being Zen on the fucking toilet in a shower. </joey>
<joey> So that was I kind of... </joey>
<joey> Sometimes when I'm just walking </joey>
<connor> and I'm just zoning out. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I've reached this point when </connor>
<connor> a lot of ideas just come to me </connor>
<connor> and it came to me when I was a monk as well. </connor>
<connor> And I got a lot of video ideas </connor>
<garnt> and a lot of ideas when I was a monk, </garnt>
<connor> which it was these ideas when I was a monk </connor>
<joey> that have developed to me to my comeback on YouTube, </joey>
<joey> where I figured out, </joey>
<joey> okay, if I'm gonna come back on YouTube, </joey>
<joey> how was I gonna come back on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, this has been a very closely guarded secret </joey>
<joey> because there were some YouTube, </joey>
<joey> some very odd YouTube clips </joey>
<joey> where I'm just wearing a beanie. </joey>
<joey> And nobody knows why I'm just wearing a beanie. </joey>
<joey> And it was because I had just finished my monkhood </joey>
<joey> and I was just completely bold. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> What if they just like took it in a really dark direction? </joey>
<connor> It's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh no, the cancer treatment." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, how do you sign up to be a monk? </connor>
<connor> Is it like a Facebook group, you're like, </connor>
<connor> " I wanna be a monk." </connor>
<garnt> Do you just rock up and be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Yo, let's do it." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean you just turn up to whatever temple </garnt>
<connor> you want to become a monk. </connor>
<connor> And they're like... </connor>
<connor> okay, you go to the head monk and you request to be a monk. </connor>
<connor> And they ask, okay, before you become a monk </connor>
<connor> you need to make sure you have no outstanding debts. </connor>
<connor> You basically, you've got to give up or material connections </connor>
<joey> to the world before you can commit to becoming a monk. </joey>
<joey> And you'll have this interview now you're like, </joey>
<joey> okay, if you're gonna become a monk, </joey>
<joey> you got to do this, do this, do this. </joey>
<garnt> - You know what would be a really cool idea </garnt>
<connor> for this channel is if like us three somehow </connor>
<connor> went to a temple here and just like experienced it </connor>
<connor> for like a single that day. </connor>
<connor> Wow, I was just already on that shit. </connor>
<connor> Hey, if you guys would like to see that. </connor>
<connor> - Monk episode when? </connor>
<connor> - Monk episode, like Garnt could be </connor>
<connor> like head monk of trash taste. </connor>
<connor> - We have to shave our heads. </connor>
<joey> Did you realize that, Joey? </joey>
<joey> - Shit. </joey>
<joey> I just noticed that. </joey>
<joey> - I can commit to that, you can't. </joey>
<joey> - I can't commit to that. </joey>
<joey> I'll just wear the beanie. </joey>
<garnt> - But I don't really talk about it </garnt>
<garnt> but now by now that I am, </garnt>
<garnt> I do like highly recommend that kind of experience. </garnt>
<garnt> So or just do it doing that kind of experience. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause you don't notice how distracting life is. </connor>
<connor> You don't realize that as soon as you wake up </connor>
<connor> you've got things to occupy your mind. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You got your job or you got, </connor>
<connor> the first thing you do is you check Twitter, </connor>
<connor> open Arknights and you don't know how crazy </connor>
<connor> your mind can be sometimes. </connor>
<connor> So, you've literally remove every distraction, </connor>
<connor> every commitments that you need to do from your daily life. </connor>
<connor> And you just have nothing 'cause it's just a void, right? </connor>
<connor> You're just giving you life a void. </connor>
<connor> And because you give your life a void, </connor>
<garnt> it fucking changes you. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know how else I can- </garnt>
<joey> - I totally get that. </joey>
<joey> Back when I was still doing YouTube stuff, </joey>
<joey> I went on this like camping trip </joey>
<connor> with a few of my friends and we went to this area </connor>
<connor> that had absolutely no reception whatsoever. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, Wales? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we went all the way to Wales. </joey>
<joey> No, we were just </joey>
<connor> in the butt fuck middle of nowhere in Australia </connor>
<connor> with no reception. </connor>
<connor> And we would just went camping. </connor>
<connor> And because there's no reception, I couldn't shake anything. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't like message you. </connor>
<connor> - This is like a lite version. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's basically just like dieting, diet version of it. </joey>
<connor> But I kind of had like a similar experience with that. </connor>
<connor> But only like for that one day </connor>
<connor> and I remember the first couple of hours, </connor>
<connor> I fucking hated it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was just, I was getting those like drugs like, </connor>
<joey> "I need to know who liked my tweet." </joey>
<joey> But after a while, when I hit around midday, </joey>
<connor> I eventually was like, </connor>
<connor> "You know what? </connor>
<connor> "This is actually really nice. </connor>
<joey> "The world is beautiful." </joey>
<connor> - That's why I love going to the cinema. </connor>
<connor> No one can like, be like, </connor>
<connor> "Why don't you answer your phone?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In every other situation, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you should have answered still." </connor>
<joey> But in the cinema for some reason, </joey>
<joey> They're like, </joey>
<joey> "Understandable. </joey>
<joey> "Have a nice day." </joey>
<joey> "You ignored my texts for three hours" </joey>
<joey> "Understandable." </joey>
<joey> - You're just like a void. </joey>
<connor> - It's great, I love it. </connor>
<connor> You just literally ignore the world </connor>
<joey> for like three hours and just have fun. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and that's why it frustrates me when </joey>
<joey> the void gets pulled back to reality </joey>
<garnt> when someone in the back is just fucking shouting. </garnt>
<connor> I just be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, yeah, I forgot this is reality." </garnt>
<joey> I hate it. </joey>
<garnt> - Because especially now I think, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know the Internet's I feel like has reprogrammed </joey>
<connor> my brain in a way. </connor>
<connor> - Definitely. </connor>
<connor> I don't remember, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I just have ADHD </connor>
<garnt> because I didn't always felt like </garnt>
<garnt> I was this easily distracted. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like subconsciously building patents </connor>
<joey> in your head thou. </joey>
<joey> You've trained your brain to check Twitter constantly. </joey>
<joey> And you will have that moment </joey>
<joey> and I'm sure you've all had it </joey>
<joey> where you're like you, </joey>
<joey> open Twitter, you close Twitter and you open Twitter again. </joey>
<joey> And then you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Why did I open Twitter again?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> - I literally just refreshed my feed like two seconds ago. </connor>
<connor> I didn't wanna to do this. </connor>
<joey> I just didn't. </joey>
<garnt> - You check Twitter on your computer </garnt>
<joey> and you realize there's nothing to changed </joey>
<joey> and then you close and you immediately checking your phone. </joey>
<connor> - "Why am I doing this?" </connor>
<joey> I wasted ten seconds. </joey>
<joey> - It's the same as course as going to the fridge, </joey>
<joey> see nothing, then closing it, sitting on back on the couch. </joey>
<joey> And then five minutes later then go to the fridge. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like food's gonna magically appear in the fridge. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So, I mean, it was an awesome experience to me. </garnt>
<joey> I don't, if that's not something that's... </joey>
<joey> it's not an experience for everyone. </joey>
<garnt> - The question is though, would you do it again? </garnt>
<garnt> - I would do it again possibly. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe not to this extreme </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like I'm in a lot better place in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a lot more privileged. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I mean, not just that, but mentally. </garnt>
<connor> I'm in a lot better place in my life as well. </connor>
<connor> So I don't feel, I would need to go to that extreme again </connor>
<garnt> but would I want an experience </garnt>
<garnt> where I just kind of just remove myself from the world </garnt>
<garnt> and just give myself- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, just like a short detox. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like a detoxing the mind. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's how I feel it. </joey>
<connor> And I highly recommend people doing that. </connor>
<connor> It sounds really cheesy </connor>
<connor> because people will always think of that </connor>
<connor> like some crazy California- </connor>
<joey> - Gap year. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I took a gap year to Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly that, right? </garnt>
<joey> - It's just like, </joey>
<joey> "Shut up, dude. </joey>
<joey> You probably went to the club every night. </joey>
<joey> "Shut up." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So that's why I don't really like to talk about it </joey>
<connor> because whenever you say, yeah, I've been a monk- </connor>
<connor> - It sounds pretentious. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds pretentious. </connor>
<garnt> People give you that look to be like, why- </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it makes it sound like </connor>
<connor> it was like a vacation for you, </connor>
<joey> whereas it was pretty, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's why it sounds pretentious. </connor>
<connor> - Or maybe it sounds like it </connor>
<joey> because maybe some people think you just went through </joey>
<joey> adjust to brag about it later on. </joey>
<joey> The fact that you don't really talk about this. </joey>
<joey> - I never talk about this- </joey>
<joey> - I remember I dragged that conversation out of you </joey>
<joey> but we were really drunk in Singapore </joey>
<joey> like three years ago. </joey>
<joey> - I think I just drunkenly offhanded mentioned it. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Hold on, you were a monk?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Were you ever angry before you were a monk? </connor>
<connor> Because I swear, I've never seen you angry. </connor>
<connor> What's up with that, Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I've been angry before, but- </garnt>
<connor> - You don't get... </connor>
<connor> Even when you're angry, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> dude, I don't know if you're angry, angry or maybe- </connor>
<garnt> - No, being a monk just taught me how to </garnt>
<joey> think about the whole process. </joey>
<joey> Basically, process everything, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when you just kind of empty your mind part of </joey>
<connor> the commitment we tried to make is that </connor>
<connor> we tried to learn how we process our way of thinking. </connor>
<connor> And you gotta kind of... </connor>
<joey> So the way I see it, it's kind of like a logic tree. </joey>
<joey> And this is what happened to me when I was a monk </joey>
<connor> where I'd feel certain emotions I need to have to </connor>
<connor> like logically think be like, </connor>
<connor> Why am I feeling this? </connor>
<connor> How did this come? </connor>
<connor> And then you kind of learned the roots </connor>
<connor> of basically all your emotions and just anger. </connor>
<connor> And then through that I just on the fly </connor>
<joey> I learned how to deal with my anger. </joey>
<joey> I would find another route to be like, </joey>
<joey> okay, before I get angry </joey>
<connor> maybe I could try dealing it with another way, </connor>
<connor> which is why I've rarely get angry. </connor>
<connor> Some people get angry very easily but for me, </connor>
<connor> it's not that I don't get angry </connor>
<connor> is that I just have different ways of dealing </connor>
<connor> about it than shouting or fucking- </connor>
<connor> - I just love shouting, man. </connor>
<garnt> I don't punch anyone anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> That's old Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> Old Connor's gone, new Connor </garnt>
<garnt> he just West coast it and shouts loudly. </garnt>
<connor> - I love shouting. </connor>
<joey> When I shout, I fucking love shouting. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why shouting is so fun. </connor>
<joey> - So is the deal like purposely shout </joey>
<joey> to just get that frustration out before it turns </joey>
<joey> into legit anger or? </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes if I'm like real angry some days, </connor>
<connor> or I wake up and I'm upset, </connor>
<connor> I'll just go in the mirror and I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Come on." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I only see that in movies, right? </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't be surprised if you're the kind of person </joey>
<joey> who just punches the pillow. </joey>
<joey> Let's get all the frustration out, but- </joey>
<joey> - I just imagined you </joey>
<garnt> in the fucking morning every morning- </garnt>
<joey> - Do it. </joey>
<connor> - Like in the mirror, </connor>
<connor> "You got this Connor. </connor>
<connor> "You got this. </connor>
<garnt> "You fucking got this." </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, some days you wake up, </garnt>
<connor> you'll feel like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, I'm kind of feeling shitty today, man. </connor>
<connor> "I don't know why, man. </connor>
<connor> "I'm kind of worthless." </connor>
<connor> I get in front of that mirror, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "You can do this." </connor>
<connor> My neighbors probably hate me. </connor>
<connor> Fuck it, I'm hype. </connor>
<connor> I'm ready for the day. </connor>
<connor> That energy rushes through you. </connor>
<connor> I feel like a 10 immediately. </connor>
<joey> - It's so monkey but I love it. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like a 10 straight away to start my day. </connor>
<garnt> - Question for you guys, </garnt>
<garnt> how did you guys hype yourself up </garnt>
<garnt> before recording session for your videos? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's gonna be a time. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay, okay. </connor>
<garnt> This is the thing that... </garnt>
<garnt> I think this is because you've just recently </garnt>
<connor> started doing it a lot, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember when </connor>
<joey> I first started filming my face a lot, </joey>
<joey> I fucking dreaded doing it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I did everything to avoid it. </connor>
<connor> I would shave like three times </connor>
<connor> just to make sure it was perfect in my head, </connor>
<garnt> but really what I was doing with delaying it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Maybe I need to go get the groceries actually. </joey>
<connor> "I should do laundry actually. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, its too late vocal record now." </connor>
<joey> - I can't record 'cause I was too busy </joey>
<joey> renovating my house. </joey>
<connor> - But now I just turn it on and do it. </connor>
<connor> I don't have to think about it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't really hype myself up- </joey>
<connor> - I have a coffee, maybe a red bull if I need it, </connor>
<connor> but that's about it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, caffeine helps definitely. </joey>
<joey> But I don't really have like a, </joey>
<joey> "Do it face." </joey>
<connor> - In the morning, if you're feeling down man, try it. </connor>
<connor> Next time you feel sad when you wake up. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it happens sometime, man. </connor>
<connor> You just feel. </connor>
<connor> Just try it. </connor>
<joey> You'll feel like an idiot at first </joey>
<connor> but then you'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Nice dude." </connor>
<connor> - It's gonna clown on me the entire day. </connor>
<joey> - I was about to say, Sydney gonna be like- </joey>
<connor> - I guess since no one lives with me, </connor>
<joey> so it's like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can do it by yourself, but if- </joey>
<joey> - Sydney's like, </joey>
<joey> "Garnt, what're doing? </joey>
<joey> "Why you saying, come on?" </joey>
<connor> - Do it. </connor>
<connor> Do it. </connor>
<connor> - Don't let your dreams take you. </connor>
<joey> - Come. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, come, come. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I've realized I'm slowly forming a profile for me </connor>
<connor> of just like a complete monkey on this one. </connor>
<joey> - I think only hyping up by doing maybe, </joey>
<joey> sometimes because I'm not going to even think about </joey>
<connor> recording a video, if I'm already not in that state. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've realized </connor>
<connor> just don't film if you're not in the mood. </connor>
<connor> - So, before I used to have to be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Okay, I have to fucking record something." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I would turn the camera on. </garnt>
<garnt> And immediately, the moment you hit that record button, </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck man, I don't wanna do it." </garnt>
<joey> - You're like, </joey>
<joey> "I hate my life right now." </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Not today." </garnt>
<garnt> But I didn't have a choice </garnt>
<garnt> because I was uploading every two days or something. </garnt>
<garnt> But with my current schedule </garnt>
<garnt> now I have a little bit levity in that. </garnt>
<garnt> I just know if I wake up in the morning </garnt>
<joey> and today's the day where I can just get something out. </joey>
<joey> Because if I feel good already </joey>
<joey> from the morning, then I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, it's time to get that bread game is late. </joey>
<joey> "Let's let's record like three videos. </joey>
<joey> "Just get that shit </joey>
<joey> while the fucking wild hype train is running." </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes playing hype music will get me in the zone. </connor>
<joey> - Just a nice funk, then those beats they hit you- </joey>
<garnt> - Dude, like power of music, man, </garnt>
<joey> that shit can easily hype enough. </joey>
<joey> - How'd you know what music to pick, Connor? </joey>
<joey> How'd you know what music to pick? </joey>
<connor> - I let YouTube decide for me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Do I go with slow beat or fast beat? </joey>
<connor> - Fast song, happy. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - YouTube search history for music is just like an AI </joey>
<joey> trying to understand what the emotions are. </joey>
<connor> - This is how my music tastes works and how I find songs. </connor>
<joey> I like one song </joey>
<connor> and then I'll just keep letting YouTube suggest me songs </connor>
<connor> and I'll keep building. </connor>
<connor> I never actively look out for songs. </connor>
<connor> I just let it suggest it the songs. </connor>
<joey> - It's like YouTube and Spotify recommendations </joey>
<connor> were built for people like you. </connor>
<connor> - Oh dude, they're amazing, man. </connor>
<joey> - It's really fucking good thou, man. </joey>
<joey> - I was diehard Spotify for like six years, maybe longer. </joey>
<joey> And then I just tried YouTube music once </joey>
<connor> 'cause I had it with premium and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Holy shit, I think I like this more." </connor>
<joey> - Oh dude, but I've discovered so much good music </joey>
<joey> on Spotify on recommended. </joey>
<connor> - I think both. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause there's a lot of songs </joey>
<joey> that aren't official </joey>
<joey> that you'll get on YouTube music, </joey>
<connor> the like remixes that will never be on Spotify </connor>
<joey> 'cause they wouldn't- </joey>
<connor> - I don't really give a shit about the remix- </connor>
<connor> - There so many good ones. </connor>
<connor> There's like one where it's </connor>
<connor> like the Sono Chino Sadame </connor>
<garnt> makes for like that 90 song by like Diana Ross or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - That shit claps, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I'll send you a link. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's always the good anime remixes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, there are so many good anime remixes </garnt>
<joey> on YouTube that you're not allowed on Spotify. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes I want to listen to like Daft Punk. </joey>
<garnt> But I also want to have that animates remixes. </garnt>
<garnt> So I can do that on YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> Hell, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Dude, I've recently kind of gone into the rabbit hole </garnt>
<garnt> of these insane like music remixes </garnt>
<garnt> and not just like anime, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously you know the anime remixes, </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone's seen the Renai Circulation, </garnt>
<connor> which has Snoop Dogg or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But my friend sent me one the other day, </connor>
<connor> which is fucking insane. </connor>
<connor> It was September by Earth, Wind & Fire </connor>
<connor> remixed with Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne. </connor>
<connor> - You can remix that song with anything though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but it sounded fucking amazing. </connor>
<joey> I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, I need more. </joey>
<connor> "I need more." </connor>
<connor> - I have never seen an Earth, Wind & Fire remix, September. </connor>
<connor> They disappoint me. </connor>
<connor> Except for the Taylor Swift and that was terrible. </connor>
<garnt> - But Earth, Wind & Fire goes with everything. </garnt>
<joey> - The Wii Show one, have you seen that? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, that shit that collapsed, bro. </connor>
<joey> I can't do it. </joey>
<joey> I will get a copyright. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - But you just like, </joey>
<connor> "Damn that was too perfect." </connor>
<joey> That was kind of own pitch. </joey>
<joey> Connor was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Did I get off pitch there." </garnt>
<garnt> - I've recently fallen into the rabbit hole </garnt>
<garnt> of just listening to J-pop that's... </garnt>
<joey> They sound like anime opening and endings, but they're not. </joey>
<joey> - Like Polkadot Stingray? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah like Polkadot Stingray, </joey>
<connor> Zutomayo, Minami it's- </connor>
<joey> - It's so many. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the rabbit hole, right? </joey>
<joey> You discover one? </joey>
<joey> The algorithm is like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, you like this? </joey>
<joey> "Oh, hello, let me show you more." </joey>
<joey> It's gotten so deep right. </joey>
<joey> That recently I was recommended a video, </joey>
<joey> which it was kind of like a vocaloid kind of remix </joey>
<joey> but I think it was original song </joey>
<joey> but the video had no title </joey>
<joey> and the channel had no title and then I click on it. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah so it's not even like they have a space or something. </garnt>
<garnt> No, there's just literally no character for the title. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Apparently you can. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a thing called like a Hoff Hoff space or something </connor>
<garnt> it's a space that is technically a character </garnt>
<garnt> but it doesn't show up as anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't like highlight it </garnt>
<connor> and copy and paste into the search bar. </connor>
<connor> There's no interaction with whatever character </connor>
<connor> they're putting down. </connor>
<joey> So the only way people would have got this </joey>
<joey> is through recommendations </joey>
<joey> and the video has like two million views. </joey>
<joey> It's just insane. </joey>
<joey> And then I click on it and then everyone's like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, welcome to the cult." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) - Join us. </connor>
<connor> - I see you have been the chosen one. </connor>
<connor> It's great because like they're probably </connor>
<connor> gonna kill me now because everyone's like mutually agreed </connor>
<connor> not to talk about this which... </connor>
<connor> Sorry guys, I guess the entire internet knows now. </connor>
<connor> Well, I'm not gonna link to it. </connor>
<garnt> If you're part of the chosen like show me a message. </garnt>
<garnt> If I see anyone linking it we'll fucking bun you. </garnt>
<connor> - You played me this in your house </connor>
<joey> and I was just hoping one day would pop up in my record. </joey>
<connor> Still waiting, still waiting. </connor>
<joey> - It's like Illumina argument. </joey>
<joey> You just got to wait for that email. </joey>
<connor> - Cook some more crappy vocal and can I get a pop up dude. </connor>
<garnt> - No, but that's just the wonders of the algorithm. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I have no idea how the algorithm works. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay going completely off topic here. </garnt>
<garnt> But there's been one video of mine recently </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> that's just been getting recommended to everyone. </joey>
<joey> And I have no idea why it's an eight year old video </joey>
<joey> that we've not talked about on this podcast. </joey>
<joey> - So many people have tweeted us about it. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, wow. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so there's been a video recently </joey>
<connor> that's been circulating that's called... </connor>
<connor> - Recently at the time of filming? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah recently at the time of filming </connor>
<connor> it might still be circulating, talking about it. </connor>
<joey> It's probably gonna start getting stuck. </joey>
<joey> So I should probably circle back </joey>
<joey> to the start of animetube itself. </joey>
<joey> You guys are about to get history lesson here. </joey>
<joey> - Go on. </joey>
<joey> - So, okay. </joey>
<connor> So do you guys know who the very first Animetuber is? </connor>
<joey> - I thought it was Mr. Anime. </joey>
<connor> That was my preconception. </connor>
<connor> - I'd be surprised if anyone watching this knew </connor>
<joey> because that means you've been around for as long as me </joey>
<joey> but the very first anime YouTuber is this guy </joey>
<joey> called Hards Anime Reviews. </joey>
<joey> And he started in 2006 and he would just basically make </joey>
<connor> very basic animal reviews with like </connor>
<connor> his camera was like up here. </connor>
<connor> - Worst angle. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah was like kind of like </joey>
<joey> the worst angle you can think of. </joey>
<joey> - The angle we all start at, right? </joey>
<joey> - And he's now quit it's funny because </joey>
<joey> I tried to search him up and see if he's still around. </joey>
<joey> And his first original channel got terminated </joey>
<garnt> as everyone's dead back then when they were reviewing anime </garnt>
<garnt> and his second channel is called </garnt>
<garnt> un ironically the Hard Mode </garnt>
<garnt> He called it the Hard Mode. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> If you search this up on YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to search the Hard Mode, no space. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise you're not gonna find it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's like that buried within the search algorithm. </garnt>
<garnt> But the second animetuber was this person called </garnt>
<garnt> Mr. Anime and he basically made his </garnt>
<connor> anime YouTube channel to compete with Hard </connor>
<connor> 'cause Hard was the only anime YouTube channel around. </connor>
<connor> And then Mr. Anime was the second one. </connor>
<connor> And he really, at the time he really was </connor>
<connor> one of the big faces of anime YouTube. </connor>
<connor> And I say big, he had like a 1,000 subscribers. </connor>
<connor> - That big shit back in the day. </connor>
<connor> - That is big shit back in 2006, 2007. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then it was after Mr.Anime that there were like </connor>
<joey> some other anime channels here and there </joey>
<joey> but those two are the founding fathers of animetube. </joey>
<garnt> We have them to thank for where we are now basically. </garnt>
<joey> - If people know the ending to the story </joey>
<joey> then you know how funny that statement is know. </joey>
<joey> - I know right. </joey>
<garnt> So then after a while I made my YouTube channel </garnt>
<garnt> and I do my own thing. </garnt>
<connor> And the very, very first shout out I got </connor>
<connor> was from a Mr.Anime video and it's still up. </connor>
<connor> - It's video, is it? </connor>
<connor> - It's it's Mr.Anime. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, is his channel still up? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, his channel is still up. </joey>
<connor> You can view his entire history and everything that he did. </connor>
<connor> - Wow that's weird because </connor>
<connor> was that guy recently got prosecuted for like </connor>
<connor> child pornography and they took down his channel like that. </connor>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah that Austin guy the singing guy... </connor>
<joey> Picture on screen. </joey>
<joey> Yeah I don't know. </joey>
<joey> They immediately took down his channel. </joey>
<joey> - I remember a couple months ago a Mr.Anime video, </joey>
<garnt> like popped up just randomly. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah, so Mr. Anime, </joey>
<joey> the first time he shouted me out was just </joey>
<joey> he made a video. </joey>
<garnt> I think it was called like the face of Animetuber </garnt>
<joey> or something and he just shouted out a bunch </joey>
<joey> of OG anime reviews back in the day. </joey>
<joey> - What a nice was is that. </joey>
<joey> - So that was the very first boost in subscribers I got. </joey>
<joey> I remember messaging him being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh thanks a lot, man, </joey>
<joey> "dude like that they're really helps me out. </joey>
<joey> "I got me like 300 subscribers." </joey>
<joey> Like, holy shit, that was a lot back in that day. </joey>
<joey> I think that was the video that pushed me </joey>
<joey> over my first 1000 subscribers, </joey>
<joey> which was a big fucking deal. </joey>
<joey> So I was really happy and I really respected the guy </joey>
<connor> as well because if not for him </connor>
<connor> I'd probably be less confident to do what I did </connor>
<connor> like to start my YouTube channel </connor>
<connor> and especially no matter what whenever you see </connor>
<connor> someone bigger than you shouting you out </connor>
<connor> that's that's like a big pat on the back. </connor>
<connor> I did well. </connor>
<connor> And he messaged me back being like, </connor>
<connor> "Nah, it's no problem, bro. </connor>
<connor> "I just really like your stuff congrats." </connor>
<garnt> He couldn't even pronounce my name back then. </garnt>
<garnt> I think in the video he called me guy geek. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Don't say that now there are gonna call you guy geek. </joey>
<joey> - I've dug my own grave. </joey>
<joey> So that was the last kind of interaction </joey>
<joey> I had with him until- </joey>
<joey> - That was the first and last interaction? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah that was my first and last interaction. </joey>
<joey> Back then the anime YouTube community wasn't... </joey>
<connor> We knew we bought each other, </connor>
<connor> but we didn't talk to each other that much. </connor>
<connor> - It was like the MSM days? </connor>
<connor> - Yes, so there wasn't an easy way to talk to each other. </connor>
<connor> Apart from back when YouTube had messaging. </connor>
<joey> Remember those days? </joey>
<connor> - YouTube DMs which were slowly just </connor>
<connor> phased out of existence, I guess. </connor>
<joey> And just nobody remembers that you could </joey>
<joey> DM people on YouTube, </joey>
<joey> but one day I just woke up and I had this message </joey>
<connor> from this other anime YouTuber who was called </connor>
<connor> ICO Ari soccer 420 who's also like- </connor>
<connor> - You remember that right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> I know the entire history of anime YouTube, </joey>
<connor> right here, right here. </connor>
<joey> - He asked me if I'd heard about this article, </joey>
<connor> that's been like linked around. </connor>
<connor> And it was this article that was this police report </connor>
<connor> that basically just said, </connor>
<connor> Trey Sesler has been arrested for the murdering his family. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Whoa, is this Trey Sesler, the anime man? </garnt>
<garnt> "The same Trey Sesler?" </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I am Trey Sesler. </joey>
<joey> - We got him first. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like... </connor>
<garnt> Fuck I've just blanked his actual name now. </garnt>
<connor> All that's coming to mind is the anime- </connor>
<garnt> - Mr.Anime. - Mr.Anime. </garnt>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I can't believe I blanked on the name mid-story. </connor>
<connor> - Why did you doubt me? </connor>
<joey> - Come on. </joey>
<joey> - I clicked on the article and he had his face </joey>
<joey> and that was just the, </joey>
<connor> "Oh shit, is this real?" </connor>
<connor> I had like 50 different emotions. </connor>
<connor> - I kind of imagine how it feels. </connor>
<connor> - Just to see him because you don't know </connor>
<joey> how to react to this because the more I read, </joey>
<joey> just the more sickening it got. </joey>
<joey> So the entire story was that apparently </joey>
<joey> Trey Sesler, Mr.Anime had been playing around </joey>
<connor> with his brother and they were playing around with guns- </connor>
<connor> - As they did in his channel. </connor>
<connor> - And they did. </connor>
<connor> See he had a lot of guns in like his channel and everything, </connor>
<joey> but me back then I just think </joey>
<garnt> Americans guns that's just what they do. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what British people think about Americans. </garnt>
<garnt> Unless you think Americans just walk around and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> hey waving with guns. </garnt>
<connor> - So he would just have guns in his anime reviews </connor>
<garnt> and I just thought that was completely normal. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause he was from Texas as well and I was like </joey>
<joey> this is completely normal. </joey>
<garnt> This is nothing to worry about. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought there's a text and watch the shooter </connor>
<garnt> with that gun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even now I see a texting with a gun. </garnt>
<connor> I just think that's even normal. </connor>
<connor> Even after everything I've just about to experience. </connor>
<connor> But I read the story and he was playing around </connor>
<connor> with this guns with his brother </connor>
<connor> and apparently he accidentally shot his brother </connor>
<connor> and he killed him. </connor>
<connor> And so the official story that he gave was </connor>
<garnt> he didn't want his parents to feel guilt or his family </garnt>
<garnt> to feel guilt about having their son </garnt>
<garnt> kill one of their brothers. </garnt>
<garnt> So apparently he just thought </garnt>
<garnt> might as well fucking kill them all which is- </garnt>
<connor> - It's a fucking awful thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is a awful conclusion to come to. </garnt>
<garnt> So apparently he kills his entire family </garnt>
<garnt> and then it gets worse because </garnt>
<garnt> like the more information that comes out </garnt>
<garnt> the more we find out that he was actually </garnt>
<garnt> not only planning to kill his family anyway but he was </garnt>
<garnt> actually planning a Columbine-Style school shooting. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I saw like this really good documentary </joey>
<connor> on YouTube I'm sure it's up there still. </connor>
<connor> - ReignBot, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I think so. </connor>
<connor> It's basically covers the whole thing </connor>
<joey> but that's how I got all my information as well </joey>
<connor> where he was planning to do a school shooting </connor>
<joey> and did he post about it online that he was going to do it </joey>
<garnt> or something like that but basically </garnt>
<joey> was on the way to the school </joey>
<joey> and that's when he got arrested. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause he was planning the school shooting </garnt>
<garnt> for way before he's killed his family. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I think how he thought was </joey>
<joey> he killed his brother by accident, </joey>
<joey> but he was always planning the school shooting anyway. </joey>
<connor> He had it all mapped out and everything. </connor>
<connor> So in between that he accidentally </connor>
<connor> killed his brother and killed his family. </connor>
<connor> And that's what outed him. </connor>
<connor> But he was always planning this </connor>
<connor> and there's this really ominous video. </connor>
<connor> I think it's the second to last, Mr. Anime video </connor>
<connor> this on a channel that's just called </connor>
<connor> Mr. Anime is planning something. </connor>
<joey> I remember watching that thinking, </joey>
<joey> "He's taken a break from any Animetube." </joey>
<joey> - Or he's planning a new reveal. </joey>
<joey> - He's planing a comeback. </joey>
<joey> But I dunno 'cause he talks about anime in that video. </joey>
<joey> So he might've been just purely talking about anime </joey>
<joey> by I'm like with all the information </joey>
<joey> that we have now he's probably- </joey>
<joey> - That title was fucking scary. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucked, that title was fucked. </joey>
<joey> And the more information that came out, </joey>
<joey> the more I just didn't know how to process this. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause how would you process the fact that </joey>
<connor> one of the people you looked up to and respected </connor>
<connor> just killed their family and was planning to </connor>
<connor> shoot up a fucking school? </connor>
<connor> Like what what'd you do with that? </connor>
<connor> That bothered me for a while. </connor>
<connor> And I remember this was the time I was at university </connor>
<connor> and people were like, </connor>
<connor> "Why does Garnt look like </connor>
<connor> "someone just died in his family or something?" </connor>
<connor> - But I think the best way I can describe it is </connor>
<connor> imagine if you like live in a small town </connor>
<connor> and you may be like you know everyone in this small town </connor>
<connor> you might not be friends with everyone in that small town </connor>
<connor> but you feel like this small, tight knit community. </connor>
<connor> And then you find that someone in this small </connor>
<connor> tiny community has done something awful. </connor>
<connor> It's like something that's not like beyond words </connor>
<connor> beyond words, awful. </connor>
<joey> And then to try to process this I made the video, </joey>
<joey> which is being recommended now. </joey>
<joey> - It's circulating everywhere. </joey>
<joey> - Even though it's eight years old </joey>
<joey> for some reason YouTube decided, </joey>
<garnt> "Yeah people wanna see Garnt reacting to </garnt>
<garnt> Mr.Anime murdering his family." </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno how that came about. </garnt>
<joey> - It's literally on everyone's recommended, </joey>
<garnt> it was on my recommended, </garnt>
<connor> I think Connor was on it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why it's probably not monetize, right? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no it's not monitized. </garnt>
<garnt> It just goes against everything </garnt>
<joey> about the YouTube algorithms like it's not monetized. </joey>
<joey> It's about a horrible tragedy. </joey>
<joey> It's about a very sensitive topic. </joey>
<garnt> I mean it was eight years old. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I uploaded this before even </garnt>
<connor> like the monetization thing like started on YouTube </connor>
<connor> or at least before I was monetized </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I had like a 1,000 plus subscribers. </garnt>
<garnt> So it wasn't massive. </garnt>
<joey> I remember stumbling upon a Mr. Anime video </joey>
<connor> even like way before I knew about the whole like </connor>
<connor> anime YouTube hemisphere and everything because </connor>
<connor> it was Mr. Anime review on Garnt </connor>
<connor> that made me wanna go watch Garnt. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That guy has got a bright career. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow, this guy is like really fun." </connor>
<connor> He fucking had... </connor>
<garnt> Do you know how ghetto his set up was? </garnt>
<joey> He had like a webcam or something to record. </joey>
<joey> And he was sitting on his bed </joey>
<joey> and he had his lap and it was like a notepad, </joey>
<joey> almost like an Apple- </joey>
<garnt> - An Apple notepad. </garnt>
<joey> - An Apple notepad of the script. </joey>
<joey> And he was literally just looking down at the Apple notepad </joey>
<joey> just reading off the script </joey>
<joey> and then every now and then I guess, </joey>
<joey> because he didn't know how to edit these videos. </joey>
<joey> So instead he had a remote that controlled </joey>
<joey> the zoom of the lens. </joey>
<garnt> He control the zoom with the lens </garnt>
<garnt> and just started talking to the camera </garnt>
<garnt> and then he just zoomed back out. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, no cuts. </joey>
<garnt> So he was like... </garnt>
<joey> I remember in the Garnt review he was talking about, </joey>
<joey> the acid scene in the Garnt anime and how he was like, </joey>
<garnt> "It made me go." </garnt>
<garnt> And then he stops and zooms in </garnt>
<joey> and zooms really far into his face and he goes, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> And then he zooms out with a dead face </joey>
<joey> and just goes back to reading it. </joey>
<joey> And that was the review. </joey>
<joey> No cots, no edits. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah I wanna watch this anime." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that was quality content </garnt>
<connor> back in the day of animetube. </connor>
<connor> I remember when I started coming out with my videos </connor>
<connor> I was one of the first to actually just </connor>
<garnt> use an editing software, </garnt>
<garnt> even though it was just putting images over </garnt>
<garnt> whatever I was say people were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "He's using windows movie maker? </garnt>
<connor> "Impossible." </connor>
<connor> But yeah that's the story of the first person I ever- </connor>
<joey> - Humble beginnings. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I recommend like as of a topic that is like, </garnt>
<connor> I definitely recommend that documentary on YouTube- </connor>
<connor> - It perfectly goes through everything about it. </connor>
<connor> And at the end of the documentary, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how they got this footage, </connor>
<connor> but there's this- </connor>
<connor> - Oh the police footage? </connor>
<connor> - The police footage of how he's like the jail cell </connor>
<connor> during the interview, that shit is so scary man. </connor>
<connor> And to think, </connor>
<connor> "This is the guy who founded </connor>
<garnt> "basically what I do for a living." </garnt>
<garnt> - I know right. </garnt>
<joey> - Like that's so fucking scary. </joey>
<garnt> - It's so weird 'cause I've had this conversation </garnt>
<garnt> with a few people and we just think, </garnt>
<garnt> "There's a lot of shit that's happened in 92." </garnt>
<connor> That's right. </connor>
<connor> - I think there's stuff that unfortunately happens </connor>
<garnt> in every community that we probably will never find out </garnt>
<connor> some really fucked up shit that people have done. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah I mean, we've only recently out about a lot of it. </joey>
<connor> - It's really unfortunate because we don't like to think </connor>
<connor> that we know people who are like that, </connor>
<connor> but at times proven anything that </connor>
<connor> I've met people who've been friendly with people </connor>
<connor> who have done really horrible stuff I'm sure. </connor>
<joey> - I never knew that one of my best friends </joey>
<joey> used to punch kids in the face. </joey>
<connor> - That's not bad, those kids they punched me first. </connor>
<garnt> I mean once you look up and respect </garnt>
<joey> a fucking serial killer school shooter </joey>
<joey> then it's all downhill from there, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I know hot it feels to see a police pull me </connor>
<connor> and being like, oh no. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a mess of emotions. </connor>
<garnt> First it's, surely this is fake. </garnt>
<connor> - As you see it you're like, </connor>
<joey> "I've never seen a police report before." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, could easily be doctored. </joey>
<joey> Like yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then you're seeing all the counts </connor>
<garnt> being slowly like added and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh no, oh no, oh no this is bad." </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think that was the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I had a conversation with (indistinct) about </garnt>
<garnt> the anime review about how we should process this. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember him saying, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, I think he just he'll keep the memories </garnt>
<garnt> of Mr.Anime, like the same, but it's just, he has to view </garnt>
<garnt> Mr. Anime and Trey Sesler as like different people. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that was the first time I had just thought about </garnt>
<garnt> the entire process of having to view online personalities </garnt>
<garnt> as different in-person as how they </garnt>
<garnt> portrayed themselves. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like whole thing of like separating </garnt>
<joey> the artists from the creation. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, it was more the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> this happened in our small community as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Because it's like happening in like the small rural town, </connor>
<connor> right when nothing happens. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I'm sure now in Animetube, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure there's some assholes somewhere. </garnt>
<connor> - Someone doing some despicable shit. </connor>
<connor> - We don't know about but they weren't a figurehead </connor>
<garnt> in this very small community. </garnt>
<garnt> - They weren't the fucking founding founder. </garnt>
<garnt> - The literal founding father. </garnt>
<garnt> - The more you say that out loud the more I'm like, oh. </garnt>
<connor> - The founding fathers tend to normally be sketchy count. </connor>
<joey> - How do we sell that the anime YouTube community </joey>
<joey> is like this really cool thing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the founding father is a serial killer. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's a conversation starter, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - I like to think of it of... </connor>
<joey> It's one of those things that was gonna be started anyway </joey>
<joey> eventually around that time. </joey>
<joey> Yeah it just so happened that he was the first </joey>
<joey> or one of the first </joey>
<joey> Maybe that's the reason why nobody used </joey>
<connor> animate in the username until I came up </connor>
<garnt> because I know for a fact that some of my early videos, </garnt>
<garnt> man those comments were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "The animate man, I thought that guy went to jail?" </garnt>
<garnt> Like they legitimately mistook me for Mr.Anime. </garnt>
<connor> - Who would mistake you for that? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Rewind that. </joey>
<joey> Flash back to five minutes ago. </joey>
<joey> - But like I obviously didn't know about that news </joey>
<joey> until after I started my YouTube channel, </joey>
<joey> because I think what year was it that he got arrested? </joey>
<joey> I mean, it was eight years ago I think... </joey>
<joey> The only reason I remember this is 'cause </joey>
<garnt> the YouTube video that's been recommended </garnt>
<joey> is eight years ago. </joey>
<joey> - So that's like 2012, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Something like 2011, 2012. </garnt>
<joey> - Was probably just a really bad time </joey>
<joey> because I started 2013 literally right after it happened, </joey>
<joey> I didn't know about it until I started it </joey>
<joey> and I had like a decent following and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh fuck I can't go back now. </joey>
<joey> "I can't change my name now, </joey>
<joey> "I should have changed it." </joey>
<connor> - So what was like the early years of animetube like? </connor>
<connor> So that was over like what, well, how long you been here? </connor>
<garnt> 12 years did you say? </garnt>
<garnt> - Since 2007. </garnt>
<joey> Okay, so how was the animetube sphere from 2007 to 2012? </joey>
<joey> - It was like slow, right? </joey>
<joey> - It was very slow. </joey>
<garnt> So before 2012, which I kind of like where </garnt>
<connor> I think you came along, it was the quality was not good </connor>
<connor> as it is, but it was fun. </connor>
<joey> I don't know I kind of in a way </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna sound so boomer saying this </garnt>
<garnt> but I kind of missed old YouTube where </garnt>
<garnt> kind of anything went- </garnt>
<connor> - Always look profondly at the time, </connor>
<garnt> when it was smaller, more manageable, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he was more intimate. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, always look back at that period, </connor>
<connor> especially on YouTube as well </connor>
<connor> I'm sure you all miss the time when you may like 1000 </connor>
<garnt> you can just talk to random people. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so cool. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember I made a video </connor>
<joey> when I hit a 1, 000 subscribers and I thought I'd made it. </joey>
<connor> I thought- </connor>
<connor> - I thought. </connor>
<garnt> "Mom, I'm dropping out of uni." </garnt>
<joey> I swear, like, I've always said this to people, </joey>
<joey> but the joy of hitting a 1,000 subscribers </joey>
<connor> is almost comparable to hitting like a hundred thousand </connor>
<connor> or a million subscribers. </connor>
<joey> Because a 1,000 is just like whoa. </joey>
<connor> - A 1,000 is like monumental. </connor>
<joey> - It is, because it's a number that is very easily </joey>
<connor> like quantifiable. </connor>
<connor> But it's also huge because thinking like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow there's a 1,000 people who like me." </connor>
<connor> Because once it gets to like a million </connor>
<connor> it starts to become something that </connor>
<connor> you just can't really comprehend, like physically. </connor>
<garnt> Whereas a 1,000 is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, shit I'm popular. </garnt>
<joey> "I'm fucking popular. </joey>
<garnt> - And back then it was just as I grew into, </garnt>
<joey> it was all about doing anime reviews </joey>
<joey> and a lot of people had different styles. </joey>
<joey> If you came in with an editing software </joey>
<joey> you were just... </joey>
<connor> I remember when like Yazoo, Taku and Tristan </connor>
<joey> gloss reflection came along and they used </joey>
<joey> Sony Vegas to edit their videos </joey>
<joey> and it just fucking blew my mind. </joey>
<joey> - They used the paid pro. </joey>
<garnt> - Some of the stuff they could get </garnt>
<garnt> away with that I couldn't do using like putting images </garnt>
<joey> on windows movie maker. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> - It was amazingly glorified PowerPoint. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I think my favorite animated video from back then </garnt>
<garnt> was this guy called Grumpy Jlisan. </garnt>
<joey> - I fucking love him. </joey>
<garnt> - I do not know. </garnt>
<joey> - He's so good. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, he's an OG and he doesn't make videos anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> But what he'd do is that he'd do anime reviews </garnt>
<garnt> but he'd do it in like the middle of a desert </garnt>
<garnt> in Arizona somewhere. </garnt>
<joey> - You would review an anime while </joey>
<garnt> like hiking through the desert. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, so it was like, </garnt>
<connor> he he was basically pre Casey Neistat because what he'd do </connor>
<connor> he'd always start off his videos with like </connor>
<connor> with him walking towards the camera </connor>
<connor> in like the middle of the desert. </connor>
<connor> So what he would have to do is that </connor>
<joey> he would have to set up his camera, </joey>
<joey> hike like a hike away off screen </joey>
<joey> and then hike back into view of the camera. </joey>
<joey> He wasn't like he was hiking a short distance. </joey>
<joey> He wouldn't be literally like hiking over </joey>
<garnt> hills and mountains sometimes to get to the camera. </garnt>
<garnt> - How long was this intro? </garnt>
<garnt> Like two minutes? </garnt>
<joey> - It was like super sped up </joey>
<joey> and you'd just see him walking towards the camera. </joey>
<joey> So it'd be like a squirrel, </joey>
<joey> just like skirling like towards the camera. </joey>
<garnt> And he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Today, we're gonna talk about a bizarre." </garnt>
<joey> - A lot of his reviews, he always had like a place to go. </joey>
<connor> So he would start with at the front of the trail </connor>
<connor> being like today we're gonna talk about hunter, hunter </connor>
<connor> and then as he's walking, he would talk about the show. </connor>
<connor> And then usually the one I saw, I forgot which anime it was </connor>
<connor> but he was hiking up this mountain </connor>
<connor> and he must've like perfectly timed this shit. </connor>
<connor> Like he must've done the hike beforehand </connor>
<connor> because the moment he got to the top </connor>
<connor> was when he finished his conclusion on the show. </connor>
<garnt> And he was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I've made it to the top guys. </garnt>
<joey> "And that's the end of my review." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, that's fucking awesome. </joey>
<garnt> - Thinking back it was very different </garnt>
<joey> from what everyone was doing. </joey>
<joey> And we were just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, old man reviewing anime. </joey>
<joey> "That's pretty weird." </joey>
<joey> But thinking back, he was... </joey>
<joey> A lot of his ideas were really cool. </joey>
<joey> - Ahead of his time. </joey>
<joey> - A little bit ahead of his time. </joey>
<joey> - And that's why he stands out to me </joey>
<connor> apart from the guy who killed himself, I guess. </connor>
<connor> No not killed himself but killed someone else </connor>
<connor> but yeah it was kind of like the wild West back then. </connor>
<garnt> I mean all of you all. </garnt>
<connor> So if that's the first era, we all like, </connor>
<connor> 2007, 2012, what came after that? </connor>
<connor> What's like the era? </connor>
<garnt> What years are we talking between? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I can't trust it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I didn't start until 2015. </garnt>
<connor> So all of it before that is like- </connor>
<garnt> - I'd say around about... </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember exactly when it was founded, </garnt>
<connor> but that was kind of like the wild West of YouTube </connor>
<joey> where everyone was kind of doing their own thing. </joey>
<joey> It was a mess of different things. </joey>
<joey> And then 2012 was kind of what like where the </joey>
<connor> anime community really started to form </connor>
<connor> into this one one conglomerate. </connor>
<connor> And I think the big event that happened </connor>
<garnt> was probably PodTaku. </garnt>
<garnt> - PodTaku was huge. </garnt>
<connor> - It was the first time I recognized anyone outside of you. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh there's other people? </connor>
<garnt> - And I remember because I was already... </garnt>
<garnt> So we had four original members. </garnt>
<garnt> There was Holden reviews, </garnt>
<garnt> Jean who was originally called extra disturbed jeans </garnt>
<garnt> and a Tristan, the Glass Reflection. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember what started it was Tristan one day </connor>
<connor> messaged me out, messaged me out of the blue </connor>
<connor> with the YouTube DMs being like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey do you wanna talk about this new anime season?" </connor>
<connor> And this was before I'd even started watching </connor>
<connor> seasonal anime. </connor>
<connor> This was before the concept of, </connor>
<garnt> "Hey you can watch anime weekly </garnt>
<garnt> "and be hyped for seasonal anime." </garnt>
<connor> - Because I'm pretty sure you made a joke in one </connor>
<connor> of your videos where it's like, </connor>
<connor> why would I want to come over the space of 12 weeks </connor>
<connor> where I could just come and warm? </connor>
<connor> That was a joke you made and I remember that. </connor>
<connor> I thought you completely forgot about that. </connor>
<joey> - That's an amazing joke. </joey>
<joey> - For some reason that stuck with me </joey>
<joey> and that's a great example. </joey>
<joey> I would like to come in one, go. </joey>
<garnt> - And my thought process is why would I want </garnt>
<joey> a 12th of an orgasm when I can just have </joey>
<joey> one orgasm one second. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah and so we made this podcast, </garnt>
<garnt> which wasn't even a podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> It was kind of just a recorded Skype call </garnt>
<garnt> and we didn't know where to put it. </garnt>
<garnt> So I made the suggestion to put it </garnt>
<connor> on YouTube because this was before </connor>
<connor> like it was an audio podcast. </connor>
<connor> It wasn't a visual podcast like this. </connor>
<connor> So nobody thought that's putting audio podcasts </connor>
<connor> on YouTube at work. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, YouTube is so why not? </connor>
<connor> "Why not put it on YouTube?" </connor>
<garnt> I don't like saying it like this. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's kind of sounds like it's like </garnt>
<garnt> sucking my own dick or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> but like PodTaku was a big factor in shaping the </garnt>
<garnt> anime YouTube community of that time. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get left as somebody who wasn't even interested </garnt>
<garnt> in being anonymous YouTube definitely shaped. </garnt>
<garnt> I think how I felt about it </garnt>
<garnt> because at the time I was listening to PodTaku </garnt>
<garnt> like every week, like I never wanted to be crossed my mind </garnt>
<connor> but definitely when I got into it </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of the influences came from listening to that. </connor>
<connor> So I think you may not have shaped the generation </connor>
<connor> you were in but you definitely helped </connor>
<connor> shape the one that came after. </connor>
<joey> - There's a reason why even to this day </joey>
<connor> people who were around in the anime.... </connor>
<connor> - People back then still are like, </connor>
<garnt> "Yeah remember PodTaku?" </garnt>
<garnt> Even people who didn't watch PodTaku, knew PodTaku </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's still a big point in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> I think back to PodTaku very fondly, </garnt>
<connor> even though it's like ended now </connor>
<connor> and I've moved on in my life. </connor>
<connor> It had a big part of shaping me as a person. </connor>
<connor> And it's especially because PodTaku </connor>
<connor> was the first ever friends I made </connor>
<connor> that I could talk to anime with. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> That goes all the way back to the conversation </connor>
<connor> we had at the start about Holden and Jean </connor>
<connor> were literally the first people </connor>
<connor> I was able to bond over anime with. </connor>
<connor> And PodTaku was kind of like my weekly, biweekly </connor>
<connor> kind of session where I could just nerd over annually. </connor>
<joey> Just bring it into with your buddies. </joey>
<connor> And apparently a lot of people looked up to us </connor>
<connor> back then because a lot of people apparently </connor>
<joey> didn't also have friends to watch anime with. </joey>
<joey> - I listened to it. </joey>
<joey> - And so that really... </joey>
<joey> I feel like that cemented the next era </joey>
<joey> of anime YouTube before I think you came along </joey>
<connor> and I think that was kind of the era </connor>
<connor> of YouTube where it was, I think it was </connor>
<connor> it was a lost era where people could just make content </connor>
<connor> without a monetary incentive in mind. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Because we did PodTaku not because we were getting paid. </connor>
<connor> We weren't getting paid for it at all. </connor>
<connor> For a lot of it we basically made it </connor>
<connor> because we just wanted to... </connor>
<connor> It was a passion, but it was kind of like this, </connor>
<connor> but back then this was before we had </connor>
<connor> any kind of monetization. </connor>
<connor> We were just four mates who would just go </connor>
<garnt> go on a Skype call and record the audio </garnt>
<garnt> and just splice it together and upload it on YouTube. </garnt>
<joey> - And then I came in when the fat checks start. </joey>
<joey> No, but like, I don't think it's too much to say that, </joey>
<connor> this podcast included there's a lot of anime podcasts now. </connor>
<connor> Big and small. </connor>
<connor> And I don't think it'd be too far to say that, </connor>
<joey> PodTaku probably the one who probably got the train </joey>
<joey> rolling in that side of attitudes. </joey>
<garnt> - It kind of amazes me 'cause like before this came along </garnt>
<garnt> before Trash Taste came along, </garnt>
<garnt> you look back to some of the views and popularity of PodTaku </garnt>
<connor> and it still basically holds up almost to a lot </connor>
<connor> of the bigger podcasts that came after it. </connor>
<connor> I mean, there's only a few podcasts that I can think </connor>
<connor> of that came after PodTaku- </connor>
<connor> - That anime related. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that we're able to do better with it </connor>
<connor> in terms of using user stuff. </connor>
<connor> And PodTaku is like six years old now. </connor>
<connor> So that kind of blows my mind. </connor>
<connor> Do you wanna hear with blast from the past? </connor>
<connor> - Sure. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Warning, the following audio may contain </connor>
<connor> coarse language and other materials that may not be suitable </connor>
<connor> for a younger audience. </connor>
<garnt> Viewer discretion is advised. </garnt>
<joey> - That is screaming to do it. </joey>
<joey> There's like maybe a couple of 100 people </joey>
<joey> watching this right now who just cream that </joey>
<garnt> that intro is like ingrained in my mind, man. </garnt>
<joey> Your accent warning. </joey>
<joey> It's like it's so 2012. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Also we may spoil anything and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have been warned. </garnt>
<connor> - If you go to my channel, </connor>
<connor> the very very first video is like a podcast. </connor>
<garnt> It looks very reminiscent of the editing style </garnt>
<garnt> of another podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Looks very very similar </garnt>
<garnt> with the cubes flashing up between. </garnt>
<joey> Oh yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause yeah did you edit all of them? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, no so originally it was basically between </garnt>
<garnt> me and Tristan and Holden who had to edit </garnt>
<garnt> most of the podcast. </garnt>
<connor> And so we basically edited the audio </connor>
<connor> so they would sync up and we would remove a lot of like </connor>
<connor> when you have calls on Skype. </connor>
<connor> - People talking over each other? </connor>
<connor> - People talking over each other </connor>
<connor> and you have this really awkward pause where it's- </connor>
<connor> - You've cut it up smoother. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> And then we were like we wanted to make it </connor>
<connor> a bit more visual. </connor>
<connor> We couldn't just film ourselves next to each other. </connor>
<connor> So we kind of just decided to go with flashing boxes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it works really well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And that was our way of just evolving the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember after PodTaku we kind of added </garnt>
<garnt> a few more people. </garnt>
<connor> - I wanted to ask about that because I was... </connor>
<connor> When I as a viewer, I was so confused. </connor>
<joey> There were just people like towards the end </joey>
<joey> would you stop joining in? </joey>
<connor> And then I was like, J-Taku? </connor>
<joey> And I'm like what is going on with all of this? </joey>
<joey> - Was Jimmy on the podcast? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Jimmy was. </joey>
<garnt> - It was so odd 'cause it just seemed like </garnt>
<garnt> people were just recycling in and I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Wait, this is not what I wanted the boys." </connor>
<connor> - For the big four. </connor>
<connor> - I wanted the big four back then. </connor>
<connor> As a viewer, I was so confused. </connor>
<garnt> I don't think you guys like ever explained any of that. </garnt>
<connor> So, I mean, I'd be interested in that. </connor>
<garnt> - For me it was because the scheduling just got super hard </garnt>
<garnt> because like I said, we weren't getting paid for anything. </garnt>
<garnt> So this was just us making time. </garnt>
<garnt> And we got to a point with PodTaku where we were </garnt>
<garnt> having a fucking hard time keeping up with </garnt>
<garnt> this two week schedule. </garnt>
<garnt> So I wanted to and it had been awhile since PodTaku started. </garnt>
<connor> So I wanted to spice things up </connor>
<connor> and I wanted to see if there was like </connor>
<connor> we could get some chemistry with other people. </connor>
<connor> And that's when I brought on the idea of J-Taku </connor>
<connor> and adding more people and making it a distinct brand </connor>
<connor> of PodTaku is where we just talk about pure, </connor>
<connor> whatever we want to talk about. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like a free flowing podcast. </connor>
<connor> And J-Taku is we're gonna pick a specific topic </connor>
<connor> and we're gonna stay on top. </connor>
<connor> And that was the kind of idea of J-Taku. </connor>
<connor> It was kind of hit everything 'cause it added </connor>
<garnt> some new elements to the podcast and also made it so </garnt>
<garnt> less of a load was on the original four as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, it's interesting to hear what you guys thought </garnt>
<garnt> about it as a view of it. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause I didn't watch every single one </connor>
<connor> and then I think I just saw like three J-Taku </connor>
<connor> and I was so confused and then I watch it and I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Who are half of these people?" </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think it really worked at first </garnt>
<connor> because J-Taku did his job. </connor>
<garnt> And then he got to the point when J-Taku kind </garnt>
<garnt> Of even maybe became the flagship series. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause if you look on even look on the PodTaku channel </connor>
<connor> a lot of the most viewed videos ended </connor>
<connor> up being J-Taku, originally J-Taku videos. </connor>
<connor> Like our most viewed video was one where </connor>
<connor> we literally just talk about hental. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - But that was back when talking about him </connor>
<connor> and I was like very harsh. </connor>
<connor> Nobody likes nobody publicly like 10 times Twitter </connor>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<joey> - Allow me to introduce myself. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah. </joey>
<joey> So J-Taku kind of became one of the flagship series </joey>
<joey> 'cause he just got more views. </joey>
<connor> And the main, the original four people </connor>
<connor> it would just became harder and harder us to schedule </connor>
<connor> with the original podcast. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's kind of what </connor>
<connor> brought like helps bring PodTaku to an end </connor>
<connor> because I feel like that era of anime tube </connor>
<connor> is defined by the start of PodTaku and the end of PodTaku </connor>
<connor> because I think the end of PodTaku really </connor>
<connor> it coincidentally coincided with a lot of times when </connor>
<connor> Joey really rose and people realized </connor>
<connor> they could do anime content for money as well. </connor>
<connor> Which just wasn't an idea before then. </connor>
<connor> And I remember, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> should I talk about the end of PodTaku? </garnt>
<connor> - Go ahead. </connor>
<joey> - If you want man. </joey>
<joey> - Are we about to do this now? </joey>
<connor> Am I really going to bring this up. </connor>
<connor> - It's up to you. </connor>
<connor> - Okay so I guess I've never talked about this </connor>
<connor> but we've obviously gotten a lot of comments </connor>
<connor> about PodTaku on this point on caps. </connor>
<connor> Comment on this podcast and it was weird. </connor>
<connor> I don't think anyone's really publicly talked about it </connor>
<connor> and to preface this I still love everyone on the podcast. </connor>
<connor> I'm not about to talk mad or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> I don't belong in the story the long and the short </connor>
<connor> of it is that we came into some creative differences </connor>
<connor> about which way the podcast could go. </connor>
<connor> Because to me PodTaku was the defining podcast </connor>
<connor> of the anime community as I have just said </connor>
<connor> and I really wanted to push that further. </connor>
<connor> I wanted to go talk to like evolve more </connor>
<connor> 'cause I saw the potential in how big the podcast could be </connor>
<connor> because the problem was that we had trouble keeping up </connor>
<connor> with our schedule and then we took like a seven month break </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - It's very long. </connor>
<connor> - It was a very long. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And the reason for that was basically </connor>
<connor> the podcast didn't really have like a designated leader </connor>
<connor> leading it. </connor>
<connor> So I'm thinking like at the beginning of the podcast </connor>
<connor> it was mainly me and Tristan who were getting things </connor>
<connor> like getting things done. </connor>
<connor> I mean Jean, loved Jean she was like the mother </connor>
<connor> of the group, but she was like she would like </connor>
<connor> come in and out because she was very busy </connor>
<connor> with her real life. </connor>
<connor> Holden fucking times busy. </connor>
<connor> I know I've talked just told him before, </connor>
<connor> unless you tell... </connor>
<connor> If you tell Holden to do something, he'll fucking do it. </connor>
<connor> - If you don't he won't do it. </connor>
<connor> - If you don't, he's not the type of... </connor>
<connor> He wasn't the type of person </connor>
<connor> that would like push people to do it. </connor>
<connor> And I think he's changed now for the better. </connor>
<connor> And I think PodTaku was definitely </connor>
<connor> a big learning experience for him as well. </connor>
<connor> So I think he's definitely grown as a person, </connor>
<connor> but back then it was mainly me and Tristan </connor>
<connor> who was pushing stuff to get done on the podcast. </connor>
<connor> And Tristan started to get less and less involved </connor>
<connor> because he started to transition doing anime reviews </connor>
<connor> as a hobby to actually finally getting paid for it. </connor>
<connor> Cause he had opened his patreon. </connor>
<garnt> He was the only one that was actively doing videos- </garnt>
<joey> - There was time when Tristan was like </joey>
<connor> really at his peak, </connor>
<garnt> he was not really growing up at that time. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember his patron was a big deal. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> Because he was the only one who had other commitments </joey>
<connor> for his own YouTube channel. </connor>
<connor> So he just had less time than all of us. </connor>
<joey> And then for me, that was also the time </joey>
<joey> when I got my job at BBC. </joey>
<joey> So you see all these factors coming into play </joey>
<joey> where the driving force of the podcasts </joey>
<joey> just had less time to really make episodes </joey>
<joey> and people in J-Taku we were all good friends, </joey>
<joey> but they weren't the original four. </joey>
<joey> They didn't really have the, </joey>
<garnt> I'd say authority to really takeover. </garnt>
<connor> - You can't really step in and be like, </connor>
<garnt> "This is mine." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> So we basically took a seven month hiatus </garnt>
<connor> or it's a hiatus but it was more of not nothing </connor>
<connor> was getting done. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I won't send anything in the group chat. </connor>
<connor> - Nothing was really happening. </connor>
<connor> - They left you on read. </connor>
<garnt> - And it was basically because we just didn't have the time. </garnt>
<garnt> And what was the driving force for it to be revamped was </garnt>
<garnt> that was the point when I wanted to return to YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> I was getting bored with my job and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, first step I wanna put all my hard work </garnt>
<garnt> into PodTaku." </garnt>
<connor> And really revamping this because </connor>
<connor> Tristan's doing really well with whatever he's doing </connor>
<connor> with his patron. </connor>
<connor> And I saw potential for not only me coming back </connor>
<connor> but also pushing PodTaku into something even bigger </connor>
<connor> and better than what it was </connor>
<connor> with help formally and trying to monetize it. </connor>
<connor> And they just basically making it- </connor>
<connor> - Have an incentive ever to turn up every week. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> And so it ended up being... </connor>
<connor> I was the big driving force to getting PodTaku </connor>
<connor> back on its feet. </connor>
<connor> And that's why I got super, super invested in it </connor>
<connor> because I was the one who was getting </connor>
<connor> trying to get episodes done. </connor>
<connor> I was editing a lot of them </connor>
<connor> not because I wanted to be paid or anything </connor>
<connor> but I just wanted this- </connor>
<connor> - It was your passion. </connor>
<connor> - I wanted my passion to be back on the ground. </connor>
<joey> And as soon as I felt it was kind of getting back </joey>
<joey> off the ground, I remember Trisan coming to me </joey>
<joey> and he was like, </joey>
<connor> "I want it to end." </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And I looking back now I totally understand </connor>
<connor> why he did, right because this is where, </connor>
<connor> this is where I put it back to </connor>
<connor> creative differences because he saw that we weren't </connor>
<connor> getting as many views as we used to before the hiatus. </connor>
<connor> And also the dynamic of the group was very different </connor>
<connor> than when then when we started some people </connor>
<connor> weren't getting along as well as they were at the beginning. </connor>
<connor> So he wanted PodTaku to just end there. </connor>
<connor> He wanted to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, instead of just fizzling, fizzling out, </connor>
<connor> I wanted to end here. </connor>
<connor> And I really really tried to convince him to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Look I know we're going through some very big issues now </connor>
<connor> "but I see potential in this." </connor>
<connor> There was a lot of factors that I saw </connor>
<connor> that could potentially have driven a lot of hype back </connor>
<connor> in PodTaku before we ended there. </connor>
<connor> We had Jean had just left. </connor>
<connor> But she was gonna come back we had scheduled that </connor>
<connor> we had also scheduled PodTaku two episode </connor>
<connor> which was like our most popular one. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Look, we can do the come." </connor>
<garnt> I really, really tried to convince him </garnt>
<connor> that it was too early </connor>
<connor> because I totally agree with all the problems </connor>
<connor> that the podcast had in order to survive </connor>
<garnt> and to go further we would have had to make </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of big changes and they could have very easily </garnt>
<garnt> blown up in our face. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess it's one of those things where it's like </connor>
<connor> you could try, but you could very easily fail. </connor>
<joey> It's one of those things where you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Do I wanna put in this work </joey>
<joey> "and I can get the guaranteed paycheck?" </joey>
<joey> I kind of get it but at the same time, I'm like </joey>
<joey> "As a viewer I knew how big it could have been as well." </joey>
<garnt> Looking at my position now. </garnt>
<garnt> And I understand how it all works. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, yeah, it could have been an option. </garnt>
<connor> It could have been severed, definitely </connor>
<connor> - It would have needed a lot of work </connor>
<connor> and it would have taken a big risk </connor>
<connor> and we could have failed massively. </connor>
<connor> But for me as a person, I would rather give that a go </connor>
<connor> then the wonder. </connor>
<connor> And it got to the point when it was just like </connor>
<connor> it was just this one clash, right of just, </connor>
<connor> I thought he was too early to end it </connor>
<connor> and Tristan wanted to want it to end it. </connor>
<connor> And it was unfortunate that I signed, fortunately </connor>
<joey> I didn't get my way. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> They didn't listen to me. </joey>
<garnt> I tried so hard. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a video that you guys all made when it ended. </connor>
<connor> And I remember watching this and that one </connor>
<connor> of those moments, you're like, please say science </connor>
<connor> please say science. </connor>
<joey> But I remember watching that video and it like... </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I remember the order, it was like you first. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, Tristan was last. </connor>
<connor> And I love trust and by the way, just say it. </connor>
<connor> But I remember watching him, I seem like, </connor>
<connor> man it kind of seems like everyone was like really </connor>
<connor> wanting to keep doing this, but then Tristan didn't, </connor>
<garnt> almost as a viewer. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't like that. </garnt>
<garnt> It was at the end- </garnt>
<garnt> - As a viewer I think that's an impression </garnt>
<garnt> I could be totally wrong just compression. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that was definitely a fraction </garnt>
<connor> that supported my stance. </connor>
<connor> There was the faction that support a Tristan stance. </connor>
<connor> - As someone who creates now I can understand both. </connor>
<joey> I don't care about either. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - I mean it's definitely a tough decision right. </connor>
<connor> Anybody in that position would have been like, </connor>
<joey> "Fuck do I take the risk or not?" </joey>
<connor> - If his heart's not in it, his heart's not in it. </connor>
<joey> If you're gonna like drag someone along </joey>
<connor> who doesn't wanna do it, you can't like. </connor>
<joey> - So was there no option to just do it without Tristan? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, we wanted to respect Tristan's wishes. </garnt>
<connor> There was the conversation of like </connor>
<connor> should we do this without Tristan? </connor>
<joey> But it just felt wrong. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah understandable. </joey>
<joey> - Because I wanted to leave the option. </joey>
<joey> I asked Tristan, would it be okay if we continued </joey>
<connor> and then at any point, if for whatever reason </connor>
<connor> you want to return the doors they were always open. </connor>
<connor> And Tristan was like adamant, </connor>
<connor> "No, I don't." </connor>
<joey> And I understand because this was his baby. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I don't feel comfortable letting my baby go </joey>
<joey> and just seeing what happens. </joey>
<connor> So that's was kind of like the last straw, </connor>
<connor> there was no going back from that. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, that's basically how it ended. </connor>
<connor> And it was after that I kind of lost a lot of motivation </connor>
<connor> because I'd put so much of myself into getting this revamped </connor>
<connor> and it just felt like it was just all taken away </connor>
<joey> and it was out of my control and I learned a lot from </joey>
<joey> PodTaku with like learning working on group projects </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> And I wanna say I'm not throwing shade at Tristan at all. </joey>
<joey> We still get along great. </joey>
<joey> I love Tristan. </joey>
<connor> It was just a point where we just had </connor>
<connor> creative differences- </connor>
<connor> - And it happens. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that's a very normal thing. </connor>
<garnt> What I'm trying to say is I've really- </garnt>
<connor> - Demonized and like don't. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I'm not demonizing Tristan. </garnt>
<connor> We just had a different way of approaching things. </connor>
<connor> I still think back to PodTaku and I still think, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, I think it ended too early." </connor>
<connor> And he obviously thinks the other way </connor>
<connor> and he thought the other way back then </connor>
<joey> and that's basically what it ended to. </joey>
<garnt> - How it is, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how it is. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah obviously we don't want anyone going </joey>
<joey> and being like, </joey>
<joey> "Who the fuck man? </joey>
<joey> "Why don't you not believe in it, man?" </joey>
<joey> I mean, like I said earlier, </joey>
<connor> like if your heart's on it and your heart's not in it. </connor>
<joey> That's not gonna happen. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, can anyone like really blame Tristan </joey>
<connor> again, it's a fucking... </connor>
<connor> I would've really vibrating as well. </connor>
<connor> - If I didn't believe in it I'm normally someone who's like </connor>
<connor> adamant about shit, right. </connor>
<connor> So I would be like, </connor>
<joey> "No, no, I don't believe in this." </joey>
<connor> Like I would do like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> So it's just how it is, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I always look back to think what could it be? </connor>
<connor> But that was just the end of an era. </connor>
<connor> And now we're in a new era </connor>
<connor> and everyone's gone down the different paths. </connor>
<connor> I'm really amazed to see what people are getting </connor>
<connor> onto nowadays. </connor>
<connor> And it's fucking great. </connor>
<joey> And I still speak to all the cast members </joey>
<garnt> every now and again especially when we would get to </garnt>
<garnt> meet in a convention. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey, bottom line is that at least there isn't </joey>
<joey> a single member of PodTaku </joey>
<joey> that went and killed their family. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> They didn't go down to Mr.Anime. </connor>
<joey> That's the silver lining. </joey>
<connor> That's the silver lining. </connor>
<connor> - 80s outro where it tells you what we've opened up to. </connor>
<joey> - The fucking snapshot is like yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Joey, didn't his family. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> Before we end it, right I guess the way I see it. </connor>
<garnt> Is if you were still doing PodTaku your Trash Taste </garnt>
<garnt> probably wouldn't exist. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I'm saying. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not trying to say </garnt>
<garnt> I'm glad that you'll pass your project, </garnt>
<connor> but I'm glad that we have this. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I'm very glad as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Please don't kill your families. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Just going to throw that out there. </garnt>
<connor> - You're not British, how do I get a gun? </connor>
<joey> I don't even know how do you do that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna have to make a twit longer. </joey>
<joey> That's like, so about Connor- </joey>
<joey> - My thoughts on Seadog V God. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - This has gotta be real. </joey>
<connor> I wanna kill your family, Joey. </connor>
<connor> Just stop talking about killing. </connor>
<joey> I'm so sorry. </joey>
<joey> - Until you choose with anime, let's fucking do that. </joey>
<connor> - I miss her anime I mean the army man. </connor>
<garnt> I mean both. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah we should've seen the signs all along. </joey>
<joey> It was in the name. </joey>
<connor> - My God it kind of felt that when PodTaku ended </connor>
<connor> that it kind of like, </connor>
<connor> it's like tearing down the Berlin wall, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just letting everyone fucking loose. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like when a big pillar in a community </connor>
<connor> kind of falls right it's just like a ton of people </connor>
<joey> covering for all right. </joey>
<joey> Basically like it's kind of like everyone's looking for </joey>
<joey> the new, like, all right who's the person </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna listen to. </joey>
<joey> We don't really have that at the moment. </joey>
<joey> I don't feel. </joey>
<connor> And I think we do, we have a few big people </connor>
<connor> but I feel that that's when definitely, </connor>
<connor> like you said the new era just was like all right. </connor>
<garnt> - Because back then it was all about doing anime reviews. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I would say the content started to really like </garnt>
<connor> it kind of like opened the doors </connor>
<connor> to all different kinds of content. </connor>
<connor> Like you were doing more blogging videos </connor>
<connor> and analytical channels start to come along. </connor>
<connor> So I feel, it was a coincidence that it happened </connor>
<connor> during the end of PodTaku </connor>
<connor> but I feel like for our community, </connor>
<connor> that was a big turning point. </connor>
<connor> - Oh definitely. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<connor> - Because I remember that was when </connor>
<connor> demo came along as well, near enough back then when </connor>
<garnt> he was starting he changed the game as well. </garnt>
<joey> - No, definitely like there is... </joey>
<garnt> I don't think there's a single attitude </garnt>
<joey> that's on the platform right now </joey>
<connor> and no longer on the platform </connor>
<connor> who didn't look up the demo in any accident. </connor>
<connor> - He did anime stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah anime stuff like demo was just a name that came back. </connor>
<connor> He's like the dad that went to go buy cigarettes </connor>
<joey> and just never came back. </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad I came into it when I did. </joey>
<connor> I feel like I came into it at the time where </connor>
<connor> it's perfect because it was where </connor>
<connor> I wanted to make the content I wanted to make. </connor>
<joey> - I think you came at a perfect time </joey>
<joey> because it was around the time </joey>
<joey> when the whole anime YouTubing thing really </joey>
<connor> diversified itself in terms of its content. </connor>
<connor> So people like you who did very </connor>
<connor> unconventional anime content, </connor>
<joey> it was very to just slip in. </joey>
<connor> - It's great I'm glad that it's gone to the point where </connor>
<joey> we can make a set like this. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause in my mind, I didn't wanna do a podcast </joey>
<connor> unless it was this good. </connor>
<garnt> Like I have no interest in it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I don't wanna do audio, an audio podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is what I kind of wanted to push PodTaku </garnt>
<connor> to the direction of going like me. </connor>
<connor> Like we obviously didn't live in the same place </connor>
<connor> but my idea was, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, what if we all flew to a place </connor>
<connor> "record tons of episodes and released it on a schedule?" </connor>
<connor> And we could do that on a periodic basis based </connor>
<connor> on like, whatever funding we could've gotten. </connor>
<joey> But I'm glad that I have you guys now who... </joey>
<joey> It's taken me how long? </joey>
<joey> - I'm not the one saying that. </joey>
<joey> People in that first episode were like, </joey>
<joey> "This is just PodTaku 2.0?" </joey>
<joey> No, I'm hosting next. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just gonna do that intro. </garnt>
<connor> You have to do it. </connor>
<connor> You have to do it now. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's, it's great, man. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I like you said earlier about the ambition of it </connor>
<connor> I think us three really have like really great ideas </connor>
<connor> of ways that we want to make this not just a podcast </connor>
<garnt> but something really crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they like the Akihabara video. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just like just a step in the Stephanopoulos. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like to say, I thought of the Akihabara video </garnt>
<connor> in the shower. </connor>
<connor> - Thank you to supporting this episode. </connor>

<joey> "Wow, it's poking for the hip." </joey>
<connor> And he was like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know who did it." </connor>
