<SPEAKER_02> you're auto piloting the intro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like taking it over and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh wait i should have just ordered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like being on a podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um normally if i'm having a normal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> conversation sometimes and i know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i know sometimes i know what when i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> start a sentence i know how i'm going to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> end the sentence but when you're on a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> podcast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you always have to finish the sentence </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> through that you're not yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just i'm just like okay i'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to say something because i've been </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> know how to start it or how to end it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where this is going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so gentlemen i thought considering i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> believe we all watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan sinks recently a nice little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quinky dink there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we all watched it separately i didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know you guys were watching it we all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't we didn't make an effort to all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch it we were all just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh we all just watched we all just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turned on netflix and it's like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay it came out recently of the time of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> recording but so by the time you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seeing this microphone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like three or four days ago yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> something like that yeah yeah for us um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but so to explain what uh japan is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> uh since we're gonna be doing uh some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of discussion around it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the new masaki yuasa anime that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> released on netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's basically about a giant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> earthquake that happens in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and after that earthquake happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan starts sinking i guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so for people living in japan it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anxiety </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the anime essentially dude okay first of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all before we get into talking it the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the very first episode they play the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> actual the sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they play this sound that you're hearing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did we like i don't know if i changed my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> phone yeah i checked my phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like where's my phone and i turned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that [ __ ] down because i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what if my neighbor's here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they start freaking out like they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna think there's an actual earthquake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the elderly you know below me yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that made me [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that gave me so much anxiety the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> episode of them portraying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the earthquake happening i was really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> impressed that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how realistic it felt you know what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i probably would have would have reacted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the exact same way it was all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> characters right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when you hear that earthquake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like notification now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you just kind of block it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like oh whatever it's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's probably a small earthquake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> once you've been through about 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> earthquakes in japan which you will yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which which you will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you just you just you hear this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> notification and it's just like another </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> day of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately though every time at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have heard that notification it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> never been the case of ah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever it's probably just a small </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> earthquake because it always happens at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five in the morning yeah and it's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing i wake up to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> imagine just having you're just having a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nice sleep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wherever you are and it's like 4 30 in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the morning and then suddenly you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hear this absolutely anxiety-reducing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> alarm because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just hear the siren but they don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say like if it's strong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah if it's weak it just says he just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> says brace yourself yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just basically brace yourself hold on to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> your butt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it might be strong and it's i already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hate waking up to the sound of an alarm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but when it's an alarm where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh i might die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah then it's it's the worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i had i was enjoying the first episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much because again there was this you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know as you said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a really realistic portrayal yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the moment i hear that sound i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i don't get anxiety often </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i went like the caveman spongebob </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they do it like three times yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would stop doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> please use a like parody noise like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> something like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could you imagine though like especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in that first episode you know when that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big wave yeah yeah do you think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is going to happen well didn't they it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot of again i should have done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> research for this episode but i swear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's been a few scientific </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> predictions that are like there's going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be a mega quake within like 30 or 50 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that i mean there has to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be right because yeah i mean we the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] planet's like no planets the the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> country's all pangaead away right that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't just happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah yeah there has to be stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's moving constantly so yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> something big is gonna happen inevitably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether it's in our lifetime or like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> children's lifetime or [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great great grandchildren's lifetime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's going to happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere like a mega quake like a mega </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quake you know it's it's an interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> idea to explore that there's probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> some massive kind of event that's going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometime in there is there like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know about i'm sure thailand has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> earthquakes right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not really i mean i think japan is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> literally on the fault line yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country is on your fault like okay do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys remember your very first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> earthquake experience yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was because okay we're from the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it is literally the safest place on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> earth yeah yeah i was about to say you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> guys don't get earthquakes right yeah no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no we're like we are like the furthest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> away from like any fault line of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we like natural disasters in the uk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is like non-existent it's like running </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> england is so [ __ ] safe you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> try really hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to get yourself killed in england by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because australia we don't have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> earthquakes at all or anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but everything else would just be we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have you know bushfires and stuff like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that and of course our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> animals are just out for blood but you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> guys don't even have dangerous animals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right no we don't right that's why i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> convinced there's so many like famous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> british explorers because they must have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] bored of the uk like oh it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another [ __ ] squirrel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> talking to americans and canadians who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> go camping and they have to worry about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> bears and stuff like that and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember going camping in england and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like oh yeah like i guess we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> have to worry about deers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i guess deers can be dangerous and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like the biggest worry in the uk is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how much alcohol do i bring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like how much alcohol is the right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of alcohol how much alcohol and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> toilet paper do i bring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's always the worry it's like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta carry two liters of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ten liters of alcohol so we gotta try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and bounce this out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now yeah i don't know i remember my very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> first earthquake experience wasn't in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> japan it was actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in america during ax oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's 28 well not last year now yeah oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no it is last yeah last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year yeah last year's ax so 2019 ax and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember the first one yeah that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like my very first really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah wow so yeah to explain when we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at ax last year we went through a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> magnitude is it seven it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> six or seven but it was far away so it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't awful but it was still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean we were it still is the strongest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> earthquake i've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in even after moving japan yeah and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i was on like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 64. and it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like such a humbling experience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because at first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i didn't know what was going on because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> i i i i remember standing up and i felt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bit dizzy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like what the [ __ ] going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> am i just like really fatigued am i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hungover what's going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i go i go up to the window right just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> imagine you're going up to the window on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the 64th floor of a skyscraper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you look down and then you see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] building just shift yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that and it was just like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i immediately i've never felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vertical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so fast and i immediately just pinned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> myself against the wall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just being like [ __ ] [ __ ] this is an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> earthquake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm surprised you had the balls to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> towards the window </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i didn't know it was an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> earthquake i just thought i was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dizzy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or drunk or something i mean the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one because there was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three that weekend yeah no that was two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> two two in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was in the same day yeah so the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one i was in the elevator while it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the elevator was shaking a lot more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than i thought it should have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm pretty sure there's a japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> woman in there who was from one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stanzas yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she looked [ __ ] terrified oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're nearly near the bottom i'm sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll be fine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're like 10 floors i'm sure we got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this but then the second one was i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with you yeah yeah that was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> funny do you want to tell that story you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> used to tell you okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so the second earthquake that happened i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think it was only maybe a couple of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hours after wasn't it yeah yeah i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like rushed to your hotel room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was busy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's right that was like that night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it was it was you me aki and our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> friend nabi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were just chilling in our hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> room we were just talking about what we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were going to do that night because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're going to a party we're going to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to a party and so we were just chilling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before the party started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know the second earthquake comes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> through and it was i think it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stronger than the first one wasn't it i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think so something like that but either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way very strong like at least magnitude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> from what i remember i think it was 7.1 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> though i think that was the seven wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh and of course it was an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> earthquake i'm used to it uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously everybody else wasn't yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we quickly ran out and we were at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> very very top of the thing was like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 68th or 69th yeah or something of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of that hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and and even amidst all the panic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> connor and my friend navi they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating uh i was thinking chick-fil-a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chick-fil-a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like chick-fil-a nuggets and connor and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nabi just kind of looked at each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well if i'm gonna die might as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> finish off these nuggets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like everyone was panicking i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was literally that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stereotypical american family there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one dude one like white guy with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> daughters like get get down to the floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get down to the bottom floor dardis i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna i'm gonna direct you and i'm there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with like my nuggets walking past him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if i'm gonna die at least i'm gonna die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with nugs in my hands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rushing down the stairs we got like 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> floors down and i was like i'm not you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i don't want to do any more physical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exercises i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i've done enough so yeah i did a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> move which is probably not a pro gamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> move i was like you know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the shaking stopped like two minutes ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'ma get the elevator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is 50 more floors and i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rather die literally than get these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stairs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and i went to the elevator but the weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> configuration of this hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you had to go back to the top yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so that means then i was like all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right well the elevators are still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> working they should have been stopped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were still working so i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay so i go back from the 50th floor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which i just walked down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the 70th i walked all the way down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like okay i'm going to go back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up to the 70th floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i go to get the elevator to go all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way down and they're blocking it off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like you can't go until it's safe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] me well our other friend was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] i'm gonna walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all the way down all the way down he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just waiting at the bottom and he calls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> me he's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where are you are you guys alive yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because i convinced them i'm like listen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys you guys can keep walking i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting the elevator and then they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay yeah i was like oh great we're back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ran down 24's for no reason it was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> scary though because i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i was a little i wasn't worried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know the doors were closing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and opening on their own i thought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's okay i can deal with that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what i didn't like anticipate was when i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> looked out the building i could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally see the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> building opposite us we were going like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this yeah yeah like parallaxing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh that's not right like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> buildings shouldn't do that because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember it was it was like to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was a really humbling experience just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at that moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like my life is not in my own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hands yeah like if this building </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> collapses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there is literally nothing i can do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know when you feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something bad happens you feel like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some kind of control like you might see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a car coming and you you think you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i can jump out of the way of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like if the building was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like logically i knew this building was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> designed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to withstand earthquakes but in my heart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like okay at this moment i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> putting my faith in the engineers and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the builders </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they've done their job [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> correctly because if they haven't i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's literally nothing i can do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i i i guess that was like a first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for me you know i i i'd never been in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of situation where i had just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my my life was in the was in the hands </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like completely something some other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> external to be fair i've experienced a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of earthquakes in my life but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> being on the 69th 17th floor was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely a first for me yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i've been on you know apart </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been in apartment buildings that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 20 floors high and that was still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scary because again the whole thing is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shaking i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to keep telling myself it's good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's shaking it's good that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shaking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but my first i think the scariest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> earthquake experience i had was uh it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was in japan obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and it was up north where my grandma </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lives right um and it was where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the giant earthquake of 2011 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hit essentially so that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that place is like a hot spot yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massive earthquakes um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh and i was there i was in some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh dvd rental place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really old dvd rental place near </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there with my sister and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly i think it was like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magnitude seven and a half or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really really big it was so big in fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that all of the dvds and books on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shelves just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flew out oh wow and me and i had to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> grab my sister's hand and just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hell out of there wow and but we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't go all the way out because the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shop assistant was like don't go out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the street because if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the street if a [ __ ] falls then you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> dead yeah so we had to kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stand in the door frame or the shop and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait for it to settle down and yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was definitely a lot scarier because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being on i thought being on a building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was scary being on the ground floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like on the street in something that big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is really scary because people running </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out and i thought that's kind of dumb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the building's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really safe yeah yeah yeah running out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't know what kid like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly if a traffic light or a you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a street light </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> falls on you then you know i think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sense of control </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know that you think you have even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> though statistically you you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually safer in the building yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the buildings are designed at least the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> newer ones i think like i mean that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really big hotel and it's they're mainly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> designed for like 13 magnitude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> earthquakes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like they're pretty [ __ ] sturdy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speaking of sense of control though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh the characters in japan sinks have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> none </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god can we go back to that yeah no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> no are we gonna we're gonna small things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna be the first spoiler warning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that we need to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've had a spoiler warning before okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there'll be a spoiler warning on screen </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> when she started to get a bit windy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> later on can i can i okay to get my to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get my opinions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of the way um what do you guys think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> series overall i'm glad that we finally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have some good propaganda for youtubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm glad that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we need more youtube propaganda </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> youtubers are good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> more op youtubers dude i'm so glad i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like wow he's a youtuber and he's not an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] this is something no no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this is amazing okay so there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> character in uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in in japan sings that is just a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's a youtuber who's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> superhuman because he can do everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's magical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we're just not gonna explain it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the way that he enters in that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fan propelled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah i know and he's just like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this is mine i bought it with my youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ad ram </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like what videos are you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> uploading you're really telling me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're going to film a video of okinawa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sinking and that shit's going to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> monetized come on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> millions of people die they're monetized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can we just appreciate that the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> character is basically felix pewdiepie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he just like whiteheads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the idealized vision of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> pewdiepie like this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this is his final form right just rocks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we see pewdiepie i wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if he changes his profile picture to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that character next because it was ryo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> from yeah it's real it's real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it looks like rio yeah but i guess when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i saw that and as you said it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably one of the first times that a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtuber has been kind of viewed in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot more positive life fashion it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> really it goes to show me that i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massachusetts is a fan of youtube yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it just it just disappointed me that in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> his final scene he didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> he didn't send them off by going and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't forget to like and subscribe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah very unrealistic there was never a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> poll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> there was not one sponsorship right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the whole thing come on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> no rage shadow i want to imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he comes in the trunk flying away like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> freezing half to death in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> stratosphere and he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> spots my right shoulder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> out of 10 was it or was it good or bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what are you guys okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not going to say that it was a 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm going to give it like a solid seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought it was like a four or five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really you didn't like it nah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't like it either okay here's his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i couldn't stop watching it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but i i didn't so many things i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> right okay here's the thing this the way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like a proper mixed bag for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah same the way i would describe it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> four out of ten series with uh some 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out of 10 scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay it was really weird because some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scenes were [ __ ] amazing it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> peak yourself first two episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> absolute bangers no exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and like some of the scenes in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the last two episodes absolutely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bangers as well like like the scene in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the scenes with the youtuber and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some some of the death scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh the guy's running yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think i don't i don't know what you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> asker has about that was amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> emotional running scenes yeah but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the father's death </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> completely caught me off guard and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh cool the one character i liked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah is dead too i literally thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wow this like after i finished episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two i thought like this could be a 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of 10 if they keep up with like how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then and then we went into the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> culture and they got to the cult and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no this is awful this is actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> awful like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the cult arc for me was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bittersweet because as a massive fan of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> us's stuff i'm like oh this is so young </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there's the scene what the [ __ ] was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> co-op </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] was it okay i gotta hit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the 360 no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i was just watching it dead serious and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the kid just gets [ __ ] destroyed by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this rock </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> she just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it was so perfect comedic timing it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just he turns around it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh casa yeah it was like it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like slapstick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember i was like properly i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was properly invested in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same my first two episodes i probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably invested and then like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some things just fell off like as as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as the series went on right because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember their father dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was he'd he died in a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horrific [ __ ] way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then nobody really just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> acknowledged that they had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just cuts doesn't it yeah they had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one conversation it's like oh you you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forgetting dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they just like next scene like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> happy-go-lucky [ __ ] shopping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in in a supermarket i'm just like like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if if that was real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wouldn't be able to say anything for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the next five days yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even think about it and yet for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason every other character that dies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> after </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that they have like a full-on emotional </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> scene but yeah it drags out like crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah it it something just felt off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the characters i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know what it was about how they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were written but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just didn't like sometimes they acted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the way i would imagine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people would act and sometimes they just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> acted in a completely random way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and then the cult arc happened and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay okay now now now we've gone from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> something feels off to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just stupid so much needed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explaining about that like whole thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where were they getting all of this food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> from where were they getting all of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> weed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so much weed like it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fields of weed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like in japan like you're just gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> grow fuel completely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they never explained the fact that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the the grounds where the cult stood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't affected by the tilting there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just so much there was so much stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it got to the cold arc where i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is too much too many holes for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me to just like be like this is okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because at the end of it all i think the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> reason i was trying to figure out okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what was the point of this called arc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like like what were they trying to build </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i think the only thing that came out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of this cult arc was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just the fact that they got that morse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> code talking professor out of there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but why was he there none of this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> explained </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just a slapstick comedy like like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember watching the coal talk and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know that point when you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really invested in the show and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you go from being invested to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> laughing at how bad it's become </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah that was the cold talk for me and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> couldn't get invested back into the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> after that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it hurt too much after the cult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happened and the fact that they just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay if the old man is addicted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> morphine i'm fine with that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they didn't even build up to that at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all they could have showed some kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know right right like they could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have maybe shown him taking some pills </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that the old man shot that kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four yeah yeah and then they were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then then he was like oh i'm sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know whatever i didn't mean to shoot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you let me fix your game boy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dude you just [ __ ] shot my kid yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> with the intent to kill it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like if he didn't have his [ __ ] ds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like he he would be dead </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just gonna let him know he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually the last ps vita ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of episode four when the kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got shot i was like oh thank god he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dead </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my god that kid was [ __ ] annoying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay did you you what did you actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sub the dubbed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i watched both i watched sorry i like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally i was like i watched the dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something fell off i watched the sub and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first time my [ __ ] life i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i could not stand like the voice </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> really like i get it that they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> supposed to be like native in both </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then i feel like they should have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got people who are native and both it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terrible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when they whenever he said let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> go it's just like that's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it sounds like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well they could have even have just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gotten someone with a similar voice type </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who speaks english you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what is it what is it about </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> and yet somehow they can't get i made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this joke on twitter but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it was the second to last </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> episode when they're in russia yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they got those like three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nurses who could speak perfect russian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and yet they can't get a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> single english voice actually yeah it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> was like what why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how is it so hard because in the dump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do they deal with the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> do uh bilingualness they they didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> really the boy just always spoke english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's that's why they mentioned it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> at all that he could speak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean like they kind of do i wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them to just be like i want to meet my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> older son </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like a reverse is it like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> huge plot point because then later on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the barrage comes with the japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh the japanese kkk which the the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know the the dynamics of that boat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just the engineering stands of it were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> horrific both yeah you couldn't handle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> waves like waves could just come off it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally burst into claims </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no reason like oh my god sorry i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got yeah it was the i've got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> engineering the more the more we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> discussing this the more i'm regretting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> giving it a seven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the emotions it gave me were ten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like like let's let's let's not forget </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that they also added a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> woman who could speak to the dead that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was just what's up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never explained </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was two points i burst out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> laughing one one was the kid dying and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the second one was like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mexican standoff where she just brings a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] samurai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is this kill bill is this a kill bill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that was such a quentin tarantino scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this there's a guy with a bag full of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gold bars with a gun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and she just rocks off with a samurai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sword and the guy just walks up the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> stairs like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> uh and i'm just like what am i watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought i was watching like a disaster </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's turned into [ __ ] kill bill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just i couldn't stop taking sick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i couldn't stop laughing at that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what did you guys think of the last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a really [ __ ] hated the last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> step yeah the last episode just kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> dragged out for a little bit too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> last episode was uh remember when the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> olympics was meant to happen right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> well this is this is awkward don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> forget the paralympics too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just gotta make sure i mean i'm sure it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> would have hit harder because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the olympics would be happening right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now yeah if this was released right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd be like oh that's that's a pro gamer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> move there you are so i see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i see you but but now that the olympics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't happening it was just one giant ad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the olympics oh no it wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i didn't want to say that but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it definitely like felt a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a little ad-like like look how amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the olympics are and it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we know yeah we know how good the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> olympics are or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how good it should have been because i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't like maybe i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was i wasn't paying attention to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i saw a lot of people commenting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> saying that the show was like very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> political </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at times and i was thinking like i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know if it was that political people are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to put that on it like i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> get that did you get that vibe no not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean maybe they were talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about the rap scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh maybe which i liked i like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rapture i like the rap scene well that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was a this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this doesn't this is a really random </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scene but i'm all for it it was a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> scene it was random though i was like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know what this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we can keep doing it but it's such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yuasa move where you know he was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like okay i really want to tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people how much i love japan but how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> much japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sucks but not make us super political </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah freestyle rap baby let's do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so originally was the rap in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese in the japanese stuff yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't notice because i at that point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was just purely watching the english </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was all in english and it it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really really done well so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't know if it was a case where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they just like had that one specific </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scene in english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but not like i really enjoyed that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really enjoyed the last two episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not the last two episodes like episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nine and the one before that yeah those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are two really strong episodes yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they had like like i said i wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> invested in the characters at that point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is really weird because there were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some scenes that like i felt something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> even though i had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> zero investment in the story and the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> characters but just because of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the sheer brilliance of some some of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ways these scenes were directed i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah man i'm i'm i'm feeling something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> even though i really shouldn't be right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> now yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um did the mom have to die like i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking like i was like did she have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enter life here for this because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of went like i don't know if they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably went further but it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one minute on the boat oop it's out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fuel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it was implied though that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because her like device hadn't run out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of battery life she was literally going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to die but then she had like a solar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> panel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no no because like that thing hadn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> become busted oh it had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh so the implication was that she was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> going to die i didn't pick that up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought is she just killing herself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like the lulls here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> she's just drowning for like i mean this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like i have to fill in my one death </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> per episode yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at this point it was just they were just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> killing characters that's what it felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like it felt like they were like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> character was going to die now and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were just trying to sit through it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't feel like it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> needed yeah and the one character that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should have died a million years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is the crippled doctor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> survived how somehow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know how no like yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was my biggest problem with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because it wasn't the fact that people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> were dying it was the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you just knew that someone was gonna die </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was it was just okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the scene where this person's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna die you know there's no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> tension or anything you're just okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well they're gonna die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're dead and everyone's moving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on now and it's sad and you should be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and japan's sinking yeah so like but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube are good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no it's really weird though because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was having this conversation with joey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> earlier though i think we could we can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> end the spoiler discussion now no more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spoilers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unless unless there's anything else you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> guys want to discuss about the series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> specifically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why of all pro games did he become a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> league of legends pro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and totally unrealistic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's not a little [ __ ] i mean he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of was there actually maybe he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah maybe he was a league player </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> no but uh yeah it was it was really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird because even though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like i would give like a four or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> five out of 10 at the end of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um i still ended up having like a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time watching your netflix i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i couldn't look away yeah it was great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't know why where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's i i find it so easy to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> anime on netflix as opposed to watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> anime on like any other platform </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been saying this since early 2018 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> ever since devil may cry baby and other </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> well it was around the time when netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just started to get their hands on a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of anime ips </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that with at least with stuff that comes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> out on netflix you know castlevania did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it really well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i think the reason why netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can kill it so hard with anime is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they know that most anime viewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> including probably all three of us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'd like to watch shows just in one big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> chunk oh my god castlevania is so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] so amazing right and i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what it is is that because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever they release something new they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just go we know you can't wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an entire week so we're just going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give you the whole thing all in one go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's perfect because netflix is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> designed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to binge it's just to be binged right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it also feels like there's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> seasonal pressure as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no if there's just one big show that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> drops yeah don't watch it right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's not it's not it's not under </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any kind of like scheduling no it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because i've had plenty of shows where i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to binge them and i wait </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they're on crunchyroll or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> funimation or whatever platform and i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay i'm going to wait for this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for this to be over and then i'm going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to binge it and then it's over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then i don't binge it and i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't watch yourself because by the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it ends there's another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whole new batch of shows that you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> interested in now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you never have time to go back to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and then i've watched so many like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mediocre anime on netflix i have no idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> why but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can download it it's super easy i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> remember watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i think be the beginning as well i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like severely disappointed in how that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turned out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i watched it i watched it all in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i still there are still many shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on every other platform that i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> still have not watched and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are on my plan to watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this so yeah i don't know what it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about watching shows on netflix so it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just makes it so it's just painless like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so easy to watch like they make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way too easy for you to enjoy it the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you want to enjoy it yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just they just know how the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> viewing habits of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people of our demographic and the app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> works so well on your phone so it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easy to just chuck that [ __ ] on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chromecast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah like you know saves where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you are it's so good we're not sponsored </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> by netflix </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but if they want to hit if they want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hit us up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay how would you feel about the uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> skip opening button though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i love the skip opening button i i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the option </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like i like i like having the option </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but like it's but i don't like how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the default is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah i don't like how the default </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is skipping because wait they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't skip it straight away yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they do the first time you watch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you you don't have the option well you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do have the opportunity to skip it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it plays it for you automatically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but every time after that then yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think they just assume that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going to skip it which sucked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because when i was watching b stars on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> netflix </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like i don't want to skip this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean yeah we're [ __ ] opening yeah b </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stars you watch but yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't have to do it so i had to keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to touch it joey it's there in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> case you don't want it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not like touch me touch me cherry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> touch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> speaking of masaki you also though like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff have you guys watched in the past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've watched most of this stuff except </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> kaiba um is that his </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's yeah devil man is here oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he's a king as well i still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's it's fun it's funny that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still haven't watched a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ken yeah even though i've watched japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sings which i feel like is going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worse than a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kid and he's against been out for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while he's a kid he's done ping pong the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animation oh i love being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> done kaiba he's done mind game mind game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is one of my favorites kick hearts as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> well which was the kickstarter one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right um he's done a lot of uh indie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> films </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> as well he does yeah your way i haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seen i haven't seen i still haven't seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i really need to watch that it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about the it's like uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> girlfriend boyfriend dies they both love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ocean and their boyfriend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> reincarnates as a wave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's the only way to describe it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right that's the easiest way to describe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it it's like a hentai yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> boyfriend resurrects as a water beast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah essentially no because i think my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite yuasa work will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like is at the moment ping pong the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animation oh my god yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> saying that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> every time we're on it's like oh this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this show just hits this dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and different i i guess because it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like relatable in some way like you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably been good at something without </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying and you've also probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not been i mean we had a lot of comments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> last week that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah connor's chess story is basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ping pong the animation just with chess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah you know what i mean but the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> way it just portrays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it because to me it's not a sports anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me ping pong the animation is a life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime that happens to follow characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one single one single sport because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's such a good metaphor for life in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> general when it when it comes to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> discussion of talent you know versus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hard work </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just basically how crushingly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> depressing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life can be sometimes life isn't fair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah life life is not fair and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one's entitled to anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately i mean that's the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason why i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] loved marsh comes in like elaine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's essentially the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing that yeah that's not what you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see it's it is not a show about shogi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you'll get into shogi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after watching it but much like ping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pong the animation it's just a story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter how good you are at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something you're still going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depressed as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i've been putting it off i'm like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to be depressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it gets pretty easy i know it does i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> do you think japan syncs is his worst </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> work that you've seen so far then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the three i've seen yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably i mean i haven't seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> everything masakiosa has to offer yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've seen a lot but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i i'd probably say it's yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> probably his weakness yeah i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely for me it was his weakest and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it literally just removed the cult yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many problems will be solved if he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just had yeah i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> would say no not every problem would be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> solved but a lot of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it would be like a lot better because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> still had problems with how the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> characters were written </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and how the story played out but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> removing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> removing the middle arc would have made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it like an easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seven to eight out of ten yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there was still like i said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there were still some amazing scenes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was some planning amazing and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like peak you are certain if i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> actually invested </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i would think that this show had some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty amazing moments in it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um because i feel like just you got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bogged down by its story so much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah um whereas his other works i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was it was like a nice combination </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between this yuasa style of directing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he has a i don't know some of his scenes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the way the way he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the way he portrays and directs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially like the emotional scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they they can hit really hard and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know what he does she's so close </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> shut the [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i definitely think that you also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> regardless of how strange it is that the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> way that he portrays </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you know character designs and just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> movement in general just animation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just animating okay i'm one of those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> anime viewers who does not care who the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> director is or any of that stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just watch the show and that's how i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watch your anime i do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with everything so i mean i could tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was from the same guy who did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> devilman within like 10 seconds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah just tell yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how i do because yuasa's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> films and series have this really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing where sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at a character design obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wow that looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty cool and then the next scene it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> looks like it's written by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the intern you know it changes i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think there was like a few frames in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> characters talking and it was like bruh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like paint </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can take a screenshot of that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just be a pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i will say out of like all his works i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like japan syncs was his most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like normal looking work in terms of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> visual style </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no no no no you like you compare ping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pong the animation and then you go to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> devilman crybaby and then japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sinks i i would i would say he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> progressively gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in terms of his big series yeah more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> more like normal ping pong is one ugly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> luck in show but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in a great way in a great way like he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a very unique art style and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the scenes were like they had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very unique animation style and some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i would still say sometimes it works </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes it doesn't work so well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but it was definitely a very yuasa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> style i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> at least you know it's him yeah yeah how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of those generic isekai shows are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i are these all animated by the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same [ __ ] people they all look the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can't tell you ask any soccer guitar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'll probably know it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> this was directed i don't care like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> i see an easy guy protagonist now and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's literally a carbon copy of kirito </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i remember doing like a copy and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> paste of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seven different like isikai protagonists </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and they all looked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly the same it was all that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> generally probably because they're all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a1 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the exact same art style the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same animation all the time and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's such a breath of fresh air you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can get anything different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh no that's what i love about masakusa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's just so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird that it's just instantly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recognizable especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you know japan sinks as you were saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even though it looks the most normal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably to the general anime viewing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> audience they would look at those </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> characters and be like oh that looks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but then you go back to massachusetts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> catalog you watch something like kyber </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like that thing that doesn't even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> look like anime yeah yeah that thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know some kind of like disney demo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it was locked away in the disney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vault for a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah the art style's weird i can't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> into it i'm like you'll know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll appreciate it it's an acquired </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time once you acquire that taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> taste acquired </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i was going to say i completely forgot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the one shot and you're also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting one show when we're talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> muscle like yo sir um to tommy galaxy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh no tommy galaxy was [ __ ] a man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like you watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] amazing it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> monogatari but on crap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is like this this this will test your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> reading ability </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to the max if the monologue is so fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> japanese people struggle to keep up with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] do you just go back the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never heard of monologue and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> talking scenes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that go by so god damn quickly yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is it is monogatari on crack essentially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's basically like if you take one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guitar but try to speed run the dialogue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's that's an episode of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tatami galaxy but it's [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that and that's on top of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] crazy mosaic you was a visual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah where it's just like i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if this is like a dreamscape or if it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird yeah yeah but it's great it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fantastic uh one thing i wanted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> one thing that we kind of like glossed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over in terms of japan things that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to talk about though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is the music i thought the music was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fantastic i thought it was phenomenal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i i i think that definitely some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it made some it it was what helped make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that main track i think it played most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the first episode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when the main character was running back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a family that kind of slow piano </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think song i love that track because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> positive sounding and yet putting it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> next to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the absolutely devastating visuals yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just becomes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> such a creepy song where it's like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> everything and everyone is dead because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well like what sold me on the first two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> episodes was just seeing seeing some of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these like horrific scenes horrific </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> landscapes and hearing this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> beautiful piano track that just gave </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this like juxtaposition </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that just like it was really unnerving </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but beautiful at the same time like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way i described it to sydney was it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> felt like i was watching some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something that was horrifically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beautiful yeah and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that that was it was like a beautiful </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> destruction yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and i don't know who the composer was it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sounded very similar to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> devman crybaby's soundtrack in some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scenes as well i don't know if it's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> same composer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> did i probably should have done my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> research before talking about japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sings on his podcast i mean i'm sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was done by science sarah who did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know devil may cry baby so i assume it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy but i i don't know i'm sure someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the comments can tell us about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i love that piano track because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not gonna lie the first time i heard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it i it kind of reminded me of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> minecraft soundtrack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a little bit i was like if this played </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> during minecraft i would not be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> phased in any way i thought [ __ ] damn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can someone in the subreddit take that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> piece of music and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put it over minecraft let's play it and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> see if you can spot it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like god this was such horrific </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beauty this the juxtaposition was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> joey minecraft it sounds like minecraft </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i was like oh minecraft i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know if i'm just dumb but i cannot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> remember any of the music you really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't no i watched it all in one sitting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we all did yeah did you watch one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sitting yeah yeah yeah yeah oh okay i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't remember [ __ ] we just have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bigger brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clearly i think i was preoccupied how do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they get a tank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> okay a question to you then what kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> osts do you remember what sticks out for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh anything where like the music is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a huge selling point i guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what what what do you mean ah i mean i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't want to be that guy but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the one that sticks out immediately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> are you remember cowboy bebop like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's right like but i wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> listen to jazz on its own i'm like so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like this just sounds like a mess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i've i've come to understand that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when it comes to music you're a little </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> bit brain dead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah because you don't you don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> really listen to because you know god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i can have a conversation of oh this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> band is the intellectual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> awesome and yet i i i remember i asked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> connor once i was like who's your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> favorite band and he was just like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really have one i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i like no i like daddy punk you know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's just noise most of the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i hate like i never listen to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lyrics like i i'll have like listened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i listened to like popped up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kicks like a thousand times or someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like it's about school shooting and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i actually listened to it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh yeah i guess it is i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know what's wrong with me you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> want monkey brain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's that monkey brain coming back man i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have like half a monkey brain half giant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> brain depending on like what i can do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a single composer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kevin penkin aside from kevin franken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's our [ __ ] mate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like he said he's not composing our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just a man do you know what he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> composed other than made an abyss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh yeah other than tal of god shield </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hero yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> okay okay it's pretty the boy's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> completely brain dude that's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess because i focus more on voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> acting than anything and that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking up all the noise input i can take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right like i don't really give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about the music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me the music is just does the music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not enhance your viewing experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the music to me is so [ __ ] important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no not really like if if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if uh if there's a shitty series with a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> good soundtrack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm still going to remember that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely agree to this day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like i will never forget guilty crown </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> despite how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] guilty crown turns into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that like will invoke an emotion in me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like if they've been a soundtrack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as far as it goes it's like but have you </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> that's yeah i remember like individual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> songs but if you ask me like describe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> them or what i like about them i'd be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like they're more like crayon colors too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like for all i care you could put like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] kevin macleod music whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kevin mccloud mcleod's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like there's definitely been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some generic sounding soundtracks that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they're normally like for generic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows right but yeah i don't know a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> soundtrack can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> easily sell me a series i wish i could </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah i know i think you just basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> described music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in in in the most like i think bare </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> bones monkey breaks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a bunch of noises i think i actually am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a caveman when it comes to music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the beeps and the boobs are very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pleasing music goes boom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean that's a huge reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when it comes to soundtracks that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> huge reason why i love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anything made by uh key studios right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> jun is a [ __ ] amazing composer and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just subtle piano tracks or any of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> openings and endings just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it builds on the scene so [ __ ] nicely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it adds like a whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like totally like at least to me i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe i'm the only one but i could just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any track from clannad or air yeah or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little busters yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it could be a specific song that can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> evoke a specific scene and i could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> easily shut it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just from listening to it like his work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is basically if you want to hit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the emotional g-spot yeah you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean like you you hear it and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh oh [ __ ] no it feels like how does a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> single piano put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this much emotion behind it i have no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] idea you're like the mike was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> asking me more he's just standing there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this conversation </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> that's great yeah i love that that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great i love that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> has has the track never evoked emotions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from you though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like have you ever listened to actual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> evo emotion okay what's your favorite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dark punk track </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh that's hard i really like face to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> face okay why is it your favorite track </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god is it because it evokes an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> emotion you've seen his face he's never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought about this thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> before i don't know why this is my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> favorite song no i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i like all the sampling in it i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like crazy how creative they are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with sampling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so you're looking at them so is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there okay think about the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> daft punk song it doesn't have to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dark just think about the one song that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has evoked like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any kind of emotion in you what song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would that be and what emotion would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i i don't think there is i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> think there is a song that evokes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> emotions in me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that mad is that what does that mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what does that mean about me as a person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm talking to a [ __ ] brick wall here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like trying to explain to you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> peppa the android what music is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like it does not compute it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like i feel like i'm alien right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emotion what is culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this i don't know i guess like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for me i maybe that's why like i focus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i'm i feel like i'm really uh strong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in being able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh really break down voice acting in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shows and really like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get into it but i think that's because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm completely [ __ ] ignorant but what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like brings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> emotions to you the story and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and the performances okay but does not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buzz but does voice acting not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> give you emotion yeah the voice acting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> does okay so how come music can't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dude i don't know i guess i can't like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know it doesn't connect with me i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> do you know a medium where you can feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> emotion just by story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and characters books books </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't read books i don't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> read the book i want someone to read it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the music for me is something that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> ties it together and it's something that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's done well i don't notice and if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's done badly i will notice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay no i agree with that which is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> way i think that most people view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like voice acting no no i agree with how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if music is done well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't if it's done so well then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes you can't notice it but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then there's a level no because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't i don't look out for it like i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no when i say when i say good i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like just it blends in perfectly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> satisfactory music you don't notice it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you will definitely hear when a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> soundtrack is really well there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> track that they use in amazing ways i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> notice that track and i'll like have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> logo right but does that not like your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> emotions you've definitely heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sarino drop yeah yeah and i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah i get a little hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about it i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> excited </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> okay so i remember the music was sad i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you talk about music to me you need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to filter it through like the youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> audio library </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tags like genre and mood that's the only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing i understand about music </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> the motorbike scene where they're on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the motor and it's nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but just no doubt no dialogue just them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> riding on a motorbike with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> beautiful visuals and beautiful music do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you remember that scene now </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> when i finished like it's gone okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's let's steer away let's go down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> let's go down to the most like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> rudimentary level here let's let's go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay okay what is your favorite anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> opening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh that's good i really like the kogius </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one okay why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> type is fun okay but what makes it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like what emotions do you feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when listening to it is it excitement is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like are you excited yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so how come you can put emotion into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that song </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but what what makes what makes that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> memorable yeah what makes that matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the opening part is pretty high you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the the the jumbo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just the meme yeah i love it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> though it's good what else do i love i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean the jojo the jojo opening type is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> okay okay oh no no giona gianno's theme </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> okay why does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as i said in i think i tweeted it i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's the bohemian rhapsody </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what does that mean what does that mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what is that because there's so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] going on it's like a five minute </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> song and there's just like so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] things happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm like wow this is amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if it's the coffee or this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> conversation but i'm basically getting a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> headache </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm getting like a brain aneurysm right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> now i imagine the viewers at home are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like what is wrong with this kid what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wrong i'm like dying inside just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listening to this ah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have i never had this conversation with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you before because every time you bring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up music i think i just go like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you if we went to school together you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be that one kid who would wear a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cocobain t-shirt not knowing who nirvana </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean like to be like yeah i like his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> face yeah look he's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that teen spirit song spirit yeah what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> looks like teen spirit so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> okay what else do you value anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> else in an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> aside from like story and characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then um i mean the visuals are really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like i feel that it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not so much that i don't appreciate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music it's again like i said like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's done well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it blends in and i don't really pay much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attention to it okay but you remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the cowboy ball soundtrack yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay why do you remember that i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it went like really well with all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cardio like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the movements in that show like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blended so well yeah music and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it like made them both stand out more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> than anything at the time when i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because the choreo so your argument is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that because this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the feeling of the soundtrack is not an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> argument so completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just saying like i'm not trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> argue or anything i'm just saying that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what i remember is because no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because because you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because you're logic from what i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understanding your logic is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that again i don't think about this too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much yeah well your logic is that the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cowboy bebop soundtrack you remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the feeling and vibe you got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from the music was so different to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> visuals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right no no because i can't put the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> visuals without the music there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so how come you don't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zankyeon ortera then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because it does the exact same thing i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember like maybe like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two scenes from sankyonotera literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and do they involve any music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no i remember seeing the building </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> explode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i was about to say the only sound i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember someone getting sniped and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> remember being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sad by the sniped i i was expecting to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> say that you were very impressed with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the no script i was very interested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with this man's aim in a helicopter very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> impressed you know must have had some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> background okay like when i watch a show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was good but not like life-changing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it kind of just goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the back of my head and i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like well apparently if you watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life-changing shows you don't remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the music anyway so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like i remember the boca rano theme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember the pokemon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone knows that song though that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all i remember from boca rato the music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you don't remember the soundtrack no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not at all i remember the soundtrack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being pretty good to book arona </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no clue um actually i don't remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah i i just remember the opening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this man doesn't remember one single </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> soundtrack because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because after after last episode or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry a couple of episodes back uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i went and re-watched a couple of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episodes of volcarano just because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hadn't seen it in such a long time and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the sound i remember the soundtrack i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was like wow this soundtrack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for sure really [ __ ] good it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason i cannot for the life of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember character names after the end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of the show like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like it's the blue haired one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he does something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even monkey breeze it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> goldfish i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely like it's so weird because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll remember so many things vividly in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my life but when it comes to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> entertainment and stuff that i consume </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it goes i mean i guess that's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you probably just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> infinite rewatch ability right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can re-watch shows and not get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoyment out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i forget what because i forget half the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] that i've seen right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh what are they we watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something recently and i remember being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very impressed because i'm like i forgot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all right we watched breaking bad and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like i forgot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all of this [ __ ] yeah through seasons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one through five i don't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything i mean that's a long show so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but yeah that's i don't know is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that weird i'm sure there's people in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the comments who are the same were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't remember any characters i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> remember the soundtracks i've i've met </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've met someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> why are you watching adam yeah i love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the experience like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> leave me alone i get what i get out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it you enjoy the experience that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't remember after hands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you remember this i've legitimately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never had this conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like this this conversation is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first to me i've never i've never had to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> explain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to someone why music is like a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> thing no no no no no in terms of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entertainment no i'm not i'm not arguing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's not a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing i just don't remember it okay i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> convinced right that people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lie about like when you have discussions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with them and you're like yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember the soundtrack i'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> convinced that they're just like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah it was totally great i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the sun there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like definitely people who do that all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the time no but like to say there's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not a single soundtrack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from like some of your favorite series i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't remember anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if you hear it if i hear it i reckon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll be able to pull out that memory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> from the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dusty old cabinet right but then you'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pull it out and what you'll pull out a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> file that just says good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like nice but it's like okay it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i can remember voice performances quite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well but that's because i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i take an active interest in really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learning those and really studying that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so what do you sell makes a good voice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> performance then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and is it something that has to be in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> english or does it have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can you recognize it in like japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah japanese too but i think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just from watching a lot of japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's something that you can because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the way you deliver a line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything right the way i visu a line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a uh when you deliver a singular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> line there's a visualization to it of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you imagine the pacing and the pitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they should in my head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a good line there's a set where it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> should be delivered right and that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> way the director wants it to and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i imagine like someone like quentin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> tarantino has the same idea it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the line is delivered </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the way i see it yeah right and so it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i just visualize in my head the way it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> should go like if you should raise your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> voice how you should raise your pitch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you should take it down when you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> should slow it down when you should out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of pause </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's really interesting seeing how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like some of the actors will deliver a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> certain line and where they'll choose to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take pauses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or how they'll choose to slow words down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i think that's really interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh i'm the same like you know i haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> done as much voicing yeah as you but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i definitely take a keen eye to voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> acting as well because i also want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get better at it yeah and i i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> totally get what you mean with the cult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> curve there's the way i wish that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wish i had figured out a way where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> could definitively show people what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean in my head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah about that because if you put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the line on like an axis of y and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like x you know they would it would go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like that right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would be like right you need to pause </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here you need to take a break here slow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> down this word this word's in italics so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please put emphasis on it but not too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much emphasis yeah very bold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's like really loads of nuances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that we don't see as the audience that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my head when i'm listening to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something i'm imagining how they saw the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> script </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'm trying to think back to what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were thinking so like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> depending on what medium we're in now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like and also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> ever since i got way too into voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> acting i see so much adr and it puts me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] off in films when you can hear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one line that's delivered in the room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yep and one line whether you get it in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> post </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's so grating when you hear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because like so many sitcoms do this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they like have the line done in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> post yeah you don't realize how many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> movies are done in post as well i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know a lot of you have done so well then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i've definitely noticed it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recently when i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like when you noticed it once you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> can't stop noticing it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i noticed and and that's the problem i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have with um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> watching shows that are dubbed in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> languages like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh you know italian or whatever or or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dutch normally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> they're they have to dub so many shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're just pumping this out and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's not really much given to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sound of it and it sounds like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a studio every single tv show they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in no matter where they go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i hear this italian or this dutch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy speak it always sounds like they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in a studio when they're outside it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what the [ __ ] i hate that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so much and that's the reason why when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people are like oh i watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i had a german friend who watched game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of thrones in dutch or a german sorry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dubbed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i was like why it sounds like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's in a studio they want a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> battlefield no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's exactly the same as thai dubs when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i was talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dubs and they just don't know audio </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mixing so instead of like making it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sound like they're in the environment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's always in the same studio and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> instead of like mixing in the voices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they just like quiet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every other voice and every other sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every other sound so the voices are just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10 times louder than every sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> effect every time someone talks and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the sound effects get louder again oh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> god it's like the worst kind of audio </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mixing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's lazy as [ __ ] yeah i mean now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not sure if they did it back then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but now commonly the japanese uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> studios will just give uh basically a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> track with just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the voices taken out yeah and they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like here's everything we've done it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just add the voices yeah normally quite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easy um but yeah but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of dubbing or voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> performances in anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cartoons that's a whole different like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i feel like i feel like one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unsung hero in terms of like voice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> acting and dubbing is the voice director </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i feel like obviously you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actors get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the credits but i feel they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> also get all the [ __ ] they always get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i feel like the a voice director has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so much control </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over how good this voice performance is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to be because i've definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> worked with voice actors and actresses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my own bridge series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they've done a great [ __ ] job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i i see them voicing like other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> projects </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's terrible it's it's bad yeah it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hurts me because i know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the potential that these voice actors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> have um and i know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably just bad voice direction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know and they're gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of people don't think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that or don't know that because they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just think oh that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a shitty voice actor you know yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a real shame </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's difficult because unless you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> been in an environment where you've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worked with a director </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or had someone directing you in any way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really hard to understand the role </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of a director </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes i didn't quite get it until i had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worked in that space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's kind of the person who like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because when you're doing it for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself and you're acting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you're in your own head you're your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> worst enemy because you're like [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> should've done it this way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because when i've recorded for one of my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> own videos 20 takes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i record for someone else with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> director one or two texts yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they tell me what they want and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> help me get there and a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's ten percent of voice actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who can deliver lines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazingly without a director yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then there's like 50 who need a director </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and there's like 30 40 percent who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's be honest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's one of those things where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do need like a good ear somewhat it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> skill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely it's definitely a skill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i personally think i'm a much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better voice director than i am a voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though i've done both i try to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insert my own voice as little as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> possible whenever i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing kind of any kind of voice work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i've done before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i really enjoy directing because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's it's definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a unique skill because i've seen how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other people direct </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their their work as well and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone has a different style </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some are just not effective at all some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some voice directors you know they they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have no idea what they want no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know and yeah it's just on the voice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actor to save </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to save the performance somehow even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though the director has no idea what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they want </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um do you ever get that moment though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're directing someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you they've not delivered the line </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly the way you want it and so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to explain it to them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you get to the third point yeah the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> third it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the third time the third time you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tried and they still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't done it the way you want it to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you continue like do you do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> continue trying to explain it to them or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> do you just go with one of the takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally i will do i would try my best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to explain it to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um worst case scenario i'll do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a line read which line read is uh you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't normally do it it's kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not unprofessional but it wastes a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of time which is where the director </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> will deliver the line </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and he'll be like just copy what i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> did yeah and that's what i'll do on the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> worst case scenario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and if they can't do that then it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> this is going to be bad like if they if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> they can't hear want like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what i just did yeah and they can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> replicate it that means that they have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no idea what i just did yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my head i'm like okay they don't even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see what i did they don't know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's the worst feeling in the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's pretty awful today's video is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sponsored by xenonsard zenonsart is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unique ai based anime card game for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mobile that's just been recently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> released </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so do you guys know what the ai card </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> game is i have no idea what ai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so basically the ar card game so in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game you get an ai buddy that you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> choose from and and the choice of the a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i think there's 16 different ai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters that you can choose from and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's based off of this interview that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you do at the beginning of the game that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dictates your personality and right you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pick the ai that best suits your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> personality but basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you have an ai buddy that plays along </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and helps you strategize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to play zenon's which is this card game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the ai buddy like gives you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> legitimate advice on the games like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can beat the game and like different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strategies and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't have to follow the ai but you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know a lot of the ais are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> acute girls and sometimes they're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really cool characters and you're </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> clips of the game and the visuals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look pretty damn impressive for a mobile </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> game so the actual gameplay involves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three phases you have the mono movement </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> phase the flash phase and the main phase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the unique feature about zenon zod </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the mana movement system where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> move summoned minions to and from mana </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> sponsoring today's episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and back to the video i did a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> series where i like fixed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh games hentai anime i redid all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> voice acting from the ground up um and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only rule was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wasn't allowed to change uh i was i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't changing anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the voice acting the whole point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> of that was to like prove to the viewers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> listen you could you can fix the bad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> voice acting but more often than not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not the bad voice acting that is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> terrible about this series or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing that you watch like it's normally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just because like everything else is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> terrible yeah and the one thing that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stands out is this dude who's delivering </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> a line [ __ ] like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but that's normally as a result of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything else being [ __ ] because voice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actors are the last priority for most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they're normally the thing that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you do at the end and some games and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff like games </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are normally the worst uh worst culprit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of terrible voice acting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh no no especially japanese games that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> get translated into english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally have god [ __ ] awful voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> actions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of those games as well just have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely horrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> localization just the dialogue clearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the person who was translating it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does not have the firmest grasp of both </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> languages and it's because normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not given like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an amazing budget to do it no these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> games are long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty underpaid unfortunately yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just like whatever i'll just do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> minimum run it through google translate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if need be you know [ __ ] it no one's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> going to notice the voice things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] anyway who cares the japanese word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in with like okasan you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah means mom in japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all according to keikaku like speaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> about voice actors and voice acting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like the only person who's actually been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in an anime here is you joe yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like an actual japanese anime like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what was the experience like for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that was really cool because you want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> explain like you're on pop team episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i just purely by coincidence i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> got to voice in pop team epic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh even though all my lines i did were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in english it was technically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it was technically the japanese i'm in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i know because funimation dubbed pop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> team epic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they didn't use me i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're allowed to though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no they weren't but you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fundamentally you could've hit me off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my dms were open my dms were we follow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> each other on twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you could have dm me anyway so i voiced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this it was this entire episode that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> voiced in english because pogba maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crazy no rules right um and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really cool because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh i got to voice act with the guy who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> voiced rio in devilman crybaby </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh awesome because he's also fluent in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> english he's pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good at english oh wow yeah so he and he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> delivered obviously in the english part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was really cool because it you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's a lot of the portrayals is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of voice acting is that you know one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person goes into the booth they do their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> next person comes in it's normal that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> normally how it is but i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is only in the japanese industry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at least with the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they put all the voice actors that are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode all into the same room and there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are four or five microphones lined up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i i saw i saw that with some like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> behind the scenes documentary yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think how i understand the dubbing in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like the english speaking world is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get one booth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> one one one after the other one but in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> anime it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you they do it all in one go so if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a current scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> where there are four voice actors then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all four voice actors will go up to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mics and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically while holding them the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> script in their hand take it in turns to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> deliver their line and when they're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing their line they pull away from the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> microphone i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all cartoons used to be that way in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> world yeah i think recently it's changed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i think so i think one series you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely see that effect in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is conoceber where you can you can tell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that all of the characters are just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bouncing off each other oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much yeah and like the dub the dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for conor super is actually great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i commend them for being able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like recreate this energy while not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being in the same room because because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can definitely feel that energy in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the japanese dub i mean connoisseur oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's what makes one of it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that's why it's so good because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can tell that these aren't just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters that are [ __ ] around with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one another but yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> voice actors that are just having a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great time yeah exactly and you need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that dynamic in a show like that yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and but it was really cool because with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pop team epic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you know we would all come on to one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> scene you know there was me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know the main voice actor and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like three or four voice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actors who were doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know just side characters yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was really cool because once a scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would finish </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then if one of us needed a retake or it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was really cool because all of the voice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actors would come together and basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> critique </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what we all just did in that one song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's cool so that we would all come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> together and i would get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know professional advice from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the voice actor or being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay that lion deliver was really cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but maybe if you deliver this next line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then i could respond in this kind of way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh okay and while all of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conversation is happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the voice director is also listening in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> so he can put in the input of his right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if need be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so i mean i didn't have to do too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many retakes with pop team epic because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the voice actor was just like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's good he just did not give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right he was just like yeah good enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] whatever i mean like you you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> speaking in english so he was like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this this probably sounds better than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right most of the english voice actors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only time that the voice actor asked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> me to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the voice director asked me to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something super specific was when i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the narrator voice uh for the guilty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gear parody scene where i had to say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heaven or hell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like in guilty gear and he was like no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no because the voice director was like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> massive fan of guilty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he's like no no that's not how you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say it you have to say like this and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> boom it over the pr system all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i'll do it like that i guess that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like such a fun experience oh it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was super fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were you nervous doing it oh hell yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> literally everybody else around me are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> professional japanese voice actors </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was really cool because all of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the voice actors were like wow how long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you been doing voice acting i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my first day technically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> speaking this is my first gig </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like you're really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> good i was like well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> call your boy back and then everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cheered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone lifted joey up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like subscribe damn dude i do i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had some terrible [ __ ] clients </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did a lot of commercials because they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would bring in like a business executive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right to come in and critique and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> don't [ __ ] know anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right and they would i remember one time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was a guy and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i did this whole take and i thought i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> killed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like yeah something's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off with it this wasn't the director </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this was just the guy who was paying for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it to be made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like yeah could you just try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something different i did the exact same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thing again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no different and he was like that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect and i was like i was like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] knew it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because like i know okay i in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like i know i can get away with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one more time but like maybe not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> second time so i was like i'll just try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once see if he notices he had no idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah at that point onwards any time he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said anything i would just look at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> voice director </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over there i would look at him i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> should i listen to this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like he was the engineer and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> director of the thing right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which he so he normally does the deliver </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh the way i the way it was set up for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> me was he normally directed me and the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> client would just stand there and go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yes yes like because i was always doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> business stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right it was like it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> perseverance inspiration </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] like that you did like a gillette </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> commercial right or it wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a like a shaving cream commercial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever it was something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was ages ago i was doing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boats for like a year you did both i did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was some i can't i don't know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the corporation is and i also don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i should say i don't know if i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> allowed i don't know what i signed i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once a week i would go in for three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hours and i would talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> boats wait how old were you this was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like last year oh really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every week i went in and talked about i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was in london right yes it was in london </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i got paid like [ __ ] like how much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it they were paying me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 250 pounds an hour oh wow uh which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 300 something bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah just talk about boats which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably like a lot better than what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> voice actors get paid to voice an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah definitely uh yeah anime rates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't that great i mean i don't i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i'm gonna i'll just say like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean i definitely didn't get paid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've heard things and uh i you know you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get paid on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> funimation from what i've been told i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if this is true i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm allowed to say this but it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not great it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel less than what i was getting yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i it's like i think it's always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just been known that the voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> acting industry in anime specifically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like paid the least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you get paid the lease out of any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> commercial which is why you see a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dubbed voice actors going on to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gaming now yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> industries the the way it goes is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally commercials pay the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because commercials you get paid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normally a premium and then you also get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's called a buyout fee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so if your ad is going to be played over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> x amount of places with radios tv that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> gets calculated in the cost yeah and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> could get like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one commercial that takes you 20 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which it often did because commercials </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 30 seconds long mostly and i would never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> be there for more than 30 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but they would maybe pay you like 15 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> grand for the biopsy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so your session fee was like 250 pounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but then you might get 15 grand or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on where they play it and how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much because i know the guy who did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mcdonald's ads in the uk that was his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole career yeah he's doing mcdonald's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really yeah because you got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he got paid so far oh yeah it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mcdonald's game like six figures every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> commercial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know that's luckily how the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> industry was that you got paid if your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> voice was being could you imagine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting paid six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> figures by going but i wish right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the thing he was like imagine how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much how much money mcdonald's made off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because normally how it is with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> commercials is that if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally with voices if a corporation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets one voice actor it's normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always that one voice actor who does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the industry where i when i was in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> london it was mainly commercial stuff so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it came up a lot and it was always like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people were competing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get that one commercial gig that kept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming yeah and so i got this boat gig </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i didn't think of anything of it um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i didn't audition they like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> requested me so i went in i did a read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for it and i was talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um i had to explain a ton of different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things about large ships </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a corporation okay and i had to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in every week and do something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> ballasting that was what i did like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] four weeks of thing called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ballasting right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ballasting is a thing and i know this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i did four scripts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sell us a bit what what is ballasting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sir he was like it was like it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> god i wish i remembered the words </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and i remember every time i would go in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to deliver it because my accent is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is english right but it's not uh receive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pronunciation which is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> typical accent which is i say grass but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's grass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so every time i would do anything he's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like you didn't you didn't say the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> received pronunciation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do it again i'm like oh yes of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ballasting you know is the you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was basically where water goes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the ships and they dunk it dump it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> later on okay but there was like so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> scientific words and i was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was the the sodium hydrosis oxide </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> oxygenation thing and i was like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the hard thing about that is that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> could do a thing called line reading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they're paying you to get this right the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> first time yeah so the first time i see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the script is when i go in there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i'm sure that was at the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for you with popped humans you could see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it beforehand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with pop team epic i got sent not only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the script about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three weeks before i went in yeah but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also got a cd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with [ __ ] the actual visuals that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so i can practice ahead of time and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> apparently that's normal in the anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's just like the japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> trust system yeah i mean like it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trust that you will not leak this that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just sounds like a leak waiting to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> happen because i didn't any other i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't sign a contract </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> either yeah they just got sent this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> without an ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just sent it to me hoping that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wouldn't leave this bro i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i can maybe count on my hands the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> amount of time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i received the script before i got there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never really yeah and so i would get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> script in front of me i'd maybe have two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes to quickly go over it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they immediately expected me to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nail it first time and again there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> words </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never even seen the english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> language they come up in these scripts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know what these words are but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm expected to like nail it whilst i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also reading it for the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's what they're paying you an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> absurd amount of money like i know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] people who run like official </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> discords for like bandai or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to sign ndas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and here you are just actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> getting it the entire script is episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> nine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> six months before it comes out good luck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> no it was crazy like i got it in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> mail they didn't even tell me they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to send it because i was also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> assuming that i was going to see the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> script and everything yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i got that's not how it is yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right that's what i heard about dubbing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do that as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's what i heard but not only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that but when i when i also cameoed uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the uh grissiah phantom trigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game yeah they also sent me the script </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like two weeks beforehand as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they didn't send me the visuals but they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sent me the script like the physical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> script and i had to go in with my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> physical script i think the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> normally in the western industries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're still editing the script like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the day off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like so normally the script that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you get might not even be the final </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> draft </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also people don't trust anyone in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> world which is which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course you know this is this is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country the way you can leave like your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] laptop in the middle of a diner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to the bathroom and then come back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just trust that nobody's gonna take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i just wanted to leak the boat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff i don't even care i just want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leak it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> no one can i just want to leak it don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> get it don't tell anybody but they use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sodium hydroxide </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that it's crazy but i mean you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did you get paid well for the both thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> though oh yeah i got paid really well oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but that's like that's like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voice actors stream is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't i didn't i didn't do it for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money i should because it was fun yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well that's yeah same with me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i i feel like people who go into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially like the anime industry to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who wants to be a voice actor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they do it for the passion you get paid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing for those sessions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean maybe unless you're a sag actor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you get paid a decent amount i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> think it's 250 dollars minimum for a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> session two-hour session </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but yeah it's you get the notoriety </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which allows you to do a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right yeah i don't know because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like nowadays </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> there's less notoriety and like big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> voice acting names yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in dubbing at least than than they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> used to true they used to be cons right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what you wanted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah exactly but now like if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even if you get to voice a dub in like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> huge huge show there's like you still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't get as much notoriety as like say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um back in like the mid-2000s where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> had voice actors like steve bloom johnny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bosch chrisman freeman who just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those those like the triple a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah everybody knew who they were yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly but it's it's a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> harder in this climate in the industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just because there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many dubs now yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything gets slimed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if it's on funimation it's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be slime or dubbed and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone watches anime in like very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different ways now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean like like even even going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> back to japan since where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i didn't know who any of the voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actors who voiced in this anime were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was literally switching between dub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sub depending on which one i like to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> listen to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um because i feel like the voice acting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for dubs in general has has gotten into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like possible quality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in almost every show like there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there are some shows that are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is this is just a funny dub you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know for the most part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i want to just shut my brain off and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just listen to the language that i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i speak then i just i'll just put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on dub and i can i have the trust that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it will be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like a decent experience yeah dubs have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely gotten to that point yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's there's certainly no like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 90s quality like hilarious dub </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no no yeah i feel like the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> argument of sub versus dub is kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like you to this point i feel like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> counterpoint to that is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are less dubs that just stand out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i i think of some of my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite dubs right something like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> baccano that's best time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know cowboy these are dubs that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stand out like literally like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i remember how good they were just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of how their quality but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nowadays i don't know i can't think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't think of like many dubs that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay this everything's good everything's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off decent quality but i can't think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> truly stands out this is a dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> experience to me the last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the newest the newest quote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unquote anime where the dub was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> wow was probably panty and stalky yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but that was like 2008 yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what i'm saying newest in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quotations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's how the industry was back then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right you had like two weeks to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cast people like you had two weeks just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for that let alone everything else but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have two weeks to not even two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one week so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cast translate and get these actors in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the booth and get recording like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you you can't expect anything good to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come out of that you you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we get the good products right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> decent but we're not gonna get anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that blows us away from it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i think the last current industry the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> last dub that blew me away was probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stein's gate because yeah it's it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of those shows where i actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i could appreciate the work that went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into translating and just scripting it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah not just like the voice acting but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like everything was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really polished i didn't believe that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was scripted by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> marketing yeah yeah oh really yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah which is which is why he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> absolutely killed it uh as well so like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i think with the era of cyber </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> dubbing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just it's a lot harder to recreate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that same quality at the same height </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they just don't have as much time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anymore i also think at least for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> funimation i think when sony took over i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> think they restructured a lot of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make it less focused on giving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh riders time and more giving like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting the whole thing out sooner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah which you know is understandable i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess but also at the same time you kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of lose a bit of that magic that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know maybe a dub would be whoa you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know what i mean yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually here's here's a question for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you joey because you you could probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> judge us the best but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever since the beginning of time there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always been this debate of subs versus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dubs you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the japanese japanese voice acting is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has there been any show or any anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from your experience that it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bad voice acting from like a japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> side of things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man that's hard to say because at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> with voice from my understanding in my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> experience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at least japanese voice acting in anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah has just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> had an insanely high bar to jump over oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even ever since even you know like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> could obviously go back to you know an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime from the 70s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and probably find some bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> voice acting there but that's because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a medium that was still getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> refined since the 60s right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i think honestly every anime i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> since you know the late 80s early 90s </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't think there's been a maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's been like one or two bad voices </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or one or two maybe like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> under qualified voices compared to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everybody else in that same show but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wouldn't say there's an entire show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has like bad voice acting being the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same way that there are bad dubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly but and i don't know maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like a cultural thing maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's because they've set up a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> system here that ensures they're getting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> voice talent right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they have schools specifically for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voice action yeah yeah we don't really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have that in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's you go to acting school and maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you stumble into voice over right if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's not really a system but their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entire you know like four year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> universities no right exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say yes it's the same reason why like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> korea are normally amazing at esports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have the infrastructure there to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> support </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like making this talent yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know in japan obviously you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've been having those schools for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> while where the bar is getting pushed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly and constantly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah whereas it's not really like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the west exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and and you know the the great thing as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well with the structure of at least the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese voice acting in anime is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> if there is a new voice actor or actress </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that comes into the industry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> they usually start them off with very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> very small roles maybe like one line or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> even just background noise to kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get them used to that environment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and give them as much experience as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> possible and then maybe after they do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ten roles of playing you know person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> passing behind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the main character after the tenth time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then they can give them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> overall awareness it's very japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's two more lines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay the next one will give you five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lines yes we'll give you ten lines and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it just builds and builds from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there unless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's someone that just has insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amount of talent from the get-go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they're just confident enough to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> put them into a show and then they make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a name for themselves because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the best dub performances have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been from actors where like they weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> acting in any other animated shows oh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i think i think um i think johnny and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> bosh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like stumbled into his first dub role by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> accident </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um i think same with steve bloom as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> uh yeah i think so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from what i found out it's been a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> since i heard the stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like both fantastic voices yeah god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i think oh was the guy who did light in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the death note dub he did a lot of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ocean dubs in canada he did like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because he did rock from black lagoon as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i think he was doing my little pony </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think you've done anything i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy voices lad rousseau in baccano i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hadn't done any animation no no i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember a lot of like back then a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> voice actors who voiced in baccano was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like their first role </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes everyone [ __ ] killed it you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was really there's a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unknown voice actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uh and actresses in that in in that show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> great show yeah questions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> questions to you guys then we've so with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ridiculously high bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that japanese voice acting has what are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what are some shows that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> eat you know that even stand up for you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese voice talent and voice acting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll tell you the show that stands out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me most recently yeah and that's b </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah b stars has absolutely like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> insane voice acting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's very different because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't it doesn't it didn't sound like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your typical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> anime kind of voice acting it sounded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> very grounded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know who the voice actor for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lego c is but his his acting was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so good like lego and luis yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was like they both had like the voice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> acting performances of that year oh any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime easily easily in in my in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opinion like eve </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even with shows like attack on titan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> three coming out that had some great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> voice acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i still think b stars was like just a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cut above the rest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's just because b stars as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> show was just a cut above the rest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah like it was just such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] amazing show i'm trying to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of any japanese shows that really blew </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me away with voice actors jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean my mandio kills it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that perform i i spoke about this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before like his performance like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dear like i'm not memes aside like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's [ __ ] amazing oh yeah he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] great and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone in part five i would argue as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well has fantastic voices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i think the thing with japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> voices was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can just do casting so well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they get it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they understand how important casting is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a character oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm working on a video right now and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i watched the clan ad dub and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just one scene where a female </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> teacher is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> voiced by a dude what really yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm i'll it's i obviously can't show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this but i'll show you guys later at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean this is why i didn't watch a dog </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> watched it dumb so i don't remember this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but i watched someone sent me the clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's just a dude hi boys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like what how did this pass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean there was a lot of weird things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that happened with dubbing back in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day if we're going to talk about bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dubs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly you know we have to talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about you know like ghost stories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ghost stories is that a bad dub or is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad that it's good people people always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> act because when i when i tweet out be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like hey i'm going to fix bad anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> scenes for a youtube video people always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like yeah fix ghost stories i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there's nothing to fix this is amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's just because i from what i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> heard about how ghost stories came to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made it was ghost stories just sold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> horribly in japan so when they licensed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it oh license they're over they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do what you need to do to make this sell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have there was so much creative </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> control yeah there were some rules but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you basically you basically had full </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> creative control </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and from what i heard like they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just the voice actors would just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> try to rush in the booth first and they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would just like ad-lib the scenes yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and everyone else would have to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> play off what they said yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like the first of bridge yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah essentially i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's it's weird to think right that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dubs back in the 70s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> were done where there was no email </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like how did they do this they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally a guy was given this dvd and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they just kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made it i know they just and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese just hoped they did it well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's weird right do you think there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even then it was a trust system yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah they're like i guess just take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> this dvd and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> go home yeah vhs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's weird but even i think that's also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why some dubs now are a bit strange </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they were still done on that system </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> where if you go first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you dub it and then the person who comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> next has to dub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but they get to hear just your character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's been before you so right yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was last normally is the easiest time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah and that because they have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of go along with oh they perform </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this character in this way so i kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have to do it the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but if the first one sucks it's a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunate because i think it makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this weird kind of feeling sometimes by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> accident but this is again why a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> director should be on top of that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's what that's why like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> director has control </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over how this sounds because there are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely some dubs where it definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like people aren't having a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i've always said i think a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> director's job is like 10 to get the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> best performance out of you and like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 90 to make sure everyone sounds like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're in the same world like that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the hardest part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're constantly thinking like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> okay that was a great line but does it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fit with what the other person just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> delivered yeah like i need to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> about that yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a really hard skill it's it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely hard because you have to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on top of what everyone is saying and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how everyone sounds and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's definitely like you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely see some of the new answers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> people don't normally think about but if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you if you play a conversation and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like man these people just sound </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like they're reading lines to each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and not actually having a conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's really it just sounds yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that uncanny valley yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounds like they're kind of talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through dimensions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one's living in one world and the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was living in the other world and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> rift just happened to open up where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh hello </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh hi mark hi mark god man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i could see her and talk all day about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dubbed anime and voice acting and all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously that's what i'm cripplingly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> addicted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> apparently not music yeah not music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna get this boy on some like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we gotta make him understand emotions i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> never thought i'd say that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just i wish like i wish kevin was here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wish kevin was like guessing in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kevin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> his reaction when you were just saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> all this stuff as a [ __ ] composer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kevin if you're watching this i want you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to just like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we ever get kevin on the show and we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> will get kevin on the show just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i want to just hear the conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> look him in the eye i want you to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> look him in the eye and just be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made an abyss soundtrack made me feel </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> video and just be like i don't remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> any of your music but it made me feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i heard the sounds i mean i i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i have the opposite brain to like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> composer though in like every aspect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like when i talk to kevin </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i feel like i'm on like the complete </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> opposite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> mind in every way it's crazy it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird i think i'd have that that kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mind that isn't isn't like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean if we can't even like relate to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not exactly composers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like you're you're very musical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> though right i mean yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but i'm no kevin penkins no right but </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> it kind of yeah from the future world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like really good it's 10 out of 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me but yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the opening that's that series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't have an opening it just had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like this chorus of kids just going ah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i was about to say it like sarcastically </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> changed the ending every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time i don't know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because with the monogatari series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was the first time when i noticed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they were actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> changing the endings like to every arc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> every arc had a different ending i </SPEAKER_03>
