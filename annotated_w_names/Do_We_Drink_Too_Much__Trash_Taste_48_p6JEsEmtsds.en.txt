<SPEAKER_07> sick of [ __ ] seeing you guys </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah god every week jesus man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean it's it's uh it's because i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> normally especially when we did three </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> episodes in one week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> because that's what we had to you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> allow us to do yeah on the last episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like what are we talking about yeah </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> didn't you go to like a gin factory or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> something we did go to a gym place yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was that like the highlight that was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> highlight yeah actually just got to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drink really nice gin that was like free </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh that's that's cool yeah and then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> could just be like make me this cocktail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they made it which is great which is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like just a power trip that i needed in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but uh but i mean you've already been to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kyodo all right yeah i've been once </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but he he found this welsh town like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> welsh british town </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like an hour in like an hour in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> in the mountains in kyoto drive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wow and it was it was pretty [ __ ] but it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> was pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good but it was just kind of like really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> underwhelming was it just like home or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> weirdly did you feel like culturally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> culturally appropriated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> in it i don't know it's just how people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like feel when they see white people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> wearing kimono </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this is kind of cool but like what's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going on like why i just wanted you to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> be like oh god this is so [ __ ] just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reminds me of horror </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just kind of like it was really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bizarre and like underwhelming i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but also the fish and chips is 22 which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is criminal i mean i'm sure like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know how it feels like for say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone who lived in china going to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chinatown or something like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean it's kind of different though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't it it's like markets and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurants right yeah that's i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that's true i feel like chinatown </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> okay it is actually china okay well what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> describes me this welsh town then okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that was what about a maid of welsh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> all the buildings looked like they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pulled out of like a small town in wales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was just really old style like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the places where you'd find in like west </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wales and it was just really strange </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's like i did i didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> particularly like everything written in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> welsh or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> well one of the pubs was called uh pond </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> oak and pond means bridge in welsh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> oh okay at least they were accurate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about it that was pretty cool i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] sheep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm really sarcastic about everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was just like i feel like this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the one time where i can be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> time to actually become sarcastic about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> something and no one can correct me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is my culture now welcome to my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean it probably wasn't as offensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as the first time i went to a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> outback steakhouse right and i was like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> whoa is this one australia's to everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah [ __ ] boomerangs on the wall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> everywhere yeah just like an australian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> home i don't really know i mean i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm pretty i kind of bash on every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> culture </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i'm by far the heart i buy far back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on my own culture more than anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> well that's good because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it wasn't a culture yeah if i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> anything else you'd be really bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to say right now americans be like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] vain i'm pretty harsh on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> americans but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i feel like i'm more harsh on though i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> mean i feel like that's just that's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> part of british culture right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you rag on everyone equally but you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially rag on your own culture oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah of course um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like for some reason when someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> else rags in your coach you're like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only i get to complain about my culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thank you very much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the one time everyone has a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> patreon i feel like being british she </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> can't really complain anymore like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone everyone [ __ ] mocks proof </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so you kind of just get used to it i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like yes honey oh you made another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> british meme bottle of water alright </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i mean like i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> self-deprecation is just part of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> british culture and british mentality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's such an amazing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fall though right like especially on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> youtube because like remember amazing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the rise and fall of british columbia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because remember in like 2015 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone was [ __ ] obsessed with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> british culture and now everyone's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in this english form of death i i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the internet has just realized what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> british people actually sound like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just i always wondered that when i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> was like growing up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no one sounds like this everyone in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uk doesn't sound like harry styles </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what and i'm and i'm just like what what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember growing up i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when uh when i like the world when is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the world going to realize that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people don't sound like they do in harry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> potter yeah every other like british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> film like doctor who or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just waiting for the day that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone realizes that not everyone in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> australia looks like chris hemsworth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> debatable i mean i know like two people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and they look you know you're one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them you look close enough </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> okay i can tease well i mean journey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> across japan so there's always a theme </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> right so like the first journey across </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> japan was cycling yeah it was chris </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> cycling yeah and i was just on one part </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um but then the second journey across </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> japan i was there fully for it and uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> it was called escape to fuji so the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> theme of it was we went around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mount fuji and like all the cool places </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> we can go to mount fuji because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> chris had never seen a nice view of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mount fuji in his life so he's never </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> taken one of those like touristy photos </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right and he kept like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently his audience kept sending him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like pictures of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing views like hey look chris i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here for two days and i got an amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> view of foundation [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you can check it out now by the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you can check it out now it's all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the third journey across japan is called </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the lost islands because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh the kyushu area has all these like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like jurassic park here man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right even though like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like promotional artwork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks like a [ __ ] like shitty movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> poster like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's like i say shitty it looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so the uh the kyushu area is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's almost like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an archipelago of just these like insane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amount of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> time was that word sorry archipelago </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the [ __ ] you whip someone needs to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> whip out a dictionary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> really you're looking for mailings you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> can be on your side here okay all right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like something so like the philippines </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for example is an archipelago because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just a bunch of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tiny tiny tiny islands so basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> cultural cross-pollination all over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> again man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> layman's terms there's lots of tiny tiny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> islands </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> along the coast of kyushu yeah so we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> were like oh that's perfect we'll call </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it the lost islands because we'll try </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and go to as many of these like small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> islands and i think we ended up going to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like three or four of them </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um i mean obviously we couldn't go to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> all them because there's literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thousands of them out there but some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these islands were [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> looking like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> completely awesome pictures yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> showed pictures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but um yeah it's just incredible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like we literally did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> speed run kyushu yeah i think i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because like that week felt like a month </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was [ __ ] insane it sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you did a [ __ ] ton from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how you were describing it to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly the challenges that we like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> usually you know prepare with on journey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> across japan yeah this time around was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of a back burner just because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so much [ __ ] we were doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh yeah i forgot we had to do like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> a challenge for this video [ __ ] yeah but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah hopefully the trailer will be out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> by the time it goes out yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if chris isn't lazy yeah if not sorry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> chris i probably just sent a bunch of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where's the trailer people over to your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> channel </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> many more places can he do journey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> across japan like how many more themes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can he do because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> one thing i will say about japan is that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one one thing one other thing that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> impresses me the most is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how [ __ ] varied japan is in terms of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like how many places there are to travel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when to explore right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm just like because i'm used to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the uk right and i feel like if you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> explored </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a decent amount of the uk then you've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of to me at least you've kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> seen it all in one town </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah if you go you go to one town </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you go to one city and it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all the same i mean london </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to me london kind of exists in its own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bubble london's like unique but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anywhere outside of london </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean yeah i mean australia is the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing right like i think geographically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just as large as like the us maybe close </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we have sand so it's like 80 of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is a [ __ ] desert </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's like that's why like i've barely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> gone exploring in australia because i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just like i just don't know what there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> is out there but then again </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if chris hadn't like gone and done like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> extensive research on places in kyushu </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i probably would have had no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] i don't know how chris finds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> these [ __ ] places no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> he comes to me with this town in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> middle in the mountains of kyoto yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well how do you find this he literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like spends months just researching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like interesting places i remember like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on journey across japan too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was this like in the middle of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mountains in uh gifu prefecture or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> toyama i think it was toyama prefecture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which usually you know people don't go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to for tourism </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah he found this like in the middle of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] mountains there was this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like field of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a thousand statues of people that had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just been built </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know how he found it he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally went on to like google </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> satellite and just like scanned through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the mountains oh my god what the heck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely until he stopped and was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> what is this what is this gray bulb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like enhanced enhanced and then i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saw that there were these statues and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because like if you look it up like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before that video went up there is no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> articles about it like not even japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> media talks about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah this is like some next level this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like some nasa [ __ ] yeah i was like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> want your like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> dedication of research people do strange </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> things with their land in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like in the uk you just kind of have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> field and maybe put a fence in it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's call it a day but there's only so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many things you can do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently they seem to go crazy with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like what if we just made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a field that's just trampoline outside </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like all right dude if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean that's what's so awesome about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> japan is that you can just be driving in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the middle of nowhere then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you just see this weird like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird [ __ ] place that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know who you don't know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> madman came up with this idea just put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a [ __ ] like a like a field of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> statues </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's like it's not even like built </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for tourism either because like it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even known </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah it's like it's like if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're lucky enough to find it then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there you go there it is enjoy it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm hoping the next journey across japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like five star hotels and chris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like come come come on connor let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> michelin restaurants </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> not only not only is it a tax deductible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fantastic it's fun i want to do this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but please look forward to that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever that i think he said it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming out end of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> may maybe so hopefully soon so like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many more places in japan do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you want to visit personally so i have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this app actually on my phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can keep track of it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what i use to keep track of all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> prefectures i've been to google </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's called google maps it stalks you it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> knows exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> okay yeah so like have we told the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> about the cycling yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh yeah okay i mean so i i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i like this that google tells </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me exactly where i was for how long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i like looking back where i was and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because when people ask me oh where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> were you this day i'm like oh let me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> check </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but like it tells you exactly where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> were for how long yeah and when we did </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the cycling special we all had our phone </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> tracking on that wasn't sharing the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> video but we actually saw where we all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah throughout the video yeah and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> when the video was done uh i asked them </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like hey guys can you export your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> map data so that we can send it to our </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> editor so that he can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> know where we were so that's how you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the you know cool map </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> graphics that i made 100 accurate but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's pretty close it's pretty close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's pretty close so where we are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> generally on that map is actually so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we turned on location services which i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know that you could track each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in like light in like real time so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so it wasn't a part of like the big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't make it a big part of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> special but we could actually see where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> we were as we were cycling down so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i could see like that joey was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kicking my ass and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> connor turned off his location sharing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when he was taking the ferry so he just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he just like popped out of existence i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> literally thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i literally thought he was like lost out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there yeah i just said i was probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like he's dead he's just straight up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dead yeah so there was no signal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly when i asked these guys to share </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it they were like wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> gantt was like wait what like they keep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all this information on here yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's awesome it's terrifying yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> so so i i didn't realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that um by turning on location services </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i could go through my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entire history day by day and if you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned on location services </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can probably do that right now if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to google maps and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you can go through the history of your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like location services </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it will tell you the exact location </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you've been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hour by hour yeah every single day for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the past 10 years of your life yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's pretty good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's it's scary that's terrifying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> google is google is literally stalking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at all times you know what you're sad is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like when i used to live in london </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i barely ever left my house it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would be like what did i do this day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like a dot on the map of me not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> leaving my house i'd be like oh what do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> like i didn't know this is like some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] fbi [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't know like because sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> i go to a place and i'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] where was that i could just go on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> google and find out where i was i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know to look back on right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no it's it's you're the only one looking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i mean i mean it's like two sides </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right because it's cool to know that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could go through your entire life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> history </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's also kind of like i guess scary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or not not scary but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> disturbing that yeah your entire life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is like can be compressed down into a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> file and just like analyzed right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and exported right and exported i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> know that that's just that's just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this this is the future that black </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mirror like warned us about you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that is some joy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i i for one welcome our black mirror </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i welcome technology i don't know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> uh yeah i i don't know i like it it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fun it's yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interactive it's right what do you what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> do you mean interactive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not stalking it's interactive no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i can see the cool side of it it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just you know it's just a bit like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> wait why did this come up again </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because you're asking how many prefix oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so so is there any place there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i have i have an app that shows me </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> so i can i know exactly now like which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> uh you know prefectures i haven't been </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to yet um and i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i mean i can bring it up but i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe i've done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i want to say like three fifths maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three quarters of all the prefectures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah these these are the ones i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> done red ones you've been to holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so the red ones i've stayed overnight </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh like walked around and the white ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i haven't visited yet so </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> because i thought living in england my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm not i'm just like whatever i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> would [ __ ] i thought i thought like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my coffee tolerance was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll [ __ ] take instant coffee if i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need to but yeah like when i moved to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japan i've realized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what [ __ ] coffee tastes like but then i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> got a job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and now i know so because remember the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> just the brainwashing that happens the </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_03> i can buy a hot coffee at a vending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> machine oh my god i'm going to play this </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_05> machine coffee every single day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without without fail and i'm just like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> will never get bored of this at all this </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] starbucks or a coffee shop to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get my coffee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i can just go to a vending machine and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then i moved here and then i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what it is about moving here like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something switched in my brain right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then i just instantly recognized it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as like oh this tastes like crap this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is processed instant coffee [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i don't know i don't know why i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know what switched my brain like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> tourist i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vending machine coffee and vending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> machine drinks were just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like five stars we don't have in the uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so you're like you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like amazed it's just like a new weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing right like you know conor i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember was talking about how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know every time every time you came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here to visit you would [ __ ] eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> you know family mode on geary every day </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah yeah and then you realized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh this is not that great actually i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> actually gone back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on it now oh really i've got i've talked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about like a drone yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i've been like full circle i've i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> relapsed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i was very diehard sandwiches for like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> year and a half and now i'm like man i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> coffee is as much of like a smell thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> as it is a drink thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like i need the reason why i like going </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> into a coffee shop </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is because i need that that wall of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> coffee smells yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that's what makes me feel like i'm ready </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> to [ __ ] drink i i'd say i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coffee is a [ __ ] morning thing for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right now because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not a morning a [ __ ] morning it is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] moment because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> honestly honestly is your morning really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> started if you don't have a coffee </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if i don't have a coffee that's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's like my indicator that my morning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> has begun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i can begin the day if i don't have the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coffee then i'm just like in permanent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 50 brain modes no coffee i sleep coffee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly that's literally how i am i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know i don't know if it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> placebo thing no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm i'm totally the same like like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember there was one week where i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i might be a little too dependent on </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> coffee let me let me let me back it up a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> bit </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah because i was having like you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> two three cups of coffee a day right so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> four or five yeah right and i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's probably not that good for me my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heart's probably about to explode so let </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> me like let me just go a week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with no coffee and see how i do day two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was getting just insane migraines in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my head i was like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like i'm really [ __ ] dependent on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this [ __ ] to start the day i just get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sluggish if i stop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't really get too bad you don't get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like coffee headaches no i've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gotten that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like friends who got it how it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels for me is that you know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scene in the film where it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like like they got the grayscale filter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how i see the world before i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my coffee man and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i have the coffee and then like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they they instantly turn up the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> saturation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that that is that is how my mornings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> work i go from grayscale to sepia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the [ __ ] meme of uh don't talk to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> until i've had my coffee </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're literally that guy no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember when i first moved to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i my mornings were just like so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> depressing because i didn't have that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> first </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that first good hot coffee to look </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> forward to right right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because even if i'd go to my like family </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> mart to get a coffee it was like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> watered down coffee wasn't it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know it's it's i've noticed the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the more i like grow up it's the little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things in life that you need to look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> forward to i don't know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> it is a little things like my mornings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> less happy if i don't have a coffee to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> look forward to yeah i just feel like my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> day is depressing that's kind of about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it really yeah yeah exactly that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> most days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one time i went to an italian restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here and you know i feel like an italian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like you can almost judge it on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh how good their espresso is with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> meal oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it must end on an espresso i feel at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> least like you know yeah absolutely and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know it was good it was pretty good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> food i was like not bad have you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you found one that has a good espresso </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yet to find one there's one or two that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know if i see the the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actual espresso machine in the back i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like nice yeah you know it's going to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> good because they've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they've gone to the effort to get this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ridiculously expensive machine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just for this like one part of yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right right yeah um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i i was i was eating there and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> food was pretty good you know i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disappointed and i thought well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fantastic i'm going to end my meal off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with an espresso and it said on the menu </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> he said espresso </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right it was a double or a single and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i ordered the double espresso </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they they just brought out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially an americano </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what and i said i said like oh no no i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ordered the espresso like i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the espresso and i'm like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like this this talk i'm like that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not an espresso and if it is i'm going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be having a heart attack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like a triple double espresso i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like what am i the [ __ ] here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are you going to make me pay for this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm not paying for this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> i paid for it but you know i didn't walk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and naturally i didn't complain and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paid for it but that's not the point i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean i was very disappointed was that at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> least a good americana no he's awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that day onwards i i swore against </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ordering coffee in places where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> couldn't visibly see an espresso machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the establishment i'm like timing to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the back take me to the back let's see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on come on </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> that thing i i hug that thing yeah every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> day </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_07> homeless and the one thing i'd keep with </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_08> those </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] they all sound the [ __ ] same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> there was one where it was literally </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> alarm clock all right it's 400 bucks it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was this alarm clock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that makes you a cup of coffee oh we had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when it went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we had that in the like 80s in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uk for tea really yeah it was called a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kettle mate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh could set the alarm and it would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> pour a cup of tea for you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this is this is not a new invention tick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tock [ __ ] yeah so it's like it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> there's like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks like maybe it's about that big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that's pretty massive it's pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] large but there's like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the cup the coffee mug there and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like a proper brewing thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the side and you put in this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> canister of milk in the morning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like lock it in and when the alarm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> goes off it just straight up just makes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> an espresso machine is literally one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> button you could literally have that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> next to your bed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't need it yeah exactly that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what i was thinking i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just get a [ __ ] nespresso machine and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just put the [ __ ] thing in and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> do it yeah so please just sponsor us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> already yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like cause the problem is right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like nespresso </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is one of the best capsule machines but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like in japan it's the only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> capsule machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's actually good because the like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> could get like the actual </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> uh you know the ones actually you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> to put the uh the coffee um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> grinded the beans right yeah but like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> had one of those </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> i had one of those as well cleaning it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is such a it's a bit of an effect yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like nespresso is like the perfect i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> literally just [ __ ] marketing to you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> right now yeah it is literally the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> easiest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and like easiest to clean it's just easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for the quality you get and for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> convenience it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best capsule machine please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sponsored </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of capsule machines </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we bought one just for this office it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> was literally the first purchase that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> made </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and we tried to get geeks plus to play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for it for us but they wouldn't allow it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> so we played before we bought this table </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> we bought the nespresso machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we had our priorities right that's for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> sure exactly yeah i remember when they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> gave us the spreadsheet of just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so they get so geeks gave us a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> spreadsheet because they said they would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> help </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> us um dick not decorate the office but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> refurbish the office yeah and we were </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> tables desk television um not my story </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> no but there was a it was it was split </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up in like here's the list of uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like here's the list of the things we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need and here's the list of the things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we want and we put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the espresso machine in the first thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> we're like no no you know what i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> saying yeah we need this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do you really need this is this as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> necessary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as the table and we were like yes yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> without without coffee this podcast is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not happening no i'm sorry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm not i'm not going to film yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> refuse to release episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like another thing about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese like coffee shops as well is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that there are so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> independent coffee shops here in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so if you ever come to japan you you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> walk down a random street and find like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five to ten different like indie coffee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shops and the problem is they all look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] great yeah they do but it's such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a coin flip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on whether it's going to be good coffee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or not because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the like the fallacy is that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like some of the best and poshes looking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coffee shops i've been to in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have just had the shittest coffee yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like acid yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like dirt water like because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like uh especially in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> central tokyo like nishiazabu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like um stuff like that there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really like fancy kind of like rustic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking coffee shops where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the beans are all lined up and they got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they got the aesthetic down they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got the aesthetic to a tea yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you order it and you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> waiting for this cup of coffee for like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 20 minutes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like what are they picking the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> coffee beans off the plant like it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> taking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so long and what comes out is like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and essentially it's it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dirt water sometimes because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like twelve dollars please yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's [ __ ] twelve dollars for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like this one yeah i i thought like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because especially going to america or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something you order like a cup of coffee </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you just assume that it's refillable </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's that kind of level of quality but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in japan you can have like </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_06> corporation's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the best at something yeah yeah all </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> tea here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] fantastic but they just it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taking a little bit longer to perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the coffee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i feel i i although i will say there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some teas here with a like yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like cherry flavor and i'm like i </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> right because uh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when i think of tea i think of hot tea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think i like an earl grey or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> english breakfast and yeah yeah stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> right but like yeah i don't count green </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> tea is like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like an afternoon tea tea i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> afternoon tea is probably the only good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> british export that we've done it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a british export that i'm proud of yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like yeah is it really nothing else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a part of me dies inside whenever i go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like a like a restaurant that does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foreign like european cuisine and i see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] fish and chips there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like why are you selling fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the best fish and chips though i ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was uh this british pop british irish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pub called hobgoblin in shibuya </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like maybe ever it's the best fishing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trip no no in japan </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> other fish and chips i've had is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they vinegar the [ __ ] out of the fish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's just like i'm not eating fish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm eating something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they should let you put the vinegar on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yourself yeah yeah but right but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's places where they just like do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it for it's [ __ ] up that's not right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so like the vinegar is like into in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> inside the [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> meat of the fish and i'm just like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does not taste like fish it tastes like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> vinegar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like as much as i love vinegar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't get me wrong what's the max from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you to pay for fish and chips </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> abroad or in england that's just a full </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> stop oh it's still still i mean how big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are we talking like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a normal portion like a normal port like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that that's why i was like you know when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i went to this place 15 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no that's the most that's what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right you would they charged me 22 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm still angry about this by the way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they they're they're the same way you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made 22 dollars for a fish and chips 22 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was mid [ __ ] honestly it was not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> very was that at the welsh place yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was at the wash tower </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm sorry i feel like i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely ruining their like any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> foreign tourism they get now but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like that fish and chips is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> important and they increased the price </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> town reviewed by a welshman it was i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just i'm still annoyed about it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> 22 times 22 bucks are pretty ridiculous </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my mom was she probably slapped me if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she saw that i've had money for that it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like a five pound fish and chips </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as well it's not my chip was it like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] frozen iceland fish and chips </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it wasn't good it was it was like more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> batter than fish ah that's that's that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what i've noticed whenever whenever i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> tried fish and chips that have not been </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> from england of course even even in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> england not every fish and chips you get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> is [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] like i'd say 80 percent of fish and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> chips you get in england is [ __ ] anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why would i trust it outside of england </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's right you gotta go to a nice pub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a nice fancy kind of pub that does like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> focuses on food a lot and they'll have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> fish and chips on the menu it'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably be [ __ ] banging they might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> triple deep fried fries as well honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i want to take you guys to the hobgoblin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a proper barramundi like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> fishing i mean like the best fish and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chips i've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is in brighton and it's like the one you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> took us to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bankers i believe so i can't remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably yeah they live next to a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] ocean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next to the [ __ ] sea right so that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like it's good fish and chips </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the fish is just fresh and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can taste this fresh and it's like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the one you took us to in brian was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> easily the best fish and chips i've ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like like even so like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that's i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel weird when whenever like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to japan and people like yo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can try the ramen you can try the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sushi you can try all these different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cuisines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and someone visits me in [ __ ] england </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like yo you want to get sir </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you want to get some fish and chips go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the local shipping go to a pub and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what you're going wrong you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> immediately have to get them drunk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> so that they can't so they don't focus </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> on they can't judge yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i do i'm like let's go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the pub right away like yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> four people's in you won't kill each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other but like like the problem is when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they stay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're saying for like a week right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're just like how many days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in a row can they drink alcohol before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they've realized i'm going to blow your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mind with the test community before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> before they realize that there's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not much to our culture that we can show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> off to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tourists that visit us that's what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> think i mean it's the same problem in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> australia as well like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after you have a kangaroo steak there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally nothing else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like we have fish and chips as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but like not as good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because i i think the the one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after moving japan after moving outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of england and you know living in places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like thailand and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan and stuff like that is that um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me in england there's not much to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apart from drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right if you don't drink is that what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happens when you live in a place or is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that what happens when you like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like leave it and are aware like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wonder okay do you think do you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what there's much to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like is there much to do in australia </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that you know of other than going to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> pub and going to the beach not really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> far it's depressing at least we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> really nice [ __ ] beaches yeah at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> least </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> at least you got that we don't even have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nice beaches like i am from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> there my beach is very nice there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> plenty of free needles and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> trash and everything like i say i tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> people i'm from i like i grew up in a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> beach town a beach city yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's bright it's bright and [ __ ] yeah we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have pebble we we like brighton </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> is the tourist beach in england right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like the worst beach it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i say that as someone who grew up in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> brighton i'm born and bred in bryce and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just a bunch of [ __ ] rocks you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> even go there barefooted right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and to make matters worse brighton is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just as expensive as london so like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's the point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of like it didn't always it wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> always like that you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember gentrified my i remember a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time when bryson was cheap </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know the the way you could tell this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like this i don't know if this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> scientifically proven but i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> as far as i'm concerned it is you can </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> tell the costs of a town in the uk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 100 just go to the pub see what the the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> pint of the beer the how much the beer </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_02> the like price </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like pint yeah which is right right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because in brighton it's like what like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> four pound fifty maybe five pounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> four pound five it's like london prices </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that's on the expensive and where i'm </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_00> sorry i didn't know you grew up in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] narnia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> what is this magical land that does not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> exist in england it doesn't exist </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> also there are two americans as well uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> like a pint </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is uh not an american point it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> different to the american point which is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> also american pine's the biggest scam </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ever by the way you guys got ripped off </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know why when americans took the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pint from us for some reason they made </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it smaller </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> we talked about this on the stream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't did we oh okay yeah it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a hundred milliliters less </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're losing a lot of beer there for no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> point the one time when americans took </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something and made us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like it's like 430 milliliters i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> think around that in america and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> british pine is 568 milliliters yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh yeah you get a lot of beer for like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really cheap it's like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pint where i grew up is like four </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> dollars [ __ ] the point where i grew up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was nine dollars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that's uh you uh australian australian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> well that's not like real money </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's nine dollar dues so usd it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> seven dollars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that's about london prices then yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably about london prices yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean like i i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's growing up in the south in england </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever i travel like further north and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the prices it's just like i i i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel great because no matter where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go in england i'm paying either the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amount or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> less or less than i'm used to this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> how like i i this is why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably swiss people feel like the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> superior people on earth because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everywhere they go it's just like on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sale </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like everything everything's cheap you </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> i don't know if it's because i don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know if it's like the psychological </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> effect of me thinking this is too good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to be trying </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but i find when the beer is mega cheap </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> like looks really small but the moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he takes his shirt off it's jacked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's right basically </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> 20s with one debuff to your body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i i i i i i guess my hand is </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> hangovers are slightly worse now that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the only reason like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the only reason like i've i drink a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ton more wine now because i don't know </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah i don't know like i just i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drink wine because one i like the taste </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> for some reason the hangovers for wine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> seriously terrible i was like i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because like yeah exactly like when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was in my teens in like early twenties i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why and [ __ ] you i would get the worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hangovers and wine especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> red wine like i swear i had like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> vietnam flashbacks from drinking red </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> wine at university right thai man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like the hangovers there were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] unbearable and then i hit like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 27 and i'm like oh this uh this this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this kind of feels warm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't even have those like nam </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flashbacks because like i didn't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't even drink water making that a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't because i didn't even i wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even interested in drinking wine i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know in my early 20s because my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dad is like a [ __ ] heavy wine drinker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> so he's always like you know try this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nice red wine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah of course australia yeah they all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> love their wine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> loads of wine yeah absolutely this is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> great wine now you know now that i can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> drink wine it's like oh yeah that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] fantastic but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when you're like 21 22 and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> drink a glass of red you're like oh god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i cannot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> get used to this at all maybe we'd drink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more wine if we grew it in the uk but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> unfortunately i think the only place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> they make wine in uk are prison so i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really think that much choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i think uk does make some wine is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wine is that considered wine or is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like grape juice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> attitude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as well you just get it from france </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so like why did you make your own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when everyone's gonna be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we literally have friends like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly and i didn't realize how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lucky i had it until i moved to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country that you know is not well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean they produce sake here they do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> produce wine but it's not as well known </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i didn't know how good we had it there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you can just go to a [ __ ] local </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> co-op or tesco's in the bike </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> great wine that is like tripled the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> price here in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah yeah and yeah sucks here yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the problem right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have to go to like a specialist wine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> place because like if you go to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> family mart or seven it's it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just basically picking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> poison if you drink a cheap wine here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know it's it's basically just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's basically just bottled rap boys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we have such first world problems </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> we're just like concerned about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> quality of the wine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> listen what happened to us man i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> know man well i didn't it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i would say i'd start drinking way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more wine because of um because of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> corona </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and because you know when you're stuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> inside you you gotta fight you gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> find an interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> decided to take up a new hobby </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> alcoholism </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no but like it's incredible because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah and then they would put the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> wine glass on the table really quickly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you would chop the thing and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then you'd have to breathe in the fumes </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> then starts rubbing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that first she sprays the evian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the evian facial spray which i think is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> water that she's telling me it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think she just sprayed warts every and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> water on my face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put a gel in it and just did a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ultrasound on my face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and apparently we are never getting a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> sponge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really just going back and forward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just it's literally that's all it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> doing how does that doing anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it felt like she was going to like she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like [ __ ] doing ultrasound on my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> face i want to start a business where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i just put my mouth against your cheek </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just scream and call it a therapy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the vibrations will heal any kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> impurities </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so basically before we start </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recording this episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mailing was like i'm just going to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> half of god's face so that the boys can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> see the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the magic and wonder of the before and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after um could not tell the difference </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're probably never going to get a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sponsor from evian but uh it looked the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't know like can you tell the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> difference in my face from my usual </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the left side of his face was just a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> little bit more moist than the other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's all it was like i don't know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know what this is supposed to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does it though or or are you just late </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> tonight it's for gullible people who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> want to believe there's a solution for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and sometimes you're just ugly that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that's like that's how it is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that happens </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> i gotta deal with that no amount of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone water spray everything wrong </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> industry out of business everyone is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> going to be a model after we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bring out water spray to the scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there's so much stuff like that where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm like i'm sure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it works as like 0.1 but how much is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a negligible amount where you're like is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it worth my time you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how how how good does it have to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where i have to sit there and rub my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> face and spray avion on it you know what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how good do the results have to be you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> know there are just some things where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i get the intent as to why this was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> invented yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's also like there are so many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alternatives that work just as well you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know probably a lot cheaper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know i mean like oh man look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like going back to the whole like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> amazon things you didn't you know you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> need a thing right like that is a prime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> example like that is just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a bunch of people with like way too much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> money who are just going on to amazon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buying all these [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like things like i remember it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sad because i mean it's just like they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they feed off the insecurities that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people have like those like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they have those uh weight loss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bracelets have you seen those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what apparently just a bracelet that has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> like magnets in it or something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah it makes you lose weight and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> the before and after pictures are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] egregious you'll be like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> most obese person yeah and then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently because of this one bracelet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which they probably can't even get on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their hand how exaggerated this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starts off as a ring yeah it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> apparently </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this one magically makes you extremely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hot it doesn't address the problem with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that if you go from like 500 pounds to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> 200 pounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where's the skin gone yeah exactly what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> actually sucks back in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] off what i love is when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> see the before and after pic and it's so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously not the same person yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like someone so morbidly obese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that they think that because they now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a six-pack he can't recognize that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just not the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] thing's totally off like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> belly button's totally different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like that there's no hair like one okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing i i always find funny is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why always in the before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the before pick dude does like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cameraman just say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look as depressed as you can yeah i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you're conscious like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're smiling why are you smiling this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> before pic you know yeah yeah i mean in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the uk but they're just depressed in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> both but i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just it's just it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> subconscious right you see someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> smiling you you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> your [ __ ] dumb monkey brains thing oh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> good yeah yeah that's a that's a good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thing happened yeah good thing it could </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> happen thing here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i don't know i just i i get really sad </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> when i know that like clearly someone's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> buying this stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like the detox teases make you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yourself like it's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] yourself of course you're gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> lose weight because you're [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all the stool that you have in there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know of course you're gonna lose </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> weight but it's just sad that people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like feel desperate enough and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they can't just like believe the fact </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that it's like just eat less </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah sometimes it's not that simple </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> though i know but that's the core of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> don't get cyberbully just turn off the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> pc but like that it sucks because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just don't get hungry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but that's what it is the fundamental of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it is just like eat less </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] obviously there are exceptions and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then you know someone in the comments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like i have ex con yeah okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good but like a fundamental visit don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> buy this [ __ ] you know it's so yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's the thing it's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people who are buying into that kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> stuff usually </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> or all yeah that's all it is like all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> they need is just like a change of diet </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> or just something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so [ __ ] easy and yeah they're just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't be fast listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> listen i can vouch for the chicken and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> broccoli diet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it works it works wonders the chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and broccoli diet is no joke i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it worked wonders for me you know a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> simple payment of 6.99 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> trade offer trade offer you get chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and broccoli you lose weight it's simple </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as that literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i get 79.99 you get chicken and broccoli </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a chicken and broccoli company team up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> with me i will show it dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is there a chicken and broccoli there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually is on ubereats around our area </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there is a yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually i actually ordered another </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] one it's pretty [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's literally a chicken and broccoli </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chain that just delivers chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> broccoli </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is how it works guys it's not fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but weight loss isn't fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it doesn't need to be i i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's sad that you know some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes in like self-improvement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a big factor in whether it's going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> succeed or not is if you're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoying yourself doing it yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's unfortunate right but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like for me like for example going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the gym </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus going to do like a sport or going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like another active activity right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like doing that activity is way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more fun than spending </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even like i could do three hours or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something of a sport </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> versus 30 minutes on the treadmill and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> choose like a three hour sport any time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's the thing like that's why i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think nintendo is like gigabrain when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they release ring fit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that is literally the answer to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you can lose weight and have fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay but this is the this is like i say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that having never played it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i play this has been sold out for a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> while the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> big problem that we have been like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believing for so long with weight loss </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is like mainly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i i know this is like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> history literally it's like okay okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> disclaimer none of us have weight loss </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> experts don't take our advice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's like you know the big companies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like coke mcdonald's and all them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like yeah dude you can drink as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much coconut you can eat as much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> mcdonald's as you want all you have to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> do is just exercise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> it's not the food it's exercise and it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like exercise doesn't really do that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> much for weight loss no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like but what weight loss what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find personally what exercise does do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the day when i exercise i am like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> vigilant about what i'm eating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like yeah no no carbs here like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sugar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for me for me the day when i exercise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason i just take care of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yourself yeah i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i actually crave healthy food right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what it is about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but like if i get if i go to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> gym for an hour that day that day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> afterwards i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man i'm kind of just craving a chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breast yeah like [ __ ] this pizza </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] the curry or whatever but like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like being a couch potato just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like sitting there you wanna you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just like yeah yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] so i kind of just feel like i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna eat [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exercise yeah i feel like going to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gym or like just exercising </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in any way you can is like it's not so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much the act of losing it it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the motivation yeah it's good for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously it helps you know general </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fitness yeah yeah healthy and it's good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not saying it's bad but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel like we have definitely been like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not the cream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah we've also just been like told when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were growing up right that if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well if you eat 10 doughnuts just burn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> off the calories and then boom no damage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not how it works 10 donuts 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kilometers on the treadmill it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not how it works though unfortunately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the trade agreement </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you lose you lose uh you know you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> receive 10 doughnuts i received 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> kilometers on the treadmill </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it sucks because it's like at the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> end of the day it's it's you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you could you could go in the gym and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> distract yourself with it but it comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to that moment when you're sitting on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the couch or you're wondering what to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat and you've got to just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have the willpower to be like ah chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> broccoli </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fine fine yeah exactly you know it sucks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like not fun it is all diet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i i feel i feel like whenever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever you do any kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> self-improvement activity it's not the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> days where you feel good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's gonna define if you basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> succeed it's the days where you feel bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and you're able to push yourself through </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i say this being like i've had </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> plenty of times </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when i have failed because i felt bad </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i just didn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just not that's not not even the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> motivation to push myself through i just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> didn't have the self-discipline because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i feel like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> self-discipline is way more important </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> than motivation because there are going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> to be some days </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> where you are just not motivated and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's those days where you can push </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i know plenty of people who have i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> not one of them unfortunately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's like as well i found that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> when i was it's easy to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eat really healthy for like two weeks i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know not easy but it's doable right yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then it's like all right well if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just go right back to doing what you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> doing it's like well nothing's changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well that's what the bounce back happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well i mean that's why like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was just like what can i cut out that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like i can i can keep out like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> forever so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't drink like soft drinks ever yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the last like that [ __ ] yeah the last </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like since juice probably the beginning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of quarantine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've just made a conscious effort to not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drink any like fizzy drinks or anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that it's just cheese and [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tea and water it's tea water coffee is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> all i'm [ __ ] drinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i i i was lucky enough that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i just never have craved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like soda or anything in my life i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just always grown up on drinking water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of made me realize that man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the habits you the habits you had as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really just like it's it's so much with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you yeah they stick with you it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much easier to learn a habit once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than to unlearn it and to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something else and i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much of my life like if i could like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i had a time machine if i could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] e-second myself back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into like a younger body there's so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things i would do to be like okay you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> learn this you learn this habit you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] unlearn it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and like and like have like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] year of your life being like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of [ __ ] me over and i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to i want to try and do something else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god damn this pizza feels so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> good right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah it's like it's not even like i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> don't even eat that [ __ ] anymore i most </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> certainly do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i kind of like trying to balance it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> out how much i do eat and uh yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's not like an everyday thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah i hate talking about the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> online because everyone's just a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> expert about it like in the comments no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> doubt they'll be like 10 people would be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like i'm a nutritionist expert i'm here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to tell you that you're totally wrong </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um because because everyone's got their </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> own opinion because er most people have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> gone through it the experience have seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what's worked for them and so yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the thing it's what's worked for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and that doesn't mean it works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fairly as long as you do it helpfully </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know you're not starving yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like you see some people like yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lost 10 kilograms in a weekend it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that sounds like a terrible idea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what did you do that sounds like it must </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have been some painful shits </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i i feel like it's i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> important thing is that just because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something worked for someone doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> mean it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't necessarily mean it's going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happen with something else and it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really like uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what i found is it's really a trial and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you know what was it like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> an hour trial and trial and error </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you either lose weight or you die i used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to be like [ __ ] paranoid about like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well what's in this thing but i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> started thinking like if i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat a reasonable amount of things yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and exercise </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think i'll be all right yeah and that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of worked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i was like carbs i eat a lot of carbs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like i just eat them within reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like my meals are never too big like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> feel like i ate a fair amount of food </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i feel like the one when i stopped </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> giving a [ __ ] about calories and stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like that and just thinking like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> is this portion stupid yeah yeah is this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a whole large domino's pizza do i should </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i eat this probably not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so i'm probably not gonna do it like but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i i feel like another thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that i don't know maybe it's just me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but i think i just enjoy food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> too much all right what's the problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's the problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not like i enjoy eating a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> food right but we talked about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i do yeah i mean we talked about </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> you're my brother now now now now i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you're a brother </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like we went to the um the indian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> place near here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we do like indian food you know we do i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> think we'd always ask for it really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spicy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like very spicy and it was quite spicy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it wasn't that bad right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right i think uh i mean to you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> level yeah because i mean i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you know even though i'm extremely white </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i love spice that pretty much cripples </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> me yeah um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh yeah just to a standard person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like myself that shit's spicy enough </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but to these like [ __ ] spawns of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> satan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because in japan when you tell them to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> make it like 10 or max they just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they don't do it yeah and the first time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we went the first few times he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> the person who was cooking it's always </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the same guy he didn't actually make it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that spicy like it was just kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was definitely japan standing yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> like it was very it was like on the high </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> end for japan standard yeah i'd say yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah and then one time for some reason i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> don't know why we went well he decided </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> this time he was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fine i'm not playing he's like fine i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not playing anymore </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and holy [ __ ] this is hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> to like yeah i was like i got like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> halfway through this and i was like i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> actually in like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> severe pain yeah like this is actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> brutal i like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> god couldn't finish it wow yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was i yeah i think it was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one week where you had to go home early </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we were in this indian place yeah he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not playing around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think i think i could see him like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the corner of my eyes like he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like watching us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> because because we've been there so many </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> times we order the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same meal every time we order like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most spicy option </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's just like yeah we we it's spicy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not like it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's it's like it's a nice tingle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on your tongue what if he was like all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right the [ __ ] boy is gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm gonna give you guys the real [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> now but it is it was by far the spiciest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> meal i've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan i could not finish it because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it got to the point where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just yeah well that's got numb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the last time it was just like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> was enjoyable about that though i don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> care i don't know what it is because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like the flavors get like enhanced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by like being just beautiful no i get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that to a certain extent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the level you guys have it is just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i don't even know what flavor is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anymore yeah i mean i feel like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> depends on the dish right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean you can go to like coco ichiman </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and um so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to explain have we have we talked about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that before glacier is like a japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> curry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have it in america oh yeah they do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah and so you can go to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> curry chain in japan and they have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a spice scale </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from one to ten and like ten is the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spiciest and i've had the ten before and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so is connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and for me it was it was actually like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> really spicy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it just it felt like no however it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> just felt like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you're adding spice for the sake of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> adding spice right right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there are some dishes that i feel um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> are designed to be spicy it's not like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flavor enhanced spice right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's just spice for the sake of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> spicy like to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a mild curry a mild japanese curry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as good if not better than some of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spicier versions but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there are some like thai dishes and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> indian dishes and southeast asian dishes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't have enough spice to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's missing there's missing a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> certain kick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and also just a lot of endorphins </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> from the pain no i get nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like i'm constantly changing i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get i get the i get the fact of like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> know the spice enhances the flavor and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff like that because you know i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> had my fish over southeast asian food </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and stuff like that which is quite spicy </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i'm just like oh this is hard to eat </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but god damn like this probably tastes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> way better than without the spice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and then there's your guys see the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> reason why i got into spicy food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because again i have to bear my my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parents feel like paprika was spicy so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah when i was growing up i didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really eat spicy food but i just when i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> started doing youtube i started doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the like [ __ ] stupid pepper challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and then i've done it so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times where i was like i could handle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the carolina reaper like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> semi-comfortably right and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] spicy food isn't spicy anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because i've just been eating these </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> peppers raw [ __ ] youtube challenges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and twitch live streams </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> so i got to the point where i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh god this is like really good now like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i really like it yeah like habaneros on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff is like perfect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> no i see because like i love that when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we're talking about like kokoichi levels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of space right because that's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> easiest gauge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're in japan right it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what level of calculation can you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you immediately know like i used i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now do level three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right but before like couple of years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> ago i couldn't even do level one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was back from joe's wearing a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> diaper that's when i was back when i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wearing a diaper that's when i was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> true [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you need something you need at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> least like a two yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right but i mean you guys can say that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you're useless because you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> been eating it you know yeah but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i mean i feel like even some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foods where there's an option to pick a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spicy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> version i don't always pick the spicy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> version it very much depends on the dish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and whether it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> complements it or not right right i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know now i could do a level </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three and now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i understand like oh you know this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> actually so much better with spice yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to a certain degree but like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i had to kind of slowly trick my brain </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> into thinking that right because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you had given me a level three spicy </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kokuichi like two years ago </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i would have been like what is this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] like this isn't enjoyable at all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i seek enjoyment out of my meal and this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is not enjoyable i mean i'm in severe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but now i've like slowly started to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> appreciate the pain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right joey says getting a level </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> three yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i say like getting a level three i'm not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> feeling those endorphins now that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly like to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> like that's [ __ ] painful but like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> it's good painful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> right and like now i'm finally starting </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to understand i'm like oh okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> these like other friends i knew who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could eat like level seven and eights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who i just thought were like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> you grew up in a thai household eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spice food all your life right yeah </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> because like my dad [ __ ] loves spicy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> food like you know like the death source </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they sell here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my dad would just put that in meals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like yeah but to me i was like why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you putting cyanide in a perfectly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why would you poison this meal like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because then he would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] serve it up to the family oh my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> god and we would have to eat it that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> reminds me my uh my older brother </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he was growing uh carolina reapers yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> and um why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's a good question because he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> won he liked spicy food but yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um one time this was right before i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moved to japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he he gave them to my parents and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> told them that they were like normal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> peppers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh wait why would you do that that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like what happened that's a true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> crime story yeah yeah so what happened </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they were like oh yeah they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying like oh brett's been growing some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some peppers and he's he's given us some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so i'm gonna put them in the stir </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fry tonight and i think oh okay sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't know yeah that they were they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were carolina </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or ghost peppers one of the other i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're both [ __ ] they're both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] hot yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bear am i my parents do believe that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> paprika is spicy i'm not joking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll probably my dad watches the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> podcast he'll be he'll be like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lying connor but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um and so they made me it's the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they did the stir fry is they make it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they give it to me first and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they make it for my dad and my mom makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it for herself last and it's like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like five minutes in between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i'm i'm eating this stir-fry and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm getting kind of like i'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this kind of what this hurts and i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thinking like oh wow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my what purpose did you use </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> he's like oh ah this is your brother he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> grew them and gave them to us and i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did he say what kind of peppers they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were so no no he just said he grew them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> look a little kick to them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> my parents didn't know they thought they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> were like the like the numbers did your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> parents eat them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so so what happened next is that uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know i want them i was like i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i really think i'm like i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> bear in mind i'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm like really think that you should </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like go easy on the peppers on yours if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get them out a little bit i think you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> should do that like no no it's fine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> we've had it before we've had these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> peppers </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> pictures taken before disaster but at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that point i was like you know what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> fine let's just see what happens let's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> just see what happens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> let's see how this unfolds i'm there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like literally like that that meme of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that kid at the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the vein on his forehead yeah just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> eating these peppers trying to keep a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> straight face like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm not my daddy he's he's about to eat </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it he takes one spoonful and he's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah wow that's really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that's really spicy </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> and he just like started like crying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i thought it was so funny and my mom </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought he was over exaggerating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so my mom was like i'll try it too oh my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> god </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and my mom starts doing the exact same </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thing she starts [ __ ] her car </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> after like one bite they just couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finish it they just started drinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> milk for like 20 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> they were just dying it was the funniest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] i don't know </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_01> what happened is i was i was out of </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> because it was so spicy that it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> induced my gag reflex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i was i was like i was on the toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like in the bathroom for like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good three hours just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gagging on on the toilet couldn't throw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up it was just like my gag reflex just </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> my body trying to throw up this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like one one little drop so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like there was nothing to throw up it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was like a drop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but it it had induced this gag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reflex and i was on the toilet for about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh my you know my my university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mates being the good mates that they </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> they just just they just kind of went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> clubbing and just left </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you while you're on the toilet fantastic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mates well what a fantastic group of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mates well that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean that's why i'm not friends with </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> maybe what if it was all a ruse guard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where they all agreed to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> take small amounts of this just so that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> god would step up to the plate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> let me show you yeah they were all like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> way i know a way that got to fall for it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that's about that i think that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they did maybe the spice challenge but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like i i i think i've read that no one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has ever died from spice before or like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can go into shock though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i think so yeah i i don't know i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know melon look it up has anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever died from spice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah they can go so you can't die from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the chemical itself but you can die from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shock you can die from the pain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it induces yeah yeah yeah yeah you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> get like cardiac arrest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah but it's always fun yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically basically just don't just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't do something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> don't go into cardiac arrest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> doctors hate </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> luckily i always i always stop those </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> stop breathing did you did you ever have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like do it no god no no you don't </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_08> 100 wow i wish i was joking how do you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> i might as well just tell stories about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being lifeguards there's just so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh basically whilst i was working on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mcdonald's uh i want to be a lifeguard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well i could swim um good start i was a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really strong swimmer and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there was a course that i did that took </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about a week um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was really really weird have to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> do because i had to sacrifice a week of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> school vacation </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> so i only had one week and i spent it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> learning how to be a lifeguard i paid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 400 bucks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then i couldn't get a job for like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> year and a half because they were all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah you don't have experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause i was like 17. right that catch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 22. yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no they didn't hire me but eventually um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it paid really well at the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> mcdonald's paid me four pounds 10 an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hour which is this much in dollars and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh the lifeguarding paid nine pounds 10 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an hour oh wow which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> at the time that was that's that's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> minted job bro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was yeah but yes the thing was you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> had to you had to have a week of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> training you'd pay for it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a double shift at mcdonald's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah and you know it was it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on paper it looks like an easy ass job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because all you have to do is sit there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for 30 minutes and you get a 20 minute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> break </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you sit there for 30 minutes you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have 20 minute break and that was it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah um but when you're new they put you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the at least minded they put me on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the shift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was uh kids birthday parties </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like because my mum swam at that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pool and they never put me on the shift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with the old people because all people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> don't drown </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> old people no because they know their </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> limits yeah because they all go to the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> swimming club </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all the time and you know it's you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they're not they're not going to and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> apart from like freak accidents which </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> never happened and like people don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> drown in pools in the uk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the the year that i became a lifeguard </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> zero people died from pools in the uk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> so this doesn't happen why are you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> laughing about it until i started the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> job </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like okay so have you ever seen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> those </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> floats that take up all the pool oh like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the lanes and stuff or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the whole pool it's like a big </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> inflatable i've never seen it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i've seen them you've never seen these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you've seen these mainly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you ever seen these google it like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a picture on screen literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> massive kind of like total wipeout s </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> courses right that you can inflate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they take up the whole pool and if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you fall off you fall in the water oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's kind of funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when i was a kid i i loved the kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like a trash day special waiting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to happen isn't it it's like yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine like a bouncy house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> on water that sounds fun as [ __ ] no dude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it is it's literally house imagine a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> total wipeout obstacle course on water </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dude it's bad it's dude when i was 12 i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> love this [ __ ] can we do that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> dude yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> so like you could um basically for kids </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> birthday parties uh there'd be like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five or six year old who would rent it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out now yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem is with kids birthday parties is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that not every parent thinks that kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to be taught how to swim </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right right i think because parents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> forget that kids need to be taught how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to swim yeah yeah because you just take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it for granted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> so what ends up happening is obviously </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a birthday party everyone invites </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> their whole class </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> now half the kids in the class don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> know how to swim yeah but they still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are invited and go anyway yeah so you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd be sitting there on my my thing and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i can tell immediately which one of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> these kids can't swim yeah they look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that jerry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the hell yeah so they'd be like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it'd be like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> climbing thing and then you have to go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> through pylons as a slide yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> now you could tell immediately when you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> look at these kids which couldn't swim </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they just had a look in their eyes where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've never been in this before what do i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do and that's a big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like thing of water because they're also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know kids are like that thing where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like most kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like a built-in like danger system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah with their life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah like it's like heights right kids </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know that they're scared of heights </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kids know that water is like weird and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> scary yeah and then the kids that run in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it right away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and normally like they can swim yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah but so you'd be what you'd be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing this thing right and there'd be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> kids </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you'd see this kid like you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just tell again you can tell he looks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he doesn't look confident right his </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> technique's poor you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> looking at the water really scared like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> toe first right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so they climb on this thing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> bear in mind it starts at the shallow </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> end and it goes to the deep end </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right where you get off right and then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're talking like i don't know like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> two meters deep yeah no no more than </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's like three meters five meters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean five minutes deep in the pool i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worked out that's pretty [ __ ] deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for uh for a kid it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these kids these kids would just walk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and then they'd get to the end of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this obstacle course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and you could see it that they were like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what do i do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone else is going down this slide </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and they're being you know they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being egged on by their friends and they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just go down the slide </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> and they would just go down this is sync </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they just sink they didn't come back </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> up they just wouldn't come back up wait </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> like two seconds </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just to like make sure just to make sure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they don't come back up yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you have two choices you can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> either jump in or you can get a really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> long pole and like poke them with it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> and hope they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well normally i just hope they're still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> alive hello </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> so what i mean basically if a kid was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> splashing around to be like ah you just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> give him a pole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he'll grab i'll like grab on to them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they'll grab on to anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right but if you uh if they don't if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't swim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just sink which is like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] go in so then i have to go in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this should happen like three or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four times sometimes in like one session </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hell because these kids are just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> terrible and you i'd have to i'd like i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sometimes i would go and jump in i would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> get a kid </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah what are you doing stop don't go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> near the deep end yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then he would go and he would go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> near it again and i feel i'd blow the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whistle back what are you doing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then i look away for a second i look </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> back he's at the deep end again jumps in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> drowns again </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i have to go in and get him i tell his </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> parents off and his parents have a go at </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> me and complained to my manager saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> twice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i hold his hand and i was like come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where's your mum show him where your mom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we went to his mum where's your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> mom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what are you doing i was like why are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you letting this kid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> into this pool without any armbands or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything and she's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't have any floaties or anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah why would that's why why didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they have armbands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you know her reason was she was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't want him to feel like he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he's like you know the weird one the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who can't swim and i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but he is the one who can't see him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's because he can't swim </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he will [ __ ] drown do you understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how this works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i'm like did you ever teach him how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to swim no i'm like why are you letting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> him do this this is really irresponsible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then i just left and this was in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> front of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all her friends because they had like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> viewing bathroom yeah and then she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complained saying i didn't need to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that in front of all her friends it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really inappropriate of me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like i'm sorry but like how you saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your kid drowned once and thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll let him keep swimming yeah i'll let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him keep going that really pissed me off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm still really annoyed about that yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just funny i mean i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that just sounds like bad parenting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's terrible yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the people that stuff like they would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just let their kids listen unless the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> parent was like [ __ ] i've been trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get rid of them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> get ready next special we're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> doing this doesn't this look amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dude and it was like it was a really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good job other than that like it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kids just like don't know how to swim </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you can tell a moment they can't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> swim </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah um and uh yeah they would also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you ever tried </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sometimes if you'd um they taught you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i never thought i'd have to use this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they teach you how to kick someone off </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you if you're if they're like trying to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> drag you down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh well i'm gonna say if someone if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're trying to save someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right if i'm drowning you coming with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they think they're drowning they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> panic and what they do is that they push </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because they think i want to get up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and you know it's not like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> selfish thing where they're like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i'm dying and you're dying with me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah literally it's like instincts kick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in for them and they think i'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm gonna push you down yeah to get up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so i can observe that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what was the technique so what you do is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like aim for the head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> so if they're trying to like grab onto </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you and push you down </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you grab them by the arms and like like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so let's say you're equal now in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> water we're both on top of the water </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> heads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you grab them and like you go down under </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the water and you kick them up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and kick them off you right right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's you push them away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you officially just grab them </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> by the face when you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm not i'm not kidding when you save </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> someone you're supposed to grab them by </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the chin like this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like pull them holy [ __ ] um or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you can there's some other ways but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the easiest because that way you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can kind of just do it like at your own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pace you can kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's other ways like you can you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> grab them but that that's really awkward </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it depends like how big they are and if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you like if it's like a child like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sometimes grabbing them by the face </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> might be a bit much [ __ ] get over it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> just imagine you like jewelry wielding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> children </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like grabbing it in the face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you know the worst thing was as well is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that when you this is the thing that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> like you don't really think about is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that you don't bring spare uniforms yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> that's not really your thing so if you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> if you go in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> um and you you save a kid and it's still </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> your shift you just go right back to the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> chair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and you're soaking and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they take the time like the first time i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> did it i thought i i have to go in right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> away i have to save their life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right away yeah and i wouldn't take my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> shoes off or anything yeah but then i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> realized all the people who are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experienced they would just walk down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> slowly they would just take off their </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> shoes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and socks because they knew they had </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> time and they knew like it's a pool they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know they're going to grab them right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so they're like i'm not getting my nike </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> air maxes where what the [ __ ] bro like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a kid driving in the gym </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they sit down like this right they see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> them like because if they're flailing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've got plenty of time yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so they would just like sit they'd like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walk down really slowly like this you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know and then they'd be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay take the watch off like this you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they would then they would go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in yeah it was really funny i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought it was really bizarre but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they i was like why did you do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't that like bad they're like no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not going to drown yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not going to drown i know the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> average time it takes yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well the moment again the money if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're worried is if they don't come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back up that's when you have to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> immediately go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in yeah so that was all like that was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fine and like again this like never </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> happened ever this is only with little </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kids because little kids are dumb </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i mean i make out these stories to be a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> lot more exciting than they are in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> general the job was extremely boring </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like it is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one of the hardest jobs to do just out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of sheer insanity like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you sit there for 30 minutes at a time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> just watching people swim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah then you take a 20-minute break and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> then you go back to it and this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like six hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just watching people swim and at first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> it's such a weird thing to do because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yo what if people get a problem with me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like staring at them while they're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> swimming </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know like like because i'm like you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> don't stare at people normally we got to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> watch the pool right but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is it weird that i'm looking at people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like there's parents watching me what do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> they think i'm looking at their kid too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i'm just making sure that they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> not drowning okay it's not weird right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like oh okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> about that he said this is the thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these are the thoughts you have when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're going insane sitting there for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> six hours thinking like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is it weird is it weird that i'm looking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at everyone for like this long is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> going inside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an existential crisis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> i legitimately started like going insane </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> working there because i was like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you have to just think how long did you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> do that for ah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> god about just under a year and then i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> went to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then i moved away um but yeah i got </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that job from doing a different job </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> which i talked about at different times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's completely different yeah it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really funny as well but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> lifeguarding in general is like super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> boring but the pay was really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you have to get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> qualification </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and you have to be taught a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff i mean yeah you're there to save </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> lives </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah and the course is quite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> hard like and you have to redo it every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so i i can't be a lifeguard now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i haven't got i didn't renew it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so uh but for the one year it was yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> mean it was it was fine i mean the pay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the pay was insane like being 18 and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> coming back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i feel like learning the basic first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> aid skills is really [ __ ] important </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it was really helpful because i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was never taught it we don't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> taught in the uk yeah yeah we don't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> too so i don't know how to do cpr </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i do not know how to do the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heimlich maneuver are you going to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that as well yeah yeah we just have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> learn like all the basics </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> um all the basically probably i should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably learn it now because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna be real awkward if i'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> be like hold on let me just bring up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this youtube tutorial for a second </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> all right wait wait wait i got i got on </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_06> a lot of aspects of the job were fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah not many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like i had to like clean as well like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clean all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> toilets and showers which was like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> mean i didn't know i was going to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right glad you spent 400 bucks to clean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> toilets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you know you you're there and when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're wrapping up and there's no one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> left in the pool you just start cleaning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what you're supposed to do um but yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> he uh i had to like because even though </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i wasn't i wasn't teaching the kids but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for the kids who are like one year old </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they're learning how to swim they had to </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> and they've like they suddenly gained </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> the grip strength of like a grown man </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was just yeah i mean it was it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just it's all right job really it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just paid well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the kids at the pool are scary just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just kids man kids [ __ ] suck </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> to swim like to me it's it's still scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um whenever i go out and i swim and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't feel the bottom i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like there's like the the fear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> there's something so wholesome about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> hearing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why i don't know it just sounds like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> child problem </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> swimming pool it's fine but like out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like out on out in the sea i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time no what's worse is when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> can actually feels like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something something yeah that's when i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scared </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean like if i don't know some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> something like in in a pool completely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fine i didn't give a [ __ ] if i can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel the bottom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if i'm like i remember the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i've realized it when my when we were on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the beach it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it was brighton beach's work so it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't it wasn't exactly a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thrilling beach and i remember like my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mates just though we we're kind of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh yeah let's go swim out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh swim out you know to where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] boys are and i've never done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it before but i knew i'd swim and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember we got there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i this is the first time in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i had swam that far out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is the first time in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i i got i got to this point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and i started kicking down and my whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life experience had taught me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no matter how deep it is you can still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stand up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so it was it was this it was this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realization where we get there and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> start flowing on the water and i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where's the floor where's where's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> where's where's the ocean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was your six foot you just you take </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> floors for granted yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly right like i've never had a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> swimming pool where like i couldn't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> stand up at least something like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> tiptoes yeah like i sink down a little </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you know i can still see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the surface of the water i'm still in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tiptoes i can reach the surface quite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so this was the first time where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had i'd gone this far out and i had the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realization of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay um there is no edges to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pool that i can quickly grab onto </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got a swim literally like all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way back to the [ __ ] beach and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the beach like you know that scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in uh like movies where you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the character gets vertigo where they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look down and like the ground just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> suddenly like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zooms out that's exactly how i look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's exactly what the beach looked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when i turned around and it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the beach just went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zoom like that and i was just like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] that's why you don't really you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know you shouldn't be swimming if you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> getting even like one percent tired like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should turn about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i was already pretty tired you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> should turn the [ __ ] off people drown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's probably like the closest that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would come to drowning as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> people get tired and they swim out and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then they they're like they're tired by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the time they turn around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're [ __ ] it's so sad and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i i remember like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember turning around and being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay i've got to [ __ ] do this because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because one of the like the scariest my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> life literally my life literally depends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on it and i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys i think i think i've got to turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back and uh i don't think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of conveyed how [ __ ] terrified i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> was to my mates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they were like yeah we're just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna keep going without school with you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> okay okay i'm gonna turn back now um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so yeah what a great group of friends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> those are bad mates maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> if they're letting you like do that dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i i i didn't have a good group of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> mates when i was growing up if i heard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> even like a breath from my friend that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> sounded a little too heavy on my throat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i'm like turn the [ __ ] around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> get the [ __ ] back especially when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get further out the waves get stronger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah exactly and then the currents come </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in and that's when it gets really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] scary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i i can't think of anything more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depressing than just [ __ ] dying and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> praying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just at least if at least if i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna die on a beach let me down a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> beach like a nice beer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> come to wales man we've got the finest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> beaches man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my fondest memory as a kid because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because australia every [ __ ] house </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> has like a pool in it because otherwise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> survive the luxury yeah you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> survive the summer otherwise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but um my fondest memory and i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know if this is like a collective like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> memory for everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like every kid who like swam in a pool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but did you used to do this thing where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go under the water and then you would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> pretend to like walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i feel like you're in like on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> moon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of course that's the only memory i have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of being in a pool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though i went to swimming school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like seven </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> years to like learn how to like do all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these like different swimming things and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like all these fun activities and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatnot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the only thing i remember is like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm on the moon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> what intelligent thoughts is joe yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the whole time you're talking about like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the pool that's in my head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was just replaying over and over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again i'm like i want to go swim in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> pool again it's sad because it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] hard to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> find a place to swim there's no pools </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> here it's like they thought they hate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> swimming for some reason </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> unless you know you [ __ ] pay 150 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bucks a month to go to a gym that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> also just happens to have a pool in it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'd pay to go to a gym with a pool in it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i just want to go to like a pool i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> haven't seen a pool anywhere </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah honestly it's always weird to think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> they just don't like pools </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes well i mean i don't know if how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> statistically correct this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is but there's a lot of even adults in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> japan that would just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> never learn to swim yeah i mean like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> if it wasn't kind of everywhere if it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't part of my curriculum i probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would not have learned how to swim </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't know where i would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gotten the motivation to be like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm going to go out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and figure out how i'm going to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> there's yeah let's play through waters </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> everywhere in the uk yeah because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the public yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah exactly you pay like two pounds and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because in australia it's almost </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like sick second nature to be like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your kid is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three to five years old well then we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> going to take you to swimming school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no question as someone who's a lifeguard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has there any like was it pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> common for like you to find pieces of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] in your pool just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it happened like so from like a year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it was like code brown so it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's what it was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd have to you'd have to empty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone has to get out you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> close the pool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you have to really you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> re-sanitize it because it's like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah because obviously there's tons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of piss in there but you can't see it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then you see a giant mars bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> floating in there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta you gotta fish you gotta fish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it out and then you gotta kick everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out same if like someone throws up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i think more people threw up than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> throwing up in a pool oh i guess from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drinking all the pool water maybe people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some kids are stupid they they would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like some of them would drink the pool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> water yeah yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> some of them would just eat a lot and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> they'd like jump around and then swim a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bunch get really exhausted and then they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah how long would it take to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] sanitize the pool i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> we had like a roomba </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that did it there's like a roomba that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> went around like the bottom and there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah like the little yeah we used to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have these yeah we could go around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it would clean it but the water is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like never like emptied </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's um it's just like salted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and they they could do a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chlorine test every like two hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah make sure the chlorine levels are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay but i i never did that i wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> allowed to they were like we don't trust </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you with the calling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the chlorine connor get out of it </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> manager there so i just i was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> just because i i i remember still having </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] vivid memories as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> when i was like learning how to swim </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like finding a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in in like the swimming pool right it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happened like twice i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because like we would never float </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it would always be at the bottom yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like as a as a kid i was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> you because i was always been </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> short-sighted i was always short-sighted </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in my entire life and i didn't know this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> until i was like maybe 10 years old that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> oh short-sighted god actually i remember </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i remember </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember as a kid right i would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking sitting really close to the tv </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because like like when playing games or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever my mom just like stopped </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> you're not you're not looking hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enough get better eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it was only when it was only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when um it's only when we realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that we know when i was in the audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but i was just i i was just born with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> bad eyesight you know unfortunately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so as a kid i didn't have glasses at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would be swimming in the pool and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> would see this like little </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i remember seeing this like little black </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] thing like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in the corner of this pool right and you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> do and it was it was it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> blurry as [ __ ] right so i'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what the [ __ ] is this black thing no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in this in the corner before i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> noticed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and so like out of you know they say </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> curiosity killed the cats </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> um so uh me being the curious little you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] six year old i was or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i swim closer and closer to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm looking back i i can hear the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] jaws music just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> playing in the background i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> done and so like i'm it's i start </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> swimming closer and closer to it and it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> starts like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> slowly slowly enhancing slowly slowly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming into focus right and it starts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it becomes this blurry mess and it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> becomes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this cylinder shaped thing and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what the [ __ ] is a cylinder shaped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the swimming pool right right and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i get closer and i get closer and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm literally like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so the shit's there right and and so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i like when it when it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> because because like when it fully came </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> into focus </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> obviously when i'm this obviously when </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm this close i can see the entire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] detail </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> of [ __ ] yeah i can like you know you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see the [ __ ] texture of the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> underwater scream i had of my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_08> yeah and we i still to this day cannot </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> figure out what happened </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_07> they would let like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> uh like six like in the pool yeah they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would let people they would put six </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kayaks in the pool and just let people </SPEAKER_08>
