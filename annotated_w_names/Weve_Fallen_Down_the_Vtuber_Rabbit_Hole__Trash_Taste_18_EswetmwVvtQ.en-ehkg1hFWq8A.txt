<SPEAKER_05> - Who's your best girl? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Who's your wife, Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, because this is you can't do that, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that's a loaded question. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - If he can't answer within five seconds </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> then you don't have a wife yet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, that's like saying
what's your favorite genocide? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no, someone's gonna be angry like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (soft upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> Hi, I'm the boy of the cDawgvariety </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> and today I'm with Jesus the carpenter man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he just built two chairs and Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just Garnt?
- Just Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, do you want something else? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - The Garnt the guy who
did not build two chairs. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just tired for no reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - We've been building up
an office you can't see it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah, there'll be some live streams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you build two chairs?
- Yeah, I did what every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> good white man, watch the brown man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> - Wow. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was just sitting in
the corner on Twitter </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, you guys got this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah you guys got this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember where they
were building the pyramids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> and there was one guy in
the corner on Twitter. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like the epitome of I'm helping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you're helping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Moral support.
- It was labeling things. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We should cut off that shit
that we just spoke about, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> this is a very inefficient
interrupt, all right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Garnt, what are we talking about today? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, what are
we talking about today? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, basically the only
like new current topic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can think of
- At the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're recording, of course.
- at the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're recording this is this week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Hololive English just
got announced basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What?
- Okay, no just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - What are you laughing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is that is it funny? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, is just that if anyone's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna start topic, it's Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been following Hololive for a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this week, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or maybe was it last week or this week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that Hololive English got announced? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And everyone's had their debut. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then Twitter just exploded. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like I was in the
Hololive community before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I knew the usual suspects, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> whose suspects would be
talking about VTubers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But within the last week, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like my entire feed has just been VTubers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's not just Hololive VTubers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right.
- Fucking everyone's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coming out as a VTuber right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everyone is turning into a VTuber. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm right there with
you because I am a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like coming out about benediction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's like, I'm
sorry but I have recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> fallen into the Vtube hole myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Hololive hole and I can't get out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - When you made that tweet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like the proud father </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> who had just found out his son </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had like won the baseball
game or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how I felt reading the tweet man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know dad, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't feel like I was winning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm glad to accept we had
a nice variation of opinions </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> on the topic is 'cause Garnt, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> has been like the old boomer simp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The boomer simp of Hololive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's been simping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> since the first crumb of Hololive existed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we just got into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like an alien who's just come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to earth for the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and has just found out
about a religion he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wait, so you will just
believe in this book? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just take it 100% you'll just follow it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes.
- Give your money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> to this book. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is a religion at this point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I'm the altar
boy and he's the pope. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - So I felt like I didn't get it before </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> and now I feel like I must be like doing </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> like something is wrong with me. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - No, because--
- I'm like the only person </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> who's just standing being like, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> so everyone's into this,
everyone likes this. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I was there with you, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I don't even
know how it even started. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's because I was just curious, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this guy won't shut the fuck UP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, I'll give it a go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I've worked with
VTubers in the past, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Kizuna Ai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I worked with her and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me see what the stream of variety is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I looked at Wan.. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> An hour passed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all it takes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then two hours passed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And then three hours passed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I said oh no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've fallen and I can't get up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've watched like a lot of the clips </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because they come at my
recommended it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> someone someone says the N word. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's how it got viral </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> in the first place. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - How I fell into the hole was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> there would be some clip
that someone had read. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was always the GTA one
there's like a compilation </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - The (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Just like just like why
is like these anime girls </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> dropping the N bomb. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what is that about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't remember that
episode of Madoka Magica. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And then after that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> it would be like that they
would jump like the F bomb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they would just be
like anime girls swearing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> And then eventually, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I was like curious </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> and then saw one clip, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was one clip that
got recommended to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was well one of
the Hololive VTubers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fubuki singing Scatman. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just this Hololive
girl like singing Scatman. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - That sound pretty good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That sounds pretty fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's adorable as fuck, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And she does like a lot of covers. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then it was one video, one video. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> And then after I watched that one video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> YouTube recommended was like--- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Allow us to introduce ourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yo, you like this shit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yo, we got all this shit right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - YouTube recommendations very turned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> into like the back alley of
like crack deal, all right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just like, you want more? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I got some more for you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - The worst is when Youtube like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> autoplays video you did not wanna watch. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then it will not stop
recommending that channel. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I never intended for this to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> Stop, stop this right now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, cause the difference between </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just watching that one channel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and having YouTube recommend
this entire just one channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like with VTubers, it's
watching one VTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it's just a load of other clips </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on other different channels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That just get recommended
to you all at once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what it
is about the algorithm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But I feel like if you
just watch one, your lost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They kind of did it in a genius way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because almost all of
the Hololive members, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> they almost always collab
with one another as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've seen that, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's just perfectly built to just get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> once you start with one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then you see that one post in you're into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> collab with another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You're like, oh, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let me check this one out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then like tree branches, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just keep growing out
until you're way too deep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To explain what virtual YouTube is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's first explain
what virtual Youtubers is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to an audience, to some people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who probably don't know
what virtual YouTubers are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - In case you're watching this from 2012. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So to basically explain, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to put it in the simplest terms, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's basically real people
who rigged themselves up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with an anime avatar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they just make content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whether it be streaming
or YouTube content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Now Now it's more about live streaming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would say like the first
real big VTuber, is Kizuna Ai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> As you probably know or not do not know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now I feel like the content is grown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so far away from what
the content was before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Kizuna Ai leading the charge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I felt like before it was all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> about making just just
like YouTube comments, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> not YouTube content. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Content, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And now it's more
like it's less scripted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's less scripted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's more about live streaming stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I actually prefer that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know about you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because I never really got into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> VTubers before hololive
came along and really kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just took over the entire scene, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, there was a part
of me that when before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and after I did work with Kizuna Ai, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was a time where I really did get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> into the YouTuber side of things as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I found Kizuna Ai </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then I found like
some of the other big </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ones like Shiro and Kabhi
Audrina and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, they're all of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like really entertaining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a lot of really
entertaining VTubers out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the problem is that the
content is just so confined, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an average Kizuna Ai
videos like three minutes long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really really short even
though it's a daily upload, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but now you have Hololive and Nijisanji </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and these other like big
YouTube stream of VTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like organizations that stream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for like two three hours daily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it's just constant
constant feed of content. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - As somebody who doesn't
really know anything about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is it not just Virtual Youtuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> Why does it have the name Hololive? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> What's up with that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay, so Hololive is just an agency. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so they're basically
an agency that have all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> these VTubers under this one roof </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's more like a
branding thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - You want your like talent
to be under your name. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like we will
have individual channels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and they have Trash Tastes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not an agency but that's kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of like the best way I can describe it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like back in
the day when YouTubers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there were different
types of gaming YouTubers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but then a lot of the gaming Youtubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will under the machinima like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there are other ones as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There's Hololive I think the two big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ones a Hololive and Nijisanji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's also all these other tiny, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tiny individual agencies
as well that have a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of different VTubers under their umbrella. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - And yeah, it's just
become like a branding now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, I guess to
play devil's advocate. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta fucking bust up(indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What did he ask? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> What stops it from just
being more than a gimmick </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> to you guys? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, it was a gimmick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, like I said, Okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the way I see is just a new
genre of content, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because there's there's
just something about VTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're not, you
don't see them as like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real life streamers even
though there's a someone that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone behind the avatar, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So there is someone operating it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's not you don't
view them as that person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you don't also view them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a complete anime character as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it like fits in this little gray area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The best way I can.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a little bit creepy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The best way I can describe it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's kind of like wrestling right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where wrestling fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They know that the
people are like, acting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They know Wrestling's fake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they still buy into it anyway, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's basically wrestling(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a whole life
is interesting because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from the little that I've seen so far, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that the characters are
really human like when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you listen to them, yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they're obviously playing and
acting up this character and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this entire law behind the character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then every now and then the human part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of them slips out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And that is kind of
charming to watch because. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I can imagine yeah,
I've seen clips of, like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff like that happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember what it was, yeah, they like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> break character for a second. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's basically like
the best of both worlds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like, I don't I don't
feel like it's a gimmick, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because the more I've gotten into it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the more I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man I can't really get this kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> of entertainment anywhere else. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And that's why I've become so addicted </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to VTubers is because I
could never really get </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> into live streams. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> I know, you've you've been really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really into live streamers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I appreciate the work they do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just never been a guy who could sit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and watch live streams for hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> I've always thought like-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I don't really
watch them for hours. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's mainly like-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It depends on the streamer right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Depends on the stream what's happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's very much like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll see what they're up to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe watch 10 minutes
and go do something else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I don't really watch
streams and sit there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I haven't really done that years. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why I can't
really get into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I watched the clips. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I find them funny, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I feel no desire at all to like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> follow them around. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think it's the
language barrier for you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, especially
there's English ones now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I checked out most of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was like, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna see if there's one I like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because everyone's just like, well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's easy to find one you like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But when you don't like like one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like, no, no. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But I feel like that some
people would say about like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> you should find a woman you like, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> (laughs) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> It's kind of like that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because there are
like so many VTubers now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm pretty sure there's
a VTuber for everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because that's how-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_10> - There's something for everyone. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> - A little something for everyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's how you get into it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like with Joey Yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> people didn't know why people go into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I never understood it
until I found the couple </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of VTubers where I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can vibe with this person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - cause for me when Kizuna Ai blew up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I respect the
character and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just wasn't my kind of content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought it was just
a really cool concept. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now, even if you don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if you have some certain VTubers that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't your favorite, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's gonna be one that you like, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't think I was a simp. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think I'm about to simp man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - I just like this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I enjoy watching some like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> here's the iron mouse on Twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched her about she's pretty funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I wouldn't like say I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, I'm gonna simp,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Simp is a strong word. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But I mean, like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> you can have fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I can watch the streams and enjoy them. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> Yeah, but I see people on Twitter and </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like fucking like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like life or death. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, you got an email
from someone, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> That one time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That was like, you wanna talk about that? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I guess I got an email
from someone who was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically trying to get me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to teach the VTuber
advocates to like people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like English speaking fans
who watch VTubers, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just like, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I ain't getting involved in this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like they're not following
etiquette or something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I can just chat shit while Garnt </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> pulls up the email for a moment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I mean, I guess I get them. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe they don't understand. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, the whole simping thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I guess like with Hololive, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's not that I don't necessarily
like enjoy or anything. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I do enjoy what I like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess it's one of those things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where when you don't
feel nearly as strongly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as other people do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's kind of alienating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, because I wanna enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I feel like
am I enjoying it right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> Because everyone else seems to be </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> so fucking aggressive about this. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that when I first started watching it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and this was only like
three or four days ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like fully started to get into it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just watched it like
just to check it out right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like any streamer would, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you obviously miss all
of these inside jokes that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are within the community, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then the more you watch them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and the more clips you
watch them you like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that means that like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to I'm slowly
starting to understand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, the general flow of how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this particular VTuber
interact with their audience, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, okay, I
either can get into that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or I can't get into that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's that's why they
call it a rabbit hole, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because there's so much content out there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that this whole that you fall into it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no reaching the bottom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And the reason there's
no reaching the bottom is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there is no way that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one person can catch up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> with all the content out there right now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> Even if it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if you just follow
Hololive Japan even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's so many VTubers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's no way you can keep up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with everything that's going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, it's hard to catch up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> with just one VTuber right because yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> most of these VTubers are streaming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> three, four hours a day. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Sounds like a normal streamer though, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> like they stream jokes
they streaming a lot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like what I found is
that with the couple of VTubers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I have found we've really enjoyed, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they could literally be doing anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they just really entertaining
and that's really hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to find in any streamer like VTuber alone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I can name a few streamers
off the top my head that are </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> pure entertainment. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I know a few as well but there's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> something, there's a different quality </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> that VTuber brings I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that a live action
streamer can't really... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Live action! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 3D streamer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Disgusting 3D. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the Netflix
live action adaptation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the anime version. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't dig the Netflix adaptation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know, I don't wanna say too much </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because I think people will just be like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Connor just doesn't get it so but like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> to me at the moment at least
maybe next week I'll come </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> on the podcast and be like, gentlemen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've changed my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I mean, like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you think about basically
has your feed been like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah its been a little-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's been decimated by VTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think is we're right on the cusp of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like kind of becoming mainstream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in English audiences, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because everyone's
trying to be a VTuber. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think the next few
months will be crucial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in determining whether
it's gonna be a thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sticks around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - It'll be a phase of... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because I remember like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was very very surprised
when Pokemon came out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with a Vtube avatar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - And I know like Lily Picchu is about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to debut her avatar, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> which probably will be
debuted by the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like debuting avatar. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Guys, I'm gonna release it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gotta tune in to the debut. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it's all about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - See that's the thing-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay, that is cool. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'll admit, that's kind of cool. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's how to build up hype. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's part of like the law, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> which is why I feel like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> which is why I feel like Hollolive English </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> really did this super well, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because they debuted
everyone at once it became </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this massive event. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And everyone's talking about it now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And everyone paid attention. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And now like, all of Western Twitter </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and like Western streaming
communities will take-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like anime fandom is
really like our attacker. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like it's even
going out to that now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think it's out of that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I've seen like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> plenty of tweets from a lot
of big streamers who are like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> what's this VTuber thing about? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Shall I get an avatar? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, I'm thinking
about getting an avatar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's mainstream internet then? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think just like the
general, the younger audience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So when you're watching these YouTubers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the VTubers, sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you don't wanna like because to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I find what's super
interesting about streamers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the person and yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything about them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, what they choose to show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And perhaps maybe they have a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting like life before streaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, to me, I find the human aspects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so entertaining and that's I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the reason why
I connect so much more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with documentaries and fiction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I think real life is
just so fucking interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because, you can't make this shit up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Like the stuff that
happens in real life is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so much more insane than what happens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in someone's like, fiction-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I wonder why you don't like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you see a VTuber. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Like when I watch VTuber, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> all I'm thinking is like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I wonder what the real person's like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I wanna see I wanna like talk to them. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think though, that
whole thing just isn't-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's completely covered by just the law </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like how they present
themselves as a character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> is just so entertaining
that you almost forget. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, shit, there's a person behind this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I guess it's why I
could never really get </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> into wrestling either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I never really cared about that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I never got into wrestling either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure there's someone can explain it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> some fucking PhD in the comment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - As they always fucking explain it to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I have no idea why
I just can't connect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the avatars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_10> I think again, like it's funny the way </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> that like a clown dancing in front </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> of me will make me laugh. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> Yeah, like that's cool. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - Here's the way I view it. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the reason I go and see VTuber was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this modern day iteration
is VTube is because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone like Kizuna Ai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> I saw completely as a character. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like, I have no interest in Kizuna Ai. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, like, I saw her completely </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> as a character. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And what kind of drew
me to Hololive VTubers, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> was that it felt like they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> did have a personality behind them. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That was you-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There definitely is. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I've seen it, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because you have times
when they talk about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> it's past stories about what they did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as a kid and some aspects. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen one of the Japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> ones always telling stories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The green-haired one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what the fuck is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'll try and find it(indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Is that the difference </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> between the VTuber YouTubers
Versus the VTuber streamers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that almost all of
the VTubers YouTubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were entirely scripted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was very difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were really controlled, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> like they were controlled
as to how much of themselves </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because the streamers
a not scripted, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> Because it's a live stream. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So they actually have
a lot more flexibility </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in what they can show of how
much of a person they are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> or how much of a character they. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I remember I saw recently, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a clip of one
of the characters who... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Laurel of her character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that she's like in her teens, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> but then the character, who
has a voice in the character </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> slipped out a little bit being like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, as a late 20 year old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and people in the chat when like late 20s. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You're in your teens? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm in my teens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't mean that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Dumb teenagers. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But then as the community
was egging her on about, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like late 20s she just
completely just gave up </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm in my late 20s, fuck it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she just rolled with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And that side was like very
human and very entertaining. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is why I feel like I was saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they exist in a place
between being a character </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> and being a human. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's just really weird. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that streamers
do that there as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I mean, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But they ain't cute
anime girls, are they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tyler1 is pretty cute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, everyone knows
I fucking love Tyler1. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think Tyler1 is such a fucking, amazing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> natural entertainer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and like for example, the age thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> he's got the whole I'm six foot five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he has a whole fake ruler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah pulls out in the stream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> He's just like, obviously like five foot. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's like that's like
the same kind of thing right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's almost WWE in that aspect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but he's obviously not that fucking insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one can be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - But like the only
difference between that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> is a fucking add a cute anime
girl in between that, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - To me it's like almost
scarily impressive how someone </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> who's on camera constantly
can keep up this act, like-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is impressive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> It is super impressive. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think live stream
is a fucking psychopath. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - I don't know what it'd have to be. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because you have that
beautiful thing of like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> when you have the Hololive,
it's doing the work for you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> You just gotta put the
voice, which is easy. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I say that as a YouTube creator </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> with total fucking respect. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have no idea how you
guys fucking do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know how 'cause
two hours of streaming </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and I start to like lose my energy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - How Tyler1 can be
screaming for 12 hours? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know.
- I don't get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like after I'm like
streaming for two hours, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> two hours is like my limits, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything off past two hours </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like pushing... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like running on empty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever I stream I press
like the end stream button </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I go my couch and I collapse, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after two fucking hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is really fucking tiring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and we have we all have friends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that can do fucking eight
nine hour streams daily. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, how do you do that shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I fucking left my
stream on the other day </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> when I thought I turned it off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I left my house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then some people
were tweeting me like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, your stream still on bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I checked and it was just on.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I looked at like the final
10 minutes before I left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like I go like bye guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> You guys can go and see this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what the-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - At least you didn't
like jerk off on stream. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs)
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - Like could you imagine, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> if I was just like done (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> Like that's just my thing when I'm done. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just stand up and the
dick just flopping out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - God, I just hate that group of people. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, Tyler1 become a VTuber dude, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> just I'm saying that that
would be fucking insane. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> We need a VTuber that
screams like Tyler1, bro. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, there's a lot fucking Japanese-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You obviously have not seen some VTubers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that fucking blow off your ears. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude, it's the muscles
combined with it that just adds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the character building,
that's the real 3D model. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> (indistinct)
(laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna fuck Tyler1. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - You just wanna simp Tyler1.
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Apes together strong.
- Apes together strong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Okay, and as well like
I think there's a... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know if this is just me, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But it's the reason why I can't
like enjoy certain things. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Okay, I wanna make this very clear </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> before people get angry at
me because I know people do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of doesn't like all the
live kind of hates all this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm interested in other aspects. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think blindly just being like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking love this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is fucking boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We wanna have a discussion here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a Japanese
company, right, Hololive? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm pretty curious about that cop. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I wanna know what it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I wanna know what that contract is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> 'cause I guarantee that it is
skewed towards the Japanese. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah it's probably like
machinima quality right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm betting it's a Machinima Com. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, we're talking like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I would be genuinely surprised </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> if the creator was getting 30% or more. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> If they were getting more than 20%, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> I would probably call bullshit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think they're getting
anywhere between 20 and 10%. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Again, this is just speculation, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just know-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a very big possibility. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause you've got approached </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by a Japanese YouTube agency before right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Many times, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - And they were offering similar costs. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Absolutely garbage. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like what was the lowest
one you've received? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - The lowest one I received was 70/30. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> But 70 to the company, 30 to me. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's how it is. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But you were already
established at that point </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> which is disgusting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I think I had like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> almost 2 million subs. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> It was it was not that long
ago, sometime last year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's really rare for an... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially if you're
an established talent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this is this the kind of numbers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that you were probably getting
pitched by Japanese company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who realized you were established. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you imagine when
you're not established? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like what numbers they're
going to be pitching you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I know him likes to do that, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause it's like, would
you focus on the character, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the entertainer, they're
having fun, they like it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's like, when you're new, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> you don't know what's good. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, I've spoken to many YouTubers, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> who I have personally, like, helped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with deals who would
they were getting paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like $1,000 for like
sponsorship (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 times that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just because they're happy with the deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't make it okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I wonder if... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, it could be a totally fair deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just, I would like to know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just 'cause it makes me worried. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I guess this goes into like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just the darker side of
idol industry period. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - 'Cause it's not only a Japanese company, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> it's a Japanese idol company. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And we (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - That shit is fucked yeah. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm interested to see, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll never find out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> But I would love to know the
rules of that they're under. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I don't know
because I feel like with-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'd like to think it's modern. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I would also like
to think it's modern. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, this is all speculation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so none of us know what kind of deal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the talent has going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - It could be completely fucking wrong </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and yeah to complete(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I fully apologize for that if I am. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just going off base off
experience and what I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're just playing devil's advocate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> I mean, get on with what you're saying. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because it feels like to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just part of the reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that Hololive rose up
so much in the beginning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was because compared to
other let's say idol agencies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and idol companies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like part of it was that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they just kinda let the girls
do whatever the fuck they want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with less restrictions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like most idol companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't allow girls to fucking swear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like tell other girls
are gonna piss on each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like one of
one of like (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The reason the Hololive
expanded so much in our community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> was just how much they
were allowed to shitpost </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and how much free-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, but I wonder if there's somebody </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> at the charge of it, who's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alright, let them shitpost
and we'll keep the profit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>

<SPEAKER_06> - Thank you to Skillshare
for sponsoring this episode, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> back to the video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I almost wonder because you have to... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> Correct me if I'm wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to audition for Hololive, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel like when these
positions in this company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like you
have to audition for us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they can kind of use that power </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even then to force you
to take a shitty deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, it's 90/10% but, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what's 10% when you're nobody, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we can make you into somebody. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean it's also the argument </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of if you're signing with the agency, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna get so much publicity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Becaus of how massive HoloLive is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like with the English
VTubers that this just debut, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> every one of them has
like got over 100k subs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like before they
even started streaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm now they're putting in like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I was watching
Mari stream yesterday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was putting in over like 30K </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concurrent viewers streaming.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you just don't get that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> starting out by yourself as independent. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> That's something you grow over years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'd be interested to see
if that keeps up as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, but I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you could argue that okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if they are getting a bad car, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, they're getting a free career. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So they should be happy
with what the company gives. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sure as well with how powerful </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> and like willing Hololive is
now in these agencies are. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm sure that if they
wanna go into like say, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of them are like
aspiring voice actors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of them are like aspiring
like that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure getting into Hololive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is just a quick shortcut to getting to-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm totally open and happy if I'm wrong. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I hope that it's an amazing fucking deal. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause when was is it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Like Coco had the most, what was it? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - She was like the highest earning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> super chat user in the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like since debuting the art school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think she'd like earned
over like 800 or $900,000 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> which is fucking insane. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like I hope most
of that's going to her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like she deserves that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> She's the one that doing all the work </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> for building this character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She deserves that money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm hoping that they get that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause the thing about
especially Hololive talent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is that everyone is extremely talented. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They obviously can hold
a stream really well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but a lot of it has other other
talents above that as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of them do like a lot of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> covers and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of them do like singing stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and voice acting stuff.
- It's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - (indistinct) is a fucking
pro Tetris player or something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Morrigan like, she just
released a song the other day. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That's like fucking... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - She's so talented. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm so proud of her, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - God opens up and just
smiles at the lock screen. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm so proud of you, honey. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Move the picture of the
fucking Vtube (indistinct) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> Like when Sydney walks in, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking change the tab.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's Sydney (indistinct), I mean, again-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm just trying to like sell them </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because I feel like couldn't get </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> why I don't wanna get into
VTubers until I got into VTubers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now it's really fucking entertaining. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wanna talk about how... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The reason I'm so obsessed with them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> is because it's just a
kind of entertainment </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I couldn't find anywhere else. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I agree, it's definitely. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, I guess 'cause like
when I hear about it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and all of it, immediately
my mind is like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I wanna know how this works. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like that's immediately what I wanna know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I only have an interesting anything else. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, this organization
sounds so unique. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, I wanna know how all this works. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> How do you decide the cuts? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> How do you decide what
rules they have and whatnot? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> That's so interesting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I feel like
that's why a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> got like mad at Pokimane
when she debuted her Vtuber-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which I think is fucking dumb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that we're fucking gate keeping people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> putting an anime avatar
themselves like, come on guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gate keeping is already fucking dumb, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let alone this kind of gatekeeping. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think what that stems from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is the appeal of Vtubers like Hololive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is completely different
from just a normal stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like putting an anime avatar above them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> Because like, it's that
character thing I talked about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where people don't view these
people as people what they do, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> but they also don't view them
as just a character as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think it's also
mainstream not mainstream, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> our live streaming was was so mainstream, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> like tuned into mainstream
especially with Fortnite. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I feel like everyone
fucking live streams now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> You're not special right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Cool, go and watch Fortnite right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Because this is something
like you told me this. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I heard from someone at Twitch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how accurate this is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but apparently, if you average </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> over 10 viewers on Twitch per stream, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're in the top 10% of Twitch. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I hope that's real. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - If it's real, that's fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - 'Cause every single
console can live stream now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so fucking easy.
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so easy to like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It used to be like, you'd
have a fucking beefy boy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm streaming, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I feel like it was almost... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At least I don't know, correct
me if I'm wrong, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it felt like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It felt like this one thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that felt kind of unique in streaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was then mainstream-ified, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> then other people coming in. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> There's dirty IRL streamers coming in. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Those dirty normies
coming into my circle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Taking over my anime girls? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Nah, not today.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I wish I could filter myself
live, like in my photos. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But I can't, so how about I
just make myself beautiful? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll just remake myself completely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I get it man, I'm lazy as fuck. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I look ugly as fuck in half
my streams bro, I wanna-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, hey, man, I'm already prepared </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to enjoy a couple of VTube
streams when I get home tonight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So Joey, I gotta ask,
who are your favorites? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - All right, I'mma head out.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so the first one I
checked out was also Coco. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Only because you fucking love her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love Coco.
- And she's fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But then I found (speaks
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The best(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I've seen so many clips, she's funny. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - She's so fucking funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - She's so cute.
- She's so cute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She's so fucking cute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I head pat her so bad.
- Oh, the head patting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna head pat her so bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna reach into the screen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> so I can give her a head pat </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because she's such a good fucking-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - She's such a (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then recently I also
got into this other Vtuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> NiKoma Takorone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but she's got like the purple... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> She's a cat girl with purple hair. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But I fucking love her
because of her voice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She kind of has like a tomboy-ish voice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She kinda has like a
Sawashiro Miyuki voice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> so a fucking like Celti's voice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She has that exact type of voice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm weak for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Wait, so if you can
understand both English </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> and Japanese fluent, which one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Like with VTubes? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Oh, Japanese for sure. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - How come? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just 'cause I don't know the... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, I must say
you've ever say (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laugh drowns out voice of speaker) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even in Vtube-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey leaves to an
English speaking country, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> God it's just not the fucking (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Drop that shit in Japanese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs)
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Can you believe that shit? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - No because I'm very much like Seyu, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a Seyu fetish, like a voice fetish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I love my fucking Seyus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and if there's like one-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - He's a Seyu simp. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm a Seyu simp like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like anything that's voiced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by like Sawashiro Miyuki or Kana Hanazawa, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just immediately fucking
love because the voice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I feel with Vtube, it's
kinda the same, but like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's the thing though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I found a few Hololives Japanese streamers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> who I really liked their voice, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but their personality
wasn't quite right for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's just kind of finding that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like perfect combination
of voice and personality. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And for me the top two right
now are Korone and Ohaiyu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Who should I watch to get into it? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Who would you recommend for me to watch? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> I will watch it and I'll come back-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - What kind of like content
are you looking for? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Because there's so much... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Is there a milf VTuber? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs)
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - 'Cause me and Joe you're
playing this fucking arcade game. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a huge pile of fucking men. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so fucking badass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have to pick like your wife </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> who always talks to you
when you tap your card. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like six different
girls that you can choose from. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like, dude milfs are
always the hottest (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He picked the milf and
I picked the (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Why are you like
masterpiece (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - So I lock in the beautiful
older lady and very nice. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> And I look on Joey, which one do you... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the fucking 10 year old (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (mimics voice)
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My fucking God-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No she's a (indistinct)
bro, it's the best. . </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, yeah, masterpiece
is the best (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we'll leave that
for another episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Too many kid Hentais out there. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But that what do you enjoy
and streamers, I should say, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's not just about the character-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or the monkey (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Well no, because I didn't
really enjoy watching XQC. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> But I love Tyler1 and I feel
like that's so like close </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> in terms of the kinda energy they have. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know like, I
definitely do think like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're more into the
kind of like buff-like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yo, let's go kinda guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you love Tyler1,
Tectone's our boy like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shout out to Tectone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I feel like the kind
of in the same realm, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Of like energy levels. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I love watching small streamers. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Like be people like four viewers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because you always get the most like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like you you get to watch
someone who's live streaming </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who doesn't know how to live stream </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and in such an endearing way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when you watch like a 10
year old playing Minecraft </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and like that talking to the chat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as they've like learned from like ninja. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they're replicating
a big streamers behavior </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> but like not quite right </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and it's really like uncanny. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - From the sound of
that then I don't think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you can get into any Hololive VTuber, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty fucking professional. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're all big and
they're all professionals. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You might like some
smaller like Indie VTubers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like I saw I saw a few of them </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> that were like 2D and it
was like 2D fishes moving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was really janky and
I was like, oh that's cute. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> They didn't have enough money for the 3D. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know I felt bad. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - They just use my face rig and shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was like yeah like face rig </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but it didn't work properly. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I felt really bad </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> and I'm like, oh man, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> but it's really endearing. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, I really love like
watching viewers with like 20, 30 </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're kind of
getting into the feel of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but not quite there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Big streamers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah Tyler1 is definitely my favorite, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like even if I didn't
like League of Legends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I just love him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like back when he was
doing a variety streams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> he was amazing stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I think the Life of
Tyler1 is one of the-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you showed me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Is one of the best fucking
YouTube videos out there. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - That had to be one the greatest streams. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wish I saw that.
- I wish I was there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if you haven't watched this video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's basically what he
does like a whole movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> he reenacts it, like a budget movie. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is like one of my
favorite streams of all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's the kind of streams I wanna do. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna do like events. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kind of like I wanna have a stream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like turn up
something dumb is gonna happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Like please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, I wanna do more-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because like the way I see VTubers </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of like variety TV for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone's doing
something different, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one of my favorite streamers to watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because she just does some
really random shit sometimes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just Akai Haato or (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like what got me into her stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is she's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> she's just like pure chaos </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and degeneracy into one right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - That sounds good, I like that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this one time she was playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like get over it or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like out of nowhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> she just like smells her feet </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because they like like
stink or something, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And then through that a meme started. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And then what she did right after that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's like one of the most current streams </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> is that she asks her viewers
to send in feet videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just like, people doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the strangest things with feet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> And then she reviews them </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just equally
as hilarious and curse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm gonna watch that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - That sounds disgusting,
but really entertaining. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And another one is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she starts reviewing her own lewds, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh like doujins of her? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, like rule 34. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So she has like several tiers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like lewdness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she posts like this black bar filter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over like the pictures, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you can kind of see what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're just watching an
anime go review her own lewds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like this is paid content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_10> Why am I even trying? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> Like this is content you
cannot find anywhere else. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is like more meta than recreated. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Can you send me a link
to this, I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe I'll come in next week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'll be like, I wanna
take all my opinions back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's amazing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's just like entertaining. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's just stuff </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that real streamers can't get away with </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and then obviously, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you got like people who are
just really good at video games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with an anime avatar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But then there are some that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are just fucking horrible at video games, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and they just make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so fucking entertaining. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it takes them like six
hours to complete one level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they just constantly they just trying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> they're really just trying and struggling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that shit is just cute to watch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, fair enough. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll give it a shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I mean, I do wanna preface again, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> because I know some people
can be so fucking salty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I don't wanna... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't hate VTubers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - He just doesn't understand it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't gotten into it yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> And I would like to play devil's advocate. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was exactly like this last week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because if it's just the
three of us talking around dicks </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and agreeing on something, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's not gonna be a very fun podcast. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> (laughs) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate podcasts where like
yeah, you've got a point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they also agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then they nod their
head for two minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't fucking stand it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know I just
feel like VTuber content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the natural progression </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like anyone who really
go into the Waifu culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like we, like us. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you that's so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, I've got I've gotten into it, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but I guess I wonder why I haven't gone </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> on the off the deep end yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because you've never stepped in yet. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, obviously you never went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into the deep end with the Waifu culture, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just kind of like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who's your best girl? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who's your Waifu Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - No, because this is... </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> You you can't do... </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> That's a loaded question. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you can't answer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> within five seconds then
you don't have a Waifu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's like saying what's
your favorite genocide? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's no Waifu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> someone's gonna be angry like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the point of Waifus, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't please anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can immediately answer that question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Suzuhara. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - Because she's a goat, man. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah she is, I agree. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because I for some reason, I like... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The whole rental girlfriend thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sounds so fucking fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I would love to do that
job, that sounds fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would love to be in a situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to test my acting skills-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be someone else's
like, to meet that grandma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have to cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds like fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does that make me psychotic? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - A little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - That's kind of what
you do on your YouTube. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Basically.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I mean you just did it
until I fucking series </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> where you had a bunch of-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I wasn't that series but I
would love to like actually try </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> and like fucking pretend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and see like it would be believable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know why that sounds fun to me. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Some people will definitely
call that sociopathic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Probably that's a little sociopathic. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> What was the point of this? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh Suzuhara.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think she's a goat, man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> She's just a goat, man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I fucking loves Suzuhara. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just made a fucking video about her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The point is genocide is bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, when the whole Waifu culture, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it like a thing where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I would like I would
fight for my favorite Waifu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I felt like it was a
thing where it was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I genuinely like this character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I'm putting on an act, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> like I don't actually
care about them that much. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, I figured that
everyone was the same way. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is why this we're both taken men. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I'm getting fucking
married next year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is this cause like your
relationships aren't satisfying. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, God I gotta find something else </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> to just fill that void. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - No, because I see Waifus
in a totally different realm </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_01> than I see real people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think like--
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It has to be stated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I think it does. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think people some people are like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when they say, your 2D is better than 3D. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Most people just say it is a gag. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've met some people
who are legitimately like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> nah, fuck 3D women, 2D is the way to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct)
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But we don't like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> We just say that as a fucking gag. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've had your fill of the 3D </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not satisfied. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I like the idea of like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> the Waifus or some of the Waifus. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - What's the idea? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - The idea that you can simp for them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> but there's no actual
repercussions for the simping. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I hate that the word
simp has been invented. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> Because now it just it replaces all nuance </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> of like explaining the feeling. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_10> - But here's the thing, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> you can simp for an actual real person, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_04> but you can't see...
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you can't simp for an anime character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just that's just not how it works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But I think some people
just tend to think like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, I can simp an anime character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you can't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> They're not even real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't simp if they don't exist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't simp if they don't exist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why I just seemed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> like I was under the impression
that everyone was like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> pretending to act like to
feel this strongly about it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I'm sure there are some people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I thought that we were all just like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah, I'll kill you for them, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I didn't think anyone actually
was like serious about that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I mean, I'm not serious about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> I mean, that's that's
part of the fun of it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - We all agree that it's like-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Did you think we won? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Wait, on what side? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you think we-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you honestly think
that if you said like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_10> oh yeah Shinobu is shit
that I would come out </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> after you with a fucking knife. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's what you just said. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I was under the impression
that everyone was like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we're all pretending
to feel this strongly. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - We are serious but we're not like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I will fucking commit genocide. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not pretending because-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - You feel strongly, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but it's not genuinely a strong emotion. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I feel strongly about
a fictional character. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - About the act your putting on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, we're committed to the media. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - It's an act, right? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Like this is what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I feel like I've met some people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who can't turn that shit off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they don't know if it's an act. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's the thing, we can turn it off. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> No, we can turn it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's because we have a brightness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and we can turn it off. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Some people can't turn it off. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like you know how people think like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> everyone just agrees the moon
landing didn't happen right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> It's like that this is
actually a conspiracy theory. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I was like, we all agree
that we're acting right? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> When we talk about these Waifu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> This is actually a conspiracy theory, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where no one actually
feels strongly about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like some American psycho shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - It's like what define feel strongly? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you mean by feel strongly? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - You would never get
upset, like genuinely upset. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, I'm talking like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like crying over sanctity
with a fictional character. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Some people will though. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some people will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, this is not
to do with the story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Like this is like stuff to do with like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> outside emotions that you're bringing in. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - No some people will. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Why? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're not that people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What you're describing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is exactly the same way as people who shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on your favorite anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, you've seen the reactions </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> where if you shit on some anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> people gonna like react strongly to that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - The episode hasn't gone live yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Where we shit on the fandoms </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I'm sure we'll see. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've seen the smear campaign </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> that went against like me when I said </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that fairy tale was shit, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It wasn't a smear campaign. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was a smear campaign. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why I'm i still getting hate? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - They were like defend fairy tale </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from the anime man, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not the only person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who said that fairy tale shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But that's the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There are varying degrees. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Do you think that that the whole like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> simping over the Waifu and stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just the extension of the show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> And the like of the show? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's kind of the same
emotional attachments. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - As the as the resident Waifuologist, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I just made that title up. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Really, I would never guessed that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you really didn't have to clarify that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I've always found Waifu culture </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like super fascinating, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> also because like I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - 'Cause it's like an
act that everyone agrees </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> to just play along with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but at what point is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Here's what's interesting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> At what point is like the attachment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> you feel towards a Waifu? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> At what point do we all agree </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that it becomes unhealthy, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like to me, I can... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, I can clearly separate my love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> towards a fictional character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My love towards like real people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I can safely say that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of like, my favorite Waifus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they would be fucking
assholes if they existed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in real life.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what you get for liking Syndra? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Imagine having a real life Syndra </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who fucking hits you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like, the stupidest shit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't understand about people who say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that Syndra is I mean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't really speak much
cause mine is the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like, at least my Waifu doesn't like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to hit people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like for no fucking reason, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Your Waifu hits people
for no fucking reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - These men are disgusting
as if it's like, man, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> if she was real, what would she do to me? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> (laughs) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> 'Cause it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Because no one defined the rules </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> on how to know act about or talk about it, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_05> but everyone just kind
of had this agreement, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that we're gonna act and all engage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a way like just like
it's a sports team. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, just like a common sense thing-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But some people have taken it too far. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There's always gonna be
people who take it to far right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like fantasy football. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Some people just take it a little too far </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and a little too seriously, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even though they know it doesn't exist. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> it's like when people like give shit </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to the team that like, you motherfucker, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I have $10 on this fucking
game, why don't you go? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, like cause I would say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all about the suspension
of disbelief right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's so many Waifus that work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> simply because they are anime characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's that's what
really works into hey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can really fucking love this character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what she represents
but there's no fucking way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that she exists in real life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I could be with someone like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the exact reason why
I'm okay with maid characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I can't stand maid cafes, like that-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - My fucking God, going into a maid cafe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the cringiest shit--
- It's so cringy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have ever been to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is extremely cringy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just don't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't mind the whole
like ghosting someone thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like if it's a fucking fictional
2D character on my screen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then when I went into a maid cafe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and a real life woman said that to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the exact same way, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, please stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and I remember like peak mid 2000s </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like cringe culture was all about like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seeing people act like anime
characters in real life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I still like, to this
day, I still fucking cringe-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It doesn't translate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whenever someone tries to
act like an anime character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> And that's whether it's
a fucking Western fan, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> or is someone Japanese and it never gets. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - It could be the cutest Japanese girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> it's still cringe. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think also being
British and Australia where </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we like our social rules </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are a lot different to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just anything like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just instinctively uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where you're putting on an act </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and putting me above you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_10> - I think in real life. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I think most people don't like it </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_04> when people pretend to be
anything other than a human. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I turn into you when you view Youtubers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever like someone acts
like an anime character, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, please
act like a human being, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know your not an anime character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like you put a fucking 3D model. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> Let's go. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - That's it, put a 2D avatar. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> - Is it the eye contact? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Is it that they have eyes? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> You can see their eyes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can see the fuck it's
like death in their eyes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Please stop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can see it in your eyes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> This is uncomfortable for both of us. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because every time I
walk into a maid cafe, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know they're not doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that's what they
really are like, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No because when you're a VTuber, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a screen there is a screen-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the barrier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't you cannot
physically interact with them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - As as a British person, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I get uncomfortable when people smile. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like when McDonald's employees smile. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like that's how much I
do not want you to act. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You should not be happy
working at McDonald's. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I worked in McDonald's. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And if you're smiling, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm like you don't get
paid enough to smile. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Don't smile. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that your favorite animal is a lion </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you really enjoy
watching lions at a zoo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's from a distance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're in the cage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> with an actual lion, you're like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna get in,
I don't wanna be here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's potential death there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In McDonald's, when I'm there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they look at me and they smile at me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> asking for my order I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is a lie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're not happy about receiving my order. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I know you're not, don't pretend. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> 'Cause it's even that
that level of fakeness </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> is uncomfortable for me, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> especially in the UK right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You'll never see a fucking
McDonald's employee smile </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and when they do, like stop that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm ordering--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Stop smiling right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like watching a
Youtuber be really nice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_10> when you know they're
an asshole in real life. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just stop man.
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, I don't know, I think it's like, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> again with maid cultures, we don't like it </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_03> when people are fake to us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And when we know they're being fake to us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I guess that's why YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and livestreamers have
done well for for so long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's poised as this real thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a genuine thing and there
are some people out there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> who are and there are
also people out there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> who most definitely aren't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is why like I never understood </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like real Japanese idol culture in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because the one thing I didn't understand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> was this idea that
these real human beings, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> needed to be perfect, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is the Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If they're anything but perfect, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> they kept fucking destroyed.
- They need to be pure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> More pure than anyone can be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Their whole life is over. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - To me that that is that is
the unhealthy side of things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Stochastic as fuck. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because it's when you are
imbuing fictional aspects </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> to real people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you expect real people to
act like fictional characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The reason Waifus work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is because they can be perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or they it's the idea
of them that is perfect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember one fucking
great Japanese meme </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that came out of about years
ago like this started on Twitch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was a thread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of some person fucking critiquing idols </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the idol culture
and that kind of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was this one reply </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of this like absolute simp for idols, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who was like, idols don't poop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't poop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> They're so pure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that they don't even poop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Isn't that something like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> North Korea says about Kim Jong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He doesn't poop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> It's just rainbows but yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, he doesn't waste, there's no waste. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's no waste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's converted into cause
he's a perfect a human being. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> It all gets converted to energy. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then that turned into a meme </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's like if something is so pure, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> they just like yeah, they don't poop. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, they don't poo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Idols don't poop, they're
perfect in every sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - They shit rainbows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they shit rainbows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll eat their shit, why not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a lion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Already cloudy, it's like Mike was out. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, oh my God it's hard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because there's so many... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess because VTubers have
gotten in that perfect spot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like it is
done the everything right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> that kind of goes against
the rules of other things </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> that would make them comfortable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I find it fucking amazing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how just how quickly VTubers have exploded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I remember when Kizuna Ai debuted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like she started a massive
fucking wave of Japanese VTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And nobody here gave a shit at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Some people do like
Kizuna Ai but I think-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like it was Kizuna Ai, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like there was like
a top three, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it was Kaguya Luna and like Siro, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i think were the top three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They had the most attention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there was like a BTA of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of smaller like 100K, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the CT was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> actual 1000s, 10s of 1000s. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like I feel like
we're just on the cusp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like something similar happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the English speaking culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm excited because it's fun </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because I feel like it could
either be like you said like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> something giant could comment
really establish itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> or it could be a flash in the pan. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's a little
bit different though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> than the the Vtubers, Youtubers are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because with the Vtuber, Youtubers side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was this like big three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> or like there was a
couple of really big faces </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> that were kind of pulling
the entire community. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> - I feel that will happen there. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, but I feel that
with like the live stream </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_03> is like with Hololive and Ninjisanji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everybody's kind of at
the top at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the entire community
is growing at once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not so much one
person leading the way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It will eventually level out there. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> This video is also sponsored by Ej Anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the same with Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck you Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got this time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ej Anime store is Kamikaze
official anime merge store </SPEAKER_06>

the newest anime figurines </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> by being introduced in season two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sorry Beatrice, I'm
simping over echidnas now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - This man changes his mind quicker </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> than the wind changes direction. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the great thing about this figure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that it includes a
letter written by the author </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> like kind of fluttering
around in the dress </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and everything it's got
a lot of movement to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is celebrating the completion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the original Strike the
Blood light novel series. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I actually can't believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I know they've been
going on for that long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I swear it started in like mid 2000s. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember seeing like anytime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a new Strike the Bloods </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or like Strike Witches anime series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man, they're still going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this still going on, seriously? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But wait, does it come

<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, this special sale
includes a big tapestry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the original created illustration </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that inspired this figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, the one I wanna talk about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is this one at the back here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is the Konosuba figure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's a double figurine of Iris </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Megumin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will say this figure is
heavily pushing monetization </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on our channel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, this is the Konosuba continued </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_09> when they have like the car.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean if my kid played all that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll be like, my man. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> - Thank you Ej Anime store
for sponsoring this episode. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Back to the video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I feel like we're in a cusp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of like just a new genre
being like birthed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like cause I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> if like in a year or something, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Twitch has a VTuber category on stream. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That'd be cool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, that's that's
kind of what I feel like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> we're about to experience, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's weird that
it's didn't this past week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> where it's just gone from
this kind of cult following to </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> everyone kind of talking about it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and livestream circuit now.
- I hope so. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I'm always down for anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like spices up a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like live streaming has
been a bit stale for a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And even if I'm not into it right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure there's gonna be
someone I like and again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ones I have seen I've rather enjoyed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just haven't gotten into it to the point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I feel very strongly about someone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, I just like people's content. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That's basically how I see. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I see VTubers. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> People are gonna make
the simp memes whatever, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you're gonna make it anyway. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I respect them the same way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I respect any other content creator </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on YouTube or any streamer on Twitch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because they like if you honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you take away the whole
like anime girl facade away, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they just genuinely really
fucking good entertainers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Dude if Dior's voice actor
became a Vtuber, it's all over, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> now I'm gonna simp. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - When we get like officially
established voice actors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to do vtubing, man it's over. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna happen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They gotta get (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - One thing I do find funny though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that I know several people like myself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who like we're very big
anime fans obviously, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who now watch way less anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just because vtubing has (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like Friendship Ended With Anime, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> New Best Friend, Hololive. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like that Toy Story meme, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I need to get rid of the toy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna play with you anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly though, like just this weekend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had so many plans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were just completely ruined </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> by the fact that I got into Hololive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just gonna masturbate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Had to cross all those out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because I feel like it's
just been the perfect storm </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> of 2020 being one of... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I think we can all agree 2020 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has been one of like the
weakest years of anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in quite a while. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's not just the fault
of the anime coming out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Obviously there's the
entire world situation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's also that-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nothing's really like,
excited everybody unanimously. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> There's been, series like, right to go for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and that kind of stuff who have like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some people have gotten excited about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there hasn't been that one show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that everyone's like, yes, let's go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I mean, other than
Re:Zero and Rent a Girlfriend </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and maybe like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck that Demon
fucking school thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Demon school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct)
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would even say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen a lot less hype
around these big shows, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which are the biggest right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than I would say in other years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I wonder if it's also a mixture of like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> a great pretender being kind of scattered. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> And all the big Netflix shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of being thrown out there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of not really
allowing much discussion, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in a way that, okay, if
there's less discussion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on on social media, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because less people are
watching in the same way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess it makes it way easier to then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get behind something like
Hololive where it's live, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> and the memes can be shared instantly. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I feel like just VTubers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> are the hot thing right now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's just what's on
everyone's feed right now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Right, that's why I'm really interested </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> to see how it will level out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if it will, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it will keep growing up.
- I hope so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, I hope so, more interesting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Speaking of like Netflix
anime and everything, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like this weekend, I haven't
done this in a while. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> But I watched an entire
show in like one day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get out of here.
- What is this 2013? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - What show was it?
- It's Dorohedoro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I've watched that too. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - So it's beem a while, like I
started watching a while ago, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> completely forgot what happened. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's amazing right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Here's the thing--
(laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - I've never lost a job
so quick in my life. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just like the way you
said that so casually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it's amazing right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I just said so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I did like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's one of these things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that makes me hate
being like an anime fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's one of those--
- I simp over it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have this experience so often, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you have you have
this 13 episode series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's got so much potential. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It has a really interesting world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It has really cool characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then just as you start to
get invested in everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing really happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why you read the Manga, bruh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was Dorohedoro for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I really love the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's one of the most interesting worlds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen in a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> Like the whole, it's so fucking brutal. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And the magic system is
really weird as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a really-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's unconventional, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's very unconventional. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kind of like Mad
Max timed psychopaths </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or something along those lines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Does something have to happen? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause we're probably gonna
get a season two probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's no guarantee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Especially that's that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the thing about being an anime fan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> With so many shows, you're
just in fucking limbo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just tell me if I'm
gonna get another season </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or tell me if I'm not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanna know, should I just go ahead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and binge the Manga or should I wait? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - With Dorohedoro you should. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - To be fair Netflix has been pretty good </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> with making season two's for that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - We've got a lot better recently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, like I was
really enjoying myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with Dorohedoro, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it just ended and I
was just feeling like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Empty inside. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - I can't remember exactly what happened. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - That's exactly it. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - It's been like, since
we started the podcast </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> when I watched this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's two months. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's not two months. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it came out way earlier than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like four months
ago I watched that shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - We didn't start this
podcast like four months ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like 20 weeks ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah.
- No fucking way. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is episode 18, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - So I watched-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - What the fuck is 2020, man? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like this is episode five right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> We've been on trash day
for like two months. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Your like a fucking comatose
patient on the podcast. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Oh my God, I watched it like then </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> and I remember being really fucking happy </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> that it felt so fucking refreshing. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> It was like a fucking glass of
orange juice in the morning, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, damn, that's nice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, the Manga especially. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I read a few of the
chapters of the Manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it left off and
I was like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hiya Sedekyu's odd,
it's just fucking insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I felt fine being like you know what? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I can tell the story isn't
getting to the best bits </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's totally fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's nowhere near
getting to the best bits. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's fine. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, it's fine. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's just annoying, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I like experiencing
the best part of stories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like seeing stories go from like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least hits one kind of climax </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I feel like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - There was Attack on Titan season two. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My problem with Dorohedoro </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was that I can't point to
a single part to be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is a huge climax happening right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - It doesn't have to have that though. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Like literally the slice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> of life fucking like literally
just named slice alive. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Like nothing climatic ever happens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I feel that the thing, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel the reason why Dorohedoro
was so unique in that sense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is because it poses this incredible world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and these incredible characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and yet they really take
their time to like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - And they don't mind you
showing you the characters </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> you might not be interested in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because eventually
they will become interesting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's a slowly building up world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't give a shit about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, i can say it's perfectly, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> it just didn't feel like a season. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, it felt like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> alright, we've just run out of time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's just cut the season off basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like with most anime seasons, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have some kind of climax, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have a season finale. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> This didn't really feel
like a season finale. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You just kind of just ended. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> sometimes I feel like I don't need that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like sometimes the ride is
better than the destination. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want a complete package with my story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well because I feel the
same thing kind of happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> with Beastars as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah Beastars didn't end satisfyingly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There wasn't really-
- No, that had a climax. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where was the climax? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The stage performance? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, not just the safe performance, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> but they fucked when he... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I can't say this without
going into spoilers. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - You can spoil it,
just say spoiler alert. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But when he saved her, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that was pretty climactic. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> That was the end of a story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Dorohedoro had equivalents of that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> When he bled out his magic juice. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> And they had to get it back or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember what happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something like that yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember just being like
fucking hyped, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Not everything like needs to
have a neat package, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, it does.
- No it doesn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes it does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No it doesn't, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - Literally The Lord of the Rings movie </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> like it's a mess bro. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I think at least at the end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the Lord of the Rings movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you still have some kind of closure, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like, that was
that was a cool story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I swear like what the fuck happens </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in the second Lord of the
Rings film at the end? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's two towers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> That's the only thing I remember. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was that climactic
battle at the end of two towers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - That wasn't the end of it though. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - What you mean it wasn't the end of it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> That was the end of the battle. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, the end of the battle,
not the end of the movie. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine if they just stopped mid battle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dorohedoro did not do
that, we didn't get like a... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We didn't we didn't get like a ticket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because we didn't even
get the big climactic battle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in Dorohedoro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay, Megalo Box was
basically that, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> No, it was a very nice, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it was a cool story had
a very nice package. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And that was shit, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - What the fucking... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> No, Megalo Box is great,
what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was boring bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Megalo Box was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> let's take ping pong and put
it in like a boxing setting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> What didn't you like about Megalo Box? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, I love mega blocks
in the first viewing, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I just said mega blocks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I love Megalo Box. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like the story was just
kind of like, alright, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> I mean, I knew what was gonna happen. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It was so fucking obvious. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, it was just kind of like, all right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I'm not
saying that Megalo Box </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was the greatest animates
come out of that year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But people are like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the fucking great, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> like people are genuinely
upset that it wasn't anime </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> of the year, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, it wasn't that good. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> I would say I felt more complete. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I definitely felt more
complete watching Megalo Box-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - But I think Dorohedoro was better than </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that Megalo Box for me. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like at the moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I can see that Dorohedoro </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely had more potential
to be good than Megalo Box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just saying that it
didn't get near that point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> It didn't fucking get near that point. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I wanted something... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I wanted a moment I could
think back to Dorohedoro </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and be like, that was a great show. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But to me-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - The baseball.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> Where they had like the
giant cockroach join them </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> to play baseball. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_04> This is so fucking dumb, but I love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - By the way, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you're wondering why
I'm not heavily involved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is because I read all the Manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm completely satisfied with this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I'm sure the Manga is amazing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I didn't even watch
the anime 'cause I'm-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Joey's that guy. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I'm just that guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey is a fucking smug cunt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, you peasants (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Joey is there when fucking
Jesus is on the cross, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Joey's like God, you should
see what happens next, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys won't believe it.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm the guy in the cinema </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who likes mouths what they
say as it's happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Just wait till we get to the cave. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, you gotta keep your eye on the cave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You guys thought that
was insignificant bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not saying he's
gonna come back but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - He's gonna revive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate those fucking Manga fans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - God, he's such a smug cunt. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, you like that character, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have fun while it last? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you might not wanna get into it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like forget what I'm
saying, it means nothing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Just don't get into that character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate it though when
you have that friend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who wants to know the like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> is anything gonna happen to them? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm like, don't ask me that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm absolutely that guy
that's like, oh you'll see. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I hate it when people tell me like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm like, yeah I've got these three parts </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that's like, part four's the best. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm like don't fucking tell
me what part is the best, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I wanna have my own opinion. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I just wanna go into like a series </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like zero expectations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because even if I hear something like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this part is fucking amazing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I don't wanna know
this part is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanna like experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the fact that it's amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> instead of like hyping it up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because then I have
like expectations to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> and I don't want expectations to me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - To fuck Joey over here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> As Joey just started
watching Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, finally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Anime Man watching
Demon Slayer in 2020. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was that bored. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like, all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - You haven't watched the
animation of the decade. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Animation of the decade. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The reason why I watched Demon Slayer... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Excuse me but... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The reason why I watched Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was because I was not watching it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then suddenly on Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> dude episode 19, it was insane bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You won't believe it bro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the animation made my fucking
gave birth to my child bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fixed all of my age (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like I've never seen... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like the level of hype </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that must have been there for Jesus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like fucking resurrection bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> I've never seen so much hype
for something in my life. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that was the first time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've ever seen an anime
trending on Twitter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like fucking ninja was
like bruh I'm an anime fan </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> whole time fucking like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are we just gonna call it that now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the Jesus resurrection now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was the second coming of Jesus. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - I have probably made too
many religious references </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this podcast. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just think if people could
feel strongly about religion. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> But anyway, I watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the whole time I was
watching Demon Slayer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was unimpressed by everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was like, yes,
I'm waiting for episode 19. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm saving my nut for episode 19. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> And there was plenty
of really amazing like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Saving my nut. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like when you've
watched a porno right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You're saving your, you
know where the good bit is. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> We all do it right, let's
not pretend like we don't, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> everyone skips, you know
where the blow jobs starts </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and you skip. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's go to literally 10 minutes in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then let's skip again 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay do you watch the blow jobs in porn? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, you skip past it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you skip past it and then
they're already in like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you've gone too far </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they already fucking fully at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, you wanna get before
they just start that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's what it was right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> That's what it was. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you saying that episode 19 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was the post blow job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_10> - It was the post blow
job part of the plan. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> It was like the everything else. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> It was like you knew it was the blow job </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> so you're like I'm saving it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm saving the nut, I'm saving it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to save it because
if you get super hyped about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know better is coming on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't match. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sorry to the female
viewers who don't watch porn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or the male. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - We don't discriminate here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But what the fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah so what is your
opinion on Demon Slayer then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so I have-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's the blow job of the anime. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's an animation of the decade. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm not up to episode 19 yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> I think I'm right before that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Save that nut. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm saving the nut. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Save the nut. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's I think that's
one of the big reasons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> why I decided to not watch
it until much much later </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I didn't want that
hype to sway my opinion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course I mean like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll admit, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was everyone
was fucking talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> about at the time, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> It's definitely in the back of my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - You were unimpressed with
things because you're expecting </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to be impressed. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, because I'm expecting episode 19 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to be the one that nut to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be the nut. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be the nut, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm basically blue balls
for fucking 18 episodes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like it's coming,
I've got to hold on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a JV </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> where it's like 15 minutes of buildup. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is like but I think
that's why I wanted it to wait </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> until all the hype was over, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just so that the earliest
stuff doesn't fucking persuade </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how I see the actual show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want it to just go
into a completely clean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - And I feel sorry for
anyone who's doing that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> with Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's like, someday it's
gonna stop being popular. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's just not. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just not happening, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But also because the Manga is ending soon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or I think it's almost
at the end, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it has ended. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it has ended. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, so it has ended. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, okay, now
is probably the best time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to actually start watching it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just so that I can probably go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just read the Manga as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm that guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was just bored. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, all right
you know what, fuck it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll see what this show is all about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's good. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I enjoy it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's great. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's very-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's the cornflakes of
anime, you can't hate it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like it's cornflakes. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's very inoffensive. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, there there is nothing inherently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the show I dislike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just I mean, so far, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't fucking stand Zenitsu, I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he's just he's annoying.
- Who does? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There are lots of people.
- There are lots of people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are so many people
who simp for Zenitsu </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's just fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I guess 'cause I think a lot of people </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> can relate to the, yo, hold me back </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> because if I go set sicko mode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I unleash my true power, you're done son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think a lot of people
can relate to that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm a pussy but--
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - When my ultimate self cool
down you better better run bro. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the problem though is right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that I don't know if I'm just not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> as invested into showing in
characters as most people are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but just like I don't
really care about Zenitsu, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> right now, I still don't really
care about Inosuke that much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> maybe I'll (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I know people gonna be pissed about me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but like I feel like it is
literally My Hero Academia </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> with the skin like think about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In those case Bakugo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tanjiro is Deku, Zenitsu
is I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> An amalgamation of
probably some (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's the thing Demon Slayer
to me is solid it's just. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - So is My Hero Academia
like it's just another </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> solid show. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - But to be fair if I can't, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would rather watch Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - No same, is there a
tomahawk in Demon Slayer? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I need to know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No yeah, I mean the Demon Slayer-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No that we know of,
Manga reader Manga readers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - There probably is. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wanna find it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I feel like Demon
Slayer has just filled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that gap in that was the
beast bleach fan before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like you haven't
got to the later episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> where they basically introduce like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - A whole 70,000 characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, we basically have a soul society. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I do admit I'm way more invested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the world's building of Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than I am in My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's so much... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know the characters feel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the ones that we
don't know much about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seem so much more interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Whereas I don't give a
fuck about (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I don't think he's fun to watch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't even get that far. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's fucking boring. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like for me-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Human scrotum with powers. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I really really
enjoyed Hero Academia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then as more seasons came out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went from like loving it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, solid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - For me it's like I watched season one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And that was like should
I watch season two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then reflect it on like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't like season one
enough to go watch season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Then people like new season two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is when the tournament ark begins bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Way to a cool me . </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just like I don't
give a shit about-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Are you cut up on My
Hero Academia anime? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, I am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you like the last
season that just happened? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I did not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my fucking God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I was so bored. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like, I did not think
they built up the overload? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Overload? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's a a good villain. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Over something the plague doctor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> I didn't think they
built him up very well. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> And then the whole... </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> it was like literally the anime trope </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_03> where every single
episode had a flashback. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they won the fight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, for fuck sake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's what I hated about Naruto. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like cut back on the fucking flashback. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like my my favorite fight in
My Hero Academia to this day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is the first All Might vs Noumu fight </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like zero flashbacks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That shit was good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - In season one yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That to me sold me on the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was like zero flashbacks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> It was just a hero being a hero </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and now it's just not... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That was a clean nut. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And like other acts
there have been good points </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> in other acts but it hasn't taken me back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the love I felt at that point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's a good point I'll be honest, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I was as hyped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> for the all my verses or for one fight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Noumu Versus-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean all my verses was just like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - You knew he was gonna win. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, that was less about
the fight the fight itself, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> which is really fucking boring </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because they like, yeah
you had all for one. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> All right, a million fucking powers </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and he uses the same fucking attacks </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> five times in a row. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Literally me in a fighting game. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> X, X, X, X, X. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> He doesn't have the fucking combo sheet. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> How is he supposed to know it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> If you have all these powers, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> how the fuck do you know
what combos to gather? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - It's like mashing X and then every now </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> and then the triangle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's literally like when
you learn the one combo </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> that seems to be spammable. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's literally all for one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like he's case figured out three combos </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> that seem to work well. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> It's like I don't really wanna do that. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I don't think the
bubbles power up will go well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> with the photocopy power. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like smash play who
only spams the forward Smash. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> This will get the job done. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder if there
was ever a conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where he stole powers people like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but why did you steal that power? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I stole the power
to be permanently erect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like but why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Why did you steal that power? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll tell you what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> It's like the same syndrome you have </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> when you're like scrolling on Netflix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just have like
so many fucking powers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and your like fuck yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just rewatch the same
thing five times in a row. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I'll be honest, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I really fucking wanted All
Might to win that fight and die. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I wanted him to die as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that would have
been fucking legendary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, top 10 anime deaths. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would have said legendary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Legendary? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, he should have died. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought it would have
made like the next ark or so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because he's just kind
of chilling around now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Which is just kinda like
the boomer who's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, I was cool once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love hanging out with these kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure Manga readers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I say always with that
omnipotence knowledge and-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially the My Hero. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - That three 360 vision and hindsight. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm fucking one thing
my biggest pet peeve, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> is when you have like
a criticism of a show. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like up to that point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the Manga reader is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_10> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> - 10 volumes in, you'll see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Thank you Joey, thank you for that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - To me, it felt like hesitation </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> that he didn't kill All Might. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_04> Because he'd been building up
All Might's frail ass like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> poison ridden body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't look at me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come on.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like he built up how frail
and how he was dying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why didn't he kill him there
at the peak right like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, to me he should. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe because he was too
much of a beloved character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that was
probably he was scared to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know maybe the
again the Manga readers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> forgot why actually the some you know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Definitely that scene
would have definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hit me harder if he had died. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because it also would
have made endeavors like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when he becomes the hero, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> in the next arc, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that would have made
that even more impactful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> because he's the only one left now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Right and he never got to
show All Might that right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are we going on a fucking fanfic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> of My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I wanted him to die. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> He shouldn't fucking died, kill All Might. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me rewrite My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is how it's supposed to be done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm a writer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So let let me fix your art. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Stop getting banned in China. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Let me fix it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm a writer, hire me Horikoshi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know like this stuff like that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that I don't have fucking
I'm losing interest </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in My Hero Academia by the season. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't think I would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because one thing I was super hyped about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when it first started airing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And right now I think I
like Black Clover more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't--
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Did I just say something blasphemous? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How can a man be so brave. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - You have made the Black Clover
fandom extremely happy now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You've given them validation
where there wasn't. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Recognition. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here's your validation everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now because I feel
like with Black Clover, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just so much fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just this is the pure
show and fun I was looking for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And with My Hero Academia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like it's trying
to go for greatness. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like it's trying to build-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's going for the long con. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's going for long con. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's trying to build
up so many great points </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and great characters, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but it's just doing a lot of things </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that is just not keeping
my interest as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Okay, what the fuck was that last arc </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in My Hero Academia season four as well </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> with the villain who
I can't even remember, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> the fucking magician </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - The British guy basically.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - He's whole quack </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Is that like, he? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> What is it like he drinks tea? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't actually think that's his quack. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> But all he does is drink tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_10> He can make things into... </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> He's basically Hisoka. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_04> He makes things into rubber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Wow. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he drinks tea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's also his big thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is that he's like really picky about tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this how he like
envisions British people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because yes, that's actually true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean just felt like a filler arc. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That wasn't actually filler. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I know people are gonna
be mad at me because yeah-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm looking forward to the
comments on this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - They enjoyed the school
festival and everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_10> but I was just not invested
enough in the side characters </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> to really give a shit
about the school festival </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> and the villain was just
fucking weak sources fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I don't give a shit about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that entire arc was just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna forget that one
when season five ends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I wonder is My
Hero Academia trying </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to go for like a 10 year run here </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> or do you think it's gonna be like-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel with just how successful it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm sure people have shown it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Well, because I think
the people have shown </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in jump they want a-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - A One Piece replacement. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, not so much One Piece replacement </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but they want something that will line up </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> with One Piece for a while </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because we've currently had
Demon Slayer just ended, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Haikyu just ended. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Is One Piece gonna end anytime soon? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, Oda said that it'll
end in the next five years, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but who the fuck, it's Oda. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - In One Piece years that's pretty soon. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's One Piece that's really soon, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's been gone for like 25 years. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm wondering as a fan </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> who has been watching My
Hero from the start, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> How, like, do they really
expect someone to be </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> into a show for 10 years? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been into One
Piece for over 10 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've been into One Piece
for as long as I've read it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like when One Piece ends-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think my mom gave up like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> be interested in me after like, eight. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, she fucking birthed me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs)
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - When One Piece ends I'm
gonna cry like nobody. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I'm gonna fucking
cry when One Piece ends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause that's like a
huge part of my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's just gone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Yeah, it's just like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> your pet dying or something. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I guess I did watch like Game of Thrones </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> for like, 10 years.
- 10 years? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Well it's eight seasons, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they took like, two years and last-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, think about-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - And that was the worst ending
I've ever had in my life. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean think about the amount
of people who fucking cried </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when Harry Potter ended. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And that show had been going off... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Well, not show but like that book series </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had been going on for
like fuck knows how long. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - True, I guess I underestimate, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I guess when you say be
interested in this for 10 years. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It sounds hard. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> But then in real life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's very much not like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like every day you're like, I'm caring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw on Twitter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's actually some
people who are like yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I fucking love One Piece ever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but that's their </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> only personality trait, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Your Tinder profile, I like One Piece. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, we're meant to be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like seeing even something like Naruto </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seeing the characters grow up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> and I'm like kind of like
growing up with the characters. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I shit on Boruto and everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but some of those first few episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where you see Naruto as a
dad, you see Sasuke as a dad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, the same thing happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with fucking Avatar The
Last Airbender ended right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the first
episode on Korra was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my God, Katara is old now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then after the first episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, alright, I don't fucking care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love Korra. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought Korra was kind of mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - You fucking love that word. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I left it at four seasons. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Was it four seasons?
- Of Korra? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No, I think it was three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I lived all of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> People had the complaints, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, because I never grew up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> on Avatar the Last Airbender.
- Me neither. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I only just recently watched it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> like in the last couple of years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, me too.
- Avatar is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually still haven't seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, it's fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I completely understand the hype now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then I was Korra and I
was like, this doesn't hit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> This doesn't hit different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like a great anime kind of feel. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> But also has that comfort of
a Saturday morning cartoon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's really like in a sweet spot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The jokes are like very campy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I've ever heard you talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about something as endearing
as you just talked about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - So comfortable about
really like takes you, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like how you felt. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I imagined when I say like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> imagine when you were
trading Yu-Gi-Oh cards </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with your friends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, man that was fun, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can totally understand why people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just isn't into it today
as they were back then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It really is like, encapsulated </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> and captured it like like
time capsule of like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just that feeling. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, when you watch it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you can't help but get that feeling. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Gentlemen, we all know a
VPN protects all privacy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_10> No one's doubting that. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> And our security online, right? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> But I didn't know this until recently. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> And it's taken my TV watching
game to the next level. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Tell me more. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> - You can use a VPN to unlock movies </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and shows that are only
available in other countries. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, I got so excited. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I forgot to even mention that this episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was sponsored by ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gentlemen over the weekend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used ExpressVPN to binge
Doctor Who on the UK Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - No fucking way. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was simple, Garnt. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Simple.
- How simple? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I just fired up ExpressVPN app, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> change my location to
the UK refresh Netflix. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> And that was it.
- That was so easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you're telling me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that ExpressVPN hides your
IP address unless you control </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> where you want the sites
to think you're located? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's exactly it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, I had no idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not only that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you can choose from
almost 100 different countries </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> more than 99. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's 100 more than zero. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's 100 more than zero. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's double fifty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So just think about all
the Netflix libraries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can go through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll give you a clue how many libraries. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's 100. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Guys i have a question. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Do you love anime? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get outta here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do I love anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you love anime, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> - Did you know that
you can use Express VPN </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> to access Japanese Netflix
and be spirited away? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that an anime reference? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would definitely need
that in my position right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Garnt, it's not just Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ExpressVPN works with
any streaming service, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> Hulu, Hulu, BBC iPlayer. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> YouTube, you name it. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> It can do it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Fix my marriage, it can do it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, listen, boys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there are hundreds of VPNs out
there I'm sure we all know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - BUt the reason I use ExpressVPN </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and the reason why you boys use ExpressVPN </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is to watch shows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's just so ridiculously fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How fast Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's never any buffering or lag </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and you can stream in HD. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No problemmo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - No jokes aside actually it is good. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> This VPN is also compatible
with all of your devices, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> phones, media consoles,
smart TVs, and more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So you can watch what you want on the go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or on the big screen, wherever you are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wherever?
- Whenever Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Damn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And if you go to
expressvpn.com/trashtaste right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can get an extra three free months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Three free months? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Three, that's a lot of frees. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Not three, I don't what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So support the show,

<SPEAKER_06> link's in the description below. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Check yourself and protect

<SPEAKER_05> - I'll tell you what else
I've been watching recently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been catching up to
Re:Zero season two as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Me too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is like going back,
how many episodes ago? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where we're just like we're
gonna get back to Re:Zero. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Here you go fans. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> We're getting back to Re:Zero. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The amount of memes
that came out of that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Just one minute later,
don't fucking, the internet </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> one minute is nothing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Can I just laugh at something? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Why is Garfiel a big orange cat? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never thought of that before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> - He literally turns
into a big orange cat. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Have you watched Re:Zero season two? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this one character called Garfiel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not, Garfield, Garfiel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garfiel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garfiel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he turns into-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - A big orange cat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A big orange cat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Probably hates Mondays. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Loves lasagna. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just I had to like
pause it when this like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, spoilers reserved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when he just starts murdering people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This cat is just this
fucking chunky Garfield. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Murdering people. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now I wanna watch this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Damn what timeline happened
to Garfield when he died bro? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's on a Monday probably. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like you should
Re:Zero season two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's fucking amazing-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's great.
- I need to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I feel like,
have you seen season one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I feel like we go back
to our conversation earlier, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> season one set up the
world really, really well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then it I knew it had the
potential to go even further. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And I feel like Re:Zero season two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is definitely hitting that potential. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, like one thing I really liked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is how in like the first
few episodes of season two, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> there were just no deaths. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It was just building up this character. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like with what happened to
Subaru in the first few episodes. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That was fucking genius. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because it managed to
build up Subaru's character </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in a way that hadn't been like done before </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and really just explore who he is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and why he acts the way he does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, because they built up </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> this almost very childish
mindset that he had, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that we often see in anime
characters, especially Isekai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they kind of just
deconstructed it in season two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which was amazing because it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate this fucking incel
and then they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> here's the reason why he didn't say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and why he's going to change. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - I respect that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nice, I like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I've only I've only
heard the greatest things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - 'Cause season one when you saw people </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> who were like, dude, I relate to Subaru. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, what's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The fuck (indistinct)
(laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it's great because it's basically, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they built that all up to be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, now he's a shady character, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna teach him why needs to change. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why those kind of behavior </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm doing all this
for Amelia is toxic. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> As it would be. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fucking simping for Amelia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's really interesting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I realized what they were first doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I started to enjoy it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So they're using the whole reset thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a way to like slowly build
up this one kind of thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're stuck in right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought it was
fucking annoying at first, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I wanted them to leave the sanctuary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I really liked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how they're just slowly been
building up through the resets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And you get a piece by piece, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it feels like almost
like a murder mystery. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Where you're kind of
getting little information. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's you built it up really well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, I'm just
really into it right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm so hyped for it guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have no qualms with that right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like I'm actually way more
into it than I was season one. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Season one, I very much enjoy. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Actually, I do have a
thing that I don't like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Where the fuck is Rem? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I want my bitch back, bro. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She's just kind of gone but-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's how basic she's bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But we better get like a
full blow job with her back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imma say it.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Everybody is gonna be like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> who is that character
Connor is talking about? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct)
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why would you still miss Rem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when this perfect specimen of a beauty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> has been introduced to the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't get over echidnas.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because she has a four penises? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, she has four penises. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you wanna explain
why that's the case, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it was a meme that
I saw in the Sonic fanbase. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always a Sonic fanbase </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they're like Knuckles
has four penis heads. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then apparently if
you go into Wikipedia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you look up like an actual echidnas, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the animal that's something
that Knuckles is based off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, echidnas have four penises. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay, I will admit
she's a top tier Waifu. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> She's definitely pulling away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> She broke Subaru down. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - She like when she got introduced. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She just fucking I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was some Re:Zero girls liked, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then there was Beatrice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> and then she just came along </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and destroyed everything. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's literally that meme
with the car drifting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> Like going straight and turning. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> It's like Amelia drifting to echidnas. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_01> One short episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will admit, it's tempting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But as a Knight of Rem, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> my loyalties cannot be swayed goddammit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_10> - Your not my queen. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm like I was clowning earlier </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> about how I'll get serious about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then I literally now do this,
I do not portray my queen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> If I don't trust men who sway
this simping, you're weak. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Pick a wife and simp goddammit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Swaying Waifu is such a weak mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It such a weak mindset. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You would be a terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you even like about Rem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - She's like crouton to the salad, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's always the best fucking part. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The crunchiest part that you can never... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You don't have to worry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about the amount of dressing on them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, Rem never fails
to just be there, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like Rem is just there, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean?
- I don't know man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Rem came through, she murdered him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's hot first of all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she kind ofm she became Owoo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I kind of opened to that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen I'm not gonna lie I'm
very struggling to remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just remember that
she was loyal to death, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was very endearing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> How many times do we get Waifus, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That put their heart
on the line like that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And God's like won't blink, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> bring out the note. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me bring out the massive list </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of literally probably
90% of Waifus out there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - But I feel like those Waifus, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they wanted to get the result, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they wanted to be the chosen one. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Whereas Rem confessed knowing full well </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> she was never gonna be picked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's something I
can respect about that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know about that one, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Obviously I haven't
watched enough harem anime </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> 'cause that's like every other girl. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - They say that's what they like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know you won't pick me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like in the back of the head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They don't wanna be picked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now Rem totally did it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> was just like Chad like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I know you're not gonna pick me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but I fucking love you
and that's okay, king. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That's what I love about Rem, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that's when that single time </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when she confessed I'm like-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Didn't she go on an entire spiel of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how she wants like a
family and stuff and like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Do you think I fucking remember that? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And she's like I want three kids </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> in a cottage in the hills like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did she, what the fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I remember something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - She pretty set in stone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - That was definitely like
a flash forward or something </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> where she had kids with Subaru. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Practice you pull out game then, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean is fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, that's fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If it fails you can just reset. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - You're like shit I hope that checkpoint </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> was over a month ago. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Gonna be real awkward. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - She comes back with like the results. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - You go back to your checkpoint, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like two weeks your like,
shit, she's still pregnant. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like fuck go back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> - You're fucking awful people. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - I'm sure there's a fucking dude. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I can't remember I'll be honest. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I cannot remember-- </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - To me like just-- </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Does like all the knights </SPEAKER_10>

<SPEAKER_09> Like shit why are we fighting? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know, I've been
doing it for like 10 years. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I just keep fighting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but that's such a weak mindset. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's a weak mindset bro. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - A weak mindset is swaying </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> with the wind Garnt like you do. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And you Joey. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I haven't swayed yet,

<SPEAKER_09> - We'll see. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Honestly, I was never like always-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Joey is literally that meme of the guy. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I was in the Beatrice camp because-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because you like kids.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - We bringin it there are we Connor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We bringing it there. </SPEAKER_06>

your honor that she was-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - This is the problem right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Let's say your wife who is Beatrice </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> or she's fucking Shinobu.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - You go into the movies, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - You turn up to the fucking restaurant. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> Table for two. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> This is my Waifu down here. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> We're gonna sit and hold hands. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Come to the table. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't stand the looks I'm
gonna get at that restaurant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> When I sit down with my fucking
10 year old at the table </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and we're playing footsies. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Here's a thing, first of all, she's 890, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but second of all-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Waiter can she drink? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She's 890.
- Yeah of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> No, but here's the thing is that like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> at least my viewing of
like my enemy Waifus </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I like them
because they're not real. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you know what I'm saying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your honor--
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - We've gone full circle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like them like I don't
want them to be real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you want a 10 page
thesis on Waifu theory? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can give you a 10 page
thesis on Waifu philosophy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay right now, like I don't want </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my enemy Waifu to be real </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's going back to
the whole maid cafe thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's like you-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why do you like kids Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's going back to the
whole maid cafe thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's like I like
it because it's not real </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the moment it becomes real, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then you realize, shit, this is not cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you be happy with someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if they fucking murdered
you in a past life? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, you know
what, we're cool now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're loyal to me now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you did fucking
murder me that one time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You did fucking like chop off my legs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and fucking beat me to death, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like three times or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - If it was hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's not like some
people's kink, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like it's like flat lining, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but not coming back. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's just like, just
actually fucking dying. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are we gonna find you
in like (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - People are gonna think
I'm into some weird, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> but I assure you-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're gonna walk up
to your fucking life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - And we're gonna walk
up to your dead body </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and just gonna have the
biggest smile on your face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're gonna be like died by like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> asphyxiation with like 10 stab wounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and you got like, a big smile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I am fortunately I'm pretty vanilla </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but I love the idea of the kink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I don't
understand about people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the idea of these
weird things that you could do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> that I never wanna do. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You don't want it to be real. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But so you're okay with it not being real. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's that's how I see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - You're okay with it with loosing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> It's such a weak mindset. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're okay with it not being real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> You're okay with not growing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's what I've never
understood about people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> who like say that fucking you
know Gasai is their Waifu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they openly are like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> I'd love it if she was
my actual girlfriend. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm like, no you
wouldn't, you would not. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> You would not wanna
fucking murderous bitch </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> as your fucking girlfriend. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> - As an idea Yandere
can be hot, as an idea. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - But obviously in real life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It won't be hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Absolutely not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, personally, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I found Gasai like annoying as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was no hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That was just like, fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> The girl I preferred in Mirai Nikki </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> was the fucks the one with the eyepatch. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - That chic, I found her way more-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I like that chic as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I found her way more hot than Yuno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck zero murders I want terrorists. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just give me a terrorist Waifu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mirai Nikki, I was
actually recommending like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so my Japanese tutor,
she's a Japanese woman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she like, takes my anime
recommendations as like gospel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> So I've seen--
- That's your first mistake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've slowly been recommending her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like worse and worse anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and she started off really into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I wanted to see
how much she lied to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_10> - Because I told her to
watch the Future Diary. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why it came up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't particularly like it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think anyone over
the age of 12 can like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No it's very weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - And so she watched it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> I need to think of another one. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I recommended Rent A Girlfriend to her </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but I'm sure she'll pick now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got to recommend her something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's similar to that but just worse. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - What's worse? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Recommend like Heavy Object. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I haven't even fucking watched that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - 'Cause that's made by the
same person as Mira Nikki </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's a million times worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't watched that yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, it's so bad. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm gonna recommend you-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're gonna recommend next? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Higurashi but in dubs
I'm gonna recommend that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like no you have to watch it dubbed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so much better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause actual like when they cry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_05> - I recently rewatched Higurashi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - So I watched Higurashi
dub, cause this is back </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when I never watched
dub, because I was like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> no I have to watch dub. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I used to watch on a website
called watch cartoons online. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember that website. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Throwback Thursday. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - I always used to be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you mean there's no dub? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like cause I refuse to watch
Attack on Titan for a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is why I just got into
anime like I don't wanna read. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fucking read. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though I've been watching... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've watched every single fucking film </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that Jet Li was in, in subtitles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why I drew the line-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every Jackie Chan movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'd gone through like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> all of Jet Li and Donnie Yen
and Jackie Chan filmography, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I fucking love them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, but, fuck what was I saying? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Maylene fucking distracted me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were talking about-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I watched Higurashi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause fucking Glass
Reflection recommended it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like cool I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't watch the full video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I didn't want to watch the review. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Later on on the video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think he says don't want you to dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's fucking terrible, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, well that would
have been nice to know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Because I watched this thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This is awful. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_10> Why is it called When They Cry? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never actually seen a dub. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's terrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think there's one good voice actress </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in the entire thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she stands out so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's carrying it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, which character?
- I think it's Shion. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the fucking
like the one teammate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> on league who isn't (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Please just group, I can do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now I need to watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love watching horrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really wish that the license
was in Limbo for the dubs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We could just watch it live
on Twitch, no problems, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I would love to do like
we'll watch Higurashi live. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That'd be so fucking--
- That'd be amazing. . </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> But yeah, Higurashi dubs sucks. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that's okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because the new ones coming out soon, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> so yeah remake-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which I'm honestly excited for. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It seems like there's a lot... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, you've done your
seasonal video already. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This seems to be getting back on track </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the just amount of anime that's-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Just coming full circle, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like just redo all the good shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, they did it with (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they fucking nailed that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean it kind of like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> doing the Hollywood thing now, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I hope it doesn't get to the point where-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's just remake everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I don't mind the remakes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I really hope it doesn't get to the point </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where one third of the
season is just remakes. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because I'm gonna be like, fuck. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well remember, like the on the trip </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that we just came back
from and we're hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and they'd remade the first episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Detective Conan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So we were sitting in a hotel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we would turn on the
TV and lo and behold, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> there was anime on the TV. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And people were just
like there's anime on TV. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Without subtitles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> How do I watch this without subtitles? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was an episode of Detective Conan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was like, obviously new animation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we don't religiously
follow Detective Conan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so we watched it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, this must be the new episode-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and I'm like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then the more we watched it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were like, wait, hold on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know what's gonna happen next. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the first episode just remade. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just felt like Subaru at that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know what's gonna happen
he's gonna kick that globe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just watch him kick the globe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then Joey's like, nah
this isn't the first episode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like new animations like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch him kick the globe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> He kicked the globe and at that point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> we realized it was just a remake. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Joey we started doing
this like mad rain man thing </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where it started like,
Joey was like, alright, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and then this is gonna happen. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they're like gonna
get in the roller coaster. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like exact things, like Joey
this is just fucking weird. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're gonna get into the tunnel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> He's gonna get the water go on his cheek </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> then he come out the heads
gonna be decapitated. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like the Pro Zd video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> where he just recycle the
Peter Pan or something. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> We were just sitting there fucking-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Drinking our beer like Joey stop, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> this not a fucking talk show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't even like
Detective Conan that much. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> But for some reason that
first episode just sticks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my mind so fucking much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I surprised myself I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well, I actually got that right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I am before the comments accusing Joey </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> of being a high functioning autistic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> With it with Detective Conan episode one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am a high functioning autist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I know exactly what
happens with everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I knew exactly what happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like scene for scene.
- It was worrying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - And I hadn't seen that first
episode in over 10 years. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> So I surprised myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Joey with one beer
fully unlocks his brain. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - To using 100% of my
brain power for that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's exactly how it works. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Is there anything else you
guys have been watching? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, I have to
watch Higurashi dub now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, I haven't been watching anything, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> just been reading Manga. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've been reading
Manga as well actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, what you reading? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a new Manga
I discovered recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's called... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's it called again? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Records of Ragnarok.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's only like 30 chapters old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But my God it is fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So to describe what it's about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically, it's it's what the God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of high school anime
should have been right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It starts off with just a tournament talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just been tournament
talk this entire time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the premise is that
basically imagine like all Gods </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in every culture has like this council </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and every few 1000 years
they just basically vote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on whether they should
wipe out humanity or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so this time.
- So 2020. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So in the first chapter
they just decide yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> humanity is kind of fucked right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so let's just put them out their misery. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is that fucking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaking foreign language)
Valkyrie or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't recognize the English title. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't recognize your
peasant English name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you had to get
no because I was about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to say that exact same anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then you explaining I'm like, no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this sounds like the one
I'm about to talk about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We are talking about the same show here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This sounds pretty fucking cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so then so then like
the Valkyries come along </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, let's give humanity a chance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe they're not total pieces of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe give them a chance
to defend themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and so she suggests that they just do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking massive tournament arc-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - As you do with humans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's like a tournament
arc of some of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most famous humans of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> And like the most famous Gods of all time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- So fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's basically just fate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but just its fate combined with Baki. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That's that's probably the
best way to explain, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it's It's so fucking over the top </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and the first chapter just
starts a tournament arc, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> and you just have two
contestants coming out </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and just banging the shit out
of each other immediately. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> (indistinct) in the UK. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, but unlike unlike
God of High School, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you actually get like the
backstories and everyone's story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as they start fighting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you throwing shade
Garnt are you throwing shade? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I am throwing shade. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I'm currently
reading through that right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm at the Adam Versus Zeus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Adam Versus Zeus. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like Adam and Eve. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Adam and Zeus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Did he eat the fucking apple? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he has an apple
in his mouth constantly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's fucking great, so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Adam is so fucking op. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause is this fucking like
chad as fuck like massive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Is this like a tea list
and enough's incoming? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because like the appeal of it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is that everyone's fucking op, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like you get the backstory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about how they became op. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like a Baki backstory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where everyone has done
something fucking ridiculous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with their lives </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then as you fighting it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they like kind of one up each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like overpowered powers and attacks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's yeah Adam Versus Zeus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> felt like a season finale fight </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's the second fight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the second fight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the second fucking fight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's only volume two of I
think currently eight volumes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think the one I'm reading right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> is Hercules Versus Jack the Ripper. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I was gonna ask is
there Jack the Ripper, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> there's always a fucking Jack the Ripper. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> There's always a fucking
dude who murdered people. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> It's not anything impressive. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - People don't even know
if he actually existed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, now that fight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hercules Versus Jack the
Ripper is fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I don't know, just I love I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I say this with every fucking Manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I recommend but I fucking love the art. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it's something so, it's gritty, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's also so inoffensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it's just like a great showman. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just love how postable it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like they have no filler. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> No, it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know you here for fights. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Here's the fight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We'll give you the backstory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So don't fucking worry about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's a hype matchup </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and let's just fucking go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Chapter one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when the fight finishes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you get like zero downtime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Immediately goes to the next one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - The only thing that's
bad about it right now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that there are only 30 chapters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's pretty much the only downside, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel about it right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I reckon though if
that ever gets animated, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and it probably will
considering that it's really big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just really hope that
they don't fucking stretch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that shit out like they did with Baki. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wish that they would
just maintain that pace. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - To be fair Baki is pretty
faster with its fights. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but also they
throw in a load of bullshit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> that the market didn't have. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - But then again the Manga
also has like some bullshit </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> in it where it's like I didn't need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to know about it's like this like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking Mohammed Ali Jr. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Is like that his backstory
is like 30 chapters long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you see him fight
for like two chapters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Are we about to on a tangent about Baki? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't think we have
enough time to go-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - We don't have time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - We need like a full episode for Baki. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We can do a full episode on Baki. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Baki is great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Read it or watch it
before we talk about it . </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We need to get John on the podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just dedicate the episode to Baki. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah.
- My God. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, that's great. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - As you guys know, I've
been reading Eyeshield 21. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, Eyeshield 21. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know it's great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's odd is (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct) is a God yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like there's some panels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like just blow you away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause like every like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's an American football Manga. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the rough squad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a bunch of the crazy characters and-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're the rough around
the edges kind of characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and team captain is a fucking
psychopath and is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought he was the villain
when he was first introduced. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - He looks like the villain, doesn't he? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But he's amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Anyway, the whole Manga super endearing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> The story is really unpredictable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you really have no
idea what's gonna happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just oh my God the op. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So if you don't know Murata Yusuke </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> to use get he did the op for One Punch Man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not the original. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The redrawing, the good one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like there's a panel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like said crazy
character does a throw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And he like he like do
an illustration of him. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like as like a fucking
God throwing a ball. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like a two page spread
and it's fucking beautiful. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I love about that Manga </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no other sports Manga has
managed to match Eyeshield in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_10> is the fucking visual metaphors. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Visual metaphors is why this
Manga just works so well. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, they like oh my God. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> There's so many like-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - The first time I saw him
do the fucking devil bat goes </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I didn't know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> I fucking nutted.
(chuckles) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, that is the coolest
fucking thing I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's just like the whole, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> if you haven't read Eyeshield 21 </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and you're not into anime. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I fucking thing American football </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> is the most boring sport on earth. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But the Manga is so good. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - That Manga got me
into American football. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like that's how I learned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the rules of American football. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And after that Manga I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can watch American football now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, it's almost perfect-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are gonna talk about that one thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay, there's this whole. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> This is all I don't know
if they appear again. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm about two thirds of the way through. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Maybe they appear in the end again. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So an American team comes over </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and there's a black guy </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and his superpower is that
he's just black, I guess. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And that's his whole thing
is that he's super powered </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because he's black. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And that's why he's a great player. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's just kind of like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when was the Manga made? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was Golden Age, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> It was mid 2000s. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like mid 2000s.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I guess mid 2000s and you
could kind of see what-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean it was around the same year </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> as the questionable Gantz episode. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's like the the
American teams manager </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> hates black people because he
was replaced by a black player </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the NFL.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then he refers to
like, he's just horrible, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> he refers to them as monkeys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> It's so uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like the most bare
bones exploration of racism. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I guess that's why it's like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I guess it would be
uncomfortable in real life. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But, it's so like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> what someone would think racism is like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and know what it is like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Then it's like, it's just
kind of like, (indistinct) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just kind of like, yikes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're reading it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> it's just one big yikes. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just so funny to
me that the superpower, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he has no other superpower
apart from just being black. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, it's just a mutually agreed fighter </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in the Eyeshield world. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Black people are just like, Superman. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there's so many fucking panels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> I screenshotted a bunch, where
they're just talking about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> how it's like a superpower. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> And I was just reading it
with my jaw on the ground. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, holy fuck, this is a thing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's poli age Manga panels. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> If there's a Twitter account for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like all of Africa </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has just a buff in this universe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like everyone else, it's just nerfed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a line and I'll
set the screenshot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Without a black men
strong yet flexible body, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> it is impossible to
make that kind of play. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> This is natural born sprinter, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> muscles that only black people have. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think it's the... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not sure if this is
the official translation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna look at it in Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but I assume it's just as bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just a massive you read it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, okay, it's just one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe they won't keep doing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> And they kept doing it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah--
- But I guarantee-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - That aside, it is an amazing Manga. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> And I know some people probably argue, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> you shouldn't forgive that. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> It's like it's fucking 2000s Japan </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they didn't fucking know any of that shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - There were lots of Manga
doing stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - They were never expose to it, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I get it they wanna touch on it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> but it's like I just
fucking speed on that point. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there's like worse way to be viewed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than just being good at being a fucking-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - At least they didn't like,
straight up, drop the N bomb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - At least they were
subtle about it in a sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If they dropped the N bomb, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> they were like, alright, yeah, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe it's time we talk
about this but you know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's just a yikes to
read and your like okay. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like one little phone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's just hurts a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because you wanna recommend it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and you want to tell how amazing it is. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you just gotta be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's just this one thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's one thing you should be careful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is an amazing Manga just be prepared </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you get to that part. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This episode Of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_06>
