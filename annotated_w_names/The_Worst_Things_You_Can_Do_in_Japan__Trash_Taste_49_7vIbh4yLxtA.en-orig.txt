<connor> i feel like 50 of the items you own you </connor>
<connor> never use think about but you you think </connor>
<joey> you need them yeah yeah yeah you also </joey>
<joey> never see them either because they're </joey>
<connor> like either put in a closet or like you </connor>
<joey> know kind of out of sight somewhere </joey>
<connor> right but like you have like a colander </connor>
<joey> like you need a colander but like you </joey>
<joey> don't really think about it until you </joey>
<connor> you start using it or there you're like </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] do i do </joey>
<joey> we have like we have this like shaved </joey>
<garnt> ice machine that uh i think i think </garnt>
<garnt> meline got it for us </garnt>
<garnt> but uh we we had it for like the last </garnt>
<garnt> summer because melia was like oh i want </garnt>
<garnt> to like come to your guys's place and </garnt>
<joey> like the girls can have like a kind of </joey>
<joey> girls like day and we can just make </joey>
<joey> shaved ice or whatever never used it </joey>
<joey> yeah that's oh we do okay we used to </joey>
<joey> once </joey>
<joey> we used it once and it's just this huge </joey>
<joey> brick of a thing that's just like </joey>
<joey> sitting in the kitchen i'm like okay why </joey>
<garnt> is this here </garnt>
<garnt> there's always that one draw in every </garnt>
<garnt> kitchen right that is just the unused </garnt>
<garnt> appliance drawer right where it's just </garnt>
<garnt> these appliances that people give you as </garnt>
<garnt> gifts or that you think is going to be </garnt>
<garnt> cool when you host like that dinner </garnt>
<garnt> party that never happens and then </garnt>
<garnt> there's just these like random </garnt>
<garnt> appliances that just get put into this </garnt>
<garnt> drawer and you forget you even have </garnt>
<joey> exactly exactly </joey>
<connor> we have like forks </connor>
<connor> use my hands </connor>
<connor> yeah well i i uh i got um this kind of </connor>
<connor> cleaning service thing because okay </connor>
<joey> one thing okay we're immediately going </joey>
<joey> to go on to this is one thing i hate </joey>
<joey> about japan throwing away trash right </joey>
<joey> okay and especially the big trash yeah </joey>
<joey> right because like in australia </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> just pick myself but um because like i </connor>
<connor> don't know about in the uk but in </connor>
<connor> australia we have like this thing i </connor>
<connor> think it happens once every two or three </connor>
<joey> months uh it's called like council clean </joey>
<joey> up day so basically what we do is we </joey>
<joey> take huge appliances like couches beds </joey>
<joey> you know drawers all that kind of stuff </joey>
<joey> yeah and we literally just throw it out </joey>
<joey> in front of the street like just onto </joey>
<joey> the street </joey>
<joey> and basically it's you know you throw it </joey>
<connor> out </connor>
<connor> um people can kind of walk around and </connor>
<connor> just you know grab stuff if they want </connor>
<connor> like if they think oh you know i can i </connor>
<connor> think two to three months it's like </connor>
<connor> every two to three months or something </connor>
<connor> i've never seen this really </connor>
<joey> in australia yeah it happens i i don't </joey>
<joey> know if maybe that's just like the area </joey>
<garnt> yeah in the uk in the uk i don't think </garnt>
<connor> there's enough space to just throw oh i </connor>
<joey> think japan </joey>
<connor> we just throw stuff out and then big </connor>
<connor> garbage truck basically comes and </connor>
<connor> collects all the stuff that doesn't get </connor>
<joey> picked up after like a week i think </joey>
<joey> right um japan doesn't work like that so </joey>
<joey> like we had to throw away our bed which </joey>
<joey> is like a queen size bed yeah uh a couch </joey>
<joey> and like a couple of tables and like a </joey>
<joey> sofa and stuff like that a lot of big </joey>
<joey> stuff but like you can't just throw it </joey>
<joey> out with the rest of the trash you have </joey>
<joey> to either you have to go to your like </joey>
<joey> local council and be like i want to </joey>
<joey> throw this stuff away and they give you </joey>
<joey> these like tickets that you have to pay </joey>
<joey> for yeah to basically be like all right </joey>
<joey> i'm throwing this out on this day and </joey>
<joey> then you throw it out onto this you have </joey>
<connor> to book it and tell them you have to </connor>
<connor> book it i need to tell the exact </connor>
<joey> measurements of the thing so yeah and </joey>
<joey> plan out or what i found out is you can </joey>
<joey> just there's just services out there </joey>
<joey> that you can just call up and be like i </joey>
<joey> want to throw all this crap away how </joey>
<joey> much is it to get rid of yeah yeah a </joey>
<joey> little more expensive than like the </joey>
<joey> whole council thing but </joey>
<garnt> so much easier </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's it's not a price for me it's </garnt>
<garnt> like like we talked about last week it's </garnt>
<garnt> just getting the paperwork done yeah </garnt>
<joey> that like [ __ ] i'm scared of yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly and like i'm not even finished </joey>
<garnt> with the [ __ ] paperwork too because </garnt>
<garnt> we have to do more after we move yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because japan is just like a </garnt>
<joey> never-ending sea of paperwork </joey>
<joey> but like i was like okay i'm getting rid </joey>
<joey> of this giant bed i'm getting rid of </joey>
<joey> this couch this table all these like big </joey>
<joey> appliances yeah and i'm like okay well </joey>
<joey> these are the big things gone so you </joey>
<joey> know maybe like </joey>
<joey> 30 of my belongings probably gone it's </joey>
<connor> more like three percent </connor>
<connor> i feel like in like your bedroom or </connor>
<connor> office there's so many little things you </connor>
<joey> just never think about especially my </joey>
<joey> office yeah and my office is so many </joey>
<joey> little things i'm just like i'm </joey>
<joey> i'm well first of all i'm looking </joey>
<joey> forward to like the moving company </joey>
<joey> coming in and seeing like all of like my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] skateboards and [ __ ] like that </joey>
<connor> just being like whoa they'll be like oh </connor>
<joey> is that is that a rem eight one eighth </joey>
<joey> scale </joey>
<joey> giving them a tour of your house you're </joey>
<connor> like yeah so this is this is the joker </connor>
<joey> it's a free office store </joey>
<joey> actually to be fair when the moving guy </joey>
<joey> first came in to like check to see what </joey>
<garnt> we had he walked into my office and he </garnt>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<garnt> whoa </garnt>
<joey> otaku's dream he's like wow jesus this </joey>
<connor> guy's gonna [ __ ] collect like the </connor>
<joey> opposite happen where like </joey>
<joey> i i i only use my tatami room to filming </joey>
<joey> and i only use it so i have a big tatami </joey>
<garnt> room that i normally do the cosplay </garnt>
<garnt> videos in yeah yeah pretty bad so i </garnt>
<garnt> never clean them up after i just leave </garnt>
<joey> the cosplays there until i do the next </joey>
<joey> video and then i clean it up uh </joey>
<joey> and then one time they didn't tell me </joey>
<joey> they were doing this but there was like </joey>
<joey> uh they were checking like the fire </joey>
<joey> alarms in the building right and i was </joey>
<joey> like yeah sure come in come in and he's </joey>
<joey> going around my house he goes into my </joey>
<joey> office you know he looks he's like oh </joey>
<joey> i'm like yeah i like jojo </joey>
<joey> he just looked at me like i was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> weird and i was like all right thanks </joey>
<joey> buddy </joey>
<joey> and then and then as he went to like my </joey>
<joey> tatami room i was like oh [ __ ] i just </joey>
<joey> remembered that all my [ __ ] was in there </joey>
<joey> and so like i i go in to check that he's </joey>
<joey> there and this man is just standing in </joey>
<joey> the middle of like my cosplay everywhere </joey>
<joey> this this stuff reached holding up </joey>
<joey> something to the fire alarm just looking </joey>
<joey> like look down don't look </joey>
<joey> don't look at anything </joey>
<joey> and then after this guy left really </joey>
<joey> awkwardly an hour later someone else </joey>
<joey> came along from the same company in the </joey>
<joey> building and did the exact same thing </joey>
<joey> right yeah and i was like wait why am i </joey>
<joey> being checked twice oh he's like a spot </joey>
<joey> man i don't know i was really just gonna </joey>
<joey> make sure my friend got it right you </joey>
<joey> know he's like yo i heard this free </joey>
<joey> cosplay wasn't that okay and then i had </joey>
<joey> the exact same interaction again where i </joey>
<joey> was like oh yeah sorry about the mess in </joey>
<joey> this room by the way i like jojo by the </joey>
<joey> way i also like jojo </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] weirdo </connor>
<connor> but luckily like we yeah like as i said </connor>
<garnt> i'm pretty sure i mentioned in the </garnt>
<garnt> previous podcast episode we gotta </garnt>
<garnt> service that where they just do all the </garnt>
<joey> packing yeah yeah my god i cannot </joey>
<joey> imagine if i had to do that all myself i </joey>
<garnt> just kind of realized what i'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> have to go through when we move um </garnt>
<garnt> because my room's gonna be fine um </garnt>
<joey> but then i got sydney's room yeah </joey>
<joey> which the amount of [ __ ] [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] in sydney </joey>
<joey> so be careful that's the [ __ ] of the </joey>
<connor> round </connor>
<joey> that looks expensive so i remember i </joey>
<joey> remember this one time we we had to get </joey>
<joey> like our doorbell fix right so we we </joey>
<joey> thought we thought our house was pretty </joey>
<joey> clean basically whenever someone needs </joey>
<garnt> to come in to check our house at all we </garnt>
<garnt> just make sure like sydney's room is </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] locked off it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> like a quarantine section you know </garnt>
<joey> you put the [ __ ] biohazard sign on </joey>
<joey> the door just to make sure no one gets </joey>
<joey> in right but radioactive yeah yeah so so </joey>
<joey> how we learned our lesson was we had our </joey>
<joey> door we had our doorbell fixed and of </joey>
<joey> course sydney's room was like cordoned </joey>
<joey> off but we forget that sometimes sydney </joey>
<joey> just has [ __ ] lying about the house </joey>
<joey> right and i guess we've just become so </joey>
<garnt> desensitized to some of the stuff she </garnt>
<garnt> reviews my my fiance reviews a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> lewd stuff that's that's that's her </garnt>
<garnt> channel so we just had like a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> figures that were just left in the </garnt>
<garnt> living room with just like their tits </garnt>
<joey> out right </joey>
<connor> living room </connor>
<garnt> so so this guy this guy just comes in </garnt>
<garnt> right and um the the doorbell's like </garnt>
<joey> right next to the kitchen and also we </joey>
<joey> have a shelf right next to the kitchen </joey>
<joey> which just has two </joey>
<joey> lewd completely naked figures just right </joey>
<joey> next to where the doorbell is he takes a </joey>
<joey> look at looks at the figures looks at </joey>
<garnt> sydney and just doesn't make eye contact </garnt>
<garnt> with sydney ever again is it he's got </garnt>
<connor> like hentai here </connor>
<joey> just like he's covering his eyes </joey>
<garnt> sweating </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that was probably the longest </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] hour he had to like enjoy his </garnt>
<garnt> life when he was just finished i love </garnt>
<joey> how he immediately looked at sydney like </joey>
<garnt> most like you wouldn't think that like </garnt>
<joey> you're looking like gone right being </joey>
<garnt> like this [ __ ] right </garnt>
<connor> he's like leaving his loose [ __ ] out no </connor>
<joey> immediately he went to sydney he's like </joey>
<garnt> god i wish that was me </garnt>
<connor> i wish my wife would let me put my my </connor>
<garnt> dirty fingers in god </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's the one time whenever someone </garnt>
<garnt> comes around and i'm just like yo this </garnt>
<joey> these loose stuff that's that's not me </joey>
<joey> guys guys that's not me it's just my </joey>

<garnt> like there's no difference between seven </garnt>
<joey> days between videos and like two weeks </joey>
<joey> between upload yeah but to the person </joey>
<joey> who makes it it's like </joey>
<connor> oh no </connor>
<garnt> it's all i think about you know this is </garnt>
<garnt> damn videos you know this is the first </garnt>
<connor> time in my career where i've been like a </connor>
<garnt> head-on video so i'm just like damn i </garnt>
<garnt> have some free time </garnt>

<joey> one day maybe one day maybe one i'll be </joey>
<joey> back i'll be back </joey>
<connor> when come on let's do it </connor>
<connor> wait until god discovers five nights at </connor>
<connor> freddy's guys </connor>
<garnt> so yeah i mean now that [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> lockdown's been happening again i guess </joey>
<joey> we can call up the 17th time for the </joey>
<garnt> 17th time i don't know lockdown in japan </garnt>
<connor> has been weird right it's a </connor>
<connor> rollercoaster it goes like the cases go </connor>
<connor> up they announce a chilly lockdown </connor>
<joey> that's like two more rules added </joey>
<joey> the case is good now and then and then </joey>
<joey> they go back up again when they let go </joey>
<joey> of restrictions and then this is </joey>
<joey> happening like the wall the fourth time </joey>
<connor> now yeah so we're just doing the same </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] over and over again but this </joey>
<joey> lockdown is the shortest ever it's only </joey>
<joey> two weeks or something yeah i think </joey>
<garnt> they're like what's gonna change in two </garnt>
<joey> weeks i think they literally just wanted </joey>
<garnt> to be like oh golden week's happening uh </garnt>
<joey> let's let's let's have it not happen </joey>
<connor> meanwhile i'll explain everybody to the </connor>
<joey> the viewers who don't know yeah so </joey>
<joey> golden week is this week uh during the </joey>
<joey> first week of may uh we're as we're </joey>
<joey> recording this we're in the middle of it </joey>
<joey> right now where it's basically just a </joey>
<joey> bunch of public holidays back to back to </joey>
<joey> back to back-to-back so i think yeah so </joey>
<joey> basically people just get a week off do </joey>
<garnt> you know how i remember golden week it </garnt>
<garnt> was the one week of the year aside from </garnt>
<joey> like new year's where manga mangakaz </joey>
<joey> would take a break from that weekend </joey>
<joey> so i'm just like oh one piece is on </joey>
<garnt> break what the [ __ ] golden week </garnt>
<connor> thank god finally everything's on fire i </connor>
<garnt> didn't get one piece this week that's </garnt>
<garnt> the only reason i knew of golden week </garnt>
<garnt> before moving to japan yeah exactly well </garnt>
<joey> because like i think you know japan </joey>
<joey> needs golden week because yeah japan's </joey>
<joey> one of the few countries that works on </joey>
<joey> christmas </joey>
<joey> you know like christmas is just like i </joey>
<joey> think everywhere else christmas is like </joey>
<garnt> a public holiday or at least like in </garnt>
<garnt> australia yeah well yeah like in </garnt>
<garnt> australia like you know it's like the </garnt>
<joey> second half of december until maybe the </joey>
<joey> first week of january like three weeks </joey>
<connor> it's just full on holiday christmas here </connor>
<connor> is just valentine's day 2.0 yeah </connor>
<joey> basically it is it really is [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<connor> but they were just like </connor>
<joey> i don't have a cup i don't have a </joey>
<garnt> partner finna work </garnt>
<garnt> it's either you're on a date or you are </garnt>
<joey> working on something yeah exactly so i </joey>
<joey> guess like you know to japan they need </joey>
<joey> golden week because it's the one time </joey>
<joey> where they're almost forced to </joey>
<joey> take the week off yeah because otherwise </joey>
<joey> they get i mean you know people still </joey>
<joey> are just like no [ __ ] it it's still </joey>
<connor> working week for me but yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> my whole favorite thing of uh all the </connor>
<connor> japanese governments lockdowns is that </connor>
<connor> they did </connor>
<joey> in the in like </joey>
<joey> during the whole pandemic the government </joey>
<joey> thought of this amazing idea called go </joey>
<joey> to travel </joey>
<joey> she's just like oh yeah this is just the </joey>
<garnt> funniest this is the funniest [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> thing so japanese government they were </garnt>
<garnt> losing a lot of money obviously from </garnt>
<garnt> tourism that they wouldn't they weren't </garnt>
<garnt> getting so in the middle of like the </garnt>
<garnt> pandemic this is like months ago it's </garnt>
<joey> before this is last year it was during </joey>
<joey> the first lockdown wasn't it yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> they were like guys we're losing too </joey>
<joey> much money in our travel economy </joey>
<joey> we put some money back into it what </joey>
<joey> we're gonna do is guys we're gonna give </joey>
<joey> you 30 off everything and we're gonna </joey>
<joey> pay you money to go travel we'll give </joey>
<joey> you 200 bucks to spend depending on how </joey>
<joey> much you spend and uh yeah you get </joey>
<joey> coupons at your yeah yeah yeah so yeah </joey>
<joey> they were like oh yes so like it's a </joey>
<joey> lockdown but also if you travel thirty </joey>
<garnt> percent discount </garnt>
<garnt> hey there's some money to spend go treat </garnt>
<garnt> yourself king but don't leave the house </garnt>
<joey> though but don't leave like yeah and </joey>
<garnt> then like they realized it was like a </garnt>
<garnt> colossal mistake like a month later when </garnt>
<garnt> the cases went up i [ __ ] up because </garnt>
<connor> everyone's of course everyone's gonna </connor>
<garnt> travel exactly you're paying me to </garnt>
<connor> travel and you don't want me to travel </connor>
<connor> like if you went to like a five-star </connor>
<connor> hotel that's like a thousand bucks it </connor>
<garnt> would go down to like 600 and then you'd </garnt>
<garnt> be given like 300 bucks to spend and </garnt>
<garnt> it's like who isn't gonna do that like </garnt>
<connor> if you have disposable income it's like </connor>
<joey> anyone is gonna do that it's like </joey>
<joey> dangling a carrot in front of a horse </joey>
<connor> and telling the horse not to run he's </connor>
<joey> like don't don't i'm finna try to be </joey>
<joey> responsible yeah japanese governor </joey>
<joey> making me act up you know what i mean i </joey>
<connor> i want you know i was like well [ __ ] i'm </connor>
<joey> going hokkaido and of course everyone </joey>
<joey> everyone abused the [ __ ] out of that </joey>
<joey> system right everyone went traveling </joey>
<connor> yeah because it was like why wouldn't i </connor>
<connor> i went to like four different places so </connor>
<connor> i was like i'm obviously not because </connor>
<joey> like literally everybody is going right </joey>
<connor> so it's like what's the point what's the </connor>
<connor> point of not going it was the most </connor>
<connor> confusing period ever because they were </connor>
<connor> like don't travel but please travel </connor>
<connor> please please travel we need it for you </connor>
<joey> and then and then they shut it down like </joey>
<connor> after like a month yeah yeah of course </connor>
<garnt> it was it was a colossal mistake yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean if i went to hokkaido because i was </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> you know i didn't interact with anyone </joey>
<joey> but i </joey>
<joey> and it was because it was because you </joey>
<joey> guys kept talking about hokkaido and i </joey>
<joey> was like okay i think it's my time to go </joey>
<joey> hokkaido as well waited for lockdown to </joey>
<joey> end and i'm just like damn this is </joey>
<joey> they they weren't joking around [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> hokkaido exactly exactly in the middle </connor>
<joey> of [ __ ] nowhere no one's there it's </joey>
<joey> like great yeah it's peaceful it's </joey>
<joey> fantastic it was just the dumbest thing </joey>
<joey> ever because if they just kept like this </joey>
<garnt> is the whole thing that the japanese </garnt>
<garnt> governments are doing where they just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of haven't really committed to </garnt>
<garnt> anything yeah they haven't really told </garnt>
<connor> you not to do anything </connor>
<garnt> i think i very wish you were i think </garnt>
<garnt> that's the thing every every restriction </garnt>
<joey> they've given it seems very half-assed </joey>
<joey> from my </joey>
<joey> like from my perspective no it's it's </joey>
<joey> not it's not been like we've never been </joey>
<garnt> fully open but we've also never been </garnt>
<connor> fully closed either like they've never </connor>
<connor> said you can't travel around they </connor>
<joey> they're the worst thing or if anything </joey>
<joey> they reward you for it yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> and then no and then they they also said </connor>
<joey> like oh yeah you know restaurants please </joey>
<joey> close at eight you know like suddenly </joey>
<connor> for some reason people are just you know </connor>
<connor> magically stop getting infected before </connor>
<joey> right yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean this new lockdown there were like </joey>
<joey> restaurants can't serve alcohol anymore </joey>
<joey> right yeah and i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> so i'm still allowed to go to the right </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> but i just can't drink beer like it's </connor>
<joey> it's generous to even call it like half </joey>
<joey> measures it's like you know like a </joey>
<joey> quarter of measures yeah is what they do </joey>
<joey> and you know </joey>
<joey> i don't know i don't really care about </joey>
<connor> the whole politics at all but i wish </connor>
<connor> they would just decide what they wanted </connor>
<joey> well that's the problem isn't it is that </joey>
<joey> like unlike a lot of countries the </joey>
<garnt> japanese japanese law </garnt>
<garnt> they can't force establishments to close </garnt>
<garnt> down yeah like a lot of other countries </garnt>
<garnt> and so they're like they're like okay so </garnt>
<joey> we can't force you to close down but we </joey>
<joey> we we advise you to not serve alcohol to </joey>
<joey> not to close after eight but there's but </joey>
<joey> there's also like from what i heard </joey>
<garnt> there's like a penalty for like </garnt>
<garnt> establishments that don't follow those </garnt>
<joey> rules but if you get you've got to find </joey>
<garnt> a [ __ ] ton of money yeah the restaurants </garnt>
<connor> that make so much money well that's the </connor>
<joey> thing i would just pay the bills the </joey>
<joey> penalty is so low that there are a lot </joey>
<joey> of restaurants out there especially in </joey>
<joey> like in a tokyo that are just like all </joey>
<garnt> paid for </garnt>
<garnt> some of like the biggest restaurants i </garnt>
<garnt> think just pay the fine yeah they pay </garnt>
<joey> the finances they make more off of the </joey>
<connor> money that they yeah yeah yeah and also </connor>
<connor> they were like the biggest that was like </connor>
<joey> not even the fine it was like we'll put </joey>
<joey> you on a list of companies that stayed </joey>
<joey> open and obviously just a lot of </joey>
<joey> japanese people that's like that's </joey>
<joey> pretty like [ __ ] we've got [ __ ] we're </joey>
<joey> gonna be on the list yeah </joey>
<joey> but then for some of them they were like </joey>
<joey> i'll [ __ ] give a [ __ ] about it it's </joey>
<joey> like getting on the naughty list on </joey>
<connor> santa right yeah yeah yeah it's like oh </connor>
<joey> no that's so so dumb yeah so dumb that's </joey>
<joey> the thing it would have this would have </joey>
<connor> been at least australia and new zealand </connor>
<joey> like totally locked down yeah like new </joey>
<connor> zealand were like nah yeah yeah in </connor>
<connor> australia no one could do anything </connor>
<connor> australia locked down for like nine </connor>
<connor> months yeah yeah and like people </connor>
<garnt> couldn't go outside for more than an </garnt>
<garnt> hour a day and like yeah all restaurants </garnt>
<garnt> were closed all that kind of stuff and </garnt>
<joey> like yeah and then when in sydney at </joey>
<joey> least we got one case and the entire </joey>
<joey> city went into lockdown for like a month </joey>
<joey> meanwhile japan is like </joey>
<joey> a thousand cases don't drink at </joey>
<joey> restaurants </joey>
<joey> it's like cool thanks yeah but i mean </joey>
<garnt> it's it'll be interesting to see what </garnt>
<garnt> happens in this next year because every </garnt>
<joey> every other country seems to be getting </joey>
<joey> their vaccines and we are still like </joey>
<joey> we're probably not going to be able to </joey>
<joey> get our vaccines this year if we stay in </joey>
<joey> japan it's right looking more and more </joey>
<joey> likely but i mean you know there's like </joey>
<joey> i know of a few of my american friends </joey>
<joey> who are here who are just probably just </joey>
<joey> going to like bite the bullet and just </joey>
<joey> go back to america this sometime this </joey>
<connor> year to just go get the whole thing yeah </connor>
<garnt> everyone like my age in america is </garnt>
<garnt> already getting it yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly in the uk as well right yeah uk </garnt>
<joey> as well yeah it's like being a kid again </joey>
<garnt> when they always got the games before </garnt>
<joey> you [ __ ] man i'm like why are you all </joey>
<joey> getting the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's reversed now like yeah it's the </joey>
<connor> last one </connor>
<joey> exactly like japan was always the first </joey>
<connor> now you're the last i feel like i've </connor>
<connor> been lied to </connor>
<joey> but like are you guys gonna do it </joey>
<garnt> i'm probably gonna do it i mean i don't </garnt>
<garnt> blame you i'll [ __ ] do it like if i </garnt>
<joey> was an american or like </joey>
<garnt> or from the uk i would absolutely it's </garnt>
<connor> twofold for me right because i i want to </connor>
<connor> go back to the uk i want to go back to </connor>
<connor> uk yeah </connor>
<connor> my friends toast goddamn it you know </connor>
<connor> it's been like this is i think this is </connor>
<joey> the longest i've been from like seeing </joey>
<connor> my family yeah see my friends yeah so </connor>
<joey> i'm just like that's that that and the </joey>
<joey> vaccine if i can get everything done in </joey>
<joey> one trip then that's yeah i'm gonna take </joey>
<garnt> like a month and a half off japan and </garnt>
<garnt> just go do the things that i want i need </garnt>
<garnt> to do for my health and also catch up to </garnt>
<connor> all the things like </connor>
<joey> toast in it just want to have it it's </joey>
<garnt> just [ __ ] my friends just beans there's </garnt>
<joey> no heinz beans here what the [ __ ] am i </joey>
<connor> supposed to do like </connor>
<garnt> see the problem was [ __ ] depressing </garnt>
<connor> i'm sorry i crave it i don't think </connor>
<connor> there's a more depressing sight than </connor>
<joey> just beans and toast by itself i'm sorry </joey>
<joey> this is a separate other brand tastes </joey>
<joey> good as a brit like seeing the sight of </joey>
<garnt> just like beans on toast as like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] breakfast dinner whatever that's </garnt>
<joey> fantastic see i feel that way but like </joey>
<joey> two or three times a year i just wake up </joey>
<joey> and i'm like [ __ ] go for some beans </joey>
<joey> right now baked beans baked beans heinz </joey>
<joey> great source of protein as well yeah </joey>
<joey> like what's not to like [ __ ] me up beans </joey>
<connor> are magical they're like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> fantastic make me fall like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] but who cares still good </joey>
<connor> who cares i like that you know it feels </connor>
<connor> like you're being cleansed </connor>
<joey> it's like detoxing </joey>
<joey> but like that's the problem right it's </joey>
<joey> like at least you guys and like all my </joey>
<connor> american friends have you know a choice </connor>
<joey> to do that right yeah go back it's you </joey>
<connor> know doubly like get it back like </connor>
<connor> australia apparently made it illegal to </connor>
<garnt> return if you're from india right if </garnt>
<joey> you're yeah oh really i think a lot of </joey>
<garnt> legal like </garnt>
<connor> well that's the problem right is that </connor>
<garnt> like i can't do the same for australia </garnt>
<garnt> because we're in no rush to get the </garnt>
<garnt> vaccine because no one's had covert for </garnt>
<joey> the past four months yeah so like not </joey>
<garnt> even my grandma who's like 92 this year </garnt>
<joey> has gotten it yet yeah it's like </joey>
<garnt> late maybe like you got you guys are </garnt>
<garnt> isolated as [ __ ] it's hard enough to get </garnt>
<joey> in your country as it is exactly yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean it makes sense right but like you </joey>
<joey> know that's why australia's done so well </joey>
<garnt> and same with new zealand but that's </garnt>
<garnt> what like the whole world goes through </garnt>
<joey> like the [ __ ] apocalypse australia is </joey>
<joey> just gonna be australian new zealand are </joey>
<joey> gonna be like two remaining countries </joey>
<connor> exactly right nothing goes in nothing </connor>
<connor> comes out man seeing the whole like uh </connor>
<garnt> like the whole joe rogan controversy </garnt>
<garnt> about all the like vaccines and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's it's so frustrating that like </garnt>
<joey> it's literally been the only thing </joey>
<joey> anyone can talk about for the past like </joey>
<joey> year and a half is covered in all this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah but it's also like saying that </joey>
<joey> you can't talk about because everyone's </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] turned it into a political thing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah where it's just like i just i just </garnt>
<connor> want to eat baked beans i just don't </connor>
<garnt> want to die i just i just don't want to </garnt>
<garnt> be ill and i don't want to get other </garnt>
<connor> people ill yeah i didn't i didn't know </connor>
<garnt> it's become like a thing like that like </garnt>
<garnt> even now talking about it i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] there's probably like some [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] in the comments who are like </connor>
<connor> annoyed about it i was talking about i </connor>
<joey> just want to kiss my homies good night </joey>
<connor> man </connor>
<joey> exactly come on man let me kiss my </joey>
<joey> homies [ __ ] hell yeah </joey>
<joey> i just want to eat some [ __ ] baked </joey>
<connor> beans watch cars 2 in the theater you </connor>
<connor> know just </connor>
<joey> well i mean what wasn't it like the uk </joey>
<joey> recently i think like couple of days ago </joey>
<garnt> just had their first muscle mask </garnt>
<garnt> mask-less concert </garnt>
<garnt> it was like 5 000 people at a concert or </garnt>
<joey> something and there were none of them </joey>
<garnt> wearing musk because they were all </garnt>
<garnt> vaccinated i'm not sure about melin can </garnt>
<joey> you like check i'm pretty sure i saw </joey>
<joey> that this morning but like i'm not </joey>
<joey> surprised either because the uk has been </joey>
<joey> i mean the us and the uk have been so </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] good with their vaccines i loved </connor>
<connor> how uh in the uk when they literally </connor>
<joey> were like okay guys i think you can </joey>
<joey> maybe go out for drinks now yeah like </joey>
<joey> the first day </joey>
<garnt> london was like rammed and it was just </garnt>
<garnt> children of course it would be and they </garnt>
<joey> were like here we waited like 10 years </joey>
<connor> for this we're going to go to the </connor>
<garnt> pinewood jerry just like oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> exactly go i can't i can't imagine how </garnt>
<garnt> weather spoons was going to be like as </garnt>
<connor> soon as i opened up oh my god i do miss </connor>
<garnt> a good weather spoons actually you know </garnt>
<garnt> the government could tell like if </garnt>
<garnt> britain had to fight in like another war </garnt>
<garnt> you know and the government was like </garnt>
<joey> please fight please fight for us and </joey>
<joey> they'd be like nah nah they're like pubs </joey>
<joey> will be open if you fight they'll be </joey>
<joey> like where are we fighting where are we </joey>
<joey> fighting </joey>
<joey> i don't know what it is about pubs and </joey>
<joey> british people but like it turns them </joey>
<joey> into something it's like ferocious like </joey>
<joey> when pubs come into the equation yeah </joey>
<joey> they become like different people yeah </joey>
<garnt> they're like you suddenly become more </garnt>
<garnt> passionate yeah i i feel like people in </garnt>
<garnt> britain weren't taking like the pandemic </garnt>
<garnt> seriously until pub started closing down </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and that's that's like the real </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] of the world </connor>
<joey> they're like i sleep i can't go to </joey>
<garnt> school or work whatever whatever what </garnt>
<connor> the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> there's a political agenda </joey>
<garnt> how dare they close the polls </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's the exact moment it got </garnt>
<joey> political </joey>
<joey> i can't believe these politicians have </joey>
<joey> done this </joey>
<joey> my arm hurts </joey>
<connor> tell me if the pendulum weren't playing </connor>
<joey> you know i know british come on that's a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] lie there's no way come on there </connor>
<connor> is no [ __ ] way the amount of clubs of </connor>
<connor> like 16 and 17 year olds like the fake </connor>
<joey> ids come on there's people are faking </joey>
<garnt> like their passport that's 100 exactly </garnt>
<garnt> passports or whatever like the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> bouncers give a [ __ ] yeah kidding me </joey>
<joey> sure you could hand a [ __ ] mcdonald's </joey>
<joey> like 10 coffee card to them as an idea </joey>
<joey> they'd let you [ __ ] in the club in </joey>
<joey> the uk to be fair to be fair though if </joey>
<joey> any country is probably going to do like </joey>
<joey> a fully normal concert first it's going </joey>
<garnt> to be the us of the uk with how they're </garnt>
<garnt> going yeah i might assume whether they </garnt>
<garnt> should </garnt>
<joey> yeah when they shoot is a different </joey>
<joey> question but i mean from what i've heard </joey>
<joey> from like </joey>
<joey> like third-party information from all my </joey>
<joey> mates back there it's the one thing that </joey>
<joey> we've been doing well about about the uh </joey>
<connor> pandemic which is the vaccine response </connor>
<joey> right which is just it kind of makes </joey>
<garnt> sense we [ __ ] bought them all up [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> you other countries this is our first </connor>
<joey> world country money yeah </joey>
<joey> give us that it's pretty tragic though </joey>
<joey> it's just like us uk bought them all and </joey>
<joey> then no one else gets it yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> it's pretty tragic really yeah you know </joey>
<joey> because you get it from the inside of </joey>
<garnt> the club you're like yeah we're doing </garnt>
<garnt> great and then yeah you see </garnt>
<joey> well yeah of course </joey>

<connor> was it looked like a [ __ ] battle </connor>
<connor> station i remember </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah but like it was way bigger </garnt>
<garnt> than any of the portable chargers i've </garnt>
<joey> ever seen and also like what sold me was </joey>
<joey> that it had its own plug so you can plug </joey>
<joey> like so you can you can plus the adapter </joey>
<joey> yes you can plug an actual like power </joey>
<joey> adapter to it right so i was like i want </joey>
<joey> something like that for a camping trip </joey>
<joey> right so i said oh what's this thing </joey>
<joey> called so he calls he says it's the </joey>
<joey> omnicharger so i google it on amazon and </joey>
<garnt> unfortunately they're not selling on </garnt>
<garnt> amazon anymore so i go to like the first </garnt>
<garnt> link that's recommended for like that </garnt>
<garnt> search </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing about amazon is that </garnt>
<garnt> you see a charger right there's nothing </garnt>
<joey> to like quantify how how big this </joey>
<joey> charger is right just from the image </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah that's not with </connor>
<connor> dimensions but i mean you might not look </connor>
<joey> at them yeah sometimes it's like buried </joey>
<joey> in a wall of like text yeah yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> buried in a wall of text so i just see </garnt>
<garnt> this block right and i'm just like it's </garnt>
<joey> probably around the same i mean it's </joey>
<connor> recommended from me searching the omni </connor>
<joey> charger so he's probably about the same </joey>
<joey> size right </joey>
<joey> he's probably around the same size </joey>
<joey> like thinking back like being like an </joey>
<joey> electronic an electrical ex-electronic </joey>
<joey> and electrical engineer we've got a </joey>
<joey> masters i should have seen like the </joey>
<joey> amount of like charge it holds </joey>
<joey> but i didn't look about the amount of </joey>
<joey> charge it holds i just i just i was just </joey>
<joey> like on like um [ __ ] autopilot mode </joey>
<joey> i'm just like yeah that looks good buy </joey>
<joey> that okay so wait a few days from all my </joey>
<joey> camping equipment that i bought um and </joey>

<joey> pack this massive package gets delivered </joey>
<joey> to my door i'm and i'm all right uh </joey>
<joey> don't it everything's like boxed up so i </joey>
<joey> don't know what everything is so the </joey>
<joey> first thing i pick up it's [ __ ] heavy </joey>
<joey> it's this [ __ ] brick and my first </joey>
<joey> thought was oh no have i bought like a </joey>
<joey> sleeping bag that's just like 10 times </joey>
<joey> heavier than i needed it you're right </joey>
<joey> and so i start unboxing it and i see </joey>
<garnt> this [ __ ] brick just in my hands </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like what the [ __ ] is this </garnt>
<connor> what i've i don't remember buying </connor>
<connor> anything this heavy yeah turn it around </connor>
<connor> and it's the [ __ ] charger and i'm </connor>
<joey> like no wait this must be how big is it </joey>
<connor> this must be a mistake um </connor>
<joey> so joey joey has a photo it's on screen </joey>
<joey> right now the photo of this brick that i </joey>
<joey> got i turn it around i look at like the </joey>
<joey> appliances that i can power and it's </joey>
<joey> just like okay so this can power phones </joey>
<joey> it can you know charge </joey>
<joey> tablets and then it says you can charge </joey>
<joey> laptops it can power a [ __ ] mini </joey>
<joey> fridge </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like you can power a mini </joey>
<garnt> fridge a microwave and i'm just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] what the [ __ ] have i bought </garnt>
<joey> this this thing he bought it literally </joey>
<garnt> is like oh i found it </garnt>
<connor> so this is like a [ __ ] brick that i </connor>
<connor> bought two routers strapped together </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah and i'm just like what the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] mac mini </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know what i'm gonna be able to </garnt>
<garnt> do with this because like i can't take </garnt>
<garnt> that on a plane because like if i take </garnt>
<garnt> it on a plane the tsa probably thinks </garnt>
<connor> i'm gonna bomb the [ __ ] plane get </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] arrested like i'm probably gonna </connor>
<garnt> be on the [ __ ] isis list if i take us </garnt>
<garnt> from a plane jesus christ so i can't </garnt>
<garnt> even so i'm just thinking to myself all </garnt>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> i've made guys </joey>
<joey> i've made a mistake </joey>
<joey> but it's okay because at least i can use </joey>
<joey> it on this camping trip </joey>
<joey> so like i like this massive [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> brick in my </joey>
<joey> suitcase or in my bag sorry which is </joey>
<joey> probably like </joey>
<joey> like by itself the heaviest single </joey>
<joey> object in my bag for a camping trip yeah </joey>
<joey> um and so we get to this campsite and </joey>
<joey> you know we get we get a lot and we </joey>
<joey> start unpacking everything and i see </joey>
<joey> this metal box right i see these metal </joey>
<joey> box and i was just like what the [ __ ] is </joey>
<joey> that metal box my first thought was oh </joey>
<joey> it's probably like a safe they provided </joey>
<joey> right because you know i hear about some </joey>
<joey> american campsites something like bear </joey>
<joey> safes or something so i was thinking i </joey>
<joey> might be a safe or something um and so i </joey>
<joey> was like navi what's that and he's just </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> just way gone let me show you he opens </garnt>
<garnt> it up and it's a [ __ ] power outlet </garnt>
<joey> but there's two power hours sticking out </joey>
<connor> like that i'm just like </connor>
<connor> yes camping with my power up yeah right </connor>
<garnt> and i'm just like so wait there's </garnt>
<garnt> literally no [ __ ] reason for me to </garnt>
<garnt> buy this [ __ ] brick and lug this </garnt>
<garnt> around i can't take it anywhere can't </garnt>
<garnt> take it on the plane and apparently it's </garnt>
<garnt> useful and it's apparently it's useless </garnt>
<garnt> for a camping trip what the [ __ ] do i </garnt>
<joey> need this for you literally i looked at </joey>
<joey> that thing and i'm like that's what </joey>
<joey> people use for like emergencies like </joey>
<joey> when like your house is flooded and you </joey>
<joey> have no electricity and like this is the </joey>
<garnt> thing yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like if japan syncs ever </garnt>
<garnt> happens i'm [ __ ] sorted man you are </garnt>
<connor> like the top of the hierarchy like </connor>
<connor> people have been fighting </connor>
<connor> the first night he like charged his </connor>
<connor> phone </connor>
<connor> well he was like i might as well use </connor>
<connor> this [ __ ] thing yeah so he charged </connor>
<garnt> his phone right it was like a hundred </garnt>
<garnt> percent next morning phone is fully </garnt>
<garnt> charged 97 </garnt>
<garnt> he's three percent of his charge his </garnt>
<garnt> power is fine i'm like this thing could </garnt>
<joey> last you like literally like two months </joey>
<garnt> yeah i i literally insane i literally </garnt>
<garnt> bought it just so i could recharge my </garnt>
<joey> phone during during the duration </joey>
<joey> like ventilation like yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i </joey>
<garnt> knew he was like [ __ ] way too </garnt>
<garnt> overkill when i opened it up had a vent </garnt>
<garnt> that had like a fan </garnt>
<joey> turned on he turned it on and it </joey>
<garnt> literally started going </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> i'm like this way yeah so three percent </joey>
<connor> power of the [ __ ] fan probably yeah </connor>
<joey> but he charged your [ __ ] phone </joey>
<joey> it was so funny yeah but like i've been </joey>
<connor> camping quite a bit in australia like my </connor>
<connor> dad and i used to go having all the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i don't want to [ __ ] counter </connor>
<connor> a power outlet with the [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly but like i i realized okay japan </joey>
<joey> does not know how to go through camping </joey>
<joey> because like it really is </joey>
<garnt> yeah it really is baby mode on mario so </garnt>
<joey> we we saw someone like so like we had </joey>
<joey> like some relatively small tents right </joey>
<connor> neighbors yeah we had neighbors yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's that's the thing that really put </garnt>
<joey> me off because i thought we it was but </joey>
<joey> it was one lot of part b so there was </joey>
<joey> social distancing </joey>
<garnt> it was one lot of part it was social </garnt>
<joey> distancing </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> probably one thing i one thing i learned </joey>
<joey> about ten is that it's just not noise </joey>
<joey> proof at all i can hear [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> everything literally i remember we were </joey>
<joey> sleeping and i just i could hear like </joey>
<joey> the other tent [ __ ] farting in the </joey>
<joey> background and i'm just like okay who </joey>
<joey> was that was that you nabi okay whatever </joey>
<joey> but like some of these tents that these </joey>
<joey> people bought they weren't [ __ ] tense </joey>
<joey> so some of our neighbors right </joey>
<joey> um one one lots like like two lots down </joey>
<joey> from us they they start unpacking this </joey>
<joey> ten right and then </joey>
<joey> they this tent has [ __ ] compartments </joey>
<joey> right and then not only that you you i </joey>
<joey> remember walking past they had an </joey>
<joey> entrance right they had an entrance that </joey>
<joey> had lights on the entrance okay and like </joey>
<garnt> fairy lights and this tent had like two </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] bedrooms a living room oh my god </connor>
<connor> my parents didn't like that yeah and has </connor>
<joey> that even a tent though yeah it's like a </joey>
<connor> family time it's just a pop-up apartment </connor>
<connor> yeah but it's like a family tent i'm </connor>
<garnt> just i'm just like this isn't a ten this </garnt>
<connor> is a two ldk bro though like jesus tents </connor>
<connor> are a [ __ ] nightmare yeah </connor>
<joey> well but that's the thing right it's </joey>
<joey> like i get it if it was a family but </joey>
<joey> this was a couple this is a couple yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's ridiculous yeah yeah unlike that </garnt>
<garnt> test that's because you're a japanese </garnt>
<connor> couple so naturally you're not gonna </connor>
<garnt> sleep in the same bag </garnt>
<garnt> of course i was i was getting to that </garnt>
<garnt> because this this like this tent had </garnt>
<garnt> carpet had shelves and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> might as well just like bring a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> caravan at this point we'd take that but </connor>
<connor> we stayed for like three weeks that </connor>
<garnt> makes sense if it's three weeks they </garnt>
<garnt> stayed for a single night and like of </garnt>
<joey> course okay so here's like the single </joey>
<joey> night yeah </joey>
<joey> they they came with us and they left </joey>
<joey> them so so here's the premium japanese </joey>
<joey> couple experience that i saw right so we </joey>
<connor> walked past this tent right and of </connor>
<connor> course this japanese couple you know </connor>
<connor> obviously very intimate japanese couple </connor>
<connor> to be going on a camping trip by </connor>
<connor> themselves together </connor>
<connor> very intimate so the peak japanese </connor>
<connor> couple experience was seeing the guy </connor>
<connor> next to his car on a [ __ ] gamer chair </connor>
<garnt> or something and then seeing the girl on </garnt>
<garnt> the other side of this massive tent on a </garnt>
<garnt> hammock both of them by themselves not </garnt>
<garnt> interacting premium japanese couple </garnt>
<garnt> experience i mean </garnt>
<connor> isn't that love </connor>
<joey> knowing when to ignore each other yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's love no i i mean i say it's a </garnt>
<garnt> free room japanese couple experience </garnt>
<garnt> because the amount of times like we've </garnt>
<connor> gone to like onsens or ryokans or </connor>
<connor> something and like it's just like us the </connor>
<connor> boys and we're just surrounded by </connor>
<connor> japanese couples they don't talk to each </connor>
<garnt> other not talking to them just not </garnt>
<joey> interacting with each other couples that </joey>
<garnt> social distance together stay together </garnt>
<joey> you know </joey>
<garnt> they're just social distancing yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> but like one one part i couldn't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> believe was um with wood fire right </joey>
<joey> so you had to like go to oh i mean they </joey>
<joey> had the option to go to like the the </joey>
<joey> reception quote unquote where you could </joey>
<joey> buy </joey>
<joey> pre-cut wood fire yeah that's normally </joey>
<joey> how it is right yeah like so off yeah </joey>
<connor> cause they don't want you just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> picking [ __ ] up around the area right </connor>
<joey> but like but like the thing is i mean </joey>
<garnt> that's what we can that's what we did </garnt>
<joey> because each bundle was like 500 yen </joey>
<garnt> right like maybe for like a bundle it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't it wasn't about the price it </garnt>
<joey> wasn't about the price </joey>
<joey> because like this wood because it's like </joey>
<joey> pre-cut and clean and dry yeah this </joey>
<joey> thing burns through like so [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> quickly i'm like we're here for the </garnt>
<connor> entire day we want this fire to keep </connor>
<connor> going the entire day right yeah this </connor>
<garnt> thing is not going to last us the entire </garnt>
<garnt> day yeah so i just said [ __ ] it and i </garnt>
<garnt> just like went out into the bush and </garnt>
<garnt> just grabbed some wood and then nabi had </garnt>
<garnt> a hatchet and i'm like give me that [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] started like deforesting </garnt>
<joey> i didn't cut down any trees yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<connor> to emphasize we didn't cut off any trees </connor>
<joey> we just cut off like some some branches </joey>
<joey> that had fallen down we cut the logs </joey>
<joey> into like sizeable pieces yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> brought them back to our campsite </joey>
<joey> because that that to me is the camping </joey>
<garnt> experience right we're out in the </garnt>
<connor> wilderness we're like yeah you're like </connor>
<connor> out here in like like a [ __ ] swimming </connor>
<connor> pool treating it like bear grylls </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> that's the thing it's like i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> we wanted to make the most out of it </garnt>
<joey> honestly because it's like otherwise we </joey>
<joey> would have to spend like 100 bucks for </joey>
<garnt> firewood i'm like [ __ ] that i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's not about a hundred bucks of </garnt>
<connor> firewood because it's just not about the </connor>
<connor> money joey it's about the experience </connor>
<joey> it's about the experience exactly </joey>
<joey> i had so i the most amount of fun i had </joey>
<joey> was going out into the bush picking up </joey>
<joey> some like dead trees and just bringing </joey>
<joey> it back and just chopping the [ __ ] out </joey>
<connor> of it that was the most fun i'd be so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] bored if i turned up and it </connor>
<connor> should like i got like 10 neighbors we </connor>
<connor> got a power outlet yeah and it's like </connor>
<joey> pre-packages like here you go here's all </joey>
<garnt> the things you need go go have fun go </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] micro transactions </garnt>
<joey> with your camping experience man </joey>
<joey> probably like bring your food if you </joey>
<joey> want to i know i know some camping trips </joey>
<garnt> actually bring you meat </garnt>
<garnt> like on the grill if you want if you </garnt>
<connor> want to have food i like to stay at a </connor>
<garnt> hotel the best part about camping right </garnt>
<joey> is when you all turn up right and then </joey>
<joey> your one mate is like voice i brought </joey>
<joey> bacon and everyone's like yes let's go </joey>
<joey> exactly perishable foods what an idiot </joey>
<joey> but it works </joey>
<joey> like i mean in the uk you can just </joey>
<joey> there's a little place you can just kind </joey>
<joey> of ask them you're like hey can i camp </joey>
<joey> on your land they were like yeah sure </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah stuff like that there's a lot </connor>
<connor> of places where you can camp like i mean </connor>
<joey> australia there's like you know </joey>
<connor> designated camping areas but like it's </connor>
<joey> first come first so if something if it's </joey>
<connor> full then [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> that in japan or is it all just </connor>
<joey> regulated it's all regulated yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's i mean it was fine </garnt>
<garnt> for the experience it was but i </garnt>
<garnt> definitely preferred the camping </garnt>
<garnt> experience i had in other countries </garnt>
<garnt> because it just it just kind of didn't </garnt>
<garnt> feel like camping you know i mean there </garnt>
<joey> was that other couple next to us that </joey>
<connor> brought a [ __ ] tv </connor>
<connor> oh yeah honestly honestly i'd do it i'd </connor>
<joey> do it too and they're like playing smash </joey>
<joey> bros or whatever the [ __ ] was i'm like </joey>
<connor> hell yeah just like why are you even </connor>
<connor> camping dude i mean if you've got a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] plug why not bring the 15 i </joey>
<joey> guess so yeah i guess i'll bring the </joey>
<joey> 50-inch yeah i guess like </joey>
<joey> i was like you think that these guys </joey>
<joey> have been like permanently living there </joey>
<joey> with how much [ __ ] they have too far i </joey>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> i'd be tempted to bring like you can get </connor>
<connor> those like really shitty uh like 19-inch </connor>
<joey> battery-powered uh monitors yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> but there is nothing </connor>
<connor> the thing is is like because i've you </connor>
<connor> know because i've had a pretty [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> stressful week because of the whole move </connor>
<connor> thing but so it's just so nice to just </connor>
<joey> just sit down and look at a fire for 12 </joey>
<joey> hours and literally drink and talk about </joey>
<joey> nothing yeah it was the best [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> experience i've had </connor>
<connor> that is the best part yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> because like because who set up the </joey>
<joey> tents </joey>
<connor> um </connor>
<joey> yeah did you really did you all did you </joey>
<joey> really yeah we all did we all did really </joey>
<connor> because most of the time it's we all </connor>
<garnt> didn't it's like i watched </garnt>
<connor> our tents really weren't that </connor>
<connor> complicated really right because it was </connor>
<joey> r10 was literally just like a triangle </joey>
<joey> one of one of those [ __ ] yeah it </joey>
<joey> wasn't it wasn't a [ __ ] inflatable </joey>
<garnt> apartment it wasn't it wasn't a </garnt>
<connor> two-bedroom apartment yeah when i was uh </connor>
<connor> when i was like 15 i had the ones where </connor>
<joey> you like you [ __ ] throw it in the air </joey>
<connor> and yeah yeah like like nabi had one of </connor>
<joey> those as well but like our past </joey>
<connor> though yeah yeah ours was a bit more </connor>
<connor> complicated and we still somehow [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it up um </connor>
<garnt> because so our 10 was like it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's like not pre i mean it kind of is </garnt>
<garnt> pre-built but we kind of have to like </garnt>
<garnt> strengthen the uh </garnt>
<garnt> the supports what what about the support </garnt>
<joey> beams that come with them right </joey>
<joey> so what are they called like the </joey>
<garnt> destruction yeah the poles the bone </garnt>
<joey> structure i don't [ __ ] know it's not </joey>
<joey> holes just [ __ ] poles it's not it </joey>
<joey> wasn't a pole because it was like part </joey>
<joey> of the tent right so this tent came with </joey>
<joey> like support beams that like supported </joey>
<joey> the structure right and it was almost </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] poles it's baby mode like i said </joey>
<joey> baby mo baby moten mode we did we </joey>
<joey> literally didn't have to do anything we </joey>
<joey> just had to like [ __ ] we well we </joey>
<joey> thought we didn't have to do anything </joey>
<joey> right because it all kind of like </joey>
<joey> unfolded and we like put it up we just </joey>
<garnt> we all we had to do is like put the pegs </garnt>
<garnt> down we thought great job done uh we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know it was job done because when </garnt>
<garnt> we were trying to sleep when we when </garnt>
<garnt> when we were when me and joey were </garnt>
<garnt> trying to sleep just kept caving in </garnt>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> because it was also windy </joey>
<garnt> it was it was a windy yeah insanely it </garnt>
<garnt> was a windy ass night so every like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] hour i'd get woken up by this </garnt>
<joey> ten just caving in and i just have to </joey>
<joey> like bring the support pole up again i'm </joey>
<joey> just like oh that's a [ __ ] sake and i </joey>
<joey> i i i could hear joey was like having </joey>
<joey> trouble sleeping as well </joey>
<joey> and it was not sleep at all and it was </joey>
<joey> only when we were packing up that we </joey>
<garnt> took the cover off and i was just like </garnt>
<garnt> at the top of the support beam there was </garnt>
<garnt> this label that said push i was like </garnt>
<garnt> why does this label say push and i push </garnt>
<garnt> it down and i just hear click and </garnt>
<joey> everything is like a solid aspect </joey>
<garnt> like transformers </garnt>
<joey> i just hear this click and i was like </joey>
<joey> what was that click </joey>
<garnt> and then i tried to like push push in </garnt>
<connor> the support beams like the manual or </connor>
<connor> anything no no no </connor>
<connor> clearly clearly we should have i mean it </connor>
<garnt> was a tense i'll just give it a click </garnt>
<garnt> quickly well because like i'm not used </garnt>
<connor> to tense like that i'm used to the ones </connor>
<connor> where you have to like kind of connect </connor>
<connor> all the poles together and do it </connor>
<joey> yourself right so i'd so i was like oh </joey>
<connor> cool this is who bought the tents </connor>
<joey> oh naby dude </joey>
<joey> so i was like oh i've never seen this </joey>
<joey> kind of tent but it seems easy enough it </joey>
<connor> literally just some reason whenever you </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] do your friend's tent it's like </connor>
<joey> the biggest piece of [ __ ] ever it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like your tent pristine brand new </joey>
<joey> yeah well your friend's tent is </joey>
<garnt> literally like falling apart the poles </garnt>
<garnt> don't [ __ ] connect they're rusty as </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it's like what do you do what do </garnt>
<connor> you do to this tent how did you put it </connor>
<joey> in this bad condition i don't know </joey>
<joey> yeah that but like that night it was so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] windy i mean the day before it </joey>
<joey> was so [ __ ] raining that </joey>
<joey> we were just like we're not we're not </joey>
<joey> camping out there it's like a torrential </joey>
<joey> thunderstorm out yeah so we're just </joey>
<garnt> gonna [ __ ] we just went to like a </garnt>
<garnt> nearby dyokon but </garnt>
<garnt> the next day though when we actually </garnt>
<garnt> went camping was [ __ ] great yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> was it was a great experience i remember </garnt>
<garnt> argued the next day it was aki was like </garnt>
<garnt> so what did you guys talk about and i </garnt>
<joey> just sat there i was like it doesn't </joey>
<joey> matter what you [ __ ] what did i talk </joey>
<connor> about what what's what's talked about </connor>
<joey> camping stays in canada yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> it was clearly so unimportant that it </joey>
<joey> didn't even retain in my memory so all i </joey>
<joey> remember is oh fire burn that's all i </joey>
<connor> remember from that camping trip i just </connor>
<connor> gave my instincts come out </connor>
<garnt> i remember trying to start a fire for </garnt>
<garnt> like a full hour because like nabi </garnt>
<garnt> bought these flints i'm just like guys </garnt>
<joey> guys we've got a power outlet like in a </joey>
<connor> bear grill </connor>
<connor> let's get a [ __ ] outlet like no and </connor>
<joey> edo for the entire time was standing </joey>
<joey> there with a blowtorch it was like </joey>
<connor> really when you are gone </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] creme brulee on my campsite </garnt>
<garnt> what's going on so there's just me like </garnt>
<garnt> huddled around these like this [ __ ] </garnt>

<joey> meanwhile i'm just like sitting there on </joey>
<joey> like my gaming channel just playing </joey>
<joey> firestarter it's like oh you got it you </joey>
<garnt> gotta make it oh my god but it was i </garnt>
<joey> just wanted to play bear grylls it was </joey>
<joey> like so it was almost scary how </joey>
<joey> enthusiastic gantt was to start a fire </joey>
<joey> he was just like </joey>
<joey> you know like because like we gotta make </joey>
<garnt> it sound like a [ __ ] i'm a [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> casual artist so we got that we got it </joey>
<joey> we got there right and we're like all </joey>
<garnt> right let's figure out what we're gonna </garnt>
<joey> do all right we gotta set up a tent you </joey>
<connor> know blah blah blah alright everybody </connor>
<connor> help get all the stuff out and god's </connor>
<connor> just kind of standing there like </connor>
<connor> i just can't wait to start a fire </connor>
<joey> oh my god that's that's how people </joey>
<joey> become arsenal come on come on let's </joey>
<joey> let's let's not pretend that the start </joey>
<joey> of a camping trip is always when you are </joey>
<joey> able to first start of course </joey>
<garnt> that's how you know the camping trip has </garnt>
<joey> been i knew i knew from i knew from how </joey>
<connor> enthusiastic yeah </connor>
<connor> i knew from how enthusiastic god was to </connor>
<connor> start the fire i was like if i let this </connor>
<joey> man start a fire he's not going to do </joey>
<joey> anything else he's going to stay next to </joey>
<joey> that fire fueling that [ __ ] for like 12 </joey>
<garnt> hours who the [ __ ] enjoys building a </garnt>
<garnt> tent like no no no one he actually </garnt>
<garnt> enjoys building a tent it's fiddly as </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] after time you're trying to figure </joey>
<joey> out how the instruction manuals work </joey>
<joey> because they're like you mean the </joey>
<joey> instruction manual we didn't read yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly right because it's a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> pain in the ass you're trying to figure </joey>
<joey> out like has somehow somehow they've </joey>
<garnt> picked the images that make it like the </garnt>
<garnt> least legible and like the least </garnt>
<garnt> understandable to like figure out how to </garnt>
<joey> like build this sounds like you you took </joey>
<connor> the monkey brain on the trip yeah i </connor>
<joey> didn't need to come there was already </joey>
<joey> monkey bro gant was very monkey brain </joey>
<joey> around that fire like he was like </joey>
<garnt> i i i feed him </garnt>
<garnt> i was single-handedly fueling that fire </garnt>
<garnt> for like 12 hours this this fire went on </garnt>
<garnt> for like 12 hours and i was the one like </garnt>
<joey> fueling it every time yeah it's like i </joey>
<joey> don't have to do anything i'm just god's </joey>
<joey> just like assistant right here just like </joey>
<connor> fueling up we need to look for like an </connor>
<connor> actual place where we can camp with like </connor>
<connor> legit like legit </connor>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<joey> outlets i don't know if we'll be able to </joey>
<garnt> find that in japan </garnt>
<garnt> what was your camping experience like in </garnt>
<connor> england in england i didn't really go </connor>
<connor> much in england i went around like </connor>
<garnt> france mainly a lot of the time in </garnt>
<garnt> france though like it was like campsites </garnt>
<garnt> like that did you count with </garnt>
<joey> my family for the most part but then uh </joey>
<joey> obviously because we're in wales so it's </joey>
<joey> really easy to just camp for a weekend </joey>
<joey> um and it was normally you were just </joey>
<connor> like in a in a farmer's land </connor>
<joey> in like some [ __ ] random field oh </joey>
<connor> like land that someone owns yeah oh </connor>
<connor> because you could because they they'd </connor>
<garnt> always know someone you could just be </garnt>
<joey> like oh can we camp and it maybe it'd be </joey>
<joey> like a 10 or a night okay because they </joey>
<joey> didn't really want anything they were </joey>
<connor> just like don't just leave a mess just </connor>
<joey> clean everything out because you can't </joey>
<joey> do that in australia it needs to be in </joey>
<joey> like like a national reserve no you can </joey>
<connor> actually </connor>
<joey> you can do whatever you want on the land </joey>
<joey> so and normally you're right next to </joey>
<garnt> woods and stuff so yeah obviously </garnt>
<garnt> there's no power outlets or anything and </garnt>
<garnt> you're probably a decent walk away from </garnt>
<joey> the car that you came in yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so yeah it was just good fun though </joey>
<joey> i mean you just normally just set up the </joey>
<joey> tent if you can get a fire going go </joey>
<joey> ahead but it might be raining a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> time and you might have to start </joey>
<joey> drinking beers in the tent like if you </joey>
<joey> squished in this tent like how you guys </joey>
<joey> doing </joey>
<joey> all right nice someone want to ball the </joey>
<joey> kettle uh get some pot noodles going </joey>
<joey> you know uh whatever whatever you do we </joey>
<connor> did like uh </connor>
<connor> uh duke of edinburgh as well we did that </connor>
<joey> oh yeah that was good fun as well yeah </joey>
<joey> because in japan you can't even like put </joey>
<garnt> a fire on the ground </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you need this like fire </garnt>
<connor> because sometimes in some places you'd </connor>
<garnt> clean up after yourself and it was </garnt>
<garnt> easier to just bring something that you </garnt>
<garnt> could wrap the like all the ash in right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah which is like i think we </garnt>
<garnt> did that a few times because it's just </garnt>
<connor> because if you have to clean it up </connor>
<connor> sometimes it's an absolute pain in the </connor>
<joey> ass getting rid of all this ash well </joey>
<joey> because in australia all you did was </joey>
<connor> just dig a hole </connor>
<connor> and then once it was once you were done </connor>
<joey> with the ash you just fill up that hole </joey>
<connor> again i mean it's good for the land but </connor>
<joey> i mean sometimes you can't do that in </joey>
<joey> some places </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean it's whatever i just kind of </joey>
<joey> like it was never more than like two </joey>
<joey> nights it was always like a night yeah </joey>
<joey> put the tent up </joey>
<joey> kind of get drunk </joey>
<joey> yeah eat a lot of bacon in the morning </joey>
<joey> and baking sandwiches yeah yeah two </joey>
<connor> nights i feel is like the optimal </connor>
<garnt> camping time yeah i'd say so two nights </garnt>
<joey> is about right it depends because you </joey>
<connor> need something to do the second day yeah </connor>
<joey> cause the first night you you're setting </joey>
<joey> up you're having a few drinks what do </joey>
<joey> you do during the whole second day </joey>
<joey> before you start drinking you can't you </joey>
<joey> can't immediately get like start </joey>
<joey> drinking beers at like 11. i mean that's </joey>
<garnt> what we did that's kind of what we did i </garnt>
<joey> mean </joey>
<joey> i guess but then there's someone like </joey>
<joey> driving right no i don't know i mean i i </joey>
<connor> kind of want to do something i don't </connor>
<joey> know yeah well that's when you can bring </joey>
<joey> the tv and connect it to the power </joey>
<joey> outlet yeah well because it's sorry if </joey>
<connor> you could who's got the switch </connor>
<connor> with british people you know and there's </connor>
<joey> like four of you like a 24 pack sorry </joey>
<joey> smash so much that a 24 pack won't last </joey>
<joey> like more than a night that's true </joey>
<joey> so it's like how much beer are you </joey>
<joey> bringing along for this thing right you </joey>
<joey> can't do day drinking that's like you </joey>
<joey> need like 40 beers at least for that </joey>
<joey> whole experience </joey>
<joey> but i mean that's why i like doing </joey>
<connor> something </connor>
<joey> uh that's why i like i mean we have we </joey>
<joey> brought like a pack of cards and like </joey>
<joey> you know that kind of stuff i mean we </joey>
<joey> never cracked them open </joey>
<connor> we just left them there for like </connor>
<garnt> decorations i was just having too much </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] fun with the fire </joey>
<joey> i was on fire </joey>
<connor> enthusiastic </connor>
<connor> this is fire burning like 24 7. yeah </connor>
<joey> well you're twenty four seven it was </joey>
<garnt> bernie for like a good like 14 hours </garnt>
<garnt> jesus christ just because we [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> adventured out and got all the wood </joey>
<joey> right that's half that was half the fun </joey>
<connor> like what did you do the second day when </connor>
<connor> you said you you slept in the tent the </connor>
<connor> first night no no no no we didn't we </connor>
<garnt> didn't sleep in the first night because </garnt>
<joey> we we got there like super super early </joey>
<joey> on the second day um because we the </joey>
<joey> first day was raining like crazy the </joey>
<joey> first day we missed the day of camping </joey>
<joey> so we did what anyone do and just had a </joey>
<garnt> nice day at an onsen yeah and slept at </garnt>
<garnt> with a nice roof over our heads um </garnt>
<garnt> and then we just went there the second </garnt>
<garnt> day and we just basically stayed there </garnt>
<joey> all day yeah we got there like 9 a.m or </joey>
<joey> something yeah like super early in the </joey>
<joey> morning so it was like a full full day </joey>
<connor> because i was in like the area near you </connor>
<connor> and the storm was [ __ ] brutal oh yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean the storm in tokyo was brutal as </joey>
<connor> well yeah i don't know </connor>
<joey> i i was like i was kayaking and then i </joey>

<joey> rumbling everywhere yeah and then </joey>
<joey> suddenly i'm just like kayaking just </joey>

<connor> and lakes and stuff like that but i </connor>
<joey> don't think i've ever been kayaking </joey>

<joey> something about the ocean just scares me </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> i mean like the the ocean is just scary </garnt>
<connor> right it's it's very nice like normally </connor>

<joey> japan as you know japan is like the </joey>
<connor> neverending cesspool of paperwork get </connor>
<connor> the paper done paperwork done when it's </connor>
<joey> not stressful so that when you work </joey>

<joey> told me that it's like way harder to </joey>
<joey> start snowboarding like yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> beginners find it easier to ski but it's </joey>
<joey> like harder to master yeah whereas </joey>
<joey> snowboarding is </joey>
<joey> harder to get into but easier to master </joey>
<joey> from what i understand </joey>
<joey> i think that's true yeah yeah and i </joey>
<joey> guess like so </joey>
<joey> my first experience snowboarding was </joey>
<connor> that it was okay i didn't realize how </connor>
<connor> much i took for granted friction </connor>
<connor> in my life okay like i i </connor>
<connor> i'm so gone how so so </connor>
<connor> like i remember the first time um so we </connor>
<joey> got all dressed up i put on all the kit </joey>
<joey> and everything uh put on put on the </joey>
<joey> snowboard on like one shoe or one foot </joey>
<joey> or however like you lock yourself in </joey>
<joey> yeah and then so my first mission was to </joey>
<joey> walk from where i put my snowboard on to </joey>
<joey> the ski lift yeah i remember trying to </joey>
<joey> take trying to take my first step </joey>
<garnt> immediately slip and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> this is a bit of a challenge in it </garnt>
<garnt> wait so you're telling me i'm gonna have </garnt>
<garnt> to go down a [ __ ] hill when i can't </garnt>
<joey> even take a single step </joey>
<joey> because it's the type of movement you </joey>
<joey> never do otherwise it just seems it just </joey>
<garnt> it's so unnatural yeah right and um so i </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] waddle my way over to the ski </garnt>
<connor> lift did you have your snowboard on or </connor>
<garnt> is it like like you're carrying a </garnt>
<joey> snowboard i had my snowboard on i think </joey>
<joey> you had the one one boot </joey>
<joey> begin a ski lift and uh i was with uh </joey>
<garnt> sydney and maelyn and malin's partner </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<connor> and um </connor>
<connor> a good time yeah milan wasn't having a </connor>
<garnt> good time either </garnt>
<garnt> um so only one of us knew how to </garnt>
<garnt> snowboard and so only one of us was like </garnt>
<garnt> showing us how it was done and melin </garnt>
<garnt> melen knows how to ski but this was her </garnt>
<joey> first time trying to snowboard either </joey>
<joey> right as well so we we were i at least i </joey>
<joey> had like a fellow novice with me right </joey>
<joey> i'm not the only one </joey>
<joey> and so we waddle over to this uh ski </joey>
<joey> lift right and so to go to go through </joey>
<joey> the gates we have to like you know scan </joey>
<joey> ourselves in </joey>
<joey> right and i'd like the problem with </joey>
<joey> being like having this big snowboard on </joey>
<garnt> you is that once i start like taking a </garnt>
<garnt> step sometimes i don't know how to stop </garnt>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> so there was this [ __ ] kid in front </garnt>
<garnt> of me right there was this kid [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> pro snowboarder like easily goes through </garnt>
<garnt> the gate i like go through the gate take </garnt>
<joey> my first step and i swear to god i </joey>
<connor> always i almost fall on this kid </connor>
<joey> yeah i almost took out this [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> five-year-old in front of me yeah </connor>
<connor> frankly had it come </connor>
<connor> coming luckily like luckily mackie just </connor>
<joey> like grabbed me before like i fell on </joey>
<joey> this kid i was like </joey>
<joey> god i'm </joey>
<joey> at this point i hadn't even got onto the </joey>
<joey> ski lift yeah um and so </joey>
<garnt> that's the first step that's that's the </garnt>
<connor> first step </connor>
<joey> i was on my way and i was texting how's </joey>
<connor> it going how's it going like it's it's </connor>
<garnt> hard yeah it's really hard it's hard </garnt>
<garnt> it's really </garnt>
<joey> it's really difficult to full face first </joey>
<joey> up with skis yeah because you how the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] you gonna do that yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> snowboard is very easy oh yeah yeah it's </joey>
<joey> almost guaranteed you're gonna fall face </joey>
<garnt> first </garnt>
<garnt> okay so i i i what are my my waddle my </garnt>
<joey> way to the ski lift </joey>
<joey> and i've never obviously this is my </joey>
<joey> first time on the ski lift i've never </joey>
<joey> like i don't know what the right </joey>
<joey> technique is or like how to like you </joey>
<joey> because you don't think about this thing </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> walking easy one one foot forward next </joey>
<joey> foot forward it was like it was like i </joey>
<joey> was a baby trying to figure out how to </joey>
<joey> walk again </joey>
<joey> so i'm i'm like it's taking like all of </joey>
<joey> my mental energy just to figure out how </joey>
<joey> to stay on two feet </joey>
<joey> and then i so the person tells me to </joey>
<joey> like go to this point here where the ski </joey>
<garnt> lift is going to go and like take you up </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just thinking this is this is </garnt>
<garnt> like this is like i i've never like </garnt>
<garnt> panicked before trying to figure out how </garnt>
<garnt> to waddle like literally one meter </garnt>
<connor> forward yeah that was probably a bit </connor>
<joey> mean of him to make you get on a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> ski lift yeah first thing you should </joey>
<connor> have just gone like walked up the hill a </connor>
<joey> little bit and just tried to go down or </joey>
<joey> at least get on the ski lift holding </joey>
<garnt> your snowboard right yeah can you do </garnt>
<joey> that yeah you can do that yeah </joey>
<joey> but clearly no one told you that you </joey>
<garnt> could do that millions husband was like </garnt>
<connor> nah trial by fire </connor>
<garnt> will be the option yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay i didn't yeah i literally didn't </garnt>
<connor> know that it wasn't normally normally </connor>
<connor> yeah you are supposed to when you with </connor>
<joey> like beginners on snowboard what you </joey>
<joey> make them do is you just kind of make </joey>
<garnt> them walk up a hill yeah like a very </garnt>
<garnt> very like not steep hill yeah yeah just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of make them like go down yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> straight like </joey>
<joey> like horizontal horizontal yeah </joey>
<joey> perpendicular sorry to the slope uh but </joey>
<connor> that was very much uh wow okay mike was </connor>
<garnt> like [ __ ] that on the skillet right now </garnt>
<garnt> so i was i was kind of like um i was </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like like a [ __ ] animal </garnt>
<garnt> looking over the edge being like okay </garnt>
<garnt> gotta go gotta go no don't wanna go okay </garnt>
<garnt> let's go now and uh so i'm like i say a </garnt>
<joey> waddle um this was like me for trying to </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ice skate over to to like one </joey>
<joey> meter ahead of me and just stay still </joey>
<joey> enough for the ski lift to like lift my </joey>
<joey> butt up and go up so </joey>
<joey> managed to do that luckily without </joey>
<joey> without any big massive incidents but </joey>
<joey> then comes the next step but then </joey>
<joey> and how about you get down </joey>
<joey> i was having a great time i was like </joey>
<joey> okay you know what this [ __ ] this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] slaps look at this view look at </joey>
<joey> this like i'm having a great [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> time it's like being it's like being on </joey>
<joey> a being on a roller coaster you know </joey>
<joey> when you when you're growing up you're </joey>
<joey> just enjoying the view it's peaceful i'm </joey>
<connor> just like okay i can get into </connor>
<connor> snowboarding um </connor>
<connor> this is pretty cool um and then i get </connor>
<joey> and then i see </joey>
<joey> um where the exit is and it's it's it </joey>
<joey> gets closer and closer and then it </joey>
<joey> slowly dawns on me how do i get off </joey>
<joey> how do i how do i exit this seat that </joey>
<joey> i'm currently sitting on right now </joey>
<joey> and i see i see the kid in front of me </joey>
<joey> gets off no problem at all and i'm just </joey>
<joey> like that looks easy that looks easy i </joey>
<joey> just i just you know i just use the </joey>
<joey> momentum that the seat is carrying me </joey>
<joey> through and i just slide it just and </joey>
<joey> just slide off right and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> cool i'm like i'm like i'm like shadow </joey>
<garnt> boxing right because i'm just i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like visualizing this in my head i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like how hard can this possibly be </garnt>
<connor> right right how hard can this possibly </connor>
<connor> be like in the shower </connor>
<garnt> i was literally psyching myself up </garnt>
<garnt> and i was just like sure i can do that </garnt>
<garnt> like if if a five-year-old kid can do it </garnt>
<garnt> then i can do it yeah and so literally </garnt>
<connor> the first thing that happens is </connor>
<connor> um the </connor>
<connor> the lift goes up it starts slowing down </connor>
<connor> i'm like brilliant i'm not i'm not even </connor>
<connor> gonna need to do this at full speed it's </connor>
<garnt> going at like naught point we're gonna </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] launch you off </connor>
<garnt> i have no idea right i i i thought you </garnt>
<garnt> just had to use the momentum just </garnt>
<garnt> i had no [ __ ] clue but honestly i </garnt>
<garnt> think i would have preferred that </garnt>
<garnt> because now i had zero momentum and i'm </garnt>
<connor> just like [ __ ] how do i position my feet </connor>
<connor> right and by the time i get to the point </connor>
<connor> where i need to get off i hadn't figured </connor>
<connor> out how i was gonna do this so literally </connor>
<connor> the first thing that happens is i'm i </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<garnt> i put both feet down i literally tried </garnt>
<connor> huh horizontal like that yeah like that </connor>
<garnt> so i was just like i was like okay so i </garnt>
<joey> was like first mistake i was i was like </joey>
<joey> okay what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> put both feet down twist and then put </joey>
<joey> one of my first one </joey>
<joey> on on the snowboard and just slightly </joey>
<joey> and just breezily just like slide down </joey>
<joey> yeah um so that so obviously obviously </joey>
<garnt> that didn't work out right first </garnt>
<garnt> what i did was i put first two feet down </garnt>
<joey> stood up immediate face plan </joey>
<joey> because there's this thing behind you </joey>
<joey> that's pushing you forward </joey>
<connor> yeah you got to like shiv to the side </connor>
<connor> like this yeah you got to shoot me like </connor>
<joey> that and then kind of go down like that </joey>
<garnt> you know it would be nice if someone was </garnt>
<connor> there to teach me how it was done </connor>
<connor> i would not have done that to you if i </connor>
<connor> was there have told you how they have </connor>
<garnt> done it but the thing is here's the </garnt>
<joey> thing right we apparently went on the </joey>
<joey> beginner slope right yeah </joey>
<joey> and then </joey>
<joey> yeah that was that that was like there </joey>
<joey> was no way that this was the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> beginner slide and we found out </joey>
<joey> afterwards um on the second day because </joey>
<joey> me and melin um we we we weren't having </joey>
<joey> a great time trying to go down </joey>
<joey> and apparently we found the next day </joey>
<joey> that there was a slope that was </joey>
<joey> dedicated to like people's first time </joey>
<joey> trying snowboarding right right no we </joey>
<joey> didn't go on that one we went we went on </joey>
<garnt> the [ __ ] beginner slope which was </garnt>
<garnt> people who had already been experienced </garnt>
<joey> enough to go downhill right right </joey>
<garnt> so it was me maelyn sydney and marky on </garnt>
<garnt> the top of this hill maki just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> bolts it down already yeah right </garnt>
<joey> and screaming at us </joey>
<connor> really [ __ ] funny </connor>
<connor> you're getting like legitimately like </connor>
<joey> frustrated oh my god they were like bad </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah and my good just get </joey>
<connor> good like what do you mean just just go </connor>
<connor> down yeah just go down </connor>
<connor> just go straight it's not hard </connor>
<garnt> and maki goes down first and tries to </garnt>
<garnt> like goad the rest of us into going down </garnt>
<joey> i'm just like you know what guys i'm </joey>
<joey> just i'm just i'm just i'm gonna go i'm </joey>
<joey> gonna do a pro gamer move and i'm just </joey>
<joey> gonna go down </joey>
<joey> immediately start tumbling [ __ ] down </joey>
<garnt> like i i i must like front flip five </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] times </connor>
<joey> and i'm just like ah </joey>
<garnt> damn snow just like in my mind i thought </garnt>
<garnt> snow is going to cushion the fall and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like man this hurts way more </garnt>
<garnt> than i thought it was going to do it </garnt>
<garnt> does cushion but like 30 yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's because all of the snow that you're </connor>
<connor> you're like snowboarding on it's been </connor>
<joey> like plowed yeah it's compact it's like </joey>
<joey> jumping off your bed onto a very flat </joey>
<garnt> pillow yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it'll cushion you but to what extent </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah i'm just like i'm just like i </connor>
<connor> i had this image in my mind that i was </connor>
<joey> just like oh it's just like </joey>
<joey> tumbling </joey>
<joey> it's just like falling on clouds and i </joey>
<joey> remember </joey>
<joey> because and because of that i like when </joey>
<joey> i first went down i i did not hold back </joey>
<joey> as well i just like [ __ ] went as fast </joey>
<joey> as i can not realizing that jesus christ </joey>
<garnt> not realizing that i i didn't know how </garnt>
<garnt> to break </garnt>
<garnt> and so and so quickly i kind of before i </garnt>
<garnt> before i learned how to break um i </garnt>
<garnt> quickly realized that the easiest way to </garnt>
<connor> break was just to fall down oh yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean that's what they teach you at </joey>
<connor> first right it's like to fall down </connor>
<connor> probably there's a reason why like when </connor>
<joey> you if you start young particularly in </joey>
<joey> skiing and snowboarding you're going to </joey>
<joey> be really [ __ ] like you're going to </joey>
<joey> be so much better than somebody learned </joey>
<joey> later on just because like when you're a </joey>
<joey> kid you're fearless yeah exactly yeah </joey>
<joey> kids don't [ __ ] know danger like when </joey>
<joey> i was a kid i was i was going way too </joey>
<joey> fast and i would just go straight down </joey>
<joey> because i was [ __ ] stupid that's what </joey>
<joey> like i was just like this is fun i love </joey>
<joey> going like a hundred miles per hour yeah </joey>
<joey> that's a good idea yeah </joey>
<joey> that's that's how people die there's no </joey>
<joey> danger here yeah </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] this hurts yeah i'm not doing </joey>
<joey> that again </joey>
<joey> and so melian and sydney see me [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> tumbling down this hill and then i look </joey>
<joey> up and making's like all right your turn </joey>
<joey> now and they're just like </joey>
<joey> no i don't think i will and so they </joey>
<joey> start like getting on their butts and </joey>
<joey> just like sliding it just like slowly </joey>
<garnt> sliding down and mark is like no come on </garnt>
<joey> guys come on get up just get good get up </joey>
<connor> there's a slide i have to go obviously </connor>
<joey> because i learned young and i was very </joey>
<joey> fortunate very lucky very privileged to </joey>
<joey> be able to learn you know how to ski at </joey>
<joey> snowboard at a young age yeah </joey>
<joey> the one thing that kind of like i don't </joey>
<joey> mind doing it because i'd rather go with </joey>
<joey> my friends than not but like it does </joey>
<joey> suck have enough weight like 30 40 </joey>
<connor> minutes you go down a slope takes you 30 </connor>
<connor> seconds yeah you've got to wait 40 </connor>
<connor> minutes for your friends to come down </connor>
<connor> then you're like right let's go on the </connor>
<joey> beginner one again </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> are literally psyching themselves up on </joey>
<garnt> this hill for like a good like 40 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes to an hour right mainland that </garnt>
<garnt> they were they were on this beginner </garnt>
<joey> hill like this which </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<garnt> but it was probably like that okay all i </garnt>
<garnt> knew was that i i stood up for a second </garnt>
<connor> and i started going way faster than i </connor>
<garnt> was comfortable with that was that that </garnt>
<joey> was that's called the hill </joey>
<connor> yeah because at the ski resort we were </connor>
<connor> at one of the like the black diamond one </connor>
<joey> of them was like only 30 degrees oh </joey>
<joey> that's not even that bad wasn't that </joey>
<joey> which is like that </joey>
<joey> so realistic it was probably like five </joey>
<connor> degrees it was i mean okay i get it </connor>
<joey> because you could get a lot you can go </joey>
<joey> pretty fast it it feels like especially </joey>
<connor> when you're not used to that when you </connor>
<joey> can see the bottom it looks way worse </joey>
<joey> than it is percent hundred percent come </joey>
<connor> on i don't know man </connor>
<joey> well i'll give you the benefit yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> okay it was the first time for you so </joey>
<garnt> again </garnt>
<garnt> the beginning of the hill was like quite </garnt>
<garnt> steep but then you got around to the </garnt>
<garnt> middle part which is the actual which i </garnt>
<garnt> feel was the actual beginner's slope </garnt>
<connor> right because this this hill obviously </connor>
<connor> wasn't even in like </connor>
<connor> what's what's what's the word i'm </connor>
<joey> looking for altitude </joey>
<connor> slow slope </connor>
<joey> angle gradient gradient that's that's it </joey>
<joey> it wasn't equal in great work so like </joey>
<garnt> the best part to learn on this beginner </garnt>
<garnt> hill was like right in like the middle </garnt>
<connor> of this course where he went like a in </connor>
<connor> like around like that like it did like a </connor>
<garnt> loop-de-loop yeah yeah yeah yeah so the </garnt>
<garnt> best part to learn was actually in the </garnt>
<connor> in the middle part which is </connor>
<connor> how i learned how to like control my </connor>
<connor> speed and turn yeah and turn because i i </connor>
<connor> had two like going down this hill for </connor>
<connor> the first time i had two speeds it was </connor>
<connor> go and tumble </connor>
<joey> that was the two speeds that i had so </joey>
<joey> um so i </joey>
<joey> while waiting for sydney and naylan </joey>
<joey> when on youtube and stuff like </joey>
<joey> i'm looking at some tutorials about how </joey>
<connor> to show boys </connor>
<garnt> i want to be that guy who like slowly </garnt>
<joey> who like slides past you and i'm just </joey>
<joey> like what's this guy doing </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<garnt> yeah because the the thing about maki is </garnt>
<garnt> that he's a good snowboarder but i don't </garnt>
<garnt> think he knows how to explain how to </garnt>
<connor> snowboard because i was asking maki maki </connor>
<connor> what's the right what's the like the </connor>
<connor> right technique yeah he's very much just </connor>
<connor> like i'll just do it just go yeah </connor>
<joey> it's very much just oh you just go like </joey>
<joey> this and like this </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> you know that clip of like that like </joey>
<joey> australian surfer or not australian but </joey>
<garnt> just that stuff who's just like and it </garnt>
<garnt> goes </garnt>
<joey> that was kind of like appeared it's so </joey>
<joey> beautiful </joey>
<garnt> that's that's kind of what i heard when </garnt>
<joey> i when maki was trying to explain to me </joey>
<joey> how to snowball </joey>
<joey> oh you just go like this and then you </joey>
<joey> turn like this and then you control your </joey>
<garnt> speed like this and i'm just like maki </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like showing me like </garnt>
<garnt> different angles here it means this </garnt>
<connor> means nothing it sucks because it's like </connor>
<connor> you have to learn to like put your body </connor>
<connor> in the place where your body doesn't </connor>
<joey> want to naturally be right because you </joey>
<connor> have to put all your weight in your </connor>
<connor> front foot which means you're going to </connor>
<connor> be leaning into the hill which yeah you </connor>
<connor> lean into it you don't want to do it </connor>
<joey> just naturally </joey>
<connor> you don't do that yeah and then you're </connor>
<connor> going to like throw your body from side </connor>
<joey> to side with your back leg yeah it's </joey>
<joey> it's it is a weird move if you haven't </joey>
<connor> done it before it feels really unnatural </connor>
<joey> like initially because it's like and </joey>
<joey> that's why the first time like after you </joey>
<garnt> finish the next day or you [ __ ] feel </garnt>
<garnt> that because you're using all these </garnt>
<garnt> muscles you've never used yeah i i we </garnt>
<garnt> actually had the snowboard thing </garnt>
<garnt> snowboarding trip for like two days but </garnt>
<joey> i could only go one day oh yeah because </joey>
<garnt> the second day you're [ __ ] right oh i </garnt>
<garnt> was i i never felt more [ __ ] in my </garnt>
<joey> life yeah i feel that yeah on this like </joey>
<connor> beginner slope i don't know which </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] sick [ __ ] decided to do this but </connor>
<garnt> i was like that's funny but also my god </garnt>
<garnt> on this beginner slope right it's like </garnt>
<garnt> this very narrow kind of like uh like a </garnt>
<garnt> hill going down like winding yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> and at the bottom of this this wind the </garnt>
<garnt> the exit to it someone had put poles </garnt>
<garnt> like a big x and the and it was open </garnt>
<joey> right so you could go on it but the only </joey>
<joey> way that you could avoid these polls was </joey>
<joey> to jump over them in the middle and </joey>
<joey> or go under them or go under them which </joey>
<joey> you weren't going to do because yeah the </joey>
<joey> gap okay so the gap to jump over was </joey>
<joey> like this yeah </joey>
<connor> but when you're a beginner or you even </connor>
<joey> even if you're like your board is not </joey>
<connor> coming off the scene yeah it's hard to </connor>
<connor> get if you're not experienced doing any </connor>
<joey> kind of jump on a snowboard yeah lifting </joey>
<joey> your board up for considerable amount of </joey>
<garnt> time is unnatural and hard to do yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's heavy yeah it's like this right so </joey>
<garnt> there's no way you'll get maybe like </garnt>
<joey> this right yeah like this it was like </joey>
<garnt> that off the ground yeah and so i i was </garnt>
<joey> like all right just jump over it gone so </joey>
<joey> i i went i jumped over it and my board </joey>
<joey> like just clipped it a little bit yeah </joey>
<joey> and i was like oh [ __ ] turn around god </joey>

<joey> i'm just gonna fall down and hopefully </joey>
<joey> i'll like learn something new every time </joey>
<joey> yeah like there's only so many ways you </joey>
<joey> can fall down before you figure out a </joey>
<joey> way to not fall down right of course um </joey>
<joey> and so i remember seeing like i remember </joey>
<joey> seeing these crosses in the middle of </joey>
<joey> like this course that i was going down </joey>

<garnt> good </garnt>
<joey> because i was basically i was basically </joey>
<garnt> just following like my face backwards he </garnt>
<joey> must have been so creeped out just like </joey>
<joey> going backwards down the slope like this </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah just checking make sure what </joey>
<joey> he was doing </joey>
<joey> i should watch him go into it </joey>
<garnt> i got mackie back i took mackie down </garnt>
<garnt> like this slope that was ridiculous yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was like oh because because they all </garnt>
<connor> stopped and meline quit and i was like </connor>
<garnt> all right mackie let's go down </garnt>

<connor> william </connor>
<connor> marlene came back the second day i was </connor>
<garnt> like i'm returning guys it's like lord </garnt>
<garnt> of the rings so he came back finally did </garnt>
<garnt> like one slope </garnt>
<garnt> i'm done </garnt>
<garnt> like she also had the choice to </garnt>
<garnt> snowboard or ski yeah right and after </garnt>
<garnt> about like one attempt on going down </garnt>
<garnt> this beginner slope on the snowboard she </garnt>
<garnt> quits and just tries skiing again and </garnt>
<connor> then quick with she's getting it because </connor>
<connor> she couldn't do it </connor>
<joey> skiing is easy right guys </joey>
<connor> she's like i know how to do it dude </connor>
<joey> yeah then bailey came back the next day </joey>
<joey> i was like guys because he only did like </joey>
<joey> two slopes yeah yeah the first day she </joey>
<joey> was like i'm going to come back and do </joey>
<joey> snowboarding again i'm ready to try it i </joey>
<joey> can do it did like one thing and then i </joey>
<connor> gave up </connor>
<connor> but at least she did try again a second </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i did try again the second day actually </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember </garnt>
<connor> um so i i went like all out on the first </connor>
<joey> day right i i like because i remember i </joey>
<joey> didn't [ __ ] i was [ __ ] i didn't </joey>
<connor> realize how tired i was because we we </connor>
<connor> went down the slope like a bunch of </connor>
<connor> times i was there all day yeah took </connor>
<joey> a lot of tumbles on the first day and i </joey>
<joey> i was i was so ready for the second day </joey>
<joey> because i'm just like by the end of the </joey>
<joey> first day i was just at the point where </joey>
<joey> i was when i was getting the hang of it </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah so i was like [ __ ] yes day two </joey>
<joey> let's go yeah i opened my eyes on day </joey>
<joey> two and it was like i felt like i was </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] got punched by mike tyson or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that right i like i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't realize that the thing that hurt </garnt>
<garnt> the most was my </garnt>
<connor> neck right because you've been hitting </connor>
<joey> your neck a bunch yeah yeah because </joey>
<garnt> because whiplash yeah i didn't realize </garnt>
<joey> that whiplash was a thing with when you </joey>
<garnt> tumble that much but now i know that </garnt>
<connor> whiplash is definitely a thing you </connor>
<connor> should have got a helmet as well they </connor>
<connor> didn't </connor>
<garnt> oh that's [ __ ] dangerous jesus christ </garnt>
<garnt> they didn't give us helmets i don't </garnt>
<connor> think oh yeah when i saw them without </connor>
<connor> helmets i was like this is a terrible </connor>
<connor> idea </connor>
<connor> like i could i could i could go a whole </connor>
<connor> day without a helmet but like if i was </connor>
<connor> doing like hard stuff i would be very </connor>
<connor> like yeah i would probably i would i </connor>
<joey> would not go down like i mean if i went </joey>
<connor> again because the last time i went </connor>
<connor> snowboarding was like [ __ ] like six </connor>
<connor> years ago i would definitely get a </connor>
<joey> helmet just because like my body's not </joey>
<connor> used to it right yeah i didn't really </connor>
<joey> give [ __ ] i was with these guys on like </joey>
<joey> like the green slopes and blue slopes </joey>
<joey> and i was like yeah [ __ ] that's fine </joey>
<joey> but then like if i went down like i i </joey>
<joey> took uh you went down to like a black </joey>
<joey> diamond well yeah so i took mackie down </joey>
<joey> to black </joey>
<joey> i i was like oh okay so everyone </joey>
<joey> everyone had left and then it was mackie </joey>
<connor> who's the one calling them a coward and </connor>
<connor> i was like all right it's time let's go </connor>
<connor> and just let's go and do a real one and </connor>
<connor> there's a double black diamond which i </connor>
<joey> wanted to do but to clarify like black </joey>
<joey> diamond is like the hardest type of </joey>
<connor> course it's just like double black </connor>
<joey> diamond which is like the most extreme </joey>
<joey> yeah and i couldn't convince him to do </joey>
<connor> that because i think he was like oh no </connor>
<connor> he's like i'm good but i'm not like that </connor>
<joey> i was like okay i love how like </joey>
<garnt> something about snowboarding just turns </garnt>
<joey> every guy into a dude bro you know what </joey>
<garnt> i mean like yeah i can just imagine like </garnt>
<garnt> when god did that clean turn and kind of </garnt>
<joey> when i'm bringing my friends my biggest </joey>
<joey> worry is that they will hate it from </joey>
<joey> falling over too much and they don't </joey>
<joey> want to do it yeah yeah because then i'm </joey>
<joey> like what i can't bring my friends again </joey>
<joey> like yeah i can't go we can't go to the </joey>
<joey> alps you know we can't go to italy drink </joey>
<joey> espressos then hit the slopes yeah have </joey>
<joey> a few bevies in germany and hit the apps </joey>
<joey> you know they can't do that's what i </joey>
<joey> want to do so and then i was like yeah </joey>
<joey> it's just the boys now it's just me and </joey>
<joey> mackie i'm gonna take him down to black </joey>
<joey> and so i meant i found one where that i </joey>
<connor> he definitely didn't want to do i was </connor>
<connor> like come on cost it </connor>
<joey> i'll be fine i'll be fine knowing monkey </joey>
<joey> he can't say no yeah he was like ah he's </joey>
<connor> like i wanted to do a harder song but </connor>
<joey> like not this hard i'm like i'll be fine </joey>
<joey> literally like this slope you can't see </joey>
<joey> the bottom of it like you can't see over </joey>
<joey> it until you start going down yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like that steep yeah and then when i </joey>
<joey> started going on it i was like oh i </joey>
<joey> think this is closed </joey>
<joey> because it hadn't been treated at all it </joey>
<joey> was like all ice it was all steep ice </joey>
<joey> like crevices and like it was so steep </joey>
<joey> that when you would go off a little bit </joey>
<joey> you would fall and </joey>
<joey> yeah crevice right nice it was it took </joey>
<joey> all my [ __ ] energy to get down this </joey>
<joey> thing without falling over that's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] terrifying i was absolutely </joey>
<garnt> exhausted i don't really get tired when </garnt>
<garnt> i go on like blue or red ones because i </garnt>
<garnt> don't really have to use that much work </garnt>
<garnt> i kind of get crazy but on the really </garnt>
<garnt> tough ones the amount you're turning you </garnt>
<joey> have to constantly turn and throw your </joey>
<joey> body where it doesn't the board is like </joey>
<joey> no no we can't turn on this it's too </joey>
<joey> steep yeah yeah you have to force it </joey>
<joey> otherwise you're going too fast so i'm </joey>
<joey> like i'm like knackered and then i look </joey>
<joey> up and i see maggie just he gets up </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] pop like falls over gets up </joey>
<garnt> falls over gets up falls through i was </garnt>
<garnt> like oh my god malian's gonna [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> kill me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah really thought i like killed him </garnt>
<connor> she was like oh my god oh my god </connor>
<garnt> connor's gonna kill him yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> gonna cause that was on the second day </garnt>
<connor> right yeah yeah cause like uh we we went </connor>
<connor> our separate ways on the second day </connor>
<connor> because i you know i woke up felt like </connor>
<joey> everything was aching everything felt </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] but i was just like no i'm i'm </joey>
<joey> i'm a still guy i'm sorry you're still </joey>
<joey> pumped i'm just i'm still pumped because </joey>
<joey> i really really wanted a second day so i </joey>
<joey> was like oh </joey>
<joey> easy fight through the pain what it's </joey>
<connor> just just a bit of muscle ache right you </connor>
<connor> can get through a bit of muscle ache so </connor>
<connor> these guys go off to like a completely </connor>
<connor> different course yeah yeah there's like </connor>
<connor> two sides of the mouth yeah that was </connor>
<connor> like two sides of the mouth so these </connor>
<connor> guys got a completely different course </connor>
<connor> and i'm just like great i'll just be </connor>
<joey> left to my own devices and </joey>
<joey> by the end of this day i'm going to </joey>
<garnt> conquer this beginner hill right because </garnt>
<joey> i i felt like </joey>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> uh sydney had given up by then um and </garnt>
<garnt> everyone else was on this other hill and </garnt>
<garnt> on the second day it was actually like </garnt>
<garnt> almost empty compared to the first day </garnt>
<garnt> because the first day was like i think </garnt>
<garnt> like it was like a sunday wasn't it or </garnt>
<garnt> like a saturday ah yeah it must have </garnt>
<garnt> been it was it was like a public holiday </garnt>
<garnt> and the second day wasn't a public </garnt>
<garnt> holiday so like the slaves were like </garnt>
<garnt> almost empty </garnt>
<garnt> conditions as well there's like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> ton of snow and it was like perfectly </garnt>
<connor> clear oh no sun was out it was like </connor>
<garnt> perfect yeah it's nice </garnt>
<garnt> so i i so i get up to the beginning of </garnt>
<garnt> slope on the second day everything </garnt>
<joey> aching as [ __ ] and i'm just like it's </joey>
<joey> fine all i need to do is like tumble </joey>
<joey> once and i'll just like fight through </joey>
<joey> the pain and you know get it get it over </joey>
<joey> with so like i go down right uh i go i </joey>
<joey> start going down this beginning he'll </joey>
<joey> get further than i did yesterday because </joey>
<joey> i got more used to it yeah and then i </joey>
<joey> tumble and i was like all right i i'm </joey>
<joey> like you know i expected this but like i </joey>
<joey> tumbled and i landed with my head like </joey>
<joey> downhill so like so like i was i was </joey>
<joey> like downhill like this yeah right </joey>
<garnt> and um </garnt>
<garnt> and then i i quickly realized oh </garnt>
<garnt> how do i get up </garnt>
<joey> right because because my neck my neck </joey>
<joey> muscles were not working at that point </joey>
<joey> so i i i could not lift my neck to go </joey>
<joey> like that i was not only like lift i was </joey>
<joey> i was lifting it not only like you know </joey>
<joey> even even when i was like perfectly flat </joey>
<joey> it was hard enough to lift my neck up no </joey>
<garnt> i was going against the hill as well to </garnt>
<garnt> lift my neck up so i quickly realized i </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't lift my neck up and i quickly </garnt>
<garnt> realized </garnt>
<garnt> how heavy my gear that i was wearing </garnt>
<connor> because what i would do is just if i'm </connor>
<connor> face down i just bring my board i do </connor>
<joey> like a flip you can do a flip but you </joey>
<joey> can also kind of just like tone your </joey>
<joey> body around like shimmy if you want to </joey>
<connor> be faster you can just [ __ ] yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah stamp it into this yeah i i i did </garnt>
<joey> not have enough ab strength at that time </joey>
<joey> that's how much like that's how much </joey>
<joey> like my everything was aching yeah of </joey>

<garnt> is on script everyone i was the best </garnt>
<joey> load my dad ever shot </joey>
<garnt> back to the [ __ ] video i kind of </garnt>
<garnt> realized quickly i was in a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> of a little bit of a pickle because i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know how i was going to get up </garnt>
<joey> with all this heavy gear so um what i </joey>
<joey> tried doing is just like slowly shimming </joey>
<joey> was like shimmering shimmying like my </joey>
<joey> body to be like horizontal or something </joey>
<joey> where i can get up um that took for that </joey>
<connor> took ages </connor>
<connor> i must have been there for like 40 </connor>
<connor> minutes right because no one helped you </connor>
<connor> no no that's that's that's the point </connor>
<connor> that's why i was there for like a good </connor>
<garnt> 20 minutes and i'd gotten around like </garnt>
<garnt> i'd say about 20 degrees </garnt>
<connor> because if i saw someone upside down i </connor>
<garnt> would go overboard </garnt>
<joey> about so after about uh so after about </joey>
<garnt> uh 20 degrees like someone someone skis </garnt>
<garnt> down and says are you okay do you need </garnt>
<garnt> any help and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> no i'm okay i think i got this </garnt>
<joey> so he goes okay um and he offers me a </joey>
<joey> hand and so </joey>
<joey> um i get up and uh i you know he helps </joey>
<joey> me sit back up </joey>
<joey> um and so i see i sit back up he goes </joey>
<joey> back over and i'm like okay i got this </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> i try shimmering a bit more slip like my </joey>
<joey> my body slips a bit and i'm like back </joey>
<joey> back in my back right and i never i i'd </joey>
<joey> never known how it felt to be like you </joey>
<joey> know you know when you see like a </joey>
<joey> tortoise on their back yeah they can't </joey>
<joey> get back up that's exactly how i felt </joey>
<joey> and so i </joey>
<joey> find you </joey>
<joey> so after another 20 minutes i finally </joey>
<joey> get to the point where my feet </joey>
<joey> is like my feet first down the hill and </joey>
<joey> i'm just like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] this i take off the snowboard and i </connor>
<joey> walk and i walk the rest of the way down </joey>
<garnt> there i am not going through that </garnt>
<connor> experience again i would do like </connor>
<connor> whatever it takes to not take the board </connor>
<connor> off i'm like i would do </connor>
<garnt> honestly that's what that's what i </garnt>
<garnt> thought but i'm just like it took me </garnt>
<connor> literally </connor>
<connor> 40 minutes i hate admitting defeat until </connor>
<joey> yeah there's nothing sadder than just </joey>
<garnt> like walking down while everyone's just </garnt>
<connor> shooting past you right yeah it was a it </connor>
<joey> was a depressing but you have to if you </joey>
<connor> have to do it yeah it's crazy like </connor>
<connor> everyone snowboards in japan it's really </connor>
<joey> weird in europe everyone skis yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah japan yeah for some reason no one </joey>
<connor> wears helmets no no one wears helmets </connor>
<joey> it's scary yeah it's and like the rental </joey>
<joey> place didn't even offer it no that's i </joey>
<garnt> it's like it's like an option you have </garnt>
<connor> to ask for it's nuts and i was like you </connor>
<garnt> don't offer helmets you know yeah cause </garnt>
<garnt> i got like the rental pack which was </garnt>
<joey> like apparently like the all-inclusive </joey>
<garnt> pack and they just yeah clearly not all </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> you know even like professionals wear </joey>
<joey> helmets you know what i mean like </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> but you never know what could happen </joey>
<joey> right because uh [ __ ] uh what was it </joey>
<joey> michael schumacher fell and hit a rock </joey>
<joey> didn't he and then he's like </joey>
<joey> he's in a like vegetative state now i </joey>
<garnt> think is he and he's like a really </garnt>
<garnt> experienced skier yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> and he just hit a rock yeah i don't know </connor>
<garnt> i guess i guess no yeah i guess nobody </garnt>
<connor> told me and i i wish i </connor>
<connor> turned up and i'm like oh god they don't </connor>
<joey> have helmets </joey>
<connor> i mean i mean </connor>
<joey> i i wish i had worn a helmet so i could </joey>
<connor> go the second day without feeling like </connor>
<connor> it would help with your neck as well </connor>
<connor> because yeah you'd have you wouldn't be </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> i wouldn't be like [ __ ] would it or </joey>
<joey> would it just be like extra weight on </joey>
<connor> your hands oh god </connor>
<connor> because i feel like that extra like </connor>
<joey> distance you go that the helmet off like </joey>
<joey> cushions oh that's true it definitely </joey>
<joey> helps yeah also though dude skiing and </joey>
<connor> then being able to get like a fat ramen </connor>
<connor> or a curry no damn that's good oh yeah </connor>
<joey> like that onsen you go to after a full </joey>
<connor> day of snowboarding is the best [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> feeling yeah it is the best sleeping </joey>
<connor> onsen in this place was just like a view </connor>
<garnt> of like </garnt>
<garnt> it was like an outdoor onset </garnt>
<connor> where you just viewed the mountains nice </connor>
<connor> i like refurbished it all as well yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah [ __ ] could feel like the snow </garnt>
<garnt> coming down </garnt>
<joey> take me back man take me back no this </joey>
<joey> old hopefully i'll i'll be able to join </joey>
<connor> you guys this year yeah yeah hell yeah </connor>
<connor> i do i want to ski so god damn much </connor>
<connor> like seasons i haven't done nearly as </connor>
<connor> much as i wanted to when i came here </connor>
<joey> yeah i [ __ ] did again like i haven't </joey>
<connor> gone snowboarding or skiing in like five </connor>
<connor> years yeah and it's supposed to be like </connor>
<connor> some of the best skiing in the world in </connor>
<joey> japan yeah some of the slopes i worked </joey>
<garnt> on is [ __ ] insane </garnt>
<garnt> i would i would just want an experience </garnt>
<garnt> where i'm not on my ass for literally </garnt>
<garnt> ninety percent of the day that's that </garnt>
<garnt> that would that would be a cool </garnt>
<connor> experience yeah like also just after you </connor>
<joey> after you're all like sore you know you </joey>
<joey> all go to the onsen then you go for the </joey>
<joey> meal and you get a bunch of beers oh </joey>
<joey> that's so good yeah yeah after ski beer </joey>
<connor> or snowboarding it's just like 100 yeah </connor>
<garnt> so it's like i feel like how long did it </garnt>
<connor> take you to learn snowboarding </connor>
<connor> so i always did skiings my my parents uh </connor>
<joey> took me um they do like the whole like </joey>
<joey> package holidays i [ __ ] i hated uh </joey>
<joey> skiing with because you'd ski in like </joey>
<joey> groups with like we did like bulgaria </joey>
<joey> where it's like dirt cheap to like do it </joey>
<joey> and uh you'd have been a group of other </joey>
<joey> like families and i didn't really enjoy </joey>
<joey> it because i was always like the </joey>
<joey> rebellious kid so i wanted to do my own </joey>
<joey> thing but to like go and like follow </joey>
<connor> along and and so i i i'd say it took me </connor>
<connor> like before i got like good enough to go </connor>
<connor> on any slope skiing it's like three </connor>
<connor> weeks </connor>
<connor> um and then i taught myself how to </connor>
<connor> snowboard </connor>
<joey> uh yeah because once you've gotten the </joey>
<joey> grasp of skiing it's very easy to kind </joey>
<joey> of because you you're already used to </joey>
<joey> the laughter it was still really </joey>
<garnt> difficult </garnt>
<garnt> it's still hard it like didn't make </garnt>
<garnt> sense in my head like not nothing can </garnt>
<garnt> prepare you for just how snowboarding </garnt>
<garnt> works because it really goes against </garnt>
<garnt> everything your mind has trained you for </garnt>
<joey> i mean especially the difference between </joey>
<joey> like skiing and snowboarding right </joey>
<joey> because like in skiing it's like if </joey>
<garnt> you're facing down the hill then you're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna go and if you're not then you've </garnt>
<connor> stopped it's the literal opposite with </connor>
<connor> snowboarding right you need to be facing </connor>
<garnt> the side to go and this way you stop but </garnt>
<connor> you know the thing that made me want to </connor>
<connor> change really badly was that i [ __ ] i'm </connor>
<joey> sure anyone who skis will know this the </joey>
<joey> shoes are just [ __ ] the worst the </joey>
<joey> worst you know and because because we </joey>
<joey> were concrete blocks because we were </joey>
<joey> doing because we were doing like you </joey>
<joey> know i'm really really grateful that my </joey>
<joey> parents took me on these like they were </joey>
<joey> like the cheapest skiing holidays you </joey>
<connor> could get right so we often stayed </connor>
<connor> really really far away from the places </connor>
<connor> and you have to put your ski shoes on </connor>
<garnt> yeah like you know kind of looks like </garnt>
<connor> kind of look like clown shoes yeah so </connor>
<connor> you put these shoes on like 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> before you'd like 10 minute walk from </connor>
<joey> the bus so you have to walk i'm like 13 </joey>
<joey> with my skis yeah i'm not that strong </joey>
<joey> yeah walking ten minutes with my skis in </joey>
<joey> these horrible things click clock click </joey>
<joey> and then you have to wait on the bus for </joey>
<joey> 20 minutes i need to walk another like </joey>
<joey> five minutes and it's just like i hated </joey>
<joey> it yeah and then i was like you know </joey>
<joey> what i hate these shoes so goddamn much </joey>
<connor> it's so painful wearing them it's </connor>
<joey> everything about these suck they </joey>
<joey> absolutely destroy your anger yes and i </joey>
<connor> was like i don't care what it takes i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna learn to snowboard for those god </connor>
<connor> because you just get boots yeah the </connor>
<joey> first time i was snowboarding boots i </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<joey> i can walk normally you know when you're </joey>
<joey> at the restaurant you know you see these </joey>
<joey> people with their trays like clocking </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> oh don't mind me just getting a beer </joey>
<joey> i'll take that thank you very much you </joey>
<joey> know it's like you just get so much more </joey>
<joey> freedom and so much chiller like i don't </joey>
<joey> know you haven't got poles to carry and </joey>
<joey> so that's why i wanted to learn it i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] sucked first three days i just </joey>
<joey> kept falling over oh yeah so yeah me my </joey>
<joey> little brother did it at the same time </joey>
<garnt> and my little brother sprained his ankle </garnt>
<joey> like first day yeah gave up and i was </joey>
<joey> like nah i'm determined i'd say </joey>
<joey> snowboarding the first week that i did </joey>
<garnt> it i was pretty [ __ ] i could go down a </garnt>
<joey> black slope by the end but i was doing </joey>
<joey> it really badly i was just like going </joey>
<garnt> like this you know yeah really slowly </garnt>
<joey> but i went down it um and then i'd say </joey>
<joey> like it took me like maybe two or three </joey>
<connor> more weeks before i felt like i could i </connor>
<connor> was actually doing it good but yeah </connor>
<joey> self-taught </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean it's it's just about like </joey>
<connor> you know just getting your body used to </connor>
<connor> those weird movements that you're going </connor>
<garnt> fast yeah but also it's just like just </garnt>
<garnt> you just have to commit yeah some of </garnt>
<garnt> these like you just have to be like i </garnt>
<joey> know this is not what i'm supposed to do </joey>
<joey> but i have to do this yeah and it's it's </joey>
<joey> scary dude like leaning forward on a </joey>
<garnt> hill like </garnt>
<garnt> you're not built for that you know your </garnt>
<garnt> brain </garnt>
<garnt> your brain's not built to be like you </garnt>
<garnt> know this thing you're going down fast </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta lean forward yeah yeah into </garnt>
<connor> the danger i always felt when i'm skiing </connor>
<joey> when you go fast when you're skiing i </joey>
<joey> almost feel like it it's like safer than </joey>
<joey> going slower like yeah weirdly yeah it </joey>
<joey> felt safer because like the way that i </joey>
<joey> don't know how it worked but when i was </joey>
<joey> going snowboarding when i started </joey>
<joey> getting speed it did not feel like </joey>
<joey> secure at all it's wobbling and anything </joey>
<joey> that hits the board underneath you feel </joey>
<joey> it [ __ ] tell me you're going really fast </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] terrifying yeah i know if </joey>
<joey> you've tumbled when you're going like </joey>
<connor> really fast oh my god you're just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> and also and also like tumbling with </garnt>
<garnt> just these massive things on your feet </garnt>
<garnt> just never it never feels natural you </garnt>
<garnt> know it's it's like having two concrete </garnt>
<garnt> bricks just like yeah glued together </garnt>
<joey> it's like it's like the green army </joey>
<joey> yeah just kind of learn like just kind </joey>
<garnt> of like do this and then yeah hopefully </garnt>
<garnt> you feel good just don't don't put your </garnt>
<garnt> hands out that's the yeah part is </garnt>
<garnt> learning when you fall naturally you </garnt>
<garnt> want to put your hands out but that's </garnt>
<joey> how you sprain your uh your ankles uh </joey>
<connor> ankles are your wrists you can get like </connor>
<joey> the wrist guards but they don't help </joey>
<joey> that much i mean what i got taught </joey>
<joey> because like i got taught by like an </joey>
<joey> ex-professional like snowboarder and he </joey>
<connor> said like when you fall like you have to </connor>
<garnt> fall with your fists yeah because if you </garnt>
<connor> fall like this just don't do that </connor>
<connor> he did that and broke both of his wrists </connor>
<connor> at the same time so he's like don't do </connor>
<joey> that that [ __ ] hurts i can tell you </joey>
<joey> firsthand i just put my arms like that </joey>
<joey> yeah you just [ __ ] do this then </joey>
<joey> you're good yeah just don't fall </joey>
<connor> straight forward just just get good why </connor>
<connor> would i fall </connor>
<joey> literally what i what i found from </joey>
<joey> snowboarding is that it's literally the </joey>
<garnt> get good of sports </garnt>
<joey> right </joey>
<garnt> like when i started getting used to it </garnt>
<garnt> there was nothing that could prepare my </garnt>
<garnt> mind like you know i watch youtube when </garnt>
<garnt> i watch the youtube tutorials i tried to </garnt>
<connor> follow what they were saying but nothing </connor>
<connor> could really prepare me for just like </connor>
<connor> getting the feel of the snowboard </connor>
<connor> because it's it's like you got to shut </connor>
<connor> off a part of your brain um and relearn </connor>
<garnt> like another skill set yeah when you're </garnt>
<connor> like snowboarding and stuff yeah and </connor>
<connor> also like just where you're where you're </connor>
<connor> putting pressure on your like toes and </connor>
<joey> your like at the exact point can can </joey>
<joey> determine so much on how you're steering </joey>
<joey> you get so much more control once you </joey>
<joey> realize like okay if i just have faith </joey>
<joey> if i put pressure here it'll turn where </joey>
<joey> i want it to but you kind of gotta like </joey>
<joey> not panic to learn that yeah panicking </joey>
<connor> is what [ __ ] you yeah yeah it's good </connor>
<joey> though i mean you get the chance to go </joey>
<connor> go but obviously honestly yeah i feel </connor>
<garnt> like it is a very privileged sport </garnt>
<joey> we've been talking about a lot of </joey>
<joey> privileged activities haven't we like </joey>
<joey> kayaking and snowboarding </joey>
<garnt> i remember when i was at the ski resort </garnt>
<garnt> and um i found my mom said to tell her </garnt>
<garnt> that i was like snowboarding and she was </garnt>
<garnt> like oh you rich now are you </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> like like they read like to us like to </garnt>
<joey> to me like snowboarding and skiing has </joey>
<connor> always been like the rich man sport yeah </connor>
<connor> it's always been like the white man's </connor>
<connor> floor that's that's that's how i feel </connor>
<connor> that's that's how like i was raised like </connor>
<connor> snowboarding and skiing because you know </connor>
<connor> when i go on holiday you know i you know </connor>
<connor> visit back where's the back home and </connor>
<connor> everything like i go to like a nice </connor>
<garnt> cheap beach or whatever in thailand or </garnt>
<garnt> whatever um snowboarding and skiing like </garnt>
<garnt> the only reason i've never gone before </garnt>
<garnt> was because there seems to be like so </garnt>
<garnt> many steps and so many like so much </garnt>
<garnt> equipment that you need in order just to </garnt>
<garnt> go down a slope it's kind of like </garnt>
<joey> golfing yeah i was about to say there's </joey>
<joey> two types of rich white man sports it's </joey>
<joey> you either go skiing and snowboarding or </joey>
<connor> you play golf well i think i saw </connor>
<connor> something i don't know if this is true </connor>
<joey> or not but i saw something and it was </joey>
<joey> like it was like based on like sports or </joey>
<joey> accidents in general what sense of them </joey>
<joey> were like white people and it was like </joey>
<joey> the most </joey>
<joey> the whitest accident you can have </joey>
<joey> is is uh on a [ __ ] jet ski it was </joey>
<joey> like it was like a hundred i can't </joey>
<joey> remember where it was it was like it was </joey>
<joey> like 99.5 of accidents on jet skis for </joey>
<joey> white people </joey>
<joey> and then the next one was skiing and </joey>
<joey> snowballing yeah of course like 97. </joey>
<joey> there's nothing more white i was just </joey>
<joey> gonna say when you put it like that i'm </joey>
<joey> like i don't yeah i don't think there is </joey>
<joey> anything wider than owning a gesture </joey>
<connor> it is like </connor>
<connor> it's the wisest have you ever been on a </connor>
<garnt> jet ski no </garnt>
<garnt> have you thought about going on a jet </garnt>
<garnt> ski </garnt>
<connor> i like to that's not going to jet ski i </connor>
<joey> don't know i don't live in like florida </joey>
<joey> or anything like that i've been on a jet </joey>
<garnt> ski it's fine as [ __ ] yeah because i </garnt>
<joey> mean in thailand obviously with the </joey>
<joey> beach and everything there's some </joey>
<joey> services where you can like rent out jet </joey>
<joey> ski for like uh half an hour or whatever </joey>
<garnt> um i mean it's basically just a </garnt>
<connor> motorbike on water it says </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> no i mean it's just it's just a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> fun i can see how people get injured on </garnt>
<joey> that though you go pretty fast and you </joey>
<joey> think that it's water so it doesn't hurt </joey>
<joey> concrete yeah exactly exactly yeah you </joey>
<joey> think that you're falling off at full </joey>
<joey> speed it doesn't hurt but it [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hurts oh yeah um but it's a lot of </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] fun um i mean i haven't done </joey>
<garnt> much on it i mean i've only had like </garnt>
<garnt> like half an hour on a jet ski on a </garnt>
<garnt> beach in thailand once but uh that's </garnt>
<connor> pretty much it i feel like that's all </connor>
<connor> i'd need i'll be like you know what now </connor>
<joey> i'm done yeah </joey>
<joey> i've i've fulfilled the white man </joey>
<garnt> experience yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i tell you that this like [ __ ] ski </garnt>
<garnt> resort that we stayed at um </garnt>
<garnt> it was like its theme like what its </garnt>
<garnt> theme was like it was very like </garnt>
<garnt> inspired by i guess like american </garnt>
<garnt> american like culture right </garnt>
<connor> that sounds so bizarre a japanese ski </connor>
<garnt> resort inspired by america it's really </garnt>
<garnt> weird it was it was like kind of what i </garnt>
<joey> imagine yeah what kind of what i imagine </joey>
<joey> a ferry would be like you know it had a </joey>
<joey> lot of different </joey>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<connor> a lot of different things for like 1950s </connor>
<connor> carnival style i'd say </connor>
<joey> weird in japan in japan whereabouts did </joey>
<connor> you guys go hokkaido oh hokkaido yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but there was some areas of this </connor>
<connor> hotel that were like totally normal </connor>
<connor> chill but there's a big area that was </connor>
<connor> like kids theme park yeah carnival theme </connor>
<garnt> it was really weird so </garnt>
<joey> so they had like they had like these um </joey>
<joey> animatronics </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> chuck e cheese [ __ ] yeah like </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly like that she's like some </joey>
<joey> chucky cheese [ __ ] right but i don't </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> when they had bought these animatronics </joey>
<joey> i don't know when they had bought these </joey>
<joey> animatronics because we were just um me </joey>
<joey> and sydney were just sitting there like </joey>
<joey> and they'd play these like songs right </joey>
<joey> they'd have these like animatronic </joey>
<joey> concerts like in in this like children's </joey>
<garnt> area where you can buy [ __ ] burgers </garnt>
<joey> and fries it was like an eating area </joey>
<joey> it's like it's full on chuck e cheese </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah basically and these poor </connor>
<connor> employees had to listen these [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> things sing all day yeah and so so me </garnt>
<garnt> and sydney were just enjoying like a </garnt>
<garnt> nice burger and everything like that and </garnt>
<garnt> then this [ __ ] this [ __ ] like </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] animatronic dog or something </joey>
<joey> just starts just starts bigging up the </joey>
<joey> confederacy </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah and i was just like i had me in </garnt>
<connor> city have to double take to be like </connor>
<garnt> did we just hear that correctly like </garnt>
<connor> what is what is going on right now </connor>
<connor> because i walked past them and i was </connor>
<connor> like don't mind my own thing i'm like </connor>
<joey> why they're wearing confederate soldier </joey>
<joey> uniforms oh my god </joey>
<garnt> jesus christ so after we heard that we </garnt>
<garnt> took like a closer look at these </garnt>
<garnt> animatronics right to be like what is </garnt>
<garnt> going on when did they buy these and </garnt>
<garnt> where did they buy these from and we saw </garnt>
<garnt> one of the bears </garnt>
<garnt> was uh </garnt>
<garnt> it was very </garnt>
<garnt> let's say </garnt>
<joey> not very tasteful 1920s like black </joey>
<connor> cartoon uh character oh no yes yes </connor>
<joey> the lips were like massive you know and </joey>
<joey> and it had the stereotypical cartoon </joey>
<joey> black man accent of like 1920s </joey>
<joey> you know like the whole like uh </joey>
<garnt> literally if you go i know if you go and </garnt>
<garnt> watch like a disney cartoon from the </garnt>
<garnt> 1920s or a black person with that like </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like stereotypical accent they </garnt>
<garnt> gave them and character yeah and it was </garnt>
<garnt> just that and it's like it was like oh </garnt>
<connor> no oh no oh no oh no no </connor>
<joey> why </joey>
<garnt> why and uh yeah these </garnt>
<joey> these things you can't make that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> these people </joey>
<joey> these poor japanese tourists or these </joey>
<joey> these poor japanese toys are just like </joey>
<joey> ah american culture yeah </joey>
<joey> kids are just like running around being </joey>
<garnt> like mama what's the confederacy i'm </garnt>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> like oh yes </joey>
<joey> yes man it's gonna [ __ ] show it to </joey>
<connor> joey </connor>
<joey> nothing weirder than that thing standing </joey>
<joey> next to a miku </joey>
<garnt> like is that a miku thing </garnt>
<joey> oh no </joey>
<joey> oh no </joey>
<garnt> oh that's oh that is a really good </garnt>
<garnt> result though it's very cheap </garnt>
<garnt> really good result really good resort </garnt>
<garnt> like that fantastic jesus christ yeah </garnt>
<joey> it is one of those things you're like </joey>
<joey> this is great what is going on here why </joey>
<joey> is this a thing why is this here yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like you know you have that like </joey>
<joey> your 90 year old aunt who has that one </joey>
<joey> piece of memorabilia like auntie you </joey>
<joey> should probably throw that away probably </joey>
<joey> not talk about that yeah probably get </joey>
<joey> rid of that yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean to give it to give them the </garnt>
<garnt> benefit of the doubt i don't think that </garnt>
<garnt> anyone there knew yeah it's just a case </garnt>
<joey> of they don't know yeah </joey>
<joey> but it's the matter of like you know </joey>
<connor> when tourism comes back in right like oh </connor>
<connor> it's been there for decades well clearly </connor>
<connor> yeah you know how has no </connor>
<joey> like tourists come up and being like </joey>
<joey> you know what that is right like </joey>
<connor> it's probably not a good idea yeah i </connor>
<connor> wanted to think of like you know because </connor>
<joey> obviously in the past like you know five </joey>
<joey> six years it's been a very hot hot topic </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> and it's only now where we've really </joey>
<joey> started to be like we should probably </joey>
<joey> get rid of all that [ __ ] yeah yeah not a </joey>
<joey> good idea so i wonder i i i i wonder </joey>
<joey> though i wonder is that anybody anyone </joey>
<joey> send them an email letting them know hey </joey>
<joey> uh love the animatronics they're great </joey>
<joey> they're really great dog is cute but </joey>
<joey> maybe we should kind of change up the </joey>
<connor> theme a little bit yeah you know we got </connor>
<connor> we got a bunch of miku's probably lying </connor>
<joey> around we've probably resurfaced that </joey>
<joey> every service </joey>
<joey> swear off this place i thought it was </joey>
<joey> you know i'm sure i'm sure you know it's </joey>
<joey> it's very good there has to be a reason </joey>
<joey> behind it it was it was a nice place and </joey>
<connor> i just i i really did feel like they </connor>
<connor> were just like ignorant you know what i </connor>
<garnt> mean yeah i mean it it like it kind of </garnt>
<garnt> felt like they had just like brought </garnt>
<garnt> some memorabilia from america they </garnt>
<joey> didn't know what they were buying well i </joey>
<joey> mean this is all right a lot of the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] ski resorts are in the middle of </garnt>
<garnt> nowhere yeah it's in the middle of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] nowhere they they have no idea </garnt>
<joey> about anything like that what's going on </joey>
<joey> it makes sense but it's still it was </joey>
<garnt> just super [ __ ] weird because you </garnt>
<connor> walk into this really bizarre </connor>
<connor> you walk into the last thing you expect </connor>
<connor> to see in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere </connor>
<garnt> in japan yeah because we had to like we </garnt>
<garnt> had to go on a coach that like </garnt>
<garnt> lasted about two three hours in the </garnt>
<garnt> middle of [ __ ] hokkaido yeah right so </garnt>
<garnt> we were going in the middle of nowhere </garnt>
<garnt> and we walk in and it's just like old </garnt>
<garnt> american memorabilia everywhere it was </garnt>
<joey> so [ __ ] bizarre as well the hotel </joey>
<joey> part was really fancy as well it's like </joey>
<joey> the entrance this hotel was like marble </joey>
<joey> like pure marble with like pillars and </joey>
<joey> it's like what the [ __ ] is </joey>
<joey> it's so fancy you can get you can get a </joey>
<joey> helicopter from the airport to the hotel </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hell yeah yeah yeah but then i </joey>
<joey> just have this whole thing that's like </joey>
<joey> and then also i mean completely </joey>
<joey> unrelated but i was really offended when </joey>
<joey> i i bought a what was it advertised as a </joey>
<joey> coffee and i paid three dollars for it </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's not the most expensive coffee </garnt>
<garnt> but i was like all right fine paid three </garnt>
<garnt> dollars for it literally dead ass saw </garnt>
<garnt> this woman put a [ __ ] shitty pod into </garnt>
<garnt> a machine and then pri think coffee i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want it was it was it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> a little espresso </garnt>
<joey> it was some budget version of nespresso </joey>
<joey> i was like what is this you know if it's </joey>
<joey> an espresso maybe up here not even an </joey>
<joey> espresso you know that's at the bare </joey>
<joey> minimum if you charging for a coffee you </joey>
<joey> know i'm not expecting much but like if </joey>

<joey> it's [ __ ] me where am i gonna </joey>
<joey> snowboard </joey>
<garnt> oh my god because like the worst part of </garnt>
<joey> like staying in a hotel right is just </joey>
<garnt> knowing that you're gonna have to like </garnt>
<garnt> drink that shitty instant three in one </garnt>
<joey> coffee you mean that shitty coffee that </joey>
<garnt> you had at the ryokan as well at camping </garnt>
<joey> oh god don't remind me so that's the </joey>
<joey> coffee machine in the door con right </joey>
<connor> okay hold up though though the fact that </connor>
<joey> there's a coffee machine in a ryokan </joey>
<connor> it's already uh it's it's okay yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> there's normally no coffee usually there </joey>
<joey> isn't right so so all of us when we </joey>
<garnt> walked in we saw that and the guy was </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah so for people who are staying </garnt>
<joey> you get free coffee at the coffee </joey>
<garnt> machine and everyone's like perfect </garnt>
<joey> that's great tomorrow morning's gonna be </joey>
<joey> fantastic walk up and my first red flag </joey>
<joey> was it was like free coffee </joey>
<joey> and i was like </joey>
<connor> no no make me pay please there is </connor>
<joey> nothing scarier than something that's </joey>
<garnt> fulfilling because i i i was gonna be </garnt>
<connor> like i sleep that's fine yeah i was i </connor>
<connor> was like it's a it's a machine that </connor>
<connor> serves coffee and you press the button </connor>
<connor> and you could hear beans grinding so i'm </connor>
<connor> just like surely surely there must be </connor>
<garnt> some quality to this if i can hear </garnt>
<garnt> something whirring in the machine it's </garnt>
<garnt> not just a pod or something like that so </garnt>
<garnt> i get this coffee i drink it and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like man i never thought i would </garnt>
<garnt> ask for a refund for a free coffee but </garnt>
<connor> i'm kind of considering it now how is it </connor>
<connor> so bad though it was like grounded </connor>
<joey> coffee beans i mean i don't know if it </joey>
<joey> was grounded coffee there might have </joey>
<joey> just been like beans </joey>
<garnt> in a container pretty sure they just </garnt>
<joey> grounded dirt </joey>
<joey> and they sold it as coffee because </joey>
<joey> that's pretty sure it was the things </joey>
<joey> that were being grown about right like </joey>
<connor> from from the dirt that they don't like </connor>
<connor> some vacuums have like speakers in them </connor>
<connor> to to have like sounds play when you </connor>
<garnt> pick up stuff like to make it sound more </garnt>
<garnt> it was not fresh coffee um it was it was </garnt>
<joey> a lot of it was beans those beans have </joey>
<connor> been there since those animatronics </connor>
<connor> once you uh grind the beans they go bad </connor>
<connor> like within like uh oh god i don't know </connor>
<connor> how long maybe like a few weeks well </connor>
<joey> clearly the people at the hotel didn't </joey>
<joey> know they're like well i mean once </joey>
<joey> they're in the machine they're good to </joey>
<joey> go aren't they yeah they they get pretty </joey>
<connor> bad pretty quickly yeah that's why </connor>
<joey> you're supposed to like grind them when </joey>
<joey> you drink them yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but clearly they didn't think about that </joey>
<joey> they were like well there you go </joey>
<joey> unlimited supply of coffee right here </joey>
<joey> for you find people staying it out on </joey>
<garnt> this hotel honestly i will happily be </garnt>
<garnt> called privileged for just wanting good </garnt>
<connor> coffee </connor>
<joey> i'll take it i'll take it because i i </joey>
<joey> remember like the most acceptable </joey>
<connor> formula i was like i was like okay </connor>
<connor> you know i i'm privileged fine i'm not a </connor>
<connor> peasant though sometimes i'm not a </connor>
<garnt> person you're fine because like i </garnt>

<garnt> something on an open fire it just makes </garnt>
<joey> it be like your caveman brain just </joey>
<connor> activates and you just like this tastes </connor>
<joey> good bacon bacon bacon on campfire yeah </joey>

<garnt> roof over my head and then i have a </garnt>
<joey> coffee machine </joey>
<garnt> one day in the outdoors </garnt>
<connor> with a power outlet </connor>
<garnt> and i'm so grateful for that it wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> the tent it wasn't the power outlet it </garnt>
<garnt> was the coffee which was what i was </garnt>
<joey> trying to say so if you want to feel </joey>
<joey> grateful for your coffee machine if i </joey>
<connor> said that that would come off as ten </connor>
<garnt> times more privileged oh come on you've </garnt>
<garnt> said something like that before anyway </garnt>
<connor> five minutes ago that was like that and </connor>
<connor> so what i i don't care i i'm tired of </connor>
<connor> pretending to be a peasant frankly i i'm </connor>
<connor> you know i it's never what i aim to be i </connor>
<garnt> remember when i was younger i was uh the </garnt>
<garnt> moment i realized i was like this </garnt>
<joey> peasant life isn't for me i i was like </joey>
<joey> 10 years old </joey>
<joey> we went on a plane somewhere and i was </joey>
<joey> like why are we already privileged you </joey>
<joey> get to go on a plane that's not [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> oh come on it's like [ __ ] ryan ryan </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a layover or something and </garnt>
<joey> then so this was like uh it was like it </joey>
<joey> was a flight that was going to like </joey>
<joey> australia but it stopped in like where </joey>
<joey> we were going to in amsterdam so it was </joey>
<joey> like a two-hour flight but i remember we </joey>
<joey> were sitting in an economy and i was </joey>
<joey> like mum why do they get to go in the </joey>
<joey> really really cool looking one they get </joey>
<joey> to lie down they were like oh because </joey>
<joey> that's really expensive and i was like </joey>
<joey> why don't you pay for it like </joey>
<joey> i was like we can't afford it and i'm </joey>
<joey> like we can't afford it just just get a </joey>
<joey> good bank account you guys have a job </joey>
<connor> right and i'm like yeah we kind of </connor>
<connor> thought it's too expensive i'm like oh </connor>
<connor> well if you were my kid i would have </connor>
<joey> slapped you over the head no i was just </joey>
<connor> asking i was like how much is it i don't </connor>
<garnt> know how much it is you know how does it </garnt>
<garnt> work i'm young as [ __ ] i don't know how </garnt>
<joey> much it costs i have no notion of this </joey>
<joey> before right i'm like i'm like well i </joey>
<joey> mean how much is it </joey>
<joey> how much </joey>
<joey> why can't you afford it yeah i'm like </joey>
<joey> what so you're saying you're telling me </joey>
<joey> that those people over there have enough </joey>
<joey> money for it nah that's not right that's </joey>
<joey> not if they can get it i can get it [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> that was like a mindset </joey>
<joey> that's how i've always been in life i'm </joey>
<joey> like if someone else can have it i can </joey>
<joey> have it why can't i have it </joey>
<connor> why not why not if they get it why don't </connor>
<joey> i personally did you did you think like </joey>
<joey> that as a kid i don't know i'm i was </joey>
<connor> like in my head i always thought if </connor>
<joey> someone else could do it i can do it </joey>
<joey> when i was like 10 all i thought was </joey>
<joey> like thank you father for buying me a </joey>
<connor> package no no i was grateful but i would </connor>
<connor> always wonder you never wondered why </connor>
<joey> there was other people who had like or i </joey>
<joey> wanted but i was like well the fact that </joey>
<joey> we're not there right now means that </joey>
<joey> they're different </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> they're the same as us they just got </connor>
<connor> lucky </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] that i'm like but they want you to </joey>
<joey> believe they want you to believe they </joey>
<joey> are like 10 000 iq we we earned this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] off no they didn't they got [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> lucky </joey>

<connor> you made a few good decisions and that </connor>
<connor> you made an air conditioning company </connor>
<joey> good for you how to get privileged just </joey>
<joey> get lucky </joey>
<garnt> there's a lot of luck involved i mean </garnt>
<connor> there is yeah it is it is mostly luck </connor>
<connor> 90 percent of the people in that first </connor>
<joey> class [ __ ] born into wealth bro it's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] that is true not fast the same </joey>
<garnt> rich people giving each other their kids </garnt>
<garnt> money </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like [ __ ] that i deserve that why </garnt>
<garnt> don't i deserve that </garnt>
<connor> i'm gonna have some of that what's the </connor>
<connor> what's wrong with having that mindset </connor>
<connor> being like if they can do it why can't i </connor>
<garnt> get it i mean there's nothing wrong with </garnt>
<garnt> having that there's nothing wrong with </garnt>
<joey> having that muscle it's just funny that </joey>
<connor> you were having that mindset at like </connor>
<garnt> literally yeah like you're just you're </garnt>
<connor> just trying to be a pro gamer from a </connor>
<joey> young age i always was like i i just </joey>
<joey> want to like why why why why why aren't </joey>
<joey> my parents mid-maxing life right now </joey>
<connor> i just always thought if someone else </connor>
<connor> could do something always from young age </connor>
<joey> right if they could do it i could do it </joey>
<connor> no that's great that's a great mentality </connor>
<connor> to have </connor>
<joey> when it's talking about you know like </joey>
<connor> privilege </connor>
<connor> because money's like a taboo subject </connor>
<connor> right you can't say that you want to get </connor>
<connor> a lot of it not like i i mean i i just </connor>
<garnt> just think that [ __ ] like everyone </garnt>
<connor> wants to have a lot of money yeah of </connor>
<connor> course that's it i mean but no one wants </connor>
<connor> to admit that right people don't want to </connor>
<connor> admit that they're like that i mean </connor>
<connor> people are always like if i had that but </connor>
<joey> they're never like i'm gonna go for it </joey>
<joey> because it's embarrassing admitting to </joey>
<joey> your friends being like i'm gonna be a </joey>
<joey> millionaire i'm gonna do go for that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] right because that sounds you're </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah all right all right yeah </joey>

<joey> mean it's like nah dude [ __ ] that let </joey>
<joey> people try if they wanted man little </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] up absolutely if you're gonna go </joey>
<joey> bankrupt do before 30 so you can at </joey>
<joey> least like fix your [ __ ] you know like </joey>
<joey> what was that i saw a thing that was </joey>
<joey> like most people uh have the most </joey>
<joey> impactful years in your life are like 40 </joey>
<joey> years old you like the people who do the </joey>
<joey> most the important things the ceos of </joey>
<joey> the company all that stuff it's when </joey>
<garnt> you're 40. so just [ __ ] up try and do a </garnt>
<connor> bunch of [ __ ] yeah exactly honestly go </connor>
<joey> for gold when you're like 20. why the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] no take some risks while you're </joey>
<garnt> young </garnt>
<garnt> yeah honestly like i what i try to tell </garnt>
<garnt> people is like especially those in their </garnt>
<garnt> mid-20s because i feel like everyone </garnt>
<joey> hits like their mid-20s or like 23-24 </joey>
<joey> where they realize oh i'm just going to </joey>
<joey> be working for the rest of my life you </joey>
<joey> know and you know everyone gets their </joey>
<joey> first job you get excited getting your </joey>
<joey> first job you're like damn </joey>
<joey> i'm actually getting paid for once i'm </joey>
<joey> not i'm not a peasant anymore </joey>
<connor> because wait let's be honest being a </connor>
<connor> student is what they want that's what </connor>
<connor> the system wants </connor>
<connor> exactly </connor>
<garnt> being a student is just like man you've </garnt>
<garnt> just gotten used to living like a </garnt>
<joey> peasant right </joey>
<joey> so yes this is normal yeah you're just </joey>
<garnt> like i i remember like i remember like </garnt>
<joey> somewhere in my mid-20s when i just </joey>
<joey> realized man how the [ __ ] did i just </joey>
<joey> live off cup ramen for a good like five </joey>
<joey> years of my life that's not normal yeah </joey>
<joey> and i've just like entered i like </joey>
<joey> internalize that to be like dude dude </joey>
<garnt> night out versus cup ramen night out any </garnt>
<joey> time </joey>
<connor> of course got to get your priorities </connor>
<connor> right but then you realize well i have a </connor>
<joey> i have a </joey>
<joey> job with a disposable income i can have </joey>
<joey> like a decent living and that's what you </joey>
<joey> would hope that most people would have </joey>
<joey> if they went through university if they </joey>
<joey> went if they got an education um it's a </joey>
<joey> lot harder now yeah absolutely like it's </joey>
<joey> it's i've you know i was lucky enough to </joey>
<joey> get even my first job after i </joey>
<joey> graduated from uni which a lot of people </joey>
<joey> have a hard time have a hard time doing </joey>
<joey> now but i will say if you are able to be </joey>
<garnt> in a position where you can give </garnt>
<garnt> yourself a safety net then by all means </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up in your 20s [ __ ] because your </garnt>
<garnt> 20s are the best point where you can </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] up in that in life and still it not </garnt>
<joey> be the end of the world yeah you still </joey>
<joey> have enough time to recoup right and </joey>
<joey> like you know get back to ground zero </joey>
<connor> yeah that's why i was just i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] it yeah i'll try youtubing it's </connor>
<joey> probably a terrible idea to </joey>
<joey> lose two or three years of my possible </joey>
<garnt> long engineering career to this [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm gonna try it like why wouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> i try it like it'd be so cool not to try </garnt>
<garnt> it you know yeah go for gold but i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it does get to a point where </garnt>
<connor> um because i i mean if i went down like </connor>
<connor> the engineering path i'm sure you too </connor>
<joey> you know eventually in your 40s you'd </joey>
<joey> probably have a very cushy wage you'd </joey>
<joey> you know you'd be very </joey>
<joey> very nice you know you'd be able to </joey>
<joey> afford very fine things in life when you </joey>
<joey> get becoming a chartered engineer the </joey>
<joey> pay you get is very good yeah and when </joey>
<joey> you work in certain places where the </joey>
<joey> engineering gets you know more difficult </joey>
<joey> or whatever like you can start getting </joey>
<joey> nutty money yeah yeah um but i was just </joey>
<joey> like yeah [ __ ] that i'd rather take 20k </joey>
<joey> yeah doing something that i like that </joey>
<joey> also has the chance to make way more </joey>
<joey> down the line you know and that's what i </joey>
<joey> was always like though i i always </joey>
<joey> thought why settle </joey>
<joey> you know i i would rather risk losing at </joey>
<joey> all trying to make a million dollars and </joey>
<joey> then just settle for like you know </joey>
<joey> comfortable yeah because to me it's like </joey>
<connor> you know i i can do that at any point in </connor>
<connor> my life i i can settle down and and do </connor>
<joey> things you know because you never know </joey>
<joey> like without career right like it could </joey>
<joey> start happening tomorrow for all we know </joey>
<connor> yeah like if you can become the biggest </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] youtuber on the planet next week </connor>
<connor> dude you're set for life you know what i </connor>
<connor> mean so it's like but i i don't even </connor>
<connor> think of it like that it's not like how </connor>
<connor> i see youtube anyway but i just i just </connor>
<joey> would rather risk and do something </joey>
<joey> that's kind of like oh that's kind of </joey>
<joey> could lose it all he xd </joey>
<joey> could like just become homeless tomorrow </joey>
<joey> fine </joey>
<joey> better start camping </joey>
<connor> right but like i mean it's i'd rather </connor>
<garnt> try it like yeah of course </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i think it's important to like </garnt>
<garnt> recognize that some people are just not </garnt>
<garnt> in the position to be able to drive </garnt>
<connor> that's true yeah because that's just </connor>
<connor> true because like i was very very lucky </connor>
<connor> that i i'd built up the savings and i </connor>
<joey> also had a really good family that set </joey>
<joey> me up exactly exactly because like i </joey>
<garnt> will say this right now like my i was </garnt>
<garnt> never brought up like my family weren't </garnt>
<garnt> in the best of financial positions </garnt>
<garnt> at all but like i was lucky enough to </garnt>
<garnt> have like a mom and dad who's like work </garnt>
<garnt> their [ __ ] asses off to like get me </garnt>
<garnt> through and give me a better opportunity </garnt>
<joey> than they ever had and that's why like </joey>
<joey> right now i'm trying to like most of </joey>
<joey> like most of everything i earn i like i </joey>
<joey> like spend on them i spend more on them </joey>
<joey> than they do on me because i feel like </joey>
<joey> it's my way of like paying back the </joey>
<joey> opportunity that they gave me yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because good boy yeah i mean it's </joey>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> such a good song </joey>
<joey> i mean dude like yeah i mean my parents </joey>
<joey> like especially my dad he came up from </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] poverty almost in [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> thailand and like somehow found found </garnt>
<garnt> his way to england and worked his </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] ass off had a much harder life </garnt>
<garnt> than i ever went through so of course </garnt>
<connor> i'm like [ __ ] dead is that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bad ass though like you know he had a </connor>
<connor> dream move to </connor>
<connor> england and then his son's like </connor>
<connor> engineering degree and then now he talks </connor>
<connor> about titties </connor>
<garnt> that was that part that part of the </garnt>
<joey> story he probably doesn't tell that </joey>
<garnt> his family gatherings but now he's </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] proud now he's like yeah </connor>
<garnt> like that's badass dude yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> because because i i feel like it's you </garnt>
<garnt> know it's it's a fallacy where you you </garnt>
<connor> know you think money solves every </connor>
<connor> problem that you have when money money </connor>
<joey> does not solve it it makes life </joey>
<joey> significantly easier yeah it sounds so </joey>
<joey> pretty privileged when you say that but </joey>
<joey> like no not like as someone who you know </joey>
<joey> has been poor in their life money </joey>
<garnt> doesn't solve every problem but there is </garnt>
<garnt> a point in your life where money is </garnt>
<garnt> ninety percent of your problems right </garnt>
<connor> right and just and and once you get your </connor>
<connor> money is your problem you don't really </connor>
<connor> have time to think about anything other </connor>
<garnt> than money exactly and like my mentality </garnt>
<connor> when i was a kid was just i just want to </connor>
<connor> get by and have and be like comfortable </connor>
<connor> yeah because i'm saying and you know i i </connor>
<connor> feel like that was that was my big </connor>
<connor> driving force to like really try to be </connor>
<connor> successful to take risks is just because </connor>
<connor> i was just tired of just </connor>
<connor> not like knowing what my life situation </connor>
<connor> would be like five years down the line </connor>
<connor> it's just like how am i how the [ __ ] am </connor>
<connor> i going to take care of my parents when </connor>
<garnt> they get old like that that was that was </garnt>
<connor> a big [ __ ] thing for me there was </connor>
<connor> definitely a time when i was like 16 to </connor>
<connor> like 18 where i thought i really love </connor>
<joey> video games i don't really care what job </joey>
<joey> i get i just want to be able to play </joey>
<joey> games after work right that's what i </joey>
<joey> genuinely i thought i wanted for like </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah and then when i went </joey>
<joey> to university it like very much kicked </joey>
<connor> in i was like i don't think i can do an </connor>
<connor> eight-hour job </connor>
<joey> like i think i can't do that i did a </joey>
<connor> three-month internship to know that i </connor>
<connor> don't want to do this for the rest of my </connor>
<connor> life yeah i was like i mean more proud </connor>
<joey> of people who love that that line of </joey>
<joey> work i just yeah i was i was jealous i </joey>
<joey> was at the time i was so jealous of the </joey>
<joey> people that loved my course and what we </joey>
<garnt> were doing because i felt like they were </garnt>
<garnt> just so op with school yeah yeah they </garnt>
<garnt> like got through it they got all the </garnt>
<garnt> good opportunities because they enjoyed </garnt>
<connor> it like i just didn't enjoy it i </connor>
<connor> couldn't try because i just didn't care </connor>
<joey> i have so much respect for people who </joey>
<joey> you know can go to their you know nine </joey>
<joey> to five job and be like </joey>
<connor> at the time when i didn't know what the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] i was doing i was so jealous i was </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] man i wish i knew what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i was yeah right you know and i'm </joey>
<joey> sure </joey>
<joey> for every person like you know i got </joey>
<joey> very lucky and i found something that i </joey>
<joey> loved and that luckily makes money </joey>
<joey> somehow </joey>
<joey> my mom just believes that it did for a </joey>
<garnt> very long time yeah sometimes i think a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of parents did yeah somehow it makes </garnt>
<garnt> money right and you know i'm sure for </garnt>
<garnt> every you know one of me that got very </garnt>
<garnt> lucky there was probably 10 people who </garnt>
<garnt> never really found what they liked and </garnt>
<garnt> just had to like kind of just be like </garnt>
<connor> all right well i got to get a job yeah i </connor>
<garnt> can't i can't do nothing on my life yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly that sucks i think one thing </garnt>
<garnt> i've realized more as i've grown older </garnt>
<joey> is that as a kid we were sold this idea </joey>
<joey> that there's only really one </joey>
<joey> one way your career path can go right </joey>
<joey> it's like education university get a job </joey>
<joey> to do with your degree and your career </joey>
<joey> progresses from there and that's like i </joey>
<joey> had this i had that mentality for like </joey>
<garnt> the longest time of my life and now like </garnt>
<garnt> the older i've got the audio i've gotten </garnt>
<garnt> the more people i've met who have had </garnt>
<garnt> like the weirdest [ __ ] career paths </garnt>
<connor> yeah we've had a lot of those people on </connor>
<joey> the podcast i feel like in the </joey>
<connor> entertainment industry you do meet the </connor>
<connor> people who kind of are just bouncing </connor>
<joey> from things to things just trying to </joey>
<joey> figure out what they want right now </joey>
<connor> not even enjoy life not even in insane </connor>
<connor> just like living in japan as well like </connor>
<connor> like i like meeting like teachers who </connor>
<connor> have like found opportunities just </connor>
<connor> randomly like like sometimes like what </connor>
<connor> i'm trying to say is that as a kid i was </connor>
<connor> i you know we got put this pressure on </connor>
<connor> that by the time you go to university or </connor>
<connor> by the time you finish high school you </connor>
<connor> need to know what you want to do for the </connor>
<connor> rest of your life i wish they didn't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] sell me that long yeah that's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that is the biggest lie </connor>
<connor> of the [ __ ] world i feel especially </connor>
<connor> especially for like </connor>
<connor> especially when you're young adults the </connor>
<connor> biggest lie of the [ __ ] world is </connor>
<connor> thinking that once you start a career </connor>
<connor> path that you're going to have to stick </connor>
<connor> on this for like the majority of your </connor>
<connor> life and that's such a [ __ ] lie and </connor>
<garnt> like another big lie is thinking that </garnt>
<garnt> you need to go to [ __ ] university or </garnt>
<garnt> college to have to have a </garnt>
<garnt> decent career that's also a [ __ ] lie </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many different career paths </garnt>
<garnt> um that are available to you that is not </garnt>
<garnt> just higher education because as an </garnt>
<garnt> asian i was taught that if i don't do </garnt>
<garnt> higher education i'm a [ __ ] failure </garnt>
<joey> if i don't get that a </joey>
<garnt> i fail doesn't it no i'm not i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm not even talking about being a </garnt>
<joey> youtuber because obviously </joey>
<joey> we we are very lucky to be able to be </joey>
<joey> youtube absolutely you know like i'm not </joey>
<joey> even talking about like oh we're </joey>
<joey> youtubers that's a different different </joey>
<joey> career path i've found no i've met like </joey>
<garnt> so many other people who have like just </garnt>
<garnt> found random jobs i mean [ __ ] melin </garnt>
<garnt> found her [ __ ] job through craigslist </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> it is about just trying and looking and </garnt>
<garnt> just yeah at the right place at the </garnt>
<joey> right time and making sure you take </joey>
<joey> every opportunity that comes your way </joey>
<joey> exactly i just say yes to everything </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and that's why i miss every </joey>
<joey> opportunity you don't take yeah yeah you </joey>
<joey> know and if you which is in the uk which </joey>
<joey> is something that i just did really </joey>
<joey> didn't enjoy it was like the culture of </joey>
<connor> you go to work you go to the pub and </connor>
<connor> that's it like you never try and do any </connor>
<connor> self-improvement you never try and like </connor>
<connor> look for any other opportunities like </connor>
<connor> looking for another job is like oh wow </connor>
<garnt> what's wrong with you yeah and like </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many opportunities out </garnt>
<connor> there for different jobs that you like </connor>
<connor> never even thought about until you uh </connor>
<connor> until it's just on your lap like have </connor>
<connor> you ever have we ever talked about kenny </connor>
<connor> before like your friend no i've talked </connor>
<connor> about kenny what he's doing oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> kenny's my friend who's uh lives in </garnt>
<garnt> niigata yeah he's just he's a crazy guy </garnt>
<garnt> he's great i love him he's amazing he's </garnt>
<garnt> so funny he's really he's he's a proper </garnt>
<garnt> out he is and uh he's just he's up in </garnt>
<garnt> negota in the middle of japan and he's </garnt>
<joey> half japanese half welsh and he's just a </joey>
<joey> fake priest and like i think i've spoken </joey>
<joey> before that my friend's a fake priest </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but like he teaches english </joey>
<joey> and then he's also a fake priest and </joey>
<joey> that's just what he likes doing but he </joey>
<joey> also just doesn't really care about </joey>
<joey> being in one place for too long he's </joey>
<joey> like i just kind of go wherever and </joey>
<joey> that's the one </joey>
<joey> he literally just goes places and he's </joey>
<joey> like all right what's going on let's </joey>

<joey> yeah yeah yeah he just doesn't give a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] because i i have a friend who's </joey>
<connor> similar to that because he's like i i i </connor>

<joey> some money and used that for like fuel </joey>
<joey> to just like go to the next place i'm </joey>
<joey> like that's so [ __ ] cool because yeah </joey>
<joey> i can never [ __ ] do that no i could </joey>
<joey> not bring myself to just be like i don't </joey>
<joey> know where i'm going to be tomorrow yeah </joey>
<garnt> i couldn't do that i couldn't do that </garnt>
<garnt> either i needed like some some like at </garnt>
<garnt> least a little bit of a plan i need some </garnt>
<joey> kind of direction yeah yeah i like </joey>
<connor> planning yeah i like playing i like that </connor>
<joey> i used to like spreadsheet all my like </joey>
<joey> spending in university like </joey>
<joey> a penny and i would like have like a </joey>
<joey> prediction of like my spending coming up </joey>
<joey> and what i was allowed to spend yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah literally everything in a </joey>
<joey> spreadsheet and then and then when i </joey>
<joey> started like my youtube started giving </joey>
<joey> me some money and in university i was </joey>
<joey> like oh my god this is amazing i was </joey>
<joey> like i don't need the spreadsheet </joey>
<joey> anymore [ __ ] this </joey>
<connor> why am i why am i like [ __ ] why am i </connor>
<connor> like spending hours a week updating this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] spreadsheet it doesn't [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> matter anyways i'm not gonna spend that </connor>
<connor> much yeah [ __ ] matter oh my god </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah and like like to go off what </garnt>
<garnt> we were saying </garnt>
<joey> i'm not saying like there's no place for </joey>
<joey> like higher education university or </joey>
<joey> everything but i'm still glad i went </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean i'm so glad i went but what </joey>
<joey> i'm saying is like </joey>
<joey> you don't feel the pressure to need to </joey>
<joey> go just because you don't know what you </joey>
<joey> want to do with your life you know </joey>
<joey> that's that's that's the big thing right </joey>
<joey> because it's it's so it's such [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that by the time you hit 18 it's just </joey>
<joey> the expectation where it's just like you </joey>
<joey> need to know what you're doing now you </joey>
<joey> know you you are now you are you you </joey>
<garnt> your birthday is ticked over you are now </garnt>
<garnt> an adult yeah like you you need to know </garnt>
<joey> everything there are 30 year olds out </joey>
<joey> there 40 year olds who don't know what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] they want to do yeah like </joey>
<garnt> founder mcdonald's is like 40 years old </garnt>
<joey> yeah right yeah it's like i don't really </joey>
<garnt> feel too bad about it you're like yes </garnt>
<garnt> you know like i said earlier like you'll </garnt>
<joey> do the most the most productive years of </joey>
<joey> your life like 40 years old so as far as </joey>
<joey> i'm concerned you're just [ __ ] up </joey>
<connor> until you get to the point where you can </connor>
<garnt> like actually do [ __ ] yeah exactly it's </garnt>
<joey> just you're just [ __ ] up enough until </joey>
<garnt> you've found out a way to not [ __ ] up </garnt>
<connor> right build the foundation of the </connor>
<connor> character you want to be you know yeah </connor>
<joey> you know it all goes back to the </joey>
