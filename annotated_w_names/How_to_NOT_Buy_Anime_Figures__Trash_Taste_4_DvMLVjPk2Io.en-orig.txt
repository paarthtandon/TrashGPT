<garnt> thing working on well welcome to the </garnt>
<garnt> trash taste podcast the show where we </garnt>
<garnt> talk trash about a taste in anime I'm </garnt>
<garnt> your host for today Joey and joined as </garnt>
<joey> always is God and Connor yo so this </joey>
<joey> episode is uh I guess the first special </joey>
<garnt> episode yeah yeah speed off every if </garnt>
<garnt> your being linked from our main channel </garnt>
<garnt> videos hello local podcast um but if you </garnt>
<garnt> haven't seen our main Channel videos do </garnt>
<garnt> we want to explain what we did oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> sure so basically on our main channel we </joey>
<joey> decided to do like a little fun </joey>
<garnt> challenge where as you can see our </garnt>
<garnt> backdrop is a little bonus this is a big </garnt>
<joey> table that has a lot of potential space </joey>
<joey> to be filled up with some Wiebe [ __ ] yes </joey>
<joey> so what we decided to do is we decided </joey>
<joey> to venture out into the web land itself </joey>
<connor> Akihabara in Tokyo which is like known </connor>
<connor> as like heaven for tacos as it is and we </connor>
<connor> decided to challenge ourselves to see </connor>
<connor> how many figurines or I guess anime much </connor>
<garnt> we can buy with a $500 budget or about </garnt>
<garnt> 50,000 yen if you convert it to yes and </garnt>
<garnt> just instead of just going out of making </garnt>
<garnt> it like a vlog kind of thing we decided </garnt>
<garnt> to turn it into a challenge where we </garnt>
<garnt> fight each other let's make it fun let's </garnt>
<joey> make it challenging and let's make let's </joey>
<connor> put some stakes on that's making the </connor>
<connor> relaxing experience into stressful Hell </connor>
<garnt> where you guys shoot they don't want to </garnt>
<joey> meet a dumb set of criteria so </joey>
<joey> essentially we gave ourselves a number </joey>
<joey> of challenges we had some small </joey>
<joey> challenges that we did in the four anime </joey>
<joey> stores that we went to in our main </joey>
<joey> Channel videos again if you want to </joey>
<joey> check it out go check it almost a lot of </joey>
<connor> context if you don't watch that </connor>
<connor> but if you haven't seen it and you </connor>
<connor> refuse to for some reason you'll still </connor>
<garnt> be fine to watch this clock yes so </garnt>
<garnt> basically we all have scores already </garnt>
<garnt> from challenges that we went to with </garnt>
<garnt> that we did in each store which is </garnt>
<garnt> probably on screen right now yeah you'd </garnt>
<garnt> know that if you've watched our videos </garnt>
<joey> but here are all our scores yep but it's </joey>
<joey> not the final score like any good mario </joey>
<joey> party game right it doesn't matter how </joey>
<joey> many stars you end up with it's all </joey>
<joey> about the final count it's all about the </joey>
<joey> bonus stars and this episode is </joey>
<joey> essentially where we go over the bonus </joey>
<garnt> stars as well as show each other what we </garnt>
<garnt> got because right now we don't know what </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] each other got no we maybe got </garnt>
<garnt> like a few glimpses as we like past each </garnt>
<garnt> other passive-aggressively in each of </garnt>
<garnt> the stores but right now we have no idea </garnt>
<garnt> what the other person board yes so </garnt>
<garnt> that's what we're gonna find out today </garnt>
<garnt> so we have a bunch of overarching </garnt>
<garnt> challenges right yes so we have some </garnt>
<garnt> that like pretty obvious like who spent </garnt>
<garnt> the most on a single figurine what was </garnt>
<connor> that what who bought a figure from the </connor>
<connor> most popular series which will you lose </connor>
<joey> a point if that's the case nor me </joey>
<connor> awarded normal or we'll go over every </connor>
<joey> challenge at the end after we've </joey>
<joey> finished showing everyone what we've </joey>
<garnt> bought um but for now I just wanted to </garnt>
<garnt> ask you guys we just filmed it yesterday </garnt>
<garnt> yeah how did you guys find the </garnt>
<garnt> experience I mean I found it super fun </garnt>
<garnt> that came out like I haven't started </garnt>
<connor> editing the video yet as I am recording </connor>
<joey> this episode but I can already tell that </joey>
<connor> video is gonna be so [ __ ] fun too </connor>
<connor> yeah I feel like it's just fun like </connor>
<joey> that's like the narrator you can see I'm </joey>
<joey> having fun in it cuz there's like a kid </joey>
<joey> in a candy store right like the same why </joey>
<joey> we always go to these very expensive we </joey>
<connor> always go to these stores and being it </connor>
<garnt> was like filming there with permission </garnt>
<connor> we you know we want to be here </connor>
<garnt> professionally we did we didn't Logan </garnt>
<garnt> pour this yeah God permission because we </garnt>
<connor> respect we respect yeah we got all </connor>
<joey> pressure in stores and it's great </joey>
<joey> because you can't just got to let loose </joey>
<joey> in this store I mean some of us also </joey>
<joey> have people in there so I'll still try </joey>
<joey> to be respectful but yeah you know like </joey>
<connor> anime we were there's no one else in </connor>
<joey> that spot we've got in like before the </joey>
<garnt> story yeah yeah when we left the store </garnt>
<garnt> there was like a massive queue of people </garnt>
<garnt> I I feel kind of bad right now </garnt>
<joey> like crimes yeah look at these peasants </joey>
<joey> oh yeah like a lot of the stores were </joey>
<joey> like very happy to have us I mean like </joey>
<garnt> amiami made us like sign that way yeah </garnt>
<garnt> if you ever go to army army in Akihabara </garnt>
<joey> look out for a little plaque yeah we </joey>
<joey> have a trash tastes like plaque hang </joey>
<connor> that up is like no but all of the stores </connor>
<garnt> were super freaking cool they're very </garnt>
<garnt> very supportive so first of all be shout </garnt>
<garnt> outs all the stores that did give us </garnt>
<garnt> permission to film there yeah but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> without further ado I think we should go </garnt>
<garnt> over what we bought in his store and </garnt>
<joey> judge our as the name suggests track </joey>
<garnt> based on figurines let's just before we </garnt>
<joey> jump right in let's just hold off on the </joey>
<garnt> jump okay I want to discuss so did you </garnt>
<garnt> guys have any strategy going into this </garnt>
<garnt> game or into this challenge even I said </garnt>
<joey> I did in my main channel video but in </joey>
<garnt> retrospect I did if if I win it was all </garnt>
<garnt> plans I was just having a fun choice you </garnt>
<joey> know I think that's okay if you go </joey>
<joey> hundred percent honest I like had some </joey>
<joey> idea but I think it my strategy was just </joey>
<joey> see what you guys are doing so yeah I so </joey>
<joey> trying to go off all the challenges and </joey>
<joey> yeah I could see you guys have paying </joey>
<connor> attention like okay I was gonna but if I </connor>
<connor> knew that's because I could tell someone </connor>
<connor> you won pain as much attention to the </connor>
<joey> challenges as others I'm sorry the only </joey>
<joey> challenge that I paid in mind too was </joey>
<connor> only one that I remembered which was the </connor>
<connor> whoever gets closest to $500 we're </connor>
<connor> taking about two points yeah we just </connor>
<joey> what two points I'm like I have to </joey>
<garnt> prioritize that two points is big whose </garnt>
<joey> voice is big but like I remember because </joey>
<joey> I couldn't even remember what the </joey>
<joey> challenges are we agreed on so I went to </joey>
<joey> into you the day being like okay this </joey>
<joey> one's an obvious challenge this one's an </joey>
<connor> obvious challenge as I went into more </connor>
<connor> stores I was like I am not keeping track </connor>
<connor> of money I don't know what's happening </connor>
<connor> when wells Wells when I was in animate </connor>
<garnt> I'm like okay I'm gonna do this in this </garnt>
<garnt> store do this in that store and then I </garnt>
<garnt> hit the second store I'm like what the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] am i doing </joey>
<joey> oh I was so short decided on like the </joey>
<connor> challenges that I had to do in that's </connor>
<connor> yeah to put it in perspective we got two </connor>
<joey> challenges for every story produce on </joey>
<joey> the video we're so rich is a total of </joey>
<joey> eight points that we could get there's </joey>
<joey> ten eleven points up for grabs in the </joey>
<garnt> overarching yes yes so I mean if you do </garnt>
<connor> really well on the overarching </connor>
<connor> challenges it might not [ __ ] matter </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah exactly like we're already </joey>
<garnt> close yeah I'm eight seven six right now </garnt>
<joey> I might be losing but like any good </joey>
<joey> mario party game I can always come back </joey>
<connor> animate I didn't I didn't buy much in </connor>
<garnt> this story I was the first why I'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> pull the trigger okay so here's the I </garnt>
<connor> didn't know how much I should boss </connor>
<connor> revealing right now or what do we do I </connor>
<joey> mean who wants to go first </joey>
<connor> I mean okay oh can I kill the host again </connor>
<joey> I'll go first because I only bought one </joey>
<connor> thing at a time okay so one of my </connor>
<joey> challenges was to get a maid in abyss </joey>
<joey> figurine yeah couldn't find it not even </joey>
<connor> not just an animate any of the storm but </connor>
<joey> I figured you know what I'll get </joey>
<joey> something like kind of cool and kind of </joey>
<joey> niche so I got Chucky mother from door </joey>
<joey> or oh yeah it's an Android of Chucky </joey>
<joey> mother and I mean it was so [ __ ] yeah I </joey>
<joey> love me my physical Samus stuff and I </joey>
<joey> love da door and I was like you know I </joey>
<joey> like my name droids - really really cute </joey>
<joey> I mean we will probably figure out the </joey>
<connor> pose of it somehow but that's the </connor>
<connor> special thing about nan droids you just </connor>
<joey> have to you go to pick one pose and </joey>
<joey> that's it's never good we all know it's </joey>
<joey> never good also see Nikki as well but </joey>
<joey> once you've like nailed it you like </joey>
<garnt> Haley exactly yeah so that's the only </garnt>
<garnt> thing I got cuz yeah I got a few things </garnt>
<garnt> I have no um so it's I I had two </garnt>
<garnt> challenges right and I think I got </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] over over some of the overarching </joey>
<joey> challenges by by just animates itself </joey>
<joey> really okay let's let's go ahead so the </joey>
<joey> first thing the first challenge was to </joey>
<joey> buy a Deku figure from my hero academia </joey>
<joey> oh yeah </joey>
<joey> so yeah as we all know one of the </joey>
<joey> overarching challenges was the word the </joey>
<joey> person who buys </joey>
<joey> figure from the most popular series </joey>
<joey> getting deduct at a point yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> there's there's my deck I was actually </joey>
<joey> getting bit worried right because there </joey>
<joey> weren't many like figures in really </joey>
<joey> varied yes so the only thing I could </joey>
<garnt> find on Nendoroids and so my second </garnt>
<joey> challenge was to ask a store clerk </joey>
<garnt> what is Japanese to recommend me what </garnt>
<joey> have you recommend you again he </joey>
<garnt> recommended to me one he recommends me </garnt>
<garnt> the figure from the one series </garnt>
<garnt> you've just made me also lose a point by </garnt>
<joey> recommending to me a check I checked for </joey>
<garnt> the fourth most popular anime series on </garnt>
<joey> Mouse cuz you see the price there that </joey>
<connor> that's 48 bucks right yeah how much I </connor>
<joey> spend on these two please this one says </joey>
<garnt> 48 88 and this one says that was like </garnt>
<garnt> about 550 to buy oh you know this one </garnt>
<garnt> will be a little bit more expand she's </garnt>
<connor> got done dirty by that man yeah I was </connor>
<connor> like I in the videos like oh thank you </connor>
<connor> very much for recommending so yeah </connor>
<connor> that's what I'm just like oh I can't </connor>
<joey> believe you've done this thing which I </joey>
<joey> checked which cracks me up </joey>
<joey> yeah which is an Ishtar plushie it's </joey>
<connor> finished ah it's cute it's kind of I </connor>
<connor> like you I like </connor>
<joey> it's like it's like a giant Simpson yeah </joey>
<joey> uh $120 Jesus I only spent was just 30 </joey>
<joey> bucks </joey>
<garnt> yeah oh my god I only spent 48 yeah so I </garnt>
<connor> will spend 48 bucks yeah oh my so I was </connor>
<garnt> looking at that one hi my two challenges </garnt>
<connor> will get a female figure and get one </connor>
<connor> from a show that you watched recently </connor>
<connor> and I watched like a few episodes like </connor>
<connor> two months ago so yeah why didn't you </connor>
<garnt> get the nesco figure I saw your figure </garnt>
<connor> and I'm like [ __ ] fight the </connor>
<connor> Normie award and I knew that do you </connor>
<connor> flares of the motion or whatever the </connor>
<connor> rankings say I've lost the Normie award </connor>
<joey> at heart </joey>
<joey> yeah and plus you know I want to risk it </joey>
<joey> all so I thought you know it's kind of a </joey>
<joey> cool figure yeah oh yeah yeah yeah it is </joey>
<joey> if we have Nezzer KO it when she's what </joey>
<joey> like fake anime fans get the [ __ ] out </joey>
<garnt> man I think God has like fulfilled </garnt>
<connor> prophecy the Boomer of Annie trivia tell </connor>
<connor> me about why massacre is you know I've </connor>
<joey> gone like how many episodes and I've not </joey>
<garnt> talked about you Moto's yeah you you are </garnt>
<joey> you're taking this chance to just give </joey>
<joey> us some time okay for the record I hate </joey>
<connor> nan droids I think nan droids are like </connor>
<connor> stressful purchases and we have four </connor>
<connor> goddamn mandroids </connor>
<connor> cuz you have to post them right and and </connor>
<joey> the whole best selling point of an </joey>
<joey> Android I'm pretty never gonna be </joey>
<joey> sponsored by an Android over the whole </joey>
<joey> selling point of an Android is that you </joey>
<joey> can move it but tell me everyone who </joey>
<joey> owns an Android when have you changed </joey>
<joey> the pose of an Android I change it a few </joey>
<joey> times </joey>
<joey> let's lie I've never changed yes he's </joey>
<joey> lying I've changed it because I'm </joey>
<joey> sponsored by this mark thanks guys it's </joey>
<connor> stressful and then you got to worry </connor>
<connor> about the box and the little things I </connor>
<joey> just I sometimes like where I'm just </joey>
<connor> like I look at the little pop and I'm </connor>
<joey> like I want to change it eventually and </joey>
<garnt> then I do and I'm like okay I'm glad </garnt>
<garnt> okay actually before we go on question </garnt>
<joey> to you guys what do you do with a figure </joey>
<joey> box do you been out or just office I </joey>
<joey> store </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] man I ripped that [ __ ] off the </joey>
<joey> value the mentality for me is like if I </joey>
<connor> eventually like possibly get like you </connor>
<garnt> know I'm gonna sell this figure yeah </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] off you know you gonna sell this </connor>
<connor> video that's me I'm like oh maybe I can </connor>
<garnt> sell this Jojo mark what helped me at my </garnt>
<joey> last place is that it makes moving house </joey>
<connor> so much easier yeah if you keep the boss </connor>
<joey> sure because you like </joey>
<connor> I usually what what I do at least with </connor>
<garnt> figurines right is like I throw out like </garnt>
<joey> the plastic like mold yeah so much space </joey>
<joey> but but the thing is if you chuck out </joey>
<connor> the plastic mold and you flatten the box </connor>
<connor> okay Dan yeah when you like move house </connor>
<joey> you can just open the box up again glad </joey>
<connor> I'm too lazy so much time and money and </connor>
<joey> like possibly like the risk of like </joey>
<joey> ruining a figure in mid move and like </joey>
<joey> that save me so much trouble when I move </joey>
<joey> to my current house so that's why I hold </joey>
<joey> onto it all right okay yes I stayed for </joey>
<joey> repurposing solid purchases though </joey>
<joey> overall great the next my favorite anime </joey>
<garnt> Full Metal Alchemist I recommend you </garnt>
<joey> guys watch that favorite character from </joey>
<joey> but the next store we went to was a </joey>
<garnt> store that's so much okay okay what were </garnt>
<garnt> you what before we get to a stop what </garnt>
<garnt> was your guys's strategy with a stop </garnt>
<joey> okay a stop is probably the store that I </joey>
<garnt> go to the most just yes so I knew I </garnt>
<joey> really had to spend time just like </joey>
<joey> looking around yeah because there are so </joey>
<joey> many figurines at a stop that I </joey>
<joey> legitimately have never seen anywhere </joey>
<joey> else even though they're technically </joey>
<garnt> second-hand yeah yeah so I'm like okay </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna aim for those and I think I </joey>
<joey> got a decent solution because for me a </joey>
<garnt> stop was the most daunting shop right </garnt>
<joey> good okay so in my challenge I had to </joey>
<joey> squat ten times before get interested </joey>
<connor> smaller challenge that was easy and my </connor>
<joey> second challenge wasn't also lose </joey>
<joey> because I had to buy the most expensive </joey>
<joey> figure which we found out was like a </joey>
<joey> thousand bucks </joey>
<joey> Neal's gonna lose that so I was like I </joey>
<joey> was going into a stop just not trying to </joey>
<garnt> complete any challenge we're just trying </garnt>
<joey> to like buy figures that I like yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah follow your heart </joey>
<garnt> yeah so I kind of went [ __ ] mental </garnt>
<connor> windows top I filled up my piece of </connor>
<garnt> paper no no no no okay serious yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> same it okay cuz I like with a stop </garnt>
<joey> there are so many figures and so many </joey>
<joey> display cases that's you don't remember </joey>
<joey> wet which ciggy which figure you saw </joey>
<joey> where yeah so my strategy was just if I </joey>
<joey> see him if I see a figure I like I'm </joey>
<joey> gonna write it down right and maybe I'll </joey>
<garnt> cross that later I [ __ ] myself over so </garnt>
<garnt> bad because I was just like I remember </garnt>
<garnt> seeing you like halfway through and I </garnt>
<joey> had filled up my entire yeah yeah you </joey>
<garnt> hadn't even had you didn't even still </garnt>
<garnt> walking I was just going okay that one I </garnt>
<garnt> get right down right down right now and </garnt>
<garnt> then I got to the end and then I </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't remember which [ __ ] I had that </garnt>
<garnt> he was like is it this one I feel like I </garnt>
<garnt> think I think yeah so who's like </garnt>
<garnt> basically trying to choose between my </garnt>
<garnt> children's I'm like what the [ __ ] am i </garnt>
<garnt> crossing out right now yeah no [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> clue Wow okay yeah because yeah like for </joey>
<connor> me like a stop I knew if I wasn't </connor>
<joey> careful at a stop I was gonna absolutely </joey>
<connor> ham yeah as I usually do just like </connor>
<joey> casually so I'm like okay there's still </joey>
<joey> two stores left we're not even halfway </joey>
<garnt> through this challenge so I have to like </garnt>
<garnt> limit myself as much as possible a taste </garnt>
<joey> this so I only bought three things oh oh </joey>
<garnt> oh okay how many of you how many yet I </garnt>
<connor> can't remember like five six I mean </connor>
<connor> you'll see do you want to go first I </connor>
<joey> decided to like kind of go for like </joey>
<joey> smallish once so my two challenges was </joey>
<joey> the first one was really easy I had to </joey>
<connor> go up to the store Clark and asked if </connor>
<connor> they had boku no pico much which they </connor>
<connor> said they didn't thank god they know </connor>
<connor> what it was </connor>
<connor> well the guy was an English speaking </connor>
<joey> stuff so he's like is that the one where </joey>
<joey> the two guys [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you'll see it in the video but uh the </joey>
<joey> other challenge was really easy it was </joey>
<connor> just pick a figurine that either myself </connor>
<connor> gone okano likes so obviously I went </connor>
<connor> with the one that I liked so that's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] by the line filling glad Rob </connor>
<joey> right here so I got a unwrap this ship </joey>
<garnt> but I obviously got my goddamn wife in </garnt>
<joey> monogastric of course it is oh of course </joey>
<garnt> it is look if I'm gonna be on this show </garnt>
<garnt> casually like all the freaking time </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] horse okay I need it to get my </garnt>
<joey> wife is she Nova I actually don't even </joey>
<joey> have this one at home </joey>
<joey> so I guess I'm gonna go I'm just gonna </joey>
<joey> go next now because of course I followed </joey>
<joey> my heart as well so yeah IIIi knew Joey </joey>
<garnt> would get a Shinobu figure cuz I saw so </garnt>
<garnt> many boxes that were just purely Shinobu </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like get that [ __ ] out of </garnt>
<garnt> me get that [ __ ] out of my face man you </garnt>
<connor> might need to like hold up to the camera </connor>
<connor> because it might have been assisted with </connor>
<garnt> the boxes in the way actually yeah so I </garnt>
<garnt> mean like what I tried to do at a stop </garnt>
<garnt> was at the beginning I just tried to get </garnt>
<garnt> I just tried to no down as many figures </garnt>
<garnt> as I could for under 20 bucks because I </garnt>
<garnt> feel I feel like anything over anything </garnt>
<garnt> over 20 bucks was like kind of risking </garnt>
<joey> its in terms of I mean especially if </joey>
<joey> you're playing like seven figures </joey>
<garnt> exactly exactly so this one's I don't </garnt>
<garnt> have I don't have this figure yet </garnt>
<garnt> because this short hair Sanjay Kihara </garnt>
<joey> oh that's cute that's dude I personally </joey>
<joey> find this short hair central kawaras </joey>
<joey> figurine so much nicer than the long one </joey>
<garnt> there was so many good center Gaara </garnt>
<garnt> figurines so it like hurts me that I had </garnt>
<joey> to buy the cheapest one always I bought </joey>
<joey> them </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> this is uh there was a nine hundred yen </joey>
<joey> sword online like the goods it was the </joey>
<connor> cheapest sword online figure because you </connor>
<connor> know if you're gonna buy garbage why why </connor>
<connor> care about which you know like terrible </connor>
<connor> item it is it was 900 yen I think and it </connor>
<garnt> was the cheapest sword online figure oh </garnt>
<garnt> damn okay was this for a challenge yeah </garnt>
<connor> remember I had to shout I freaking love </connor>
<connor> Sao </connor>
<garnt> while buying an SEO agency yeah I will </garnt>
<garnt> say </garnt>
<connor> that's shout wasn't a shelter that was a </connor>
<connor> in Japanese culture that was like full </connor>
<garnt> it was like it was just like it was like </garnt>
<connor> a gradually building volume let's get </connor>
<joey> this boy out of him okay the other two </joey>
<joey> though that I bought I think is super </joey>
<joey> freakin cool because they're too </joey>
<joey> figuring that I post a really wanted but </joey>
<connor> also it just like I think it goes </connor>
<connor> without saying don't listen to the audio </connor>
<connor> or only of this it's gonna sound </connor>
<connor> probably guys this is box opening ASL </connor>
<joey> okay let me show you the other two I got </joey>
<connor> okay this second one I got is a shounen </connor>
<garnt> John oh that's so cool that's pretty fun </garnt>
<garnt> that's right like I've never seen this </garnt>
<joey> before and I'm like I was like does this </joey>
<connor> count as a figurine probably yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that's a piece of you know solid I mean </connor>
<joey> my mom's shown a job and that's gonna </joey>
<garnt> look so cool and like the shell facade </garnt>
<garnt> that's I think if we had a coolest item </garnt>
<garnt> award because I didn't know if we could </garnt>
<garnt> get a cool this item okay you all agree </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah but I think we can all agree </garnt>
<garnt> this is the cool one of the course </garnt>
<garnt> figuring yeah and the other one I got is </garnt>
<connor> also pretty cool it's puck from berserk </connor>
<garnt> how much was that this is 980 yen oh wow </garnt>
<joey> cuz every Buzzard figure I saw was so </joey>
<joey> expense </joey>
<joey> like there's there's a few figures in </joey>
<joey> the sword I found like Nana Chi the the </joey>
<garnt> the little Nana Chi figure mana she was </garnt>
<joey> like 250 bucks </joey>
<joey> oh yeah know the meaning of this stuff </joey>
<garnt> is so explored that made an abyss thing </garnt>
<joey> at a stop I probably still wouldn't have </joey>
<joey> been able to do it because I'm not gonna </joey>
<joey> spend $250 I got I got URI from Angel </joey>
<joey> Beats she was I can't remember how much </joey>
<garnt> but it was between ten and I there's one </garnt>
<joey> figure that I didn't get I of course </joey>
<garnt> puts a guru down I have cause for salary </garnt>
<garnt> down and you see in my video when I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like trying to figure out which fit </garnt>
<garnt> which is which and that was like just </garnt>
<garnt> crossing our figures the realization </garnt>
<garnt> when I had crossed out Zachary was just </garnt>
<garnt> like my heart </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] sank man my heart sank when I </garnt>
<garnt> was like oh </garnt>
<connor> oh no I crossed us a girl how could I oh </connor>
<connor> my god don't don't look at what I'm </connor>
<joey> humbled I mean I mean that's this this </joey>
<joey> is essentially all I bought at a stop I </joey>
<joey> think I spent I didn't even spend $100 </joey>
<garnt> at a stop I think because yeah I spent </garnt>
<garnt> nine thousand nine hundred and forty and </garnt>
<garnt> at a stop because this shounen jump one </garnt>
<garnt> was 5,000 yen it's kind of expensive but </garnt>
<garnt> not too bad I mean I just try to get </garnt>
<garnt> syndra's is like Miriam Mirren's I don't </garnt>
<connor> to say I bought the single best figure </connor>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<connor> $30.00 Mike Wazowski is so cool that's </connor>
<garnt> actually like that's I know cuz I saw </garnt>
<garnt> Mike Wazowski I'm like ado shouting I </garnt>
<joey> was like Mike what are you doing here so </joey>
<connor> I have it was a $30.00 purchase and I </connor>
<connor> just wanted to make you guys laugh yeah </connor>
<joey> I I can see that that's good for </joey>
<garnt> actually why I love this dude I love how </garnt>
<joey> like the base is the monsters in Claudia </joey>
<garnt> yes that's so cool I bought it for a </garnt>
<connor> troll but I actually thought it's not </connor>
<joey> bad no that's actually I think our </joey>
<connor> audience can appreciate that that's so </connor>
<garnt> cool do you have any more figures Connor </garnt>
<joey> I have plenty hot key figures yeah I </joey>
<joey> mean I'm all out so I'm just gonna watch </joey>
<garnt> you guys you keep talking yeah Meg am in </garnt>
<connor> my life cool she was a cheap I think </connor>
<joey> she's like 19 bucks make me some mega </joey>
<joey> mint agree it's a pretty big figure like </joey>
<connor> the form factor of this box it's pretty </connor>
<connor> deceiving </connor>
<joey> that's what do you notice about a mega </joey>
<joey> mint figurines and some of them are like </joey>
<joey> way cheaper than what they should be </joey>
<connor> it's it's hard to tell the difference </connor>
<connor> between an $80 mega man figure and a $20 </connor>
<garnt> maybe like you know it's up with some of </garnt>
<garnt> the popular characters there's like so </garnt>
<garnt> many different prices yeah yeah with </garnt>
<garnt> some of the popular characters because I </garnt>
<garnt> think I was about to buy I was gonna buy </garnt>
<garnt> darkness as well oh I thought Joey was </garnt>
<garnt> gonna buy Mega Man </garnt>
<garnt> thought about it but I'm like I don't </garnt>
<joey> need to and I reckon one of you guys is </joey>
<garnt> gonna buy in so hold on hold on well </garnt>
<connor> ninety point each Oh Joe figures oh wow </connor>
<connor> it's um it's funny you asked oh thank </connor>
<garnt> god </garnt>
<joey> thank God I would just like to preface </joey>
<joey> that that was not a scripted cuz we were </joey>
<garnt> just showing figures and I remember </garnt>
<joey> thinking I I say in the video okay </joey>
<joey> Connors gonna buy Joe Joe figures I </joey>
<joey> don't need to buy it I don't need to buy </joey>
<joey> any Joe Joe figures yeah so if you </joey>
<joey> didn't buy any I would have been like </joey>
<garnt> how did we go an entire [ __ ] trip to a </garnt>
<garnt> key Harbor without buying any joke boy </garnt>
<garnt> multiple Jared your fingers actually </garnt>
<garnt> because it's all sides okay good good on </garnt>
<connor> Brad so this is the figure that I've </connor>
<joey> actually never seen before this is the </joey>
<connor> crazy diamond George a figure and it's </connor>
<connor> the one of the special colored editions </connor>
<connor> actually I think is the there's a normal </connor>
<connor> colored version and I've never seen this </connor>
<connor> figure before and I've never seen it </connor>
<connor> listed anywhere or anything but there's </connor>
<connor> two of them in the store funny enough I </connor>
<connor> hope somebody like 19 bucks for 19 bucks </connor>
<connor> that's a really nice figure and if </connor>
<connor> you've seen Joe Joe figures you know </connor>
<connor> they look ABS a charge a lot more for a </connor>
<connor> lot less effort it's it's tragic that </connor>
<connor> like a 20-buck figure for the special </connor>
<connor> call edition is like way better than I I </connor>
<joey> paid a hundred 20 also like enjoyed your </joey>
<joey> figures it's like a double-edged sword </joey>
<joey> is that like some of them just look like </joey>
<connor> absolute ass some of them do not look </connor>
<garnt> like the character tonight and it's kind </garnt>
<joey> of tragic it's like one of the most </joey>
<garnt> influential and popular series in Japan </garnt>
<joey> and they do them dirty but it's a good </joey>
<joey> thing we can agree on that that is a </joey>
<joey> beautiful figure my boy should I show my </joey>
<garnt> next figure that I bought I bought a lot </garnt>
<joey> of they stop for 10 this is war dude I </joey>
<garnt> knew whose ACCA's before we left the </garnt>
<garnt> store I and I don't know if we got this </garnt>
<connor> on camera I don't think we did Joe he </connor>
<connor> was like I was gonna buy this figure and </connor>
<connor> he pointed to the booth where I got this </connor>
<connor> figure he was like oh I must spend in </connor>
<connor> the different booth and I was thinking I </connor>
<joey> bought the moment like I looked over it </joey>
<joey> was like a comic I was like I looked </joey>
<joey> over and it was just gone my head I'm </joey>
<garnt> just like someone bought it it is how </garnt>
<garnt> much that cost it was like 30 bucks 30 </garnt>
<connor> bucks </connor>
<connor> oh cool that is for 30 but it is so it </connor>
<connor> is not standing up I </connor>
<connor> realizing now okay good like do you see </connor>
<connor> cure figure no yeah never [ __ ] steal </connor>
<joey> okay absolutely </joey>
<connor> that's very cool oh now it's standing up </connor>
<connor> yeah I guess now yeah this is my last </connor>
<connor> figure I of course I wanted to fill this </connor>
<joey> channel with some degeneracy just you </joey>
<joey> know what you just the question is how </joey>
<joey> much was I willing to spend on it are </joey>
<connor> you kidding me yes really yeah yeah oh </connor>
<garnt> my god do you want to know how much I </garnt>
<joey> spend figure I think I don't think I </joey>
<joey> walked past and I think I remember it </joey>
<garnt> being way over my budget how much this </garnt>
<garnt> was $170 when I saw it I was like I </garnt>
<garnt> gotta get this cuz you know you know </garnt>
<garnt> that mean when it's just like how to </garnt>
<garnt> help me budget this correctly when I was </garnt>
<garnt> going through the sheet I was like </garnt>
<garnt> crossing off figures and Sydney was like </garnt>
<garnt> just get rid of the [ __ ] highschool </garnt>
<garnt> DxD getting rid of the high school I </garnt>
<connor> walked past this figurine had my video </connor>
<joey> and I was like I would get this okay if </joey>
<connor> it wasn't a hundred and seventy dollars </connor>
<joey> because I didn't want to go overboard </joey>
<joey> but the moment I saw and I'm like one of </joey>
<connor> these ones that feel when I realize that </connor>
<connor> I don't have the most expensive figure </connor>
<joey> yeah oh this is in two parts okay so I </joey>
<garnt> was trying to put that together under </garnt>
<joey> underneath okay okay yeah what's what is </joey>
<joey> this oh sure yeah figures okay is this </joey>
<garnt> uh is this the dragon from slime it is </garnt>
<connor> indeed yes my parts holy [ __ ] I didn't </connor>
<connor> realize that we'd that fly line would be </connor>
<joey> representing this much because honestly </joey>
<garnt> like I didn't put too much thought </garnt>
<connor> into what I was trying to buy there we </connor>
<connor> go this came with so many oh I'm so glad </connor>
<garnt> I'm so glad you got a reamer ooh so wow </garnt>
<connor> that's so cool yeah wait till we build </connor>
<connor> it but like this was a two-in-one figure </connor>
<connor> I don't know if that counts as me buying </connor>
<connor> two figures or if it's I paid one but </connor>
<connor> it's true I mean that's technically one </connor>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> no no cuz they're not actually joined </joey>
<joey> yeah they were sold to get oh my god </joey>
<joey> yeah so guess how much I paid for these </joey>
<connor> two yes </connor>
<garnt> 20 bucks I pay 30 bucks for the both of </garnt>
<garnt> them okay because I originally said </garnt>
<connor> originally had a Merriam figure and a </connor>
<connor> Rimmer figure which is 35 bucks </connor>
<connor> no no it was like it was like a bundle I </connor>
<connor> dragon no no she's real nice oh no KOCO </connor>
<connor> with Miriam and then I decided to go </connor>
<garnt> against that just to go from a rim so </garnt>
<joey> I'm glad that we don't have a single </joey>
<garnt> like character that's like overlap yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I'm surprised cuz I thought I </garnt>
<joey> thought at this point we would at least </joey>
<garnt> have like some dupes </garnt>
<garnt> or characters but we've miraculously </garnt>
<connor> somehow come over help add where's his </connor>
<connor> head not going in what [ __ ] this wing is </connor>
<connor> not going in either but yeah I sold me a </connor>
<connor> faulty thing I'm jerking those variants </connor>
<connor> so is that everything you ball Connor my </connor>
<connor> finger gone I spent money on that but </connor>
<garnt> yeah I thought you know I knew I knew </garnt>
<garnt> falling apart </garnt>
<garnt> I knew one of you were gonna get a slime </garnt>
<garnt> figure yeah so I thought you know I'll </garnt>
<connor> get it cuz I thought also it's super </connor>
<connor> blue yeah I thought that would look sick </connor>
<garnt> on the podcast so like how much did you </garnt>
<garnt> spend on we'll find out later because I </garnt>
<connor> store where I spend the most I thought I </connor>
<garnt> thought because when I finished uh when </garnt>
<garnt> I finished go through the store I </garnt>
<joey> thought that I had at least bought the </joey>
<joey> most figures in this door because I saw </joey>
<garnt> Joey's horn and I was like I got this I </garnt>
<connor> got a son I realize how many figures you </connor>

<joey> [ __ ] stare at this beautiful thing in </joey>
<connor> the background every singing to monetize </connor>
<joey> every episode is because of a Reese's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> alright so with that giant hole all the </joey>
<garnt> way by right so let's go with the third </garnt>
<joey> way how much did you spend </joey>
<joey> I stopped I spin I mean I spend less </joey>
<joey> than a hundred dollars at a store my </joey>
<joey> most expensive thing was the jumps thing </joey>
<joey> right here which was 50 bucks that's </joey>
<connor> cool as [ __ ] though it is cool as [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> two hundred and twenty bucks </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god [ __ ] exactly I spent because </garnt>
<joey> one of the challenges was whoever spends </joey>
<joey> the most at a single store gets a point </joey>
<garnt> what was actually we can figure out yeah </garnt>
<joey> we </joey>
<joey> IIIi OS I also spent 220 bucks oh it's </joey>
<joey> gonna go down to the tiny Emeril's nyet </joey>
<joey> all right but the third store we went to </joey>
<joey> was cables k books much like a lot of </joey>
<joey> stores in the Virgil kcon building they </joey>
<joey> sell figurines but they also sell a </joey>
<joey> bunch of light other much like figurines </joey>
<joey> plushies just little knickknacks and </joey>
<joey> stuff like yeah um </joey>
<joey> so remember oh no I do remember exactly </joey>
<garnt> what I bought two things yes okay so </garnt>
<garnt> let's let's talk about strategy first so </garnt>
<garnt> what was your guy's a strategy going </garnt>
<connor> into cave K bugs this was the point </connor>
<connor> where I started considering how much </connor>
<connor> money I have left </connor>
<connor> Aesop it was like spend Spanish because </connor>
<connor> I felt like I was too behind it had </connor>
<joey> animate yeah so I went ham in a stop and </joey>
<connor> then uh this is when I was like okay </connor>
<joey> maybe I should start like being careful </joey>
<joey> I was the complete opposite at this </joey>
<garnt> point I had more than half of my budget </garnt>
<garnt> left </garnt>
<garnt> oh my so I was gonna go like big big </garnt>
<garnt> bucks boy on K books and the final army </garnt>
<connor> army what would you buy I got two okay </connor>
<garnt> one of my challenges was to get in a </garnt>
<garnt> stall for figurine right I don't know </garnt>
<joey> why super specific but I found one a </joey>
<garnt> stole faux figurine didn't even come it </garnt>
<connor> because what happened right who was to </connor>
<connor> those two you didn't find because </connor>
<connor> because we were walking past there and I </connor>
<joey> was I saw the Estelle full figure yeah </joey>
<joey> and I just I was just like putting loads </joey>
<joey> of other figures on corner come look at </joey>
<garnt> this I got this and I didn't I didn't </garnt>
<joey> see the second one so there was another </joey>
<garnt> one so I like waited ahead and I watched </garnt>
<connor> him as he was going through it and he </connor>
<joey> actually found another one but the one </joey>
<garnt> that you buried he didn't find ya oh </garnt>
<garnt> damn it the kiss he always got me with </garnt>
<joey> that conspiracy but then the second one </joey>
<joey> I got oh the second challenge was to </joey>
<connor> find a car kept a soccer figurine </connor>
<connor> unfortunately I couldn't find one but I </connor>
<connor> know that if I went to K books like six </connor>
<connor> months ago </connor>
<connor> you don't like soccer I did the new </connor>
<garnt> soccer was still like hot and fresh in </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's minds I don't know what it </garnt>
<garnt> found one well so I gave up on that so </garnt>
<garnt> instead I </garnt>
<garnt> bigboy dollars and god Oh hold your </garnt>
<garnt> stinky figurine cool I'm like I'm not a </garnt>
<garnt> huge fan of Tanya personally by oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this is a [ __ ] cool that's an awesome </garnt>
<joey> figurine yeah like that this was a </joey>
<connor> hundred and thirty two dolls oh okay </connor>
<joey> with an interchangeable head book every </joey>
<connor> episode we're changing the head I'd say </connor>
<joey> that I'll have to do it but that's </joey>
<joey> pretty much the only two things I bought </joey>
<garnt> yeah cuz at this point I was just trying </garnt>
<garnt> to stay alive they stopped it stopped </garnt>
<connor> really fun with you spend how much are </connor>
<connor> they stop and then you also spend a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> ton of anime yeah yes so I had I think I </garnt>
<garnt> budgeted it it's like I think I could </garnt>
<garnt> only spend around 70 bucks or something </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe less in each store so I had to </garnt>
<garnt> complete the challenges which was </garnt>
<garnt> getting a figure from a shown in Syria </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god I mean I already knew I'd lost </garnt>
<garnt> this point so I didn't really but what </garnt>
<joey> surprised me because I I wasn't really </joey>
<joey> familiar with K books so I didn't know </joey>
<joey> what kind of merchandise they had yeah </joey>
<joey> they did not they did not have a lot of </joey>
<joey> shown in figure no that's all right it </joey>
<joey> was between this one and a leafy one and </joey>
<joey> I just went for the cheapest one because </joey>
<garnt> I needed what I challenged I wanted to </garnt>
<joey> challenge was to buy something lewd </joey>
<connor> right that was not difficult as there </connor>
<connor> was a gigantic hentai see the like I </connor>
<joey> bought like I think like half of the </joey>
<connor> source was just like 18 so I'm like I'm </connor>
<joey> like this is big remote what what lewd </joey>
<joey> thing can i buy that's really cheap and </joey>
<joey> can keep me on budget so john alter john </joey>
<joey> old horse I just okay I need I was I was </joey>
<joey> more focused on find finding a cover </joey>
<joey> which wouldn't get us easily like which </joey>
<joey> just wouldn't get this video off the </joey>
<joey> what am I too much do you monetize yeah </joey>
<joey> that's big brain youtuber boy but I did </joey>
<joey> buy one more okay but I just checked it </joey>
<garnt> before we start recording I don't think </garnt>
<connor> I can show of blood </connor>
<joey> get all reaction yeah yeah maybe mood on </joey>
<joey> just put like a huge black screen over </joey>
<garnt> whatever God brings out so I bought </garnt>

<joey> gonna buy a two hundred dollar figure </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah k books quickly ruin that plan </joey>
<joey> right challenges so I spent seventy </joey>
<joey> seven bucks on just my challenge yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and then obviously I realized when </joey>
<joey> I drop to a Miami which what about now </joey>
<joey> yeah I challenge that I had to do as </joey>
<garnt> well yeah yeah so for me I'm Yami was </garnt>
<connor> just I was just trying to survive I was </connor>

<garnt> think $60 or $50 60 bucks </garnt>
<connor> what yeah yeah I was just at this point </connor>
<connor> I was just praying and hoping like I'm </connor>
<connor> wishes [ __ ] $40 on a budget pillowcase </connor>
<garnt> okay part of the challenge wanted ad </garnt>
<garnt> obviously macaron okay you're like </garnt>
<connor> Gamble's all his money's amazing I just </connor>
<connor> don't understand why I got the money all </connor>
<garnt> the time man it sucks more because like </garnt>
<garnt> I because I knew this would be my only </garnt>
<garnt> opportunity to buy a document of course </garnt>
<connor> why did you want to buy one sir badly </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] the pot of trash taste that's </garnt>
<garnt> why look it's good trash taste for a </garnt>
<connor> reason we have a lot of me we had a lot </connor>
<connor> of blank space in the background where </connor>
<connor> we can hang one up so I was like </connor>
<garnt> dakimakura I think that's a good </garnt>
<garnt> purchase and now I bought one wasted $40 </garnt>
<joey> can't even use it [ __ ] brilliant </joey>
<joey> gonna be a black bar I've got one at my </joey>
<connor> house I'd rather pillow the dakimakura </connor>
<joey> pillow so really I mean I've got one of </joey>
<joey> shoes of course but uh with me for army </joey>
<joey> army this is where I spent the most </joey>
<joey> amount of money cuz I have almost like I </joey>
<joey> think I had like two thirds of my budget </joey>
<joey> still left because I knew I've been into </joey>
<connor> umm yummy before not the one in the </connor>
<connor> Dajjal cake on that we went to but </connor>
<connor> there's another one in October why don't </connor>
<connor> you spend a lot of money on I spent a </connor>
<connor> lot of money there and I know they have </connor>
<connor> some really expensive figuring oh yeah </connor>
<connor> but they have a huge selection as well </connor>
<joey> so I knew I was gonna find something </joey>
<joey> hopefully good I mean that's before this </joey>
<joey> but my two challenges I believe was buy </joey>
<joey> a plushy a character plushie okay and </joey>
<garnt> the other one I don't remember what it </garnt>
<garnt> was but I got okay I needed to you know </garnt>
<garnt> spend my money goes yeah yeah exactly so </garnt>
<connor> I got Mughal and Final Fantasy and Final </connor>
<joey> Fantasy 7 remake out of it that's cute </joey>
<joey> alright give out JRPG love us some love </joey>
<joey> as well yeah so I got that and the most </joey>
<joey> expensive figuring I've got overall Oh </joey>
<connor> more expensive oh okay okay </connor>
<garnt> is did you buy this purposely to like I </garnt>
<joey> bought this purposely to get as close to </joey>
<garnt> $500 as well oh okay so this is not part </garnt>
<garnt> of the challenge yeah I got lucky </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't me from daily life oh nice I </garnt>
<garnt> mean again this is kind of gonna be like </garnt>
<garnt> rias in the sense that like possibly do </garnt>
<garnt> I know took sucky figurines can offer </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason so expensive yeah I mean </garnt>
<joey> she's a really popular table life </joey>
<joey> character which 141 what is expensive is </joey>
<joey> the rear software he lost that challenge </joey>
<connor> body </connor>
<joey> IIIi may have overheard or saw what Joey </joey>
<joey> was when he was buying that one yeah and </joey>
<joey> I thought all I gotta do is beep 1300 </joey>
<joey> yeah I literally just went over 1300 my </joey>
<joey> expensive figure reveals soon okay okay </joey>
<garnt> okay because yes that was everything you </garnt>
<garnt> bought and that's everything I bought </garnt>
<garnt> okay because for me amiami was a </garnt>
<joey> stressful experience not because of the </joey>
<joey> story the story itself is great but </joey>
<joey> because I saw my challenges which was </joey>
<joey> one find an Avery Evangelion figurine um </joey>
<joey> that was a lot harder than I initially </joey>
<joey> gave it credit yeah yeah because I </joey>
<joey> missed the entire figure section right </joey>
<joey> at the back Sarge necks yeah yeah we </joey>
<joey> were just walking around and there was </joey>
<joey> one figure I found which was $200 no </joey>
<joey> actually no way that I could buy that </joey>
<joey> figure yeah and the I found another </joey>
<joey> figure which was fifty bucks </joey>
<garnt> I've no no fifty to seventy bucks but I </garnt>
<garnt> that was the tiny bill budget this this </garnt>
<garnt> this girl [ __ ] me so hey I mean she's </garnt>
<connor> a succubus that's luckily I found an </connor>
<garnt> oscar pop figure because it was the </garnt>
<joey> cheapest okay I think this is gonna be </joey>
<joey> awarded for the most Normie no offense </joey>
<joey> if you like pop vinyls but we know no </joey>
<connor> offense if you do like let's look at hey </connor>
<connor> pop figures oh Jesus how much you spent </connor>
<garnt> on this 14 bucks you know what it's like </garnt>
<connor> it's it's like you go to like hey you </connor>
<connor> come to Japan right you have all these </connor>
<connor> amazing figures yeah it's like go into </connor>
<connor> like a like Germany and being like I </connor>
<connor> want hot dogs from the can please I want </connor>
<joey> I want not none that starts like gonna </joey>
<joey> Germany me like can have an Asahi </joey>
<joey> No yeah I'll give you for the challenge </joey>
<joey> yeah it was for the challenge instead </joey>
<joey> like like this army ami had a lot of </joey>
<joey> good figures yeah I really really wanted </joey>
<joey> to buy I just needed to go for the </joey>
<joey> cheapest okay and then the second one </joey>
<joey> which I had no idea how to complete was </joey>
<joey> by a furry and like 100% non humanoid </joey>
<joey> figure and I was like okay the only </joey>
<joey> thing I could [ __ ] think of was </joey>
<joey> chopper from one piece yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> did not have any chopping oh my gosh I </joey>
<joey> was like I've probably lost this and </joey>
<joey> then I was like mmm wait a minute that's </joey>
<garnt> there's probably there's probably one </garnt>
<joey> thing I could I could twist and that's a </joey>
<garnt> heavy figure okay okay I was like okay </garnt>
<garnt> if I can't go the chopper route maybe I </garnt>
<garnt> can go the Pokemon routes because I </garnt>
<joey> guess that's how they translating </joey>
<joey> Japanese they realize that there's a way </joey>
<joey> cuz when you pulled that out yeah I </joey>
<garnt> thought you were gonna get one of these </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah cuz I didn't think those kind </joey>
<joey> of does a figure I thought but I'm like </joey>
<joey> V's furry it's nonhumanoid it's a figure </joey>
<joey> shut the [ __ ] up I am getting that </joey>
<joey> points okay okay okay that's back count </joey>
<joey> tell us that counts because there was </joey>
<joey> between like Eevee and Mewtwo I think I </joey>
<joey> was like yeah he's cuter so yeah what </joey>
<connor> are the challenges that you had Connor I </connor>
<connor> had by three anime mugs or glasses ass </connor>
<connor> because they've other sets or anything </connor>
<joey> yeah it's buy them separately yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> and then it was also by a figure that </connor>
<garnt> you think is trash so we're how much </garnt>
<connor> budget that you have left at this point </connor>
<joey> 140 something also you Alan set out </joey>
<joey> pretty wall between the four stores yeah </joey>
<connor> because I BAC spent nothing at anime I </connor>
<joey> spent 70 bucks a K books so I kinda like </joey>
<joey> did pretty good at budgeting by accident </joey>
<joey> like I didn't plan anything I think not </joey>
<joey> having challenges that [ __ ] me over </joey>
<joey> was yeah yeah yeah that was definitely </joey>
<joey> hopeful yeah shitty summary oh yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> no it was like 220 yen as well which my </joey>
<joey> sheepish figure is is </joey>
<joey> Ida who the [ __ ] is the center your </joey>
<joey> character does anyone know I think I </joey>
<joey> know what you know I know like the what </joey>
<joey> that's cool </joey>
<joey> okay I know time I'll go warm the egg </joey>
<joey> one oh good I liked it yeah yeah yeah I </joey>
<joey> don't see Hello Kitty but I bought from </joey>
<joey> sure that was a hundred yen luckily Wow </joey>
<joey> every other mug was like a thousand yen </joey>
<joey> like nice to find two for 600 yen so we </joey>
<joey> have more mugs now for the podcast right </joey>
<joey> get all drink from those possibly maybe </joey>
<garnt> never </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know these are like there's the </garnt>
<connor> mark so I did the challenge is cool and </connor>
<garnt> then I had and I was like so annoyed </garnt>
<garnt> because the is a frothy figure the one </garnt>
<garnt> with like the cool comic book text I saw </garnt>
<garnt> one I saw that well I had just enough </garnt>
<garnt> budget to get that if it wasn't for this </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> so I had to completely change my mind </joey>
<connor> I'm not saying the stuff is bad but it </connor>
<joey> ruined my plan yeah so I had to go with </joey>
<joey> different I mean I guess you get what </joey>
<garnt> you pay for right that's all that's a </garnt>
<joey> like there's 100 yen for a reason you </joey>
<garnt> know what what series is this I have no </garnt>
<connor> idea oh no it's all characters on the </connor>
<connor> back and then these are from oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> they look like a timer I don't watch or </garnt>
<connor> play any or tell my games I know that </connor>
<joey> huge here in Japan but I mean for a </joey>
<joey> female demographic yeah I was just </joey>
<connor> prefer yaoi just straight up yeah don't </connor>
<joey> like you had come out with a yaoi like </joey>
<connor> manga I think you would have won like </connor>
<connor> cool the final figure and most expensive </connor>
<garnt> figure that I bought right Oh si si o si </garnt>
<garnt> - si si si - what happened same thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's her like on the bike that's yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's cool that's a I should get out so </joey>
<garnt> you guys can fully appreciate me to go </garnt>
<connor> but yes is that that was a hundred and </connor>
<connor> thirty seven thirty honestly worth every </connor>
<connor> penny </connor>
<joey> okay so while they were opening these </joey>
<joey> figurines up I guess I just want to ask </joey>
<joey> you guys like how was the challenge like </joey>
<joey> overall like do you have a good feeling </joey>
<joey> I </joey>
<connor> more stuff by the way are you add more </connor>
<joey> stuff okay oh yeah we should oh okay </joey>
<connor> we should also preface as well that </connor>
<connor> there is like consequences for the final </connor>
<connor> scores and yes basically whoever has the </connor>
<connor> lowest score at the end like including </connor>
<connor> the start the points that we got in our </connor>
<connor> individual videos as well as the points </connor>
<connor> that we're gonna add up at the end of </connor>
<connor> this episode this one has to do some </connor>
<connor> kind of punishment in a traditional </connor>
<connor> really sadistic Japanese way we </connor>
<connor> basically gonna be consuming something </connor>
<connor> that we personally don't don't really </connor>
<connor> want to consume with these two because </connor>
<connor> they're absolute [ __ ] they're gonna </connor>
<connor> have to eat one packet of knock door </connor>
<joey> which is like Japanese fermented </joey>
<connor> soybeans it's disgusting I love it </connor>
<garnt> smells horrible </garnt>
<garnt> okay I love it thank you very much I </garnt>
<garnt> grew up with it </garnt>
<garnt> so obviously I'm not gonna eat that if I </garnt>
<garnt> lose I'm gonna have to eat the spicy </garnt>
<garnt> noodles that I ate in my Jojo quiz video </garnt>
<garnt> which you can go check out on my channel </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but we're gonna find that out at </garnt>
<garnt> the end of the episode once we've </garnt>
<garnt> calculated all the scores but I guess in </garnt>
<garnt> the meantime as well let us know down in </garnt>
<joey> the comments below so far what is the </joey>
<joey> favorite figurine that you saw it'sit's </joey>
<garnt> my one I know most likely it's gonna be </garnt>
<joey> this one I'm like so happy I bought that </joey>
<joey> now because I brought it on pure </joey>
<joey> instinct right I wasn't trying to win </joey>
<connor> the game I didn't have any [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> strategy in mind you were horny on MAME </connor>
<garnt> I was just 40 on main and I just wanted </garnt>
<joey> everyone to see just saying so has the </joey>
<connor> bigger Dom truck yeah yeah now I know </connor>
<connor> gone is gonna [ __ ] himself now but the </connor>
<connor> rest of my purchases were to get that </connor>
<garnt> even 500 bucks okay Sarge bought like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] aren't even and this is what is </garnt>
<connor> that what is that I just guess I'm a </connor>
<garnt> door knob I think of something it's like </garnt>
<connor> an arm in let me let me open this a </connor>
<connor> towel of some some some money Tony it </connor>
<garnt> was a hundred yen towel what is this </garnt>
<joey> show that's the POV anime where like the </joey>
<joey> cute girls like work out yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's so bad I love it </garnt>
<joey> I got some scroll from some show wow you </joey>
<joey> really like that why did someone have </joey>
<garnt> like a challenger yet to buy wall squall </garnt>
<joey> I was from a different Oh trading cards </joey>
<garnt> for 210 yen what is this what is this oh </garnt>
<joey> wait you can put something in here well </joey>
<joey> hopefully it for like tickets maybe some </joey>
<joey> like that train tickets </joey>
<connor> maybe concert tickets its man you know </connor>
<connor> if you don't know if you want like to </connor>
<connor> know who is it weird movie you just put </connor>
<connor> this on like a track everything I bought </connor>
<garnt> and it came out through an even 500 </garnt>
<garnt> exactly oh are you serious </garnt>
<garnt> hang on 500 [ __ ] I did the exact I had </garnt>
<connor> this footage this in my video which you </connor>
<connor> guys didn't see I went to the cashier </connor>
<connor> and I went 10 yen over so I asked the </connor>
<connor> guy I'm like no no take all the stuff </connor>
<connor> out I'm going back and they were all so </connor>
<connor> confused they're like what's he trying </connor>
<connor> to say I'm like you kick up rid of the </connor>
<joey> stuff I gotta go back so I went and </joey>
<joey> found exactly what it was good the maths </joey>
<joey> on the spot went through my camera </joey>
<connor> footage to find out what I spend at </connor>
<connor> least roll oh my do exactly 500 bucks I </connor>
<joey> was like I don't think there's anyone </joey>
<joey> that's gonna get close to $500 like at </joey>
<joey> all like if I can get as close as I can </joey>
<joey> to 500 then I think I probably won so I </joey>
<garnt> think my overall price came to 49 </garnt>
<joey> thousand eight hundred and forty so I </joey>
<garnt> was 160 yen off because for me I was </garnt>
<garnt> like after a stop I had just stopped </garnt>
<garnt> calculate I was not even uh I I died </garnt>
<joey> like I was like I'm probably gonna go </joey>
<garnt> bust probably gonna go bust and lose the </garnt>
<garnt> entire thing but no I - came out to </garnt>
<joey> 47,000 150 - yeah which is like four </joey>
<joey> hundred seventy dollars that's how we do </joey>
<joey> that's how we we should probably explain </joey>
<garnt> that we are calculating it by dollars by </garnt>
<joey> just dividing by a hundred yeah so I </joey>
<joey> guess for the first challenge of whoever </joey>
<connor> can get closest to $500 those two points </connor>
<connor> are gonna go to call hell yes that means </connor>
<connor> I'm the holy [ __ ] there's 10 points damn </connor>
<connor> I was so confident that I was like I </connor>
<connor> thought like all both of you were gonna </connor>
<joey> get like yeah I'm like not a hundred </joey>
<connor> sixty wait I got this yeah Jerry seems </connor>
<joey> so confident when we were filming that I </joey>
<connor> thought </connor>
<joey> the exact same things I got like exactly </joey>
<garnt> Lucas cuz this [ __ ] he was like I </garnt>
<connor> thought he'd planned everything right </connor>
<connor> name same I talked to him off screen he </connor>
<connor> turned up smiling and everything yeah </connor>
<connor> he's like I got my strategy for each </connor>
<connor> door I'm like I'm no I did not like a </connor>
<connor> good game of poker you're gonna be </connor>
<connor> overcome whatever you bluffed me into </connor>
<connor> being exact with my money I wouldn't </connor>
<connor> have done that if I didn't know that you </connor>
<joey> might have been a guy I didn't think you </joey>
<joey> were gonna like pile this small [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> forget exact I wanted to get those two </connor>
<joey> points age what I don't want to eat </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] I can't well then that was huge </connor>
<joey> so let's go over the next couple of </joey>
<joey> challenges I think there's ten left yeah </joey>
<garnt> so the second one is the most expensive </garnt>
<connor> figure obviously that goes on and this </connor>
<connor> done that was one hundred and sixty uh </connor>
<garnt> hundred hundred and sixty thousand yen </garnt>
<connor> 767 170 box by one and then mine was 137 </connor>
<joey> so Gong gets the point for that one yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah next one is the cheapest </joey>
<connor> figurine I got the 220 yen figure yeah </connor>
<joey> anyone did anyone beat that no mine was </joey>
<joey> puck which is 900 Nader Oh mine was I </joey>
<garnt> think I can't even [ __ ] remember it </garnt>
<connor> was a thousand bucks so even if I didn't </connor>
<connor> buy that I still had the even gallier no </connor>
<connor> you still would have won even if I sir </connor>
<garnt> okay the most the lowest rated series on </garnt>
<joey> mal which was yours number </joey>
<connor> it's Tommy brave which is thinking that </connor>
<garnt> mug and it was like two thousand three </garnt>
<joey> hundred and seventy five seventeen </joey>
<garnt> thousand four hundred and forty four </garnt>
<joey> seventeen 1744 okay or now well give me </joey>
<garnt> the point because mine wasn't berserk </garnt>
<garnt> which is five thousand six hundred and </garnt>
<garnt> eighty no whoa no oh because it's the </garnt>
<joey> anime </joey>
<garnt> oh hell yeah garbage anime not the mom </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure if I looked at what that </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] towel was the schools might even </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] know what it is so I guess </joey>
<garnt> that's not fair point to me baby </garnt>

<connor> figures bought in one store no we did </connor>
<connor> store her and no we just did ok ok well </connor>

<connor> stop I fill up the thing I bought </connor>
<joey> everything that I filled up overall not </joey>
<connor> gonna lie or you've a good selection but </connor>
<connor> I think my selection is pretty [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> strong this figures great paw of the </connor>
<joey> rest his selection is strong ok next one </joey>
<joey> most spent on one series I all of mine </joey>
<joey> was separate so I'm just gonna go off </joey>
<connor> the base that this I wholly forgot about </connor>
<connor> this one yeah wait wait no probably Joe </connor>
<connor> Joe right it could have been Joe Joe but </connor>
<joey> it wouldn't have been I spent a lot on </joey>
<connor> like attack on Titan and Joe Joe but I </connor>
<joey> didn't get anything near 160 </joey>
<garnt> she's just so not carrying these these </garnt>
<connor> challenges alright it says we made </connor>
<connor> challenges that will reward you for </connor>
<joey> being frugal with your money yeah and </joey>
<joey> buying a little things yeah so would </joey>
<joey> reward you if you bought if you did the </joey>
<connor> gamble that paid off them oh yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's the game and yeah yeah cuz you </garnt>
<connor> had to guess right cuz I was thinking in </connor>
<connor> my head would Joey buy $200 figure oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah I thought both of you could and I </garnt>
<connor> was like maybe I should just give up on </connor>
<garnt> that challenge yeah just focus on </garnt>
<garnt> everything else cuz like I when I saw </garnt>
<connor> her I was like I just want to buy her </connor>
<connor> because she's like a pretty unique </connor>
<connor> figure tips and I thought I just I saw </connor>
<garnt> titty and I didn't I didn't think and </garnt>
<garnt> before I knew it I was writing down the </garnt>
<connor> number like his wife was right there as </connor>
<connor> well if I didn't matter it was funny </connor>
<garnt> because out of every figure I bought </garnt>
<joey> this one was the one that I didn't think </joey>
<joey> about the most I was getting this figure </joey>
<garnt> I'm not even gonna think about it my god </garnt>
<joey> the most spent on a nun figure well for </joey>
<connor> me it would be I guess which is 2,800 </connor>
<connor> Mama's wife 1001 </connor>
<garnt> okay mine was a document yes forty bucks </garnt>
<connor> on it </connor>
<garnt> if being a degenerate [ __ ] save me in </garnt>
<connor> this game I'm so [ __ ] happy yeah </connor>
<joey> what's the next are the most next one is </joey>
<joey> most faint in once how much did you </joey>
<joey> spend exactly an a stop I spent one </joey>
<joey> hundred and ninety seven dollars where'd </joey>
<garnt> you spend twenty two thousand three </garnt>
<connor> hundred and eighty yen I spent twenty </connor>
<garnt> two thousand one hundred and ninety come </garnt>
<joey> on come on come on </joey>
<joey> okay here we go okay closest to 69 </joey>
<garnt> closest to $69 this was this was the </garnt>
<joey> mean one this is all right for me it was </joey>
<joey> the short jump thing which was four </joey>
<joey> thousand nine hundred and eighty n okay </joey>
<connor> mine was nowhere near mine was the </connor>
<garnt> Edward Elric one yeah </garnt>
<connor> which was five thousand two hundred </connor>
<joey> ninety nine I win </joey>
<joey> $66 baby Oh on the jointer Giavanna one </joey>
<joey> funny Oh so the one that I had no choice </joey>
<connor> to buy don't me another point so sweet </connor>
<joey> oh my god I'm gonna [ __ ] lose alright </joey>
<connor> no Meah below me award so whoever has my </connor>
<garnt> highest rank on mal loses a point I </garnt>
<connor> think I lose this right did you what did </connor>
<garnt> you go attack on Titan </garnt>
<garnt> whatnot is that higher than attack on </garnt>
<garnt> Titan is number two I think if I look </garnt>
<garnt> what I lost </garnt>
<connor> number one is death no that's no </connor>
<joey> definite okay I'm definitely say most </joey>
<connor> minds according to according to my enemy </connor>
<connor> list it's death note shingeki no kyojin </connor>
<connor> sort online then full metal alchemist </connor>
<garnt> lose that one cuz cuz I could because I </garnt>
<connor> saw my boy Levi where is he was it </connor>
<joey> beautiful here like I couldn't oh I lose </joey>
<joey> a point so okay final one buying a hint </joey>
<connor> I figure okay okay okay so I'm at zero </connor>
<joey> points for me baby I'm gonna argue no no </joey>
<connor> no no no here's why I didn't I didn't </connor>
<joey> realize this but you can replace </joey>
<joey> Reese's tits to be uncensored are you </joey>
<joey> serious yeah yeah yeah I didn't know I </joey>
<garnt> didn't know what that was until I opened </garnt>
<garnt> it up those are just nipples </garnt>
<connor> I didn't know they came with </connor>
<garnt> interchangeable nipples we're gonna find </garnt>
<joey> that out after the yeah so light thing </joey>
<connor> they're attached to the hand yeah oh my </connor>
<joey> god I mean I would like to argue that </joey>
<joey> you buying the dakimakura already counts </joey>
<garnt> as like a thigh thing but that wasn't a </garnt>
<garnt> figure but III think that uncensored </garnt>
<garnt> nipples counts as a hentai figure </garnt>
<connor> because we condone but but is it though </connor>
<connor> cuz it's highschool DxD it's not </connor>
<connor> technically hand tie I mean if there's </connor>
<connor> tits out there is it a hentai figure I </connor>
<joey> mean I would like to argue that if it's </joey>
<garnt> something we can't show yes Paul if it's </garnt>
<garnt> something we can't show on this podcast </garnt>
<garnt> which I have okay this isn't a hint I'm </garnt>
<joey> so [ __ ] good only a single figure in </joey>
<joey> clutch oh my god okay and the total </joey>
<joey> scores were Connor with 12 points got </joey>
<joey> with 12 points and I got 7 points why I </joey>
<connor> would have won this if I didn't buy the </connor>
<joey> attack on tiny figures by the way I </joey>
<joey> woulda won this if I was actually smart </joey>
<garnt> probably would have lost this if I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't buy this one it was also your </garnt>
<garnt> downfall </garnt>
<garnt> yeah well it also more positives than </garnt>
<garnt> negatives because when we were like </garnt>
<garnt> going through all the challenges because </garnt>
<garnt> we had complete forgotten the overall </garnt>
<garnt> challenges and I was like wait a minute </garnt>
<garnt> like I think this one figure could be a </garnt>
<connor> lot of these challenges yeah I'm like I </connor>
<connor> totally forgot we put hentai figure in </connor>
<connor> there would have bought a shitty one if </connor>
<connor> I was like it would have been hard good </connor>
<connor> there's not any hentai figures no no cuz </connor>
<garnt> all of the hentai figures were like </garnt>
<connor> hundreds of dollars </connor>
<connor> yeah they mean you know it's a very </connor>
<joey> cultured I'm I just like to point out </joey>
<garnt> that I over all of these like overall </garnt>
<garnt> challenges I only know one point and </garnt>
<garnt> that was the fact that puck is the </garnt>
<joey> lowest rated out of everything here I </joey>
<joey> think the thing is that he went all out </joey>
<joey> with that yeah I was a bit more </joey>
<joey> conservative spread my money out you </joey>
<joey> know you went like mid range </joey>
<joey> hey I'm buying kind of expensive but no </joey>
<joey> this is like I like this [ __ ] I'll just </joey>
<garnt> buy it this is what happens when you try </garnt>
<garnt> to strategize I will at least like the </garnt>
<joey> credit of probably getting the coolest </joey>
<garnt> no no you use cool that's cool you can </garnt>
<connor> have that point yeah I'll have that put </connor>
<connor> up that face I'm not gonna win the pity </connor>
<connor> points cookie this is such a nice figure </connor>
<joey> alright well since I lost I guess I have </joey>
<joey> to eat a horrible thing I think I'll </joey>
<joey> produce a Maylene brought something yeah </joey>
<connor> which I am NOT looking forward to eating </connor>
<connor> well that already I that I I can't even </connor>
<connor> smell it but I can picture one of his </connor>
<connor> mouths like thank you may lean our </connor>
<joey> amazing producer yeah alright well my </joey>
<garnt> challenge has arrived </garnt>
<joey> hey it's ty so what what is this it's a </joey>
<garnt> pickled mudfish so apparently according </garnt>
<garnt> to our producer this smells awful </garnt>
<joey> apparently is just as bad if not worse </joey>
<garnt> than surstroemming which is like pickled </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's like mackerel filling </garnt>
<joey> it's like Swedish thing that old </joey>
<garnt> youtubers eat okay so I'm gonna open up </garnt>
<joey> and give it a smell of a jury </joey>
<joey> yeah I'm just gonna like I just saw that </joey>
<connor> man go to heaven smells like actual </connor>
<connor> light well it I can smell it from here </connor>
<joey> on smell it like oh this looks okay I </joey>
<joey> mean we have no utensils gonna have to </joey>
<garnt> get in that I think I'm I think I've </garnt>
<joey> eaten that oh my god </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like okay so it's like Verdi </joey>
<joey> salted fish right so it's gonna be super </joey>
<joey> super super salty I'm just gonna grab </joey>
<garnt> like a piece of it weights to show it on </garnt>
<garnt> camera [ __ ] show that piece on camera </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah careful the boghei is </joey>
<joey> that off yeah yeah just don't get on the </joey>
<garnt> microphone like Inez please gravity how </garnt>
<garnt> is it yes it's just salted fish right </garnt>
<garnt> some water because what what kills you </garnt>
<joey> is the [ __ ] artist the first few </joey>
<joey> bites aren't that bad but the more you </joey>
<garnt> chew it the more like the flavors come </garnt>
<garnt> out under the aftertaste just just it </garnt>
<garnt> hits you and your breath is gonna stink </garnt>
<garnt> for like a [ __ ] oh my god it's </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] stinks now hey guys should you </joey>
<connor> should wash it down with the durian </connor>
<joey> anything that would be a good I think </joey>
<garnt> that'd be a good idea </garnt>
<joey> seeing as you did lose pretty badly yeah </joey>
<garnt> don't smell it maybe a jury I don't </garnt>
<garnt> think like I've eaten a lot of weird </garnt>
<garnt> foods in my life this is easily the </garnt>
<connor> grossest thing I've ever had yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> smell it over there it's like a fire I </connor>
<garnt> think the smells getting stronger yeah </garnt>
<connor> fallout zone here it's like it's like a </connor>
<joey> nuclear blast I'm like fine if I hold my </joey>
<joey> nose because like I don't like smell the </joey>
<joey> thing but the moment I get rid smell my </joey>
<connor> own breath it's next week when we do the </connor>
<connor> podcast Joe will still be smelling it </connor>
<joey> yeah I really just hope this doesn't </joey>
<joey> give me like an illness because we're </joey>
<connor> like going on a trip to old tide people </connor>
<connor> right now </connor>
<joey> we're going on a vacation tomorrow yeah </joey>
<joey> I don't want to be sick it's gonna </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] stink it's in the windows of </connor>
<garnt> infectious episode like Jesus so so now </garnt>
<garnt> that the challenge is over what are you </garnt>
<connor> guys as closing thoughts I'm in each </connor>
<connor> little [ __ ] I mean you know the goal the </connor>
<garnt> ultimate goal was was the one not lose </garnt>
<garnt> and become like this mani yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> going through like the five stages of </garnt>
<joey> grief with his face you know we got to </joey>
<joey> decorate the office I think by a miracle </joey>
<garnt> we got like some pretty good variation </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah honestly would love to do some </garnt>
<connor> like this again in future with another </connor>
<garnt> challenge we're not going film I'm </garnt>
<joey> surprised that out of all the things </joey>
<joey> that we bought not a single person </joey>
<joey> bought the same thing yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> because that was the thing I was most </garnt>
<garnt> worried about right when I you know </garnt>
<garnt> pitched the challenge I was the thing I </garnt>
<garnt> was worried I was like what if we all </garnt>
<garnt> just go for the same [ __ ] figure Zaku </garnt>
<connor> dendekker </connor>
<connor> I would like three of your finest deck </connor>
<garnt> because because yeah I had a lot of fun </garnt>
<joey> filming in the stores and I would love </joey>
<joey> to do something like this again I don't </joey>
<joey> know if you guys enjoyed seeing the </joey>
<garnt> aftermath of all our different </garnt>
<garnt> individual challenges and how we like </garnt>
<connor> approached it yeah I mean I think it's </connor>
<garnt> the speak for all thing we have fun with </garnt>
<joey> every step of this process I really hope </joey>
<joey> that was reflect I got to ask you though </joey>
<garnt> yeah cuz this is your first time doing </garnt>
<garnt> like a video filming in public okay I'm </garnt>
<joey> used to embarrassing myself and how was </joey>
<garnt> it I got to know it was hard like </garnt>
<garnt> outside of animate when I was filming my </garnt>
<joey> intro I don't even know if you're gonna </joey>
<joey> see that because I'm thinking about </joey>
<joey> filming like a separate intro anyway so </joey>
<joey> but I was just like tripping over my </joey>
<joey> words I had no idea yeah give me a </joey>
<joey> script great I can read off the script </joey>
<joey> if I just have to talk about my thoughts </joey>
<joey> without any scripts and like a podcast </joey>
<connor> is different in my mind's cuz I have </connor>
<joey> people to bounce off right because when </joey>
<connor> I'm looking at a camera I'm like hey </connor>
<garnt> guys </garnt>
<joey> I'm here outside of an anime oh my gosh </joey>
<joey> like somewhat tribal speaking skill you </joey>
<joey> learn I think yeah and I mean I always </joey>
<garnt> awkward as [ __ ] I remember first but I </garnt>
<garnt> think I got used to it when I just it </garnt>
<garnt> was a stop animates I was so like </garnt>
<joey> getting my feet on the ground with a </joey>
<joey> stop I was just I think it was thanks to </joey>
<joey> just the facts the places well because I </joey>
<joey> wasn't great I wasn't thinking about </joey>
<joey> what challenges there were yeah I was </joey>
<joey> just thinking about getting as many </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] fingers like I did a lot of fun </connor>
<connor> I think it was well I was like a great </connor>
<connor> environment like when you get permission </connor>
<garnt> to film in a place and cuz the original </garnt>
<garnt> plan for this video was just to like </garnt>
<joey> MacGyver away through GoPro cover that </joey>
<connor> would have not been that great yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> but I mean I haven't edited the video </garnt>
<garnt> yet but I think it's gonna be pretty </garnt>
<joey> pretty entertaining and you guys can let </joey>
<joey> us know as well like how you guys found </joey>
<joey> those videos how you found this episode </joey>
<joey> hopefully you guys enjoyed watching me </joey>
<joey> eat literal [ __ ] this is easily the </joey>
<connor> worst [ __ ] thing I've ever had I can </connor>
<connor> still [ __ ] taste it I really want you </connor>
<connor> guys to smell your fingers I mean I </connor>
<connor> definitely even though this was like a </connor>
<garnt> logistical nightmare planning that's me </garnt>
<garnt> about logistics from episode oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> this was like actual logistical </joey>
<joey> nightmare planning all this yeah we had </joey>
<joey> to like bounce stores and it's short </joey>
<joey> notice and everything like I would </joey>
<joey> definitely be up for doing something </joey>
<joey> when it's like three angles again and </joey>
<connor> it's a challenge that we have concluded </connor>
<garnt> on the problem it's like you you like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not sure if you see in the video but </garnt>
<garnt> by the time we got to army army </garnt>
<garnt> I was I was exhausted like it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like that feeling when you've </garnt>
<connor> just spent an entire day at a con </connor>
<garnt> working oh yeah yeah I've got to do one </garnt>
<connor> more just a con in general yeah yeah I'm </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] oh we gotta have dinner oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> asleep </joey>
<garnt> like I remember post filming I just went </garnt>
<connor> home and collapse yeah yeah I didn't </connor>
<joey> leave my bed yeah I think we won't look </joey>
<connor> 10 kilometers that day yeah I checked my </connor>
<joey> like stat typical Tokyo Dave Church you </joey>
<joey> do a lot of walking when you come to </joey>
<garnt> Japan yeah but I think so what was the </garnt>
<garnt> favorite thing you guys bought them </garnt>
<joey> that's a good question </joey>
<garnt> easy play for you yeah instinctively I </garnt>
<connor> want to say like I mean I think it's </connor>
<connor> good it's sorted but I think the most </connor>
<joey> interesting for you and like coolest </joey>
<joey> ones I'm glad I bought was maybe the </joey>
<connor> akhira one which i thought was just so </connor>
<joey> far or the leave I want Mike Wazowski </joey>
<connor> though the name should be sad </connor>
<garnt> kendo yeah that's that's a good deal I </garnt>
<joey> think my favorite is definitely John oh </joey>
<connor> that's that's because it's so unique I </connor>
<connor> love unique figures yeah yeah there's so </connor>
<connor> many figures that look alike and who </connor>
<joey> doesn't like job exactly yeah I just </joey>
<garnt> that's gonna that it's just gonna look </garnt>
<connor> good yeah </connor>
<connor> what is okay what's the worst figure you </connor>
<connor> think each of us bought this is this </connor>
<connor> thing what the hell I don't know </connor>
<joey> actually I liked all the figurines I </joey>
<connor> bought maybe that's why I what's the </connor>
<garnt> most biggie thing I bought was one you </garnt>
<garnt> bought or I mean you bought so many </garnt>
<joey> icons </joey>
<connor> that's what yes probably you're [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> a Montague a free one that's kind of </connor>
<joey> excuse you trash tasty I do see one </joey>
<joey> small mine I have a registered weapon </joey>

<connor> [ __ ] on like some of the things we </connor>
<joey> bought but the stores are [ __ ] great </joey>
<connor> this business like if we shed on this </connor>
<joey> figure this isn't representative to the </joey>
<joey> what we had what they had at the store </joey>

<garnt> ISM a project by Japan Media Arts </garnt>
<garnt> Festival's </garnt>
<garnt> oversea promotion initiated by the </garnt>
<garnt> agency for Cultural Affairs of Japan man </garnt>
<garnt> that was a mouthful that's a serious </garnt>

<joey> of the three anime films it is a </joey>
<joey> colorful ninja yo machi the single one </joey>
<joey> is mother saboteur of the wind and the </joey>
<joey> third one is simply titled Rebecca so </joey>
<garnt> basically these are three films from the </garnt>
