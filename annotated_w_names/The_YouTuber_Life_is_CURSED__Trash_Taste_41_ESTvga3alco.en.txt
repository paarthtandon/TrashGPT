<SPEAKER_05> so by the time this comes out this would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have been very old by now but we haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> really got a chance to have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had a real debrief on our cycling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> special oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um because we we filmed an outro and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that turned out to be 26 minutes or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like that and we were just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah originally and people we were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> people don't want to hear us talk about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a special thing by the way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if you haven't watched the cycling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> special you should go and do that before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we we're going to talk he's talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about that video so if you want to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that link down below or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on screen now but um i think the biggest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> thing i mean obviously the reaction for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has been absolutely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> incredible but what i found funny was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how seriously people took when it came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> discussing who won and who lost and who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cheated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in that cycling special there was i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> never seen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like our subreddit turn into like just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the most like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> no you don't it was a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> free-for-all for a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a good period of time there it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like it was like a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> team guard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and joey versus team connor battle is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this how the twilight fandom were in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> their prime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean i get it you know they they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they're invested they're investing which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah but i mean okay i think i i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very like i'm very fake salty like i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fake i think we are all fake salty and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fake but like in real life as well i'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get like i'll start like getting like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll sound like loud i'm like yo this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] up and then i'll be like well you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you really can't like no no not really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just like getting annoyed about things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in a way that isn't like that's very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah british very british it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like this is i can't believe this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god really like i don't know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the chili i was like at the moment i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> sure when i found out you cheated i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] and then i probably just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought like all right yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's also clips of like me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about on my live stream but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously like i play up the saltiness </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i have you know it's good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> showmanship you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's unfortunate that like a large </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> majority of the internet doesn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> understand sarcasm there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so i there was a there was like enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> subreddit people discussing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah who cheated who really won the real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> world who done it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was this one comment i can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember where it was called but they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were like it was like big man connor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> cahoon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinks he's a real winner real chad huh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> calling his friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cheetahs when he cheated he was getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so angry about it and i was like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it was just so funny seeing how like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fact that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there were so many people who are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> infinitely more saltier than we are like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> we didn't give a [ __ ] it's like to us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's you know we make the video we film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it yeah yeah if someone cheats you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it makes for good content it makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for good content yeah yeah i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> originally i remember going on a cycling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> special i i think i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this this got cut out the uh video but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> remember telling connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'm gonna do the whole thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll feel good if i do the whole thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and so the fourth challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then joey suggested the cheating and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> i just thought to myself </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that'll make for a really funny segment </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if we do actually that's exactly what it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> was it's like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know saying that oh i wanted to take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a [ __ ] free car ride like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd be lying if i say i didn't want that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but ultimately i was like no no let's do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> this because it'll make for great </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> content and it did it's not it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the race it was about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> friendship it was it wasn't about it it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was about the friends we lost along the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is apparently each other very true </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> no because like i i feel like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's there's there's a difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously none of their scripted which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know it's it we don't script what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happens on the specials but we we are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know we we are we do still have that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my that voice in the back of our head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that says this is going to be content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people are going to watch this for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> entertainment </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because let's be real like you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there was a part of me that was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know i'm sure there will be some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> level of entertainment factor if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hypothetically all three of us with no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> accidents whatsoever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> completed everything from start to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> finish but you know it's the little bits </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> unexpected drama that makes for an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> interesting drama it's the banter i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like that's what makes for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interesting video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel like part of this discussion it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we laugh at it because we know we didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take it seriously but i'm glad people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are that invested in our content to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> balls deep to really like break down the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> levels of cheating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and like okay i had like i i swear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some people could make a spreadsheet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of like every little thing that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like thesis papers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the dream cheating thing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> who cheated technically there's a one in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> seven trillion chance that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> god's chain would break at that very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> moment </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> there was one comment there's like why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't gon just put the chain back on i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did think that i was like with the god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why didn't god put the chain back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this wasn't uh there's a lot of my you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know trying to fix the chain did get cut </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> out but it was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> completely lodged in there so yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like uh the three the reason you were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waiting so long for us was because i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like trying to unlodge this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then like i got it back on and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it came off again immediately and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was trying to figure out what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was wrong with my bike so i had this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like half an hour to 45 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where i realized that i had gone the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> entire cycle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> without uh without first gear so so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the reason the reason the chain came off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was because when i went went to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> um the highest it just slipped off um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah these bikes were very cheap and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i realized why i was suffering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so much now on the [ __ ] hills was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> i i was in second gear the entire way um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i also love though how like there was so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> many comments even on the video being </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh man their seats are too low their </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bikes are too small it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> look that was the biggest bikes they had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> those were the biggest bikes and i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i did adjust my seats to be the highest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so the highest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um because these people are designed for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese people by far </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because these we didn't buy the bikes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there were the rental bikes from the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> lake because we had a place to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fly to the other side of the country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah so we couldn't bring these bikes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we're definitely not suited for six foot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> foreigners that's for sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speak for yourself five foot gang over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> even but even for your size it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smaller that was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe okay for me but like i'm really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> pushing it like yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because i remember i put my seat all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> way to the top i was like oh no this is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the highest it goes i'm gonna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> okay we're pretty [ __ ] dumb right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah we're not we're not that dumb </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i saw comments that were also like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> they did they even use any gears i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd know i can't you wouldn't know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we didn't change gear because god would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not be moving up anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> else i think god could pedal at six gear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> up a hill i was already suffering enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on second gear let alone [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> some people pretend like it was the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> first time we ever saw a bicycle with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gears </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like that day it's like what what are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> these things let's just leave it alone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't realize until i saw the footage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> actually how much of a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how much of a clown i looked with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] bike </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with my massive legs just like just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pedaling along you're basically on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of those like you know the kid bikes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like young and like sitting there the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feet are going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh man that dude squats every time i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> glad people enjoyed it but man </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just it's not that serious guys it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> just it was just a little bit of i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a lot of there was a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like fluff that got cut out shout out to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mudan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for editing that and going through jesus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> how much footage </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like 100 hours between us because it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the six gopros it was like one terabyte </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of footage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we had six gopros for so two gopros </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> between each of us and then also the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> handycams and whatever and the gopro in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the camera uh the gopro and the car as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why it took so long we filmed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that in october that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the production took so long for our next </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> special we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably won't like scale up until we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have like a super super big idea maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> try something a bit smaller you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i feel like at this rate it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gonna get like bigger </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's going to turn into like a mr beast </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah if we don't scale back a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> little bit i mean because we're the ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mainly arranging this as well so we have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> to come up with all the equipment we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to figure everything out and so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's quite it's quite a lot to do it for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> us like i i kind of realized this when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh we were doing the thing and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> connor's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tire popped and every comment was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like wow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't believe they didn't plan for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a spare tire or something like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah in hindsight it sounds [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stupid doesn't it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you have to understand that most of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> our planning went into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how the [ __ ] are we going to power six </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gopros yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on our bicycles when we have one car and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> none of us near each other yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so we we were trying to figure out the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> logistics of trying to get this filmed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's where the last thing we were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> expecting was a pop-tart yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> these bikes were like extra heavy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we had like duct tape the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out of stuff to it like there was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> portable batteries </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> strapped to these like a break just to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like keep the gopro and also gopros are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fickle things they're amazing when they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> work but the moment like there's any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> heat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they just stop working yeah because we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realized this during the drifting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> special because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people look at this content and think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they they don't see the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> effort and logistics that goes into this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i didn't think about this until </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> i had to go out and film it they just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think oh just buy some cameras and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> attach it yeah so with the with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> drifting special a lot of connor's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> footage just got lost yeah so like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a shame because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the when i was doing like the sick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doughnuts like all of that footage was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> lost because the gopro just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> overheated in like five minutes 100 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> degrees yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's an oven in that thing and mine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> turned off luckily your guys has worked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mine kept dying in the second half yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it just sucked because like all you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get to see is an outside shot it doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even look like i'm in the car doing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] thing and you missed all like me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> getting [ __ ] hyped screaming </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> spoiler it was a stunt dog yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like it looks like it could look like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> stunt dog yeah it's so sad i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that's my trip </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i recently watched this horror </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movie with sydney i don't remember the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> name it's a korean horror movie right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the premise of this horror movie is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's this company who basically does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> live stream content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and so this company hires a bunch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people from the public to live stream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> going into this like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> haunted haunted asylum and you know live </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> streaming their experiences there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and so i was watching this movie and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they had this like jank set up with some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gopros that are apparently like live </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> streaming to this base camp that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a literal camp that they had set up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> outside this mental asylum right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and when i was watching this i couldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get invested in the movie because i felt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that guy doing like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> youtuber reacts to youtuber movies right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and all i could see in the back of my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> head was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they these gopros don't even have any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spare cameras [ __ ] lie there they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were like live streaming for five hours </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> or something like that two out of ten </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> not really yeah yeah there's no way that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would work also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how are they getting signal in this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> mental asylum there's no way the stream </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would be this clean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> while they were streaming places inside </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> backpacks exactly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they didn't even have the [ __ ] 5g </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> twitch backpacks like this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fake movie two out of ten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> oh my god i mean i'd like to do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> something like that but like just you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the [ __ ] effort it would take to just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> try and organize the technicalities </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> behind that just sounds like a nightmare </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> in and of itself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean to me twitch uh like irl </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> streamers are just built different i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't know i think you have to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> an another level of like masochist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i think i i to me it seems like why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> would you want to be embarrassed in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> public </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah like constantly yeah i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> mind doing it for a video every now and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then yeah but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> having it constantly on because at least </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're out there filming when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're out and about there filming at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> least you can like edit it so it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting things that happened on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day but if it's an irl stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see everything and i'm just and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're not even even in the safety </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of your own home either you're out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in public people can see you people can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> judge you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and to me that's just a level of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's the dystopian future that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i don't want in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't know yeah i've gone wrong yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was saying like not to mention like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> in japan especially where people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> way too wary about filming in public </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i i don't know how you can just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like rock up to an izakaya full of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> people and just be like yeah i'm just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gonna put this camera here and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> start talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i i i i don't know i don't i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't do that either i don't know i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't tried it but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i don't know how it i would get over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that mental barrier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just going going to around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> restaurants like having the phone in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> front of me and just talking to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> phone now i'm too british i can't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the thought of going into just a place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and doing that is like what like just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like on the street as well like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't get how like like j vloggers for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instance can like just be walking on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> streets by themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have a camera like this and being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> late all right guys so we're going to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> to blah blah blah and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have people staring at you i've done </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that it looks like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hostage video i'm like [ __ ] talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down to the camera like yeah like i i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> wouldn't go like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> some people just like yeah hello hello </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the giant selfie stick outwards this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone in ikebukuro right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> check it out like i don't know i mean to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me it's like you know and i watch some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of these irl streams except i'm quite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interested in it myself and i think yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh maybe i could do it sometime but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when i watch it i'm like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool they did like one cool thing in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the rest of it like a lot of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> time they were just being like sitting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there asking their chat like what do you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guys want to do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you just want to do what should we do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guys and it's like all right and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> anybody get what the appeal was because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> most of the time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> real life's pretty [ __ ] boring you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like traveling or waiting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah exactly i think though in this day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and age i feel it's a type of content </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that is like really small </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah maybe right now i can understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that but before that i'm like why would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to watch someone just kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sit around all day and maybe do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something interesting for one hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you're really there i i get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in covert times isn't this some kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like black mirror-esque [ __ ] that we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting on though like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i just want i don't want to have a day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> myself i'm gonna watch someone else have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm going to give them money it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> literally that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> image of you know that kid sitting in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> front of like the the poster and being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> every podcast be like that just keeps </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> getting posted on our subreddit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's really what that is cause </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like for me like i i feel awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if i have a hands-free set and i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in public </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm on the phone like sometimes i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have hands-free set and i have the phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> up to my face </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> to look like i'm talking on the phone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah as opposed to exactly supposed to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> talking to myself i don't know yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because the other day uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i had to go buy like some uh some like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> eyelashes for archie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i went to like the local was it this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one yeah no yeah the local pharmacy and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i don't know which one she wants so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i tried to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know take some pictures and send up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like yeah pick out which one it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she just [ __ ] calls me and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just show me so i had to like flip the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> camera and i'm just i'm just doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> while talking on a hands-free set and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these old women are looking at me like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] is this guy doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that they probably understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> filming eyelashes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and being like which one i don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> why i find like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only irl content is where it feels a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> little black mirrory to me a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird i don't know why like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no other type of content makes me feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in that weird kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like no other content makes you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like this is too far </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like irl just some something about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes i'm watching it i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> well because like i feel that like if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you stream in like say a studio like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like a performative side to it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's almost like a stage or like a setup </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like like there is literal sets that we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> perform in like yes yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but sitting down for like three hours at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> an izakaya while like having a casual </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> beer it's a little too realistic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well like i saw a lot of them like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of them get like drunk a lot of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time and that's like the audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loves that oh yeah they love it when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they get drunk because they're like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they could [ __ ] up they could say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff like so the audience constantly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eggs them into drinking yeah people are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like waiting for the next like stream </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and i'm like i'm like [ __ ] is that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a horrible relationship to have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your viewers where they just want to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] everything that's probably yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean i i feel like even though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though you're it's an irl stream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know when we're streaming we do have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this performative side to us that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just talked about um that we feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we want to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we want something interesting to happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or we at least want an interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation to happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i feel like it's a very i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know like unhealthy kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> relationship to have with your viewers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at that point because your your best </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is for something to happen so you are in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this performative side and i've talked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a few irl streamers who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have done things on their streams which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they probably wouldn't have done if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know nobody is watching right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you definitely get that like fake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> confidence yeah yeah stream watching you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i mean isn't that where like the whole </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> generalization of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know fan bases of ireland streamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're pretty [ __ ] toxic yeah like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i know a couple of viral streams in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan as well and you know they're all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lovely people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you know off stream yeah but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think it's because of the fact that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have this really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> toxic and you know quite aggressive type </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of audience that loves to egg them on to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make them do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stupid [ __ ] or you know fail in some way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that they kind of get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dragged into that yeah you know hate to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> say it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of them on stream turn into a bit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of an [ __ ] but that's also because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you know you have thousands sometimes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tens of thousands of people being like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> do this thing that makes you look like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> an [ __ ] for our entertainment yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's kind of unfortunate because it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a you know if you're being an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> you know but your audience is enjoying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and the egging you on you could you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can almost get lost in the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no i don't think i'm being an [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think i'm being entertaining right right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> right i think so but then you know you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> see them when you talk to them one on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> one you realize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh they're actually quite normal nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like they are nothing like this they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> really nice most of the time i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe i'm over generalizing i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i haven't met many but the ones i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> met are very different to how they act </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> on stream </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah i mean yeah i only really know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a few who are like exactly the same </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that's i feel it's a rare breed yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but i i feel i i completely agree </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with you with like irl stream content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the black mirror kind of content as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> opposed to any other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stream kind of content in my opinion and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm not sure why maybe it's because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's you it literally is like kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like a slice of life where it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it feels a bit too intimate i feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> especially when it's those irl streams </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's like it's not the camera </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pointing at the person but it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> shot in pov </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah like that [ __ ] especially it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like whoa </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just weird it's just it just makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you think like where's it gonna go from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> here like what's the next step because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna be a next step and like i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's only going to one-up itself yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why i'm like i wonder where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's going to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's just it's really interesting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> streaming my wife's pregnancy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of scary honestly i i i i could see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> screaming my child's birth </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> streaming my child's conception dad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> reacts to child birth well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like those [ __ ] oh there it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> there are those families on youtube that </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> beating a dead horse because we're just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like yeah you know we we have a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> crazy stories </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> there are still some people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> out there despite how many times we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talked about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll do some uh not pretty pretty not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool stuff yeah i mean uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so if if you haven't been following my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> twitter so yeah someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone tried to leak some monk photos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i had which were private on my mum's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> facebook and yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh i mean i i said this i said this on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my twitter longer but you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i purposely didn't release it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's i'm fine people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knowing that i was a monk and meaning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that aspect just you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meaning the knowledge or whatever but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like i i kept </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that part private because you know there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are like quite intimate photos it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> religious ceremony so i didn't i didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> want that part of my life there i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when you initially told the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> story i remember after it you were like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah boys i don't want to show a photo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm pretty sure he said it on the clip </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> did you like i'm pretty sure on the clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were like i think one of us said like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> oh we'll put the pictures and then god </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like no i don't want to put the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> pictures oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think i might have said that it's been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a while it's been a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember being like you didn't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> share the pictures we were like yeah i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just sure whatever i understand what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and you know it's become a meme i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completely fine with you know being the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monk has become a meme </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but uh yeah someone someone literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stalked my mum's facebook </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um which you know it's there's there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a difference between you know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i [ __ ] up and you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's some part of my private life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know i forgot to private you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's still an [ __ ] move but you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as a public figure you can expect that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> people are going to try and dig into </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> your past everything like that just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in and of itself yeah yeah i mean it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you know we can talk about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] that you know we kind of had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expect that but you kind of do have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expect that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just felt dirty that someone tried to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> stalk my family especially like my close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> family yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's actually [ __ ] yeah it's pretty </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> funny and like these are really old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pictures as well so they would have had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> years and years worth of like my mom's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pictures that she had so creepy to think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone's just scrolling </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> being scummy as well yeah they even like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> where you know the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the barrier of privacy between reality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what's entertainment is like slowly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slowly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drifting apart and slowly being erased </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know it feels weird finally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> experiencing that for myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and being in the crossfire yeah it sucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i i'd like to tell my parents i </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> it's sad that you have to do that right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like the thought i think it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> really sad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i would rather be harassed like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hundred times personally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than my parents be harassed once yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you know what i mean like i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> couldn't because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they've got nothing to do with it why </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> did they have to get involved right it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hard enough raising me as it was right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like let alone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> the little [ __ ] that you are the little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] that i was you know it's hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't want to have to give them extra </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> work after yeah he's trying to enjoy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> retirement you know so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's it's been kind of funny seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the transition between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like my parents at least because my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parents like really technologically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> illiterate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i've had to basically teach them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything but it's been funny seeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the transition between them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like not understanding social media at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all and just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not using it at all and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> transitioning that to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like transitioning that to most of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> family now use facebook </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right remember when facebook was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like a cool kids thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like the parents their parents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't get it my parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still didn't they still think it that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because it was really funny because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember one day um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i you know i've you know we are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all grown up on the internet and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've been doing youtube and social media </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a long time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but one day my mum phones me up um and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this this was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this was when i had stopped using </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> facebook by this point i'd like most of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my online life has gone to twitter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that's my job and everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um but my parents had just started </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really getting into facebook and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being being that being that parents who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know tag tag you in everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> comment on people's photos you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> properly involved yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i remember she phones me up one day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and she goes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh gant um someone left a mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> comment on one of my photos what do i do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm just like what do you mean mom what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you mean what do you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she's like i i don't know what to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it makes me feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sad i kind of want to reply and i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mom do not do not do this do not reply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do not get involved that's the one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you should not do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just funny because um because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like years ago she was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she's like you know just just just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ignore all the mean comments online and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't worry about it as you know as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the parents do because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as someone as as a parent watching a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> social media and do youtube that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just don't get it you see comments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these comments don't mean anything right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah but it was funny seeing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seeing my parents who had never been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into social media go through the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cycle that we had to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we had to go through being like what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what is a mean comment why are people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> commenting mean things on me this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sense you know what i'm gonna reply i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to give the trolls everything they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at least your mom wasn't like do you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> know the number to the cyber police </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i need to report a crime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no like my mom's like my mom's really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> smart about it like because she's been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> using uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you know about this website called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mixi i don't think it's any brand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anymore but basically it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's really all web it's basically like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the old japanese version of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh myspace or like facebook and stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that but i don't even think it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> around anymore basically my mom's been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like using that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so like she's had a pretty good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understanding of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know privacy can be very easily </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> leaked on the internet if you're not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> careful </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so like my mum has openly told me she's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i follow you on twitter and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> instagram but yeah you'll never know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which account is mine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] it out that's some death note [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> she's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like she's like because like she just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uses like you know a completely separate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> name and like doesn't use any photos and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff like that and i'm like yeah i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> glad that you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she understands that you know if she </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> used her real face a name that could </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lead to a whole lot of problems </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me while my dad is like you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> openly comments on my videos and being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's my son </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's my boy no no i remember i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember one time he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> did you see the comment on my latest on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your latest video and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh no i get i get thousands of comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every day and he's like oh okay i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> send you a screenshot of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like and he's like oh you might </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have missed it because i don't use my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> name on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but instead he didn't use his name on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's like a completely different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> username </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i knew immediately it was my dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the comment starts with hey son </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> hey son i really like this video the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> editing was done really well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like you'll never know it's me oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah sure that's so [ __ ] wholesome i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know why that that's so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hot yeah but the problem </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is is that like when i was still using </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> facebook back in the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like you know again like my mom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> would use a completely like separate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> name right so like you know it was fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever but my dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would not only use his real name but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> would also comment on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every [ __ ] thing i posted always </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> starting with hey son </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so like hey guys joey's dad here yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and so like and so i had to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and so like one day he came in being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like really upset at me being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why did you block me on facebook son i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like because you keep [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stop commenting oh stop stop opening a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> comment with hey son </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> your dad sounds like such a fun guy no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> he's a great guy don't get me wrong but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i had to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i had to literally block him on every </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> social media just because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he kept [ __ ] doing that and now the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the number one harasser yeah and now the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only way i can get in contact with my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is get this through email </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> because like a number or something you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> know okay like i have his number or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever but like you know obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's international it costs a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bit of money right yeah and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like hey dad you should start a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> lion account because everyone in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> has line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone in my family has a line right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah if you guys don't know that lion is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> facebook messages it's just a messaging </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> app that we use in japan a lot so i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you should start lying and he's like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't want to start on other social </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> medias and i'm like dad it's not a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> social media it's just it's just a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> messaging app and he's like all right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all right fine i'll do it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and so i added him and i messaged him </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was like three months later he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> came back being like what's up son </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so now so i just like i was like all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> right i guess i'm just sticking the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> email now with my dad if my dad ever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> needs anything i'll just be like just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> email me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's urgent i've got to email him right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now urgent hey son </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> now every one of your comments on every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> one of your videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah no i guess that's good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there because then now i'll truly won't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know which one my dad is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the comment section is all gonna be my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dad he's gonna have to try and find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> something like a new phrase to go with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like hey boy hey boy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i love you dad i'm just joshing but what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> were we talking about internet privacy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> i guess internet privacy i mean i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know like i've never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i guess this is the first wake-up call </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me that i've had to really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think about my internet privacy it took </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me way too long to make my facebook </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh my my facebook privates um that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that should have been the first stage </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think the problem with internet like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> celebrities or whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nowadays is that there's a difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> between say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's you know someone who's signed to a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> big film or someone gets picked up by a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> music label like old school celebrities </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was this system by which they got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> picked up and they knew they were going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to be famous but the problem is anyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can be famous now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anyone can have their privacy leaked and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not really think about the consequences </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of really going through their entire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] past </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and just making it private or you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making it not public because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we were we were teenagers we don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remember every [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> site that we signed up to oh my god like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i don't know how many one of my like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old forum like old anime forum profile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pictures are still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like public or whatever you know because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i signed up to a lot of slides back then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i was a teenager but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's something that you you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really think about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you don't make content on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> internet because you don't no one really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expects to be famous or no one really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expects to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> an audience or anything like that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and i feel like i i do wonder if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the newer generation is going to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think about this when whenever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they do anything or if we're just going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to continue to be stupid kids that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't really think about anything i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> would i would like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for it to be the first option if i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being honest just because like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i think that whole pre-notion of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know you you should expect your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> privacy to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know hacked and slashed yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah it's like it's like what is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about suddenly being you know quote </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unquote famous you know regardless of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how you view </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know fame to be where it's suddenly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh well you know you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have a presence on the internet that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you share openly with a large audience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so that means that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know you don't have a privacy if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's on the internet it's not private </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anymore it's literally like the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> argument as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like old-school paparazzi have you ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen any [ __ ] interviews with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any paparazzi photographer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the most they're all [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the most like you see these people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> openly being arseholes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're they're just they they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proud of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're [ __ ] proud of it like i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> i remember the last one i saw was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i think anthony's like sitting down with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a paparazzi i thought yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> literally everyone he interviewed was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just the the biggest class they are sold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know they do that whole [ __ ] of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh if i don't do it someone else is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna get it yeah it's like how about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> none of you [ __ ] do it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it sucks because like i think 99 of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people again who are watching this are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like super chill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't but like think that way there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all it takes that one percent to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your life happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like and that's unfortunate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because you know i i don't i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have any resentment to mine like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audience or anything like that i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know most of them are super [ __ ] nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly just a [ __ ] shame that some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people are just like i'm a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> ruin this man's life yeah it's a shame </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you know you have to change your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> behavior </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for literally one percent of the people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching you and you know that most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> most of everyone that you interact with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just going to be a generally nice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cool person yeah and then it just sucks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's that small percentage that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unfortunately it's it's that small </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> percentage that ruins it for everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's i guess i guess that's just the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> world in general right yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah but you know we'd be living in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the utopia if everyone was being honest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> flying cars we're not flying cars by now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's not the case right now some of us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> are still walking on the ground </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> so yeah big sad i was i was watching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this video the other day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was like um it's not blue's clues </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> blue or not blues </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trust me this is related back to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> show okay okay so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did you watch blue's clues when you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> growing up of course what's blue's clues </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> all right so blues clues this tv show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and especially this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was like talking to the camera kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like dora style </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is where it started this kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> style i maybe didn't know but i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> definitely popularized where there would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> be like a a task </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was this you know a notebook </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'd have to do x amount of tasks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it was a really good show actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was a dog called blue yeah okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and so that you the dog would help </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh steve steve steve find all the clues </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and um yeah so i always wondered i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like why did he stop doing it because if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you if you watch the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he basically swaps halfway through the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> show with another actor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought oh that's where's weird why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did that happen so it turns out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that uh he was losing his hair and that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he didn't want to like go bald on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tv right okay right right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i was like [ __ ] that hit me i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cause like i mean okay there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tons of comments about it and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's frustrating because like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really give a [ __ ] anymore like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've gotten over it but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately my dad did not give me a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lucky dice roll with my genetics and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> am going bald eventually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna happen and obviously it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been happening a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's so frustrating that people will </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like go to other videos and be like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> connor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah did you know you're balding and i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like keep pointing it out yeah it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's so frustrating because the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that bothers me is that like again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i fully accepted that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happening i know people are gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like have you tried doing this have you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tried [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> doing voodoo and it's like yes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because people are always like hey just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just try pushing the ball because people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> always like hey man just take these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> drugs do these things like yeah okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've honestly like done all that tried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all that yeah unfortunately like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't do surgery either so whatever so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i just kind of got to the point where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like all right i think i've tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough things or i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] sucks yeah but it can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really do much about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah and so i kind of got over it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's really frustrating like i said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when people go to other videos and be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like bro you're balding it's like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like like i'm i am aware but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> frustrating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that sometimes i feel like edit videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> differently because it's like all right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if i don't edit this part out people are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to comment about this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of the [ __ ] video and only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> comment about it yeah it's like it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like i just want to focus on the video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's so frustrating people feel they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> need to point it out yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like why like yeah yeah i mean i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know exactly how you feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because i too have not been luckiest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my gene pool so like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> of nice it's something that i knew was </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> and i remember um you know i've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like my entire family on my dad's side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's everyone's bold so i asked my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dad </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> he was young and he had hair down to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> here man he's bad yeah yeah he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> dripping um but yeah </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> hair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i saw what it looks like now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like so um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dada when when did you start losing your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hair just just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of curiosity so just so i can take a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> look and uh take a look at my own hair </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he goes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um i guess late 20 30 year old and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> asked this when i was 28 i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] why did you not tell me earlier for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] sakes yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yo this is like i i can't i hadn't i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a feeling like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably gonna happen to me right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like i i didn't like quite know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then i realized okay my older </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brother who's like 10 years older than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> me was going bold and i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh [ __ ] she's starting to sweat a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and like i you know what i totally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get why kids think it's funny to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mock </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hairlines because you just think like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's never gonna happen yeah yeah i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got hair my hair is [ __ ] luscious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now it's never gonna happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it does oh yeah what is it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] two out of three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> especially if you're white i think two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out of three men get like some signs of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hair loss or whatever all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but i remember like i thought okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if it happens to me at 30 no biggie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's by then i'll probably be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chilling out i'll be settling down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i was like 21 or like 20 i started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to notice just a little bit it's getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a little bit thin and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> right what's going on up there huh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> better put a timeout </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so even when i was like 20 i started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like trying to do things to like help it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> doing those like you know taking it all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] fda approved all that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for some people it is purely just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genetics yeah you just [ __ ] like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that helps and like you know you do a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of research you look into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> some guys you might be in a place where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe the building you're living in is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like really bad case of like damp or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something that's [ __ ] with your like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> your hair right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right so some people who you know their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> living conditions are the reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're losing their hair yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no unfortunately as much as i wish that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i could do something about it it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever and it's it's yeah i guess the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason why i just thought [ __ ] it i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just talk about it because it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've gotten to the point now right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> people are pointing out anyway </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's it's like it's not going to stop </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i feel like if we just say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> something yeah facebook can at least be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> especially with a growing audience right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like new york are going to come into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> being like oh this is the inside meme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll add on to it for the millionth time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because you know it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> unfortunately it's just kind of a thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's just something that i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't really do anything about and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately people are going to see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know because i'm not like i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> unfortunately not gonna you're not gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wear a hat every day yeah my videos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't just me statically in front of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the camera never moving my head so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like how do you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't go anything further than like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a 90 degree angle otherwise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a red zone yeah yeah and it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like so when i dyed my hair </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> blonde it wasn't that bad because my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> scalp is like white </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah so it didn't look that bad but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it's when it starts to go brown and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> certain lighting like especially studio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> lighting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] reflects that [ __ ] yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where it doesn't look too bad if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look at me like normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like video where the lighting is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> washed out it looks [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> awful yeah right and it's like when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see it on video i'm like [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that bad i check it i'm like oh it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too bad like that's what happened yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm pretty much at peace with it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll probably shave it at some point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i kind of want to see how it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i reckon you're good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like you have you have you lucked out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> though in that regards because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the one thing no no like the one thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like you know like the fact that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've already accepted that you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably going to go bored and like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably already know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever but at least the good thing is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that you can grow a beard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah there is nothing weirder than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> a dude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> who is bald and has a clean face why are </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_07> industry yeah sure and you know and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know yeah i can't say that in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> front of johnny sims right because he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably smacked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> particularly across my face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like you know at least like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a beard on a bald guy </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> you know you you said like you know i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jealous of you joy but like i actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had the opposite because like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> what a problem guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because my because like your entire </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dad's side right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> dude they're like i think my dad was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> born like [ __ ] 20 yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> see my mom's side is exactly the same </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> because my granddad went bold at like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 24. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so for the longest time in my like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> early 20s </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my mom and my sister would just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> egg me on being like when are you gonna </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> the head of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> all the hairline's receding a bit yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and like i would like i remember when i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was like 18 i like asked my granddad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> being like how old were you when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like started to go to the ball and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 23 and i was like that's like five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] but you know obviously i at that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look if i go bald [ __ ] it i'll just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> accept it you know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i'd rather just like shave it all off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> then like leave it half fast right so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the more i thought about it and um the </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> surgery even i wanted to because i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my like a blood condition yeah yeah the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more i thought about i was like do i </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> desperately cling on to this like at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> end of the day i was like i don't really </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_07> i think i need my hair to function yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i think i'll still be fine without </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right that's the thing right like i </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_04> i i feel like it's especially hard as an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> asian as well </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> because because like at least you're not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> pretending at that point yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like the fact that they're like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> saw a bunch of people who like like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> especially like older like women </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> who you know always believe in that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason who would like wear that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well i don't have to wear a mask anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'm fully protected with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this you know i mean it's the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> reason [ __ ] anti-vaxxers and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like exists right because this kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have if we have a small small enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> group who traded not trade information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> within that group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um then they're just going to start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> believing the wilder [ __ ] sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and you know it's a lot of like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> image globally is that a lot of people a </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> all over it's it's all over it's all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> over the world like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's definitely it is all over the place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just stupidity's not confined by </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> one type of like nationality just the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> big difference is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it seems in america it's just more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> documented and it's more widespread yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's unfortunate because like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean like you said like the stupid i do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> agree they are stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's been like proven right if you </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> believe in it more yeah yeah you're like </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> people weren't even this obsessed during </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> world war two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we had more pass through world war ii </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than we do now what the [ __ ] going on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i guess the problem is that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's telling each other you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> panic like in real time right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spread it yeah it's like oh my god i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know i had a bunch of cup ramen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like i'm pretty i think i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'll see what happens like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty sure the stores aren't just gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shut </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i i like there would be an exact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where i would like start panicking and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that exact point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> is if i found out the kombini was closed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like i i feel like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> here if the combination closes you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going through some real [ __ ] that is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when i'm truly watching </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay how are we really going through an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> apocalypse okay i wake now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm [ __ ] yeah it's like america </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like waffle house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and like you can judge on like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> disaster based on whether waffle house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is open or closed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like it's an actual like study like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where like even when there's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hurricanes yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waffle house in america is still open </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seriously yeah seriously look it up it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really interesting like i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know which big natural disaster it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was i think it was a katrina or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was still open like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because they're all equipped with like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> generators right why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in case disasters yeah they're like one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of the only things that like will try </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> their best to stay open unless like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the disaster is so bad yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> when waffle house in america like damn </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my roof just got blown off </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i could kill for some waffles right now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> if like windows and [ __ ] are broken i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> think they'll still continue to be open </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like they'll let you in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like i i i'm not i'm not sure exactly i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> could be chatting out my ass but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's as far as i'm concerned anyways </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what this entire situation has made me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realize is i i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh before before 2020 watching like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> old school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zombie movies and something like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you think to yourself man they made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the they made the people really stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zombie movie this would never happen in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> real life and now i look back and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like definitely gonna happen i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they didn't make them stupid enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> jesus christ </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there'll be a sect of people that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rounds up people and feeds them to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> zombies because if they think it'll </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably appease the zombie or something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> there'll be some [ __ ] like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there'll be something like that i look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at something like dead rising and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like well this is unrealistic there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> still things inside all of the stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the toilet paper is still a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there isn't a subgroup of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> praising the zombies what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i i am curious what every like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zombie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> story and like every like every kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like apocalyptic story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like would like how if 2020 would have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> changed like how cliches and trolls are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just going to get a million </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] boring movies about this current </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pandemic and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know can you make an exciting movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> about the pandemic i don't care i mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they tried to do it with 2012 right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> they made one like in 2006 or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that oh it was pandemic right that was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little pandemic there's like a few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movies that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are like worryingly close to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> what happened yeah that was the there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was the one that i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that went viral i think i saw it last </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> year um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like crazy yeah yeah like in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> movie there was like a pandemic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was like completely obviously named </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> something completely differently years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh and i think it got viral because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> found it on netflix and started watching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it and the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dead asked the plot is that there was a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> virus that was started </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in china through that really yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and people were like yeah some chef had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it and he shook hands with a business </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> woman yeah and then and then it spread </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to america and then like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> half of americans [ __ ] mad i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and people are like oh my god this is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> almost scarily similar to what's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> actually happening right so probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smarter because people probably acted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much a lot smarter in that movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know no no no no no well then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but in that movie as well they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> just like instantly die </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah for some reason matt damon and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> his kid i think were immune you were the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ones that were immune because of course </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> matt damon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm pretty sure if that happened matt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damon and tom cruise be [ __ ] immune </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to him yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> matt damon i think matt in the movie </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> matt damon was like i quarantined for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> two weeks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> never mind i'm immune now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he leaned like that i stayed inside of a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> room for two weeks and then the doctor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> guess you're immune now it's a pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> good movie have you watched it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've just seen clips of it yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty good it's pretty fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching it now being like yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] weird it must be weird watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it during the pandemic and seeing being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is uh this is uncomfortably close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to what's happening now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just makes you realize like how lucky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got that it could have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way worse like you could have just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> immediately killed people yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i think you know we we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously gone through a really harsh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> period right now but i feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> humanity really just got like we got the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> best warnings yeah yeah this was this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was the best warning sign that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we could have gotten and i say this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously knowing that you know it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a [ __ ] tragedy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how many people have died but the the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> scary thing is that it could have been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so much [ __ ] worse yeah than it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this was this was kind of like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worst case scenario for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how easily transmittable this virus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> could have been but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in terms of like in terms of like its </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actual effect it could have been a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> worse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i say this with the [ __ ] awful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> results we've gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> so far i mean it's just it's just scary </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to think that you know if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> this had happened you know 50 100 years </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> prior yeah like how much probably much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> much much worse it could have been you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's weird because i i've been thinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about this a lot because it's uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's been like a full year now since </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since i remember thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh this is gonna this is gonna last a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> few months this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> there's this quarantine thing right this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> is a this is a little this is this is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> fun day everyone came together it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we'll bunk up for like two months and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then you know we'll be able to go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> outside and enjoy the summer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember the joke was like oh anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> nerds haha i found </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i was born for this yeah and then i kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of you realize pretty soon that there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> a big difference between choosing to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> stay home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and being forced to stay home there's i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know what it is but there's a big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i saw a tweet that was like man are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people gonna judge people who have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tough time readapting to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> social situations right i was like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> what do you mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what do you mean re-adapting like people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> who have been uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like in live in their house for too long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> alone yeah they were like i hope we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> don't get judged what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what they're suddenly gonna go outside </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being like how do i interact with humans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought it was a little odd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't you see [ __ ] like that on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> twitter and it was just read something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like it they they made it out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like it was way more serious and like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big issue than it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like bro it's literally talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> to people what are you what are you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> doing how is this not second nature to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> just don't worry about it just go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to being we'll just go back to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> situation people will choose to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> inside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> taking a flight guard going on a plane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know if you loved being inside </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> before the pandemic you're probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still going to be inside after the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pandemic let's be real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> no it's like the police aren't going to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come and be like all right you've been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in this room for too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> long all right get the [ __ ] out get the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] out you got it you gotta </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you think there are going to be any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> big changes once this pandemic's over or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're just going to be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ah that was a funny thing that happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> last year right i mean like in terms of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like you know because we're already such </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> a yeah do you think japan is never going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to stop wearing masks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now no like because before you know it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was still a socially accepted norm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> for people to wear masks but not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone wore masks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and now i feel like now it's going to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so deeply ingrained in the culture that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 90 to 80 percent of people are just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna be permanently wearing masks oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah of course </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i mean you know like people already wear </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> masks here like you know during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially this time of year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know flu season yeah people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have hay fever because you know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of stuff and then you know you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the influenza season in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> november where people are getting sick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the [ __ ] time yeah everyone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> wearing a mask and it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is your face a little bit cold wear a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> mask you know do you know what i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hoping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i think it's going to happen and i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happy for it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> people are going to take care of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> hygiene during conventions that's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know but you're asking them yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's a tall order </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i i am hopeful that a global pandemic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> will make nerds care more about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> hygiene during a big social gathering </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> am i am i being too hopeful for this am </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> i being grateful for this i feel you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know what i feel if anything it's going </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> to be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> listen we're all not going to get each </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> other sick now we've we've all gotten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the shot yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and and i've been and i've been forced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to use hand sanitizer and bathe and wash </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my hands for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> far too long i am going to go on a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> bathing strike </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i'd like to just see the like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the alcohol stay in front of like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> especially at conventions where you are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shaking hands with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so many [ __ ] people and you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know maybe wearing more masks in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convention that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not exactly a bad thing because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> con flu is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an accepted part that is an accepted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> part of every convention you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you go to right well it's more like see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> here's the one thing i've never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> understood about conflict right like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right whenever you catch a cold </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right it's usually from someone yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who's the [ __ ] who's going to a con </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with a cold i mean there's loads of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people because i mean i get it right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if you if they booked it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you've you've already taken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them off work you've already paid money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've booked your hotel yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> they'll get a cough </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the least you can do is like try and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> stay as hygienic as possible right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is what you're talking about i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> can we can we change this please like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's what i'm saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm i'm hoping that i go to the next </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> convention or maybe like not just the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> next one because obviously the next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> one's gonna be affected yeah but maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> in like three years time we still got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same etiquette of you know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you know maybe wearing masks isn't such </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a bad thing we're a master use hand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sanitizer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or people having hand sanitizers just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like easily readily available like if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh [ __ ] does anyone have any hand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> sanitizer and like three people around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> me just be like yeah bro i got your back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i think that's the positive change maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know maybe the smell can change but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's just hopeful thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that that is hopeful can we make those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ones that like [ __ ] wet your hand to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oblivion illegal you know the ones when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get it and it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a oil has been dropped on your head that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] should be illegal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's like way too sticky but it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like sticky it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like feels like it's been hydrated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like one thousand percent like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weird why do they keep buying this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> stop making that that's the potent [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is it really though i i i like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feeling of that one because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your hands feel clean because it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the man puts his hand in a tangle one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> time and now he wants to like have his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> groove all over him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because like sometimes you get like you </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> please please sanitize your hands and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they give you like this they spray like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the tiny spray on and you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> meant to like make this tiny spray last </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like like cover your entire </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> absorbs into your palm before you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stretch it out i'm just like you you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know that picture where it's like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> door that's being held by the cheeto and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the swat team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> breaking down the door that's what it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels like when they put like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> piddly little spray on and you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i can see this does nothing but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just doing it because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> regulation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like i don't want my hand been feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i've just dunked it in like a vat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of oil </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like that's what it feels like sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like the feeling of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's one it covers your hands and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> two you can feel it evaporate so you get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> little tingly cooling sensation i rather </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> than go overboard with the hand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sanitizer than on the board like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel i feel like it's clean otherwise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's it is [ __ ] it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i know there is my hands are the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cleanest it is sanitized that's that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the point of hand sanitizing it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> sanitizes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that point zero one percent of germs is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> clinging on for dear life on my hands </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> right now like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i just prefer to use like soap i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know i like the food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> all right spray a little bit on and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to go toilet and clean my hands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what takes so much more effort yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i like that is the least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> optimized thing yeah coming from a man </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> who optimizes everything in his list </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurants aren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inherently an unoptimized experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's so much waiting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> image imagine the queue to the toilet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah if that if that was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> norm not everyone could be large brained </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like myself you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> shut up just shut up all you have to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is buy this gel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it sanitizes your hands more feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it strips your skin i don't know why </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're not even well that's just your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> weak ass epidermis apparently it is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is my weak ass epidemic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because sometimes i love it when i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel my bone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because some people have just know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> some people some people just have like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> know he maybe did like three or four so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait where could you watch this was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> on twitter </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's on the pokemon it's on the official </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pokemon youtube channel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like if you look up post malone pokemon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> concert it'll come up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just yeah i just don't want to be in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my room attending another this is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just sad there's just something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> about the energy of having a crowd there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's just that that you need that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> energy i mean it's something that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> can't because nothing's sadder than a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> virtual mosh pit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah oh god that sounds so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> depressing yeah oh my god i'm playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> what's the virtual mosh pit it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> twitch chat going insane right that's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> virtual mosh pins like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> not quite the same i love twitch chat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and i i love interacting and i love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> streaming but there's something about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> when it was supposed to be live </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like in person when it goes to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch it feels weird or yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it feels weird i don't really know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like conventions i just think are an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> experience you inherently just cannot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean you go to convention for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people for the atmosphere otherwise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone would be [ __ ] going on their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> discord service and talking about anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> being cringy exactly you go to be cringy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and personal yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> meet other cringy people it's like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whole reason why you go to like concerts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's of course to see whoever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you're seeing live but it's also to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> see it with people yeah there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something different about seeing you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing a bland live as opposed with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> other people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as opposed to seeing it you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> listening to the album or seeing music </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like that there's just there's just an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> energy you can't capture if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching it through a screen exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and i mean that's that's why i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> why people have to do virtual events and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everything but i'm kind of i'm kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i just want to attend i [ __ ] miss </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> concerts i miss crowds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and i never thought i would miss </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> crowds because like hey i hate crowds i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hate crowds so much but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like even like it's not just even being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there in a crowd but just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> seeing an event and just hearing that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> crowd scream </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's just something special there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just something that brings that hype to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i get that i get that like um the most </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> recent like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most recent event i can think of is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh league of legends worlds right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally i'm like super super hyped for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worlds because as you would be for any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other sporting event </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was just something about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing this gameplay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that just didn't have the crowd raw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> behind it that just made it feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you were just watching a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tyler1 stream or something like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like you're watching an online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> tournament yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i remember the players they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> saying as well they were like yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> not the same without a crowd yeah of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> course when you get a win </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when the crowd's that uh you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> know like when someone makes a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and you hear that roar there's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> something special about that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though i'm not there in person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i've i've been to you know i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been there in person and the energy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] incredible um but even just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> capturing a bit of that energy and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> putting it like just hearing that crowd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> scream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's it's something that can't be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> replicated and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i know um and i i think it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> china </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that tried adding like that that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tried the cans laughter effect where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they they they added </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> fake crowds effects yeah yeah yeah to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the league of legends yeah yeah i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about this this stuff like someone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably gonna fact check and call me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> out on this but i think i heard that and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just sounds i wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that just sounds even worse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah if they did that just like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> friends [ __ ] like soundtrack started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> playing like the science old bass just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> comes in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because like i remember like uh you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know because february just passed and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i love watching like the sumo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and the sumo season is like during </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the winter yeah so just finished but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like of course because it's a pandemic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't have people in this tiny you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know stadium </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> watching the summer so like yeah it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really sad to see this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> massive sumo stadium only having maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like four people in it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like and you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously after every win right usually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the crowd you know like claps or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cheers or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but instead it's like someone does this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like epic win yeah and like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> three people are clapping it just sounds </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a cow [ __ ] it just feels like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> there's zero stakes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you can't if you can't hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> anything it's not hype at all yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that's really interesting cause the sumo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they were like all wearing mash before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they got on stage yeah they take it off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just funny seeing them like all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right we have these precautions they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> take their masks off they step up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] put their faces together i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah i don't know i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> about this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> there's not so much point i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> how socially distant sumoing is but i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it is funny how crowds can play into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sporting event hype because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i've been recommended a lot of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> since we did the chess tournament i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like been recommended way more chess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> clips and been watching like share </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> streamers like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hikaru and everything like that and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's just something about the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> image i had about chess before that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> boring </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i feel a big part of that was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how bored everyone looks in any big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chess crowd right it's it's like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like people playing a chess tournament </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> during a coughing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coughing event yeah and and what i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what i've realized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like one thing i've realized about how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we could like how the the image could be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> easily changed was i was recommending </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this other events </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like clips of this other event where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just a bunch of grand masters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um who went who are just like chewing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh shooting [ __ ] and having fun and they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were like having team tournaments and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like trash talking each other and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like dude this seems like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> legit fun event and this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this could have easily changed the image </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of chess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which i think it's it's great now that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the image of chess is being like slowly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i know not everyone will agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with you going down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean that's that's my opinion as a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> filthy casual chess player </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gm tweeted out being like man it's such </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a shame that chess is going in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> direction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and then everyone's just like in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a not serious direction yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah because you know chess has a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> history behind it and there's a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people who are like it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know it's it's big brain it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> intelligent and it's being watered down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for these common folk you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yes i mean you you are like an ex you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know you you've played chess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean for your country how do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel about it i mean you can it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> really seem like you had that like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> purest view on it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no because like i hated it because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i was doing it it was a bunch of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know 60 year old white men who would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just be in charge of everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they talked about it like you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the [ __ ] night's god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah culture like yeah because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's taken very seriously in the uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the history behind it is like very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long and you know what not but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i don't give a [ __ ] i mean you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if if the sports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you know wants to have more funding and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> be more popular i think it's good thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people get into chess i mean yeah it's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> good game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i think that it's you know one of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably the better better games your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> kid can get into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah um i mean it's gonna evolve </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> together with the times right and pure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> behind you know i mean you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately chess is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably on its own a bit boring yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's be honest right like i play it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i you know say that but i think you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adding these tournaments that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really take away anything from the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pro scene you know if it gets you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you look at chess viewership on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> twitch you know outside of like pog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> champs and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the big chess streamers viewership has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> grown a lot i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how many street how many viewers does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hikaru get now it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 25k yeah and it's it's [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because before you literally could not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> make money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> play like players there's so many big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chat streamers now yeah and it's really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> epic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know epic one it's really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting that's coming up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's pretty epic seeing uh that like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> know there's room for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like many chess streamers to make a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> living off this and stream it and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean it makes sense right like i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it it's really taught me how important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> images </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah in regards to like a sport and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like that because yes you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's you know you got to respect the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> legacy and history and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but you get to a point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's modernized yeah it needs to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> modernize they need to catch up with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times and i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's great because i've gotten way more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into chess simply because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it just it just looks funner yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> know it looks way more fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i mean there's like like stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone thinks that sports like rules </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't change yeah like rules are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sacred but like stuff like basketball </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm pretty sure the nba changes the rule </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> have changed the rules a few times based </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on what makes a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more fun viewing experience yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it begs to question is like what's more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> important the sport or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the audience yeah and so i think chess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is out there for crossroads where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there's obviously people who have been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> training their whole life to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know pros and whatnot yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously it sucks that maybe your sport </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is a little less serious </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but on the other hand you have way more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> opportunities way more money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know way more chance to have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> platform and do whatever you want and if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be on the sidelines being salty about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're probably going to be the one left </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> behind yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's a balance at the end of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> day right yeah you can't go too far in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> either direction </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i feel that like i remember when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> hikari got signed up for tsm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was just like holy [ __ ] that's pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cool this this is a pogba </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that is a part right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like like just just like imagine imagine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if we had a chess tournament where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people showed up in like esports gowns </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] esports shirts and stuff like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that that would be pretty hype in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> opinion but obviously i'm a filthy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> casual </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't play i don't play chess out of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything but just casually so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just my opinion i totally forgot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i played in chatham like last week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i totally forgot i did that oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it was fine i mean i had like one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> hour sleep so it's pretty brutal and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like i had to go somewhere i mean you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say that but you're like knowing your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> schedule i kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like kind of you were you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> addicted to apex back then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah you kind of did it to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself yeah you kind of did it you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know i did i just you know you just say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yes to something and you're like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't really think about like how it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> will like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually fit into your schedule it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sounds cool until it happens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so i got invited to twitch rivals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was like they wanted to do like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chess tournament where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get paired with like a gm or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> something and they tell you which piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to move </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you have to choose which of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> piece if they say pawn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you choose which of the eight pawns to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> move right and so it's pretty fun i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i haven't played chess in a like since </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> our tournament yeah so i was pretty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rusty and obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not having much sleep and so yeah but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was good fun i like doing it it's fun i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like playing chess but it's really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> annoying how like there's some comments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> as well that like bro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> conor wasn't kind of didn't play like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when he was a kid that's a lie he's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] now and i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> bro if you didn't play for like seven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> years and you played now i bet you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably wouldn't ever heard about you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ever heard of a gap </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah and also i think i'm probably </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> level or probably better as a child than </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i am now yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah which could be weird to say i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah i mean i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the same logic it's like oh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learned the quadratic equation during </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> masters talk of engineering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm sure if i applied for an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> engineering job i'm more qualified than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone who is like hasn't got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> degree but might be studying that thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah who probably knows more than me at </SPEAKER_03>
