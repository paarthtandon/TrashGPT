<connor> - At a C.K. Louis special instead for two hours, </connor>
<garnt> learn about the world with some high quality comedy </garnt>
<garnt> and then five years later you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Big PP Nation what's up?" (men laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. - Uncultured. </joey>
<joey> Uncultured, clearly. I'm kidding. </joey>
<joey> I'm the biggest offender of it, I'm there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah dude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you are. - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> if anyone is Big PP Nation, it's you. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - How I think I am like the Winnie the Pooh meme, </connor>
<connor> you know the one with the, how I actually am, </connor>
<connor> you know? (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Oh my gosh, so what are we talking about today guys? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I mean we can talk about anything. </connor>
<joey> I thought I would tell a story to begin with. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - I was in my Japanese class this- </connor>
<connor> - Story time with Connor? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Story time it's (laughs). </garnt>
<garnt> - It's story time with Connor. (Joey humming) </garnt>
<connor> - Right so, I was in my Japanese class, as I do, </connor>
<connor> learn Japanese, not very successfully as always, </connor>
<connor> but you know, I turn up, - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, I'm helping. - Yeah, you're there, </connor>
<connor> you're there. - I'm helping,. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - I'm helping. </connor>
<connor> And I was, in the break time, </connor>
<connor> we get like a five minute break. </connor>
<connor> Don't know why, it's only two hours. </connor>
<connor> I don't really feel like you need a break </connor>
<connor> for two hours and you know, whatever, anyway. </connor>
<connor> So we get a break, and we're chilling </connor>
<connor> in like the lounge area, it's like that kinda hip- </connor>
<connor> - A lounge area? </connor>
<connor> - They have like a kind of, </connor>
<connor> it's like this like fake, hip college kind of area. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Yeah, sit where you want man," </connor>
<connor> like everything's a chair. - Oh! </connor>
<connor> Oh. - It's like, and so, </connor>
<connor> I was just sitting and then, </connor>
<connor> I was talking with my teacher and then, </connor>
<joey> a guy, right next to me, like here, is like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, do I know you? </joey>
<joey> Do, do I know?" (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> And I'm like- </joey>
<joey> - That's always the worst. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, "No." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I don't know." </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "You're a YouTuber right?" </joey>
<joey> I have my mask on, bear in mind, as well. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I guess that's me." </connor>
<connor> And I just stared at him, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> I was so caught off guard, I didn't know what to say. </connor>
<connor> So I was just, (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was just like, I looked just dead in the, </connor>
<connor> like the Mike Wazowski meme, again, </connor>
<connor> I love that meme. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I just looked at him like, "Yeah, I guess. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah I am." (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Just stared at him. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like, "Oh no, that was pretty, </connor>
<connor> "he probably thinks I'm an ass-hole now." </connor>
<connor> So if you're watching this, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> I just stared at you blankly, (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> when you recognized me. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, wait, so he came up to you and was like, </joey>
<joey> "You're the YouTuber right?" </joey>
<joey> And you said, "Yeah." </joey>
<joey> And then he just didn't say anything or? </joey>
<connor> - He was like, "Oh yeah, I think I've seen your stuff." </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh, thanks." </garnt>
<garnt> - I love it when you like get recognized and they come over. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, "Hey, you're that guy right?" </garnt>
<connor> And then you say, "Yeah." </connor>
<connor> And then, you kind of see the realization on their face, </connor>
<connor> that they didn't plan the conversation out </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> any point after they said that. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just 'cause I didn't expect it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like in my Japanese class in like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, in Japan. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's a lot of foreigners there, admittedly, </joey>
<joey> but it's only like, a lot of older people than me. </joey>
<connor> So I just didn't just expect it to- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, what is up with some people who are just like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, he's a YouTuber." </connor>
<connor> He'll leave the conversation on right afterwards. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't mind, I felt bad, 'cause </joey>
<connor> I felt like I should have been like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh man, how're you doing or something?" </connor>
<garnt> - Because, because. (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I was just like, "Yeah." </connor>
<garnt> - Because when you get recognized, </garnt>
<garnt> not at an Anime Convention, right, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I feel like when you get recognized </connor>
<connor> in an Anime Convention, </connor>
<connor> - You're prepared for it. - You're like in the zone, </connor>
<connor> you're like, okay, I'm expecting this. </connor>
<connor> I like know how to handle this, </connor>
<connor> but when it's just out on the streets, IRL- </connor>
<connor> - Just like not near a convention. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - In my daily life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just in your daily life, </connor>
<garnt> you just get blindsided. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I've had. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you get caught during like your off period, </garnt>
<garnt> right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Because like at a con, you're always on your on period, </connor>
<connor> where you're like, "All right, there's people around me, </connor>
<joey> people looking for me." - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, not like, not to be like egotistical, </connor>
<joey> but at a con you know there's gonna be some people like, </joey>
<connor> it's an anime convention. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know people are gonna know you, </connor>
<joey> so you're like ready for it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, you know, when I'm just at my school or on the gym, </joey>
<joey> it's like the the last thing that's in my head </joey>
<joey> is that I'm a YouTuber, right? </joey>
<connor> I'm just thinking like, wish I could get my fucking day </connor>
<connor> over with, right? (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - That was like the time where I got recognized by, </joey>
<joey> it was the first time I was ever recognized by, </joey>
<connor> like a straight up Japanese person, like, </connor>
<connor> can't speak a word of English </connor>
<connor> Japanese person. - Oh whoa! </connor>
<connor> - And it was a fucking salary man, </connor>
<connor> in like, his mid-40's. (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> And, when he like tapped me on the shoulder </connor>
<garnt> and I turn around, there was this just this mid-40's like, </garnt>
<garnt> like borderline ugly bastard looking fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh that poor guy. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I'm serious, it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> borderline ugly bastard looking guy. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, "Oh no, I'm in danger." (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Turbo past the x-ray. - I'm gonna need a (laughs). </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like I'm in danger and then, </connor>
<connor> in Japanese he was like, "Oh, you're the YouTuber </connor>
<connor> who collabed with Kizuna Ai, right?" </connor>
<connor> And immediately, - That's how he knows you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, immediately I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Ah, you're a Kuzuna Ai fan, </garnt>
<garnt> of course you are." - Yeah, of course </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course you are. (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<connor> You look like a VTuber fan. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And so I said like- </connor>
<connor> - You're just offending all the Vtubers </connor>
<garnt> right now. - Yeah, whoa, </garnt>
<garnt> call me out like that Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, you look like a Japanese VTuber fan. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I did." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I think it was, like maybe one or two weeks </garnt>
<garnt> after I did my first collab with Kizuna Ai? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - And that was like </garnt>
<connor> a really big thing for me where I got a lot of Japanese eyes </connor>
<connor> on me because before that, - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, because I don't really speak in Japanese </connor>
<connor> on my channel right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Japanese people aren't subscribed to my shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But when I was </connor>
<connor> on Kizuna Ai's channel, 'cause I spoke Japanese, </connor>
<connor> I got a lot of like Japanese people, </connor>
<connor> who, you know, came to my channel, obviously, </connor>
<connor> and the salary man was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, after I saw your collab with Kizuna Ai," </connor>
<connor> oh, sorry, no, he said, (speaks Japanese). </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Oh yeah, you're definitely a fan." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> "So after I saw your collab with AI-chan, </connor>
<connor> I subscribed to your channel." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, do you understand? </connor>
<connor> Like can you speak English?" - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he's like, "No, but I watch </connor>
<connor> your videos to learn English." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Hmm." </connor>
<connor> Just in the back of my head I was like, </connor>
<garnt> going through my entire. - All the terrible, </garnt>
<garnt> stuff. - All the terrible things. </garnt>
<garnt> - All of the terrible shit, I'm just like, </garnt>
<connor> "I'm pretty sure I say cunt like every three words </connor>
<connor> in my videos." (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I don't." - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so, jokingly, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, I mean my videos aren't the best </connor>
<connor> to learn English with." </connor>
<connor> And in a straight face he's like, </connor>
<garnt> "No, actually I've learned a lot, from your videos." </garnt>
<connor> I've learned. - Oh no. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like, "No, no, no" </connor>
<connor> - [All] No, no, no." (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, that was scary though. </connor>
<joey> Have you ever been recognized by a Japanese person? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've been recognized once, </garnt>
<joey> by a Japanese person in Japan. - Oh really? </joey>
<connor> - It was like the most random place 'cause I think, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember what date it was, but I think </connor>
<connor> I was like on a date with Sydney, </connor>
<connor> somewhere in Japan and we went </connor>
<connor> to this like random Italian restaurant, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It was like a, </connor>
<joey> local run Italian restaurant, but it was like run </joey>
<joey> by a Japanese person. - Mmmh. </joey>
<joey> - And we come in, and for some reason the Japanese person </joey>
<joey> was just like, the guy waitering us was just </joey>
<joey> like super, super nice. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And we thought he was just like, </joey>
<joey> this overenthusiastic Japanese person </joey>
<joey> who was like. - Yeah, it happens. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah he was just like trying to speak English to us </connor>
<connor> and everything, and we're like, </connor>
<connor> "Aw man, this is a really nice restaurant. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if they're just nice to everyone here." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then we get the bill, </joey>
<joey> and he puts on like this massive discounts on it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And we're like, "There must be a mistake. </joey>
<joey> We got like the wrong bill or something." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So we go up to the, </joey>
<joey> so we go up to the guy, trying to speak our broken Japanese, </joey>
<connor> just to say like, this is wrong. </connor>
<connor> This is the wrong price. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he goes like, </connor>
<connor> he also communicates in broken English </connor>
<connor> and Japanese being like, "Oh no, I just wanted </connor>
<connor> "to say thank you for everything you've done. </connor>
<connor> You have, like, I watched your videos to help, </connor>
<connor> again learn English." (laughs) - Learn English. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, "Man, why are our videos </connor>
<garnt> being used as a resource to learn English?" </garnt>
<joey> - There are so many good videos out there </joey>
<garnt> where you can actually learn English. </garnt>
<joey> Why, don't use any YouTube videos to learn English. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - It's never a good idea. </garnt>
<garnt> - Although I dunno, like I feel like whenever I, </garnt>
<connor> if I ever get to meet a VTuber and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, thank you for helping me learn </connor>
<connor> Japanese." (laughs) (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm wondering if they're gonna have the same kind </connor>
<connor> of reaction on the other side. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, who's this guy, what? </connor>
<garnt> I'm gonna talk shit about him on the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like the, that's like the, </garnt>
<connor> that cashier, at the Family Mart near our house, </connor>
<connor> who's like a fan of my videos. </connor>
<connor> And every now and then - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like if when I go to the Family Mart near my house, </connor>
<connor> late at night, and he's working there late at night, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - He's sometimes just like, </connor>
<connor> yo, come here and he like leads me </connor>
<connor> to the cash register and he's like, </connor>
<connor> "See all this chicken in here, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna throw it out." - Yeah, they give you it, </connor>
<connor> they give you it. - "Do you just want some?" </connor>
<joey> And he just gives me the free fucking Family Mart chicken </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "mmmh, yeah, sure why not?" </joey>
<joey> This is probably gonna kill me, but it's all right. </joey>
<joey> I'll take some free chicken, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Shout out to you by the way, - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Whatever your name is, I don't know what your name is. </joey>
<garnt> - I actually got recognized last week as well </garnt>
<connor> in the last week. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - It's a bit. - God cam con. </connor>
<connor> Go on, calm down man. - It's a bit, </connor>
<connor> it's a bit of an awkward story though. </connor>
<connor> - Go on. - And what's awkward about it, </connor>
<connor> is the guy mentions that he watches Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> every week so- </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I'm about to tell the story and, </connor>
<garnt> hello guy who's probably watching this. </garnt>
<joey> - He's probably shitting his pants right now. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) He's like, that's me. </garnt>
<joey> - Because, okay, because it was a bit </joey>
<connor> of an awkward experience, I'm not gonna lie. </connor>
<connor> Not like (chuckles). (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> And the thing is, I'm probably gonna see </connor>
<connor> this guy again in the future because. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Okay so, where I met this guy was </connor>
<connor> at an anime bar in Akihabara. </connor>
<connor> So I went to this anime bar in Akihabara </connor>
<connor> and it was a really, really cool bar, </connor>
<connor> but it was like kind of small. </connor>
<joey> - Right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember the name of it. </joey>
<joey> I think Meilyne was the one who told me about it. </joey>
<joey> But I remember that, </joey>
<joey> I went in there, and immediately, one guy recognizes me. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't see that, Meilyne saw that. </joey>
<joey> - Japanese guy or Western guy? </joey>
<joey> - We thought he was Japanese, </joey>
<joey> but he was like Californian. - California, okay yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like you know when you get recognized </joey>
<joey> and it's just like that look. - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Where it's just like. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's like the triple-take, right, </connor>
<garnt> It's like. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I haven't had one that aggressive, </garnt>
<garnt> can you guys explain? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, but like, you know like when you're </garnt>
<connor> at an Anime Convention, and you're just like that, </connor>
<connor> and they're like, debating about whether </connor>
<connor> they should say hello for like the next five minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - I see you, just come. </connor>
<connor> - And like if that ever happens, </connor>
<garnt> if that ever happens, just please, just come. </garnt>
<garnt> Come, come. (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - No! - Come now! </connor>
<connor> - I'm so sorry that we always reference that. </connor>
<connor> It's just, (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> you can't stop fucking laughing at that shit. </connor>
<garnt> Anyway, go on. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, so we're sitting at the bar </garnt>
<garnt> and the waiter comes up to us and goes, </garnt>
<connor> "Yeah, do you mind if that guy says hello to you? </connor>
<connor> Apparently he knows you from some way." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "yeah, sure." - The waiter did this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the waiter did this. - Oh wow, </connor>
<connor> like fucking romance thing? </connor>
<connor> Like did he? (man laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, so I think he asked the waiter. </connor>
<connor> And so he comes says hello and we have a nice friendly chat. </connor>
<connor> You know, he was a friendly, he seemed like a friendly guy. </connor>
<connor> But, you know, it wasn't anything more than that. </connor>
<connor> It was just like, oh, you know, what are you doing here? </connor>
<connor> Do you work here? Do you live here? </connor>
<connor> - Just the casual banter. - Yeah, just for </connor>
<connor> the casual small talk, you know, </connor>
<garnt> didn't seem like that weird or anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - But, (laughs) but, so we you know, </garnt>
<garnt> we go back to our tables and we just you know, </garnt>
<garnt> carry on the night and that was my last interaction </garnt>
<connor> with him. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Right, and so as we're leaving, </connor>
<connor> the bar's closed early because of, </connor>

<joey> and you know, picking our songs. </joey>
<joey> And then one of the waiter comes in </joey>
<joey> and brings in like an extra towel, </joey>
<joey> which if you've ever been to a Japanese establishment, </joey>
<joey> when you come in, you get the wet towels. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. - Everyone gets a wet towel </joey>
<connor> for like how many people there are. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - So we start asking, </connor>
<connor> "Oh did someone order an extra towel </connor>
<connor> or something what's going on?" </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then the guy, just waltzes in, </garnt>
<garnt> and goes like, (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (claps) "Boys, can I join you?" </garnt>
<connor> And so I look around, and I'm like, okay, </connor>
<connor> he was talking. - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - He was talking to someone else in the group at the time. </connor>
<connor> So I look at him, to be like, "Did you invite him </connor>
<connor> 'cause I didn't invite him. </connor>
<connor> Sidney didn't invite him, Meilyne didn't invite him, </connor>
<connor> I don't think, so it must've been you." </connor>
<connor> And I just saw like the look of confusion on his face. </connor>
<connor> And I just, immediately. - It wasn't me, it wasn't me. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And I was just immediately like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, okay. No one invited him. </connor>
<garnt> Um, okay, how the fuck did he know </garnt>
<garnt> that we were in this specific room when we didn't even know </garnt>
<garnt> that we were in this specific room?" </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) - That so creepy! </joey>
<joey> That only just means then that he followed you guys. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I don't know how he followed us, </garnt>
<garnt> because as we walked to the karaoke place. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so, we didn't know we were going to the karaoke place </garnt>
<garnt> until after we had gotten out of the bar. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. - And he wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> there behind us, so, apparently like he said that's, </garnt>
<connor> he's like he knows everyone in the place. </connor>
<connor> He's a regular. - All right. </connor>
<connor> - And so, somehow he found out we were </connor>
<connor> in this specific room, and he, you know, </connor>
<connor> apparently he just thought he was, he could just join us. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. - And if you're watching this, </connor>
<connor> guy, which you probably are. </connor>
<connor> - As a fan of Trash Taste. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - As a fan of Trash Taste. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> This is totally a call-out because, </connor>
<connor> you know, as I'm probably gonna be </connor>
<connor> in the area. - You're gonna say it now. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna say this now, as the same as </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna say it probably the next time I see you. </connor>
<connor> Bruh, like, that was pretty creepy. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like if we had interacted more, </connor>
<connor> I would have been like totally fine, you know. </connor>
<garnt> If we had invited you or if you had like, </garnt>
<garnt> if you had like talked to us beforehand, </garnt>
<garnt> but the fact that you just showed up, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) like unannounced, </garnt>
<garnt> and we didn't know how you got. </garnt>
<garnt> We didn't know how you knew where we were. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we didn't even know we were gonna be there. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I don't know what you were expecting. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - I'd like to think </connor>
<connor> that he was expecting like the moment he'd come in the room, </connor>
<connor> you were all just like, turn around like, </connor>
<connor> welcome, you did it, you did it. </connor>
<connor> - Congratulations. (laughing and clapping) </connor>
<connor> - Join us, you found us, you solved the mystery. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> You can now join us. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You have unlocked the secret ending, please enjoy. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I mean it's at like conventions though </connor>
<connor> as well, right, people do that all the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's like, </connor>
<connor> I remember I was with Emirichu at a con, and Emily comes up </connor>
<connor> to me, 'cause we were hanging out the whole con </connor>
<connor> 'cause we really didn't know anyone. </connor>
<connor> And there's two guys with her. </connor>
<connor> She's like, "We getting lunch Connor?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, who are those two?" </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "Oh, I don't know." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What are they, (man laughing) </connor>
<connor> what are they, what are they doing?" </connor>
<connor> They're like, "They asked if they could join us for lunch." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Do you want them to?" </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "Not really." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "All right, okay." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Hey guys, we don't really know you, </connor>
<joey> we're gonna get lunch, sorry." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel- </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause some people like, you know like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like how'd you guys. - Don't wanna be the ass-hole. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like how do you guys handle that because- </garnt>
<garnt> - I just straight up them, I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> "Hey man, I don't know who you are. </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna get." - There's really </connor>
<joey> no nice way of saying that unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> You just have to, I mean, you know, </joey>
<joey> and I can tell that sometimes when people do that, </joey>
<joey> they don't mean it in like a creepy. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. - No, you're right. </joey>
<connor> - A lot of them just you know, they've met, </connor>
<joey> who might be someone they really look up, </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And this is their one chance to socialize with them </joey>
<joey> and they maybe you know, don't really think about, </joey>
<joey> hey it might be a little weird </joey>
<joey> if you just kind of like follow someone. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I'd like to feel like I'm pretty, </connor>
<connor> I'm a pretty open guy in terms of like, </connor>
<connor> social situations. - Oh yeah, </connor>
<connor> I'm definitely like happy to meet people. </connor>
<connor> - I've had plenty of situations where, </connor>
<connor> you know we were at a social gathering or a party, </connor>
<connor> and then, you know, we join someone else's </connor>
<connor> karaoke room. - And someone's cool </connor>
<connor> and you're like, "Hey man, come on." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but you know there are like several steps </connor>
<connor> that you have to take before that, </connor>
<connor> before both parties like mutually comfortable </connor>
<connor> with something like that. - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - You know, which is you know, </connor>
<connor> this is equally a message to everyone at conventions </connor>
<joey> and everything like that because, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure we have a lot of different stories </joey>
<joey> of just awkward social situations </joey>
<joey> where you don't really know people </joey>
<joey> and they kind of just invite themselves into your group. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like it would be the same </joey>
<joey> whether we're famous or like not, you know? </joey>
<joey> - No, yeah, it's just like, </joey>
<garnt> general social skills. - Yeah, it's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think my absolute pet peeve though, more than that, </garnt>
<connor> is because, like, you know, at least with people </connor>
<connor> who try and get a little too social </connor>
<connor> with us or whoever they admire right? </connor>
<connor> And try and sneak themselves into our friend group </connor>
<connor> or whatever, is that at least you can just straight up </connor>
<connor> be like, "Okay, you know, I'm not cool with this," </connor>
<connor> or whatever, you can directly do something about it right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. - What I find worse than that, </connor>
<connor> and this is sometimes at conventions. </connor>
<connor> This is sometimes just out in public, </connor>
<connor> is when they take a photo of you, from a distance. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, that's- </connor>
<connor> - And then they tag you, either on Twitter or Instagram, </connor>
<connor> being like, "I saw, Joey at blah, blah, blah." </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, it's just, it's like paparazzi. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's so. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I had one, oh I forgot where it was. </connor>
<connor> It was some con in the US but, </connor>
<connor> we were no where near the con. </connor>
<connor> And we were just hanging out at some mall </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Because we had already </connor>
<connor> finished all our panels and whatever. </connor>
<connor> We're just hanging out with a couple of my friends, </connor>
<connor> and then, you know, it was fine. </connor>
<connor> You know, we didn't really, </connor>
<connor> we ran into like maybe like two or three people or whatever. </connor>
<connor> They came up to us and said hello and whatnot. </connor>
<connor> And then I went back to the hotel </connor>
<connor> and I was just checking through Twitter. </connor>
<connor> And then I saw this photo, </connor>
<connor> of me, but it looked like I was on the ground floor. </connor>
<connor> And you know how some malls they have like </connor>
<connor> a big where the open? - Yeah the open top right. </connor>
<connor> Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It looked like someone had taken a photo </joey>
<joey> of Aki and I from like the fifth floor. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<connor> And it was this- </connor>
<connor> - Enhanced, enhanced. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah no, no, we didn't even have to enhance </connor>
<joey> because they drew a red circle around us. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Hey man, they made the thumbnails for you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they made the thumbnail for me. </connor>
<connor> They were like, they were like, </connor>
<joey> they drew a red circle around us and being like, </joey>
<connor> "I saw Aki and Joey at so-and-so mall." </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "That's fucking terrifying, Jesus Christ." </connor>
<connor> If he saw us, then just like, it would have been </connor>
<garnt> less embarrassing and less creepy </garnt>
<garnt> if they had just fucking shouted my name </garnt>
<garnt> from the fifth floor right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Then at least </garnt>
<garnt> I would know that they're there. </garnt>
<joey> But they were like, "I can't let them see me." </joey>
<joey> (imitates shutter clicking) (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like why? </joey>
<joey> Why would you do that? </joey>
<joey> It's just like, I get it, right. </joey>
<connor> - They're sometimes really nervous. </connor>
<joey> I know they tweeted me sometimes. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - I get they're nervous right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But there's a, </connor>
<joey> there's a difference between being nervous, </joey>
<joey> and being creepy, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I understand, like I try to be as like, </garnt>
<joey> understandable as I can with- </joey>
<joey> - No of course. - With, </joey>
<garnt> like, people being nervous. </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't scold them or anything, right? </joey>
<garnt> I didn't call them out on Twitter or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> because it's happened more than once. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - But every time </garnt>
<garnt> I see stuff like that, and thankfully it hasn't happened </garnt>
<garnt> in a long, long, long time. </garnt>
<garnt> But, whenever every now and then when stuff like that </garnt>
<garnt> does pop up on my Instagram or or Twitter or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Dude, come on." </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) I mean just, </connor>
<connor> you were literally, you took a photo of me. </connor>
<connor> There was another one when I was back home in Sydney, </connor>
<connor> - Right? - And I was just like walking. </connor>
<garnt> I think I was, I think I was walking around </garnt>
<garnt> with my sister or something, and someone had taken a photo </garnt>
<garnt> of me from behind, but it wasn't </garnt>
<connor> from like even that much of a distance. </connor>
<connor> It was literally like, </connor>
<connor> like- - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I've had that, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "That's fucking terrifying." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Because if I had turned around at that moment, </connor>
<connor> - Right. - I don't know what </connor>
<garnt> they would have done. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would they've just stood there like Mike Wazowski like, </garnt>
<connor> "I wasn't taking a photo, I swear." </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> Bye. </joey>
<joey> - No I don't know, I mean people can just talk </joey>
<joey> to me whenever, like I might. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Like look at them </joey>
<joey> blankly for a second as I realize </joey>
<joey> what's happening but, I mean, you can always </joey>
<joey> come up to me. - But if you're that close </joey>
<garnt> to me to take a photo, just come up to me. </garnt>
<connor> - Just, just like- </connor>
<connor> - I wanna talk to people. </connor>
<connor> - I like talking to people. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, as long as you, you know, </connor>
<garnt> just come on in like a nice friendly way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, as long as you don't come up to me </garnt>
<connor> and like grill the shit out of me like, </connor>
<connor> I don't care, just come up to me, like. </connor>
<connor> But that's the thing though right? </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of people don't like to come up </connor>
<joey> to YouTubers or whoever they admire </joey>
<joey> because it's their private time currently. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I don't give a shit. - I don't give a shit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Unless I'm like eating </joey>
<joey> at a restaurant, like if I'm sitting down </joey>
<garnt> clearly eating, don't. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You've said that a number of times, right. </connor>
<connor> - Or if I'm in like a private karaoke room, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) for example you know, </connor>
<connor> now that's. - At my house, you know. </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But if I'm walking around in public I don't give a shit. </joey>
<joey> Like talk to me. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Same here, I love having conversations- </garnt>
<garnt> - So this is a PSA, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If there are any Trash Tastes fans and you see any of us </garnt>
<joey> out on the streets wherever, just come up to us. </joey>
<joey> Just come up to us. </joey>
<joey> - And if it's an awkward situation, </joey>
<joey> we're just probably gonna tell it on the podcast. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. (men laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - No, we won't. - So, just don't fuck it up. </garnt>
<connor> Don't fuck it up. (man laughing) </connor>
<connor> - If you don't wanna be called out on the podcast. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm kidding, there's like 100 awkward interactions </connor>
<connor> we haven't talked about here. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah dude, we could dedicate an entire episode </joey>
<garnt> to shit like that. - And we should some day. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just saying. - I mean. </joey>
<garnt> - I gotta ask you, have you guys ever had that </garnt>
<garnt> the other way around, where you've been </garnt>
<garnt> the nervous wreck meeting someone? </garnt>
<joey> - I've had that once. </joey>
<connor> I've had like a fanboy moment- </connor>
<connor> - Why is Meilyne laughing? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, why are you laughing? </joey>
<joey> (chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] I've- </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - We know you've been there Meilyne. </joey>
<garnt> - That's Meilyne's life. - That's just you in general. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've had that. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never understood like the fanboy moment in my life, </garnt>
<connor> until maybe, I think it was two or three years ago, </connor>
<connor> I don't remember if I told it the podcast or whatever, </connor>
<connor> but I was at Otakuthon in Montreal, Canada. </connor>
<garnt> And I was a guest there. </garnt>
<connor> And one of the other guests was Obata Takeshi, </connor>
<connor> who is the illustrator for Death Note. </connor>
<connor> - Oh whoa. - And Bakuman and you know, </connor>
<connor> basically that guy. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he was a guest, </connor>
<connor> and I knew he was a guest. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - But, there were lots of guests at that convention, </connor>
<connor> so I was like, "I know he's a guest but I'm, </connor>
<connor> it's such a massive con. </connor>
<connor> like I'm probably not gonna see him." </connor>
<connor> So we went to the opening ceremony </connor>
<connor> 'cause we had to go to the opening ceremony. </connor>
<connor> Of course he wasn't at the opening ceremony. </connor>
<connor> - He's too busy for that. - No. </connor>
<connor> - He was too busy for that, all right? </connor>
<connor> So I'm just like, it's whatever, like. </connor>
<connor> Oh, you know, I might see a poster </connor>
<connor> of him somewhere or whatever. </connor>
<connor> Right? - I'll see a poster. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'll see him </connor>
<garnt> in the distance. - No, 'cause like. </garnt>
<garnt> When you're two guests at a convention, that means nothing. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Especially 'cause. - I know, I know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - He's like, </connor>
<connor> he doesn't seem like the kind of guy </connor>
<connor> who I was just like meet in the green room right? </connor>
<garnt> Like he's gonna have like his own room or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> He was easily like the biggest guest at that con. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I was like, "Okay, that's cool." </connor>
<connor> I mean it's cool that I'm in the same building as him </connor>
<garnt> or whatever but it's whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> if I don't see him, totally fine. </garnt>
<garnt> So, we finish the opening ceremony </garnt>
<garnt> and we're walking towards our first panel, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think Aki was with me and she, </garnt>
<garnt> and she was like, "Joey, you should turn around." </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Why?' </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "'Cause look at the guy </connor>
<connor> who's like directly behind you." </connor>
<connor> And I turn around and it was Obata Takeshi. </connor>
<connor> Just kind of standing there, </connor>
<connor> he was just like, kind of looking at me. </connor>
<connor> Like silently, and immediately, 'cause he has such a, </connor>
<connor> 'cause he's like, he's got bald head, right? </connor>
<connor> Like very distinct looking dude. </connor>
<connor> And I immediately knew, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Holy shit, that's Obata Takeshi." </connor>
<connor> And anybody would tell you, </connor>
<connor> if you're a guest at a con with Obata Takeshi, </connor>
<connor> that is like the most optimal moment to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hi." - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - "Hello," right? - You could be like. </connor>
<connor> - It was the perfect timing to be like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm a guest of this con too, and I'm a massive fan </connor>
<connor> of your work," or whatever. </connor>
<joey> I couldn't say anything. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I legit was like, (laughs) (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was, and at that moment I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh my God, this is the fanboy moment." </connor>
<connor> I understand it now. </connor>
<connor> Like you really can't say anything. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You just get, that was the definition of just dumbstruck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I think I was so caught off guard, </connor>
<connor> that I didn't expect him </connor>
<connor> to be literally standing right here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Looking at me. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why he was looking at me either. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) Like silently. </connor>
<connor> He was like. - Was he off? </connor>
<joey> - Was he off? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he was like. - Did you speak to him at all? </joey>
<joey> - No. - Oh, damn. </joey>
<connor> You would have loved to speak to him </connor>
<connor> in Japanese. - I know, I know, </connor>
<joey> I should have, I missed that opportunity. </joey>
<joey> I regret it to this day. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I've had a similar experience </garnt>
<connor> when I first moved to Japan, and it was when Meilyne took me </connor>
<connor> to a Hiroyuki Sawano concert. </connor>
<connor> So we go to this Hiroyuki Sawano concert, </connor>
<connor> and it's not the type of concert </connor>
<connor> you think it's gonna be, right? </connor>
<connor> When I heard Hiroyuki Sawano concert, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Big bass, big drums, </connor>
<connor> this is gonna be in your face." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> No, it was like at this really, really posh jazz bar. </connor>
<connor> And it wasn't, I wouldn't even call it a concert </connor>
<connor> because everyone had like, everyone had tables </connor>
<connor> and posh little cocktails, and he was just playing a lot </connor>
<connor> of like acoustic versions of what he was, you know, </connor>
<connor> of a lot of the songs. - That's cool though. </connor>
<connor> That's pretty cool. - That's cool though. </connor>
<connor> - Of a lot of songs he's composed. </connor>
<connor> So it was, it was more like, </connor>
<joey> it was more like a private jazz bar kind of deal, </joey>
<joey> but it was still fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so after the concert, </joey>
<joey> Meilyne like asked me, "Hey, do you wanna meet him?" </joey>
<joey> And I was just like so unprepared. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like, I thought I was just going there </connor>
<connor> to see one of my favorite anime composers. </connor>
<connor> And I wasn't, I didn't know Meilyne had like </connor>
<connor> all the fucking contacts that can- </connor>
<connor> - Of course she fucking does. </connor>
<connor> - Which, now knowing her now, </connor>
<connor> of course she does. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But back then, 'cause this was </connor>
<connor> when I had just moved to Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so we go, we go to the green room or whatever, </connor>
<garnt> and I'm waiting outside, and I'm just like. </garnt>
<garnt> (breathing heavily) </garnt>
<joey> Holy fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Heavy breathing. (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, I haven't, </joey>
<connor> I haven't emotionally prepared myself. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Like what am I going to do? </connor>
<joey> What am I going to say? </joey>
<connor> And like the, I was reciting all the basic fucking Japanese </connor>
<connor> that I know at the time. (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> (Connor speaking Japanese) </connor>
<connor> Like okay, I just need to say something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - I need to say something. </connor>
<connor> And then so, he comes out, I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "It's Hiroyuki Sawano, it's Hiroyuki Sawano." </garnt>
<garnt> And then so, Hiro said, "Do you want a picture?" </garnt>
<garnt> And everything, and I'm like, "Yeah, sure. </garnt>
<garnt> Sure I'll have a picture." (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So, so we take the picture, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I was like, oh I just wanted to say. </garnt>
<garnt> I want in my mind, I wanted to say, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, thank you very much for your work </garnt>
<garnt> and everything you've done." </garnt>
<connor> Didn't fucking say anything, and so he, </connor>
<connor> like after the picture, I'm just staring at him like this. </connor>
<connor> And he looks up, and he looks at Meilyne, </connor>
<connor> and then he's just like, "Was that it? </connor>
<connor> Okay, I'm just gonna go back now." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then he goes back to the green room and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<connor> - "Oh fuck, that was that guy." </connor>
<garnt> I was that guy. (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Oh no. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That's why, that's the thing though, right? </joey>
<joey> Is like, now that I've experienced that moment, </joey>
<garnt> I don't blame anybody who does that to me </garnt>
<garnt> or like their favorite person, </garnt>
<garnt> right? - Exactly, exactly. I get it. </garnt>
<garnt> I get it. - I completely understand </garnt>
<joey> how it feels, like- </joey>
<garnt> - Everything you recite in your head </garnt>
<connor> just goes out the fucking window. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've never had that- </connor>
<garnt> - Really never? - Really? </garnt>
<joey> - I think maybe, I'm trying to think </joey>
<joey> of who would, maybe like, Araki, I'd be like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, oh yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like that's like maybe it, like I don't know, </joey>
<connor> I don't know, like I, it's weird. </connor>
<connor> I see people who are maybe like, big things </connor>
<connor> in stuff that I like and I'm just kind of like, </connor>
<garnt> "That's really cool." - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Maybe I should say hi," like I was at a con, </garnt>
<joey> and, there was a, Billy West, the guy that voices like Fry. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Futurama, and like </joey>
<connor> did like some of the Looney Tunes, like the later ones. </connor>
<connor> Like one of the most iconic voice actors, right? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, I grew up on all that stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, "Hi man, nice to meet you." </joey>
<connor> And we just like, 'cause he was using the same green room, </connor>
<connor> so we were just talking about stuff, </connor>
<connor> but I was never like, (breathing heavily) </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> It was just like, this guy is so cool. </connor>
<connor> And I like, remember his voice in stuff. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, it's weird, I guess 'cause I don't, </joey>
<joey> in that moment when I see them in person, </joey>
<joey> normally I don't think about their work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> this is another person in front of me. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - I'm gonna talk </connor>
<connor> to them like that, but maybe if it's like someone, </connor>
<connor> again, like Araki, who I'm obsessed with- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think it's also, for me at least, </garnt>
<connor> it was like language barrier, 'cause I knew- </connor>
<connor> - That's gotta be nerve-wracking. </connor>
<connor> - There were so many things I wanted to say to him, </connor>
<connor> and if I could speak Japanese. - You couldn't even begin </connor>
<connor> to say. (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was like, either I look like a nervous wreck </connor>
<garnt> or I looked like a nervous wreck speaking broken Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what's better, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause English it's like, you play like a word game. </connor>
<joey> Like you don't wanna say I'm a fan. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause like, especially with other YouTubers right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - You don't wanna say </connor>
<joey> I'm an admirer 'cause that's just kind of creepy. </joey>
<connor> - I normally say like, my go-to is yeah, </connor>
<connor> like man, dude I love your work man, it's sick. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I usually say like "I appreciate your work." </joey>
<garnt> - I think the one guest I got on immediately well with </garnt>
<joey> was the first time I met Kevin Penkin, </joey>
<joey> who was like such a fucking lad. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, - Yeah. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but to be fair, like. - He's an Aussie? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> It's like if he didn't know who this guy was, </connor>
<joey> you'd be like, "Oh it's just another Aussie bloke." </joey>
<garnt> - No, he totally is. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's this mutual, just like, understanding that I feel </garnt>
<connor> like British people and Australian people have </connor>
<connor> when they like meet, it's like, "We're getting drunk right?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Like, we're getting drunk? </connor>
<connor> Ah, sick, we'll get drunk. </connor>
<connor> Whereas in Americans, I feel like there's a lot more </connor>
<connor> like juggling involved, "So are you, </connor>
<connor> are you a drinker? - So do you do. </connor>
<connor> - [In Unison] Do you drink? </connor>
<connor> - Do you do like, "How much you drink? </connor>
<connor> Do you like party and everything like that?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because like, have you met a ton </connor>
<garnt> of Americans that just don't drink? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you can never tell, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It makes us sound like alcoholics, </garnt>
<garnt> how we're like, "No, we have to drink." </garnt>
<connor> No but it's like. - No, we are alcoholics. </connor>
<joey> - In a sense, in a sense. </joey>
<joey> - It's ingrained in our culture where, </joey>
<connor> if I meet like a fellow Brit or an Aussie, </connor>
<connor> it's just- - We're drinking right? </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, "Hey, I'm having like, </connor>
<connor> I'm having some drinks later." - Yeah, you wanna join? </connor>
<connor> - It's not even like, </connor>
<garnt> it's just an assumption that they will join. </garnt>
<joey> - We're one step away in like Britain and Australia, </joey>
<joey> we're one step away from the point of, </joey>
<connor> if you don't drink we're gonna bully you. </connor>
<garnt> (man laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's like, it's that ingrained in our culture. </connor>
<joey> - Whereas, whenever I meet someone American </joey>
<connor> like an American guest or something and I wanna get </connor>
<connor> to know them better, I'm like, "what's the best way </connor>
<connor> to approach this, do I ask them out for like lunch or?" </connor>
<connor> - Some drinks? Like you wanna get some drinks? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Pub, pub. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not pub, don't say pub. (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Drinks is always way more open-ended man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there isn't that same assumption </garnt>
<connor> that you're just gonna go out for drinks afterwards. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Just like, </connor>
<garnt> just like bond over a pint or something. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause, I feel like if we hang out in the UK </connor>
<garnt> during the day and you know we haven't really said anything, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like, we're getting drinks later, right? </garnt>
<joey> Like. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, if you're ever a guest on the podcast, </joey>
<joey> probably gonna get drinks after. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, </joey>
<connor> we have every single time, we do it with Chris, </connor>
<connor> we do it with Carol and- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Who are like, who would you say is the? </connor>
<connor> Well it doesn't have to be one person, </connor>
<connor> but who would you say is the coolest person you've met? </connor>
<joey> Like as a fan, or as an admirer of that person like, </joey>
<joey> who would you say? </joey>
<joey> If someone, if I asked you, </joey>
<joey> who is the coolest person you've met. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, in the anime industry, </garnt>
<joey> it'd probably be Hiroyuki Sawano for me, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've been a big fan of his work for like- </joey>
<garnt> - You're not gonna say Kevin Penkin? </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Nah, nah. - Kevin's just crying. </connor>
<connor> - Kevin knows he's a boy, man. (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Kevin's like, "I'm not your favorite composer?" (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - No, because like, he's a great writer. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember the first time we met Kevin </garnt>
<garnt> and we got like pissed together, </garnt>
<garnt> and he starts talking about how like his, </garnt>
<garnt> like how he composed for like "Made In Abyss" </garnt>
<connor> and his process for everything like that. </connor>
<connor> And he starts talking about this really like technical, </connor>
<connor> composition, like talk and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, this is really fucking interesting." </connor>
<connor> This is like, like a lot of people would love to hear this. </connor>
<connor> This is like a really interesting conversation, </connor>
<connor> but we were like pretty hammered att that point. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> And so I remember making a mental note being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Man, I gotta hear this again sober </garnt>
<garnt> because this is like some really interesting stuff." </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - In your head you were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Wow, this is really interesting." </garnt>
<garnt> But what came out was, </garnt>
<joey> "Shut up Penkin, shut up Kevin." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like the day afterwards, at Crunchyroll Expo, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Man, so what were you saying about composing </connor>
<connor> that scene with Mitty and like all that stuff like, </connor>
<connor> can you just repeat what you said, </connor>
<connor> 'cause that was like super interesting." </connor>
<garnt> Kevin just goes, "No man, I have no idea </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck I was saying." </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> "I was fucking pissed mate." </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) - Oh my God, </garnt>
<joey> I fucking love him. (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> I love him so much. </joey>
<joey> He was so, oh man, 'cause I remember the first time </joey>
<garnt> I met him IRL was when we all went. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yes, a year ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, the the moment I saw him, </garnt>
<garnt> at that you know, at the pub, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, "Oh shit, that's Kevin Penkin." </joey>
<joey> But then, the moment he opened his mouth, </joey>
<joey> he went from Kevin Penkin to, "Oh look, and Aussie." </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> - The moment I knew that it was gonna be like fine, </connor>
<connor> we were gonna get on was like, I sat down, </connor>
<connor> he was like, "Right, I'm getting a round then." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, ah, okay and if you don't know </connor>
<connor> what a round is, in the UK and Australia, </connor>
<joey> we have this thing where, I think it's a way to trap you </joey>
<joey> into having at least like seven drinks. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Basically it's a system where, </joey>
<joey> and this probably sounds like hell to like, </joey>
<joey> like socially. - Someone </joey>
<joey> who doesn't drink, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's basically like, if there's like four or five of you, </joey>
<connor> someone buys the round which means that they buy all </connor>
<connor> the drinks for everyone. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then you kind of rotate who does it but obviously, </joey>
<joey> you can't just then have one, you have </joey>
<joey> to go through the whole cycle. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because you don't wanna be that guy </connor>
<joey> who doesn't pay for their round. </joey>
<garnt> - You don't wanna be. - Everyone'll know, </garnt>
<garnt> you're the stingier. - Yeah. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - You don't wanna in debts with anyone. </connor>
<connor> So you're getting at least as many rounds </connor>
<connor> as there are people on the table. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. - Right? </connor>
<connor> And that's just like how, </connor>
<garnt> that's just how the drinking culture works. </garnt>
<joey> - It's such a horrible social trap because, </joey>
<connor> when you think about it like, in terms of the amount </connor>
<connor> of money you spend, it's literally net zero. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you make it through the entire round, </connor>
<connor> but for some reason you're just, </connor>
<joey> you're locked into this until the round is completely over. </joey>
<connor> It's horrible. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like whenever I've tried to get Americans </connor>
<connor> to do this, they're like, "No, that sounds stupid. </connor>
<connor> Why would we do that?" - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And I'm like, "No, no, just do it, just do it." </garnt>
<connor> - It's a social thing, right? - Just try, just try. </connor>
<connor> - It's like logically, it's like yeah, </connor>
<connor> why would I not? - It's a way to get </connor>
<connor> everyone drunk. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but it's just a way to get everyone drunk </connor>
<garnt> and everyone social 'cause like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're all in this together right? </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The moment you sit down you are in the cold, (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> you cannot leave. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So like Kevin, we're just fucking, okay, I'm gonna. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a 10 minute Kevin Penkin appreciation part. </connor>
<connor> - This is a 10 minute Kevin rant. </connor>
<connor> Like if you hang out with Kevin, </connor>
<connor> he has this thing called Oolong high or Oolong die. </connor>
<connor> And Oolong high is just like, (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> the worst fucking drink that gives you the worst hangovers </connor>
<joey> 'cause it's like whiskey and Oolong right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or something like that. - Basically there's </joey>
<connor> Oolong and like. - Or is it Shochu and Oolong? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's Shochu, Sochu, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Some fucking disgusting shit. </joey>
<joey> - And like he orders this every time </joey>
<connor> and I did not know that you could order like, </connor>
<connor> Oolong high by the jug, - What? </connor>
<connor> - In karaoke places? - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But he found a way to order it by the jug </connor>
<garnt> in karaoke places. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - He was like, "You wanna a Oolong high, right?" </connor>
<connor> "I'll try it and I guess." </connor>
<connor> Two jugs come in and I'm like, "Kevin." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> This isn't, what kind of sample size is this? (laughs) </connor>
<joey> What the fuck? God damn. </joey>
<connor> - That is the most Australian fucking like phrase </connor>
<connor> for like that. - Oh, do you wanna </connor>
<joey> just try that? - Oolong high or oolong die? </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> My God! - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then there's this one other time </joey>
<garnt> when I went to fucking Yakiniku with Kevin, </garnt>
<joey> and it was like, (laughs) why, </joey>
<connor> it was like all you can eat as well. </connor>
<garnt> And so, Kevin took all you can eat, as he takes the menu, </garnt>
<connor> and he orders two of everything off the menu. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - 'Cause </connor>
<garnt> he was just that hungry. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - So much disgusting stuff as well on that menu. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and just like the food kept turning up </garnt>
<garnt> and it was like, and he didn't tell everyone </garnt>
<garnt> that he was ordering this much food. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - So we would finish this and we will like, </connor>
<connor> it was like that scene, that scene in Seven </connor>
<garnt> where the guy over feeds the first like sloth guy </garnt>
<garnt> to like kill him, that's what it felt like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did not see the reference going there. </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Like 'cause you were just eating food, </garnt>
<garnt> and you were like, your stomach was already expanded beyond, </garnt>
<connor> it felt like my stomach was fucking Jupiter or something. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. - That's how expanded it was, </connor>
<connor> and then as soon as we finish, </connor>
<garnt> another round of fucking Yakiniku comes, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I look at Connor, we're like, </garnt>
<garnt> why did we sign ourselves up for this? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, we made him tell the kitchen, </connor>
<connor> please stop, stop the order. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> We take it back, like fuck go back. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Like pitiful. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, well, we can't wait to have Kevin on the show. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - If you couldn't already tell. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the original question again? (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - The original question was, </joey>
<joey> who is the coolest person you've met? </joey>
<connor> And then it went (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> to a 10 minute Kevin Penkin appreciation post. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like when you meet like, celebrities or whatever </connor>
<connor> in the right environment like it normally results </connor>
<connor> in really positive. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like if you're in the green room with someone </connor>
<connor> then normally, and obviously not everyone can get </connor>
<connor> in the green room sadly, but you know, if they're in a place </connor>
<connor> where they're comfortable, and you talk to them, </connor>
<connor> I find like most people you speak </connor>
<connor> to are really fucking cool. </connor>
<joey> - That's true. - Most, most, I mean there's, </joey>
<joey> I've met plenty of guests who have been like, yikes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - At conventions. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We won't go into that. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, well we should leave them unnamed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna get called out. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that one time I punched that kid, </joey>
<joey> I really don't want that getting out there. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - One time punched that guest. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Dude, some of the stuff </joey>
<joey> I've seen guests do, "You're like holy shit, </joey>
<joey> they're confident doing that in front </joey>
<connor> of like eight other guests? </connor>
<connor> - Yikes. - Jesus Christ!" </connor>
<connor> (Connor exhales) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I've seen guests that have made like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause at cons you get like handlers, </connor>
<connor> I've seen them make their handlers cry over like nothing. </connor>
<connor> We're all just sitting there in the room like. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) Okay. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I'm just sitting there being like, </joey>
<garnt> I don't even know what to do with my handler. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even know where my handler is right now. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) - Yeah, I tell them, </connor>
<joey> listen, I'm fine. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe I'll need a coffee at some point over this weekend. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) I feel bad asking </connor>
<connor> you to do that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I feel like one guest who, </connor>
<connor> and I know this is probably gonna be like, </connor>
<joey> so like, of course, Connor, so when I was doing </joey>
<joey> my obviously Sebastian stuff </joey>
<joey> for so long. - I knew where you were going. </joey>
<joey> - Okay no, 'cause I felt like I learned so much right? </joey>
<joey> So, I was copying Jay Michael Tatum's Sebastian impression </joey>
<garnt> for so fucking long, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I was so worried when I met him, 'cause I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm literally like, made my career </garnt>
<garnt> at that point off just copying the dude. </garnt>
<connor> Right, which could've gone either way. </connor>
<connor> - You thought it could have been like the Spiderman </connor>
<garnt> meme like, (laughs) (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It could've been like, "I fucking hate what you're doing. </connor>
<connor> "Why are you copying me? Stop doing that," </connor>
<connor> or it could have been like, "Who are you?" </connor>
<connor> Or it could have been like, "Oh nice." </connor>
<connor> I guess, I didn't expect, I don't know what I expected. </connor>
<connor> And when I met him, he was super fucking nice. </connor>
<connor> He was like, "Oh, you're that fucking guy." </connor>
<connor> Like jokingly. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, (exhales) okay, he's cool about it. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, he invited me for drinks and stuff and we met </connor>
<connor> and yeah, one thing I learned from him is that </connor>
<connor> he is amazing at handling the fans that come to him. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And just getting to like sit next to him </connor>
<connor> and watch him like talk to them and like, </connor>
<connor> he just immediately changed his atmosphere based </connor>
<connor> on who he saw or who was coming near him. </connor>
<connor> He just read people, like immediately. </connor>
<connor> And so, starting to copy like doing that, </connor>
<connor> and it was rough at the start but I feel like </connor>
<connor> I've learned so much from him in just, </connor>
<connor> how to compose yourself, how to just be nice to people. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) I'm just such an ass, </joey>
<connor> I'm kidding. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Right, not only did you copy his voice </connor>
<connor> but you copied the way that you handled- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And that he was so willing to like, </connor>
<garnt> like help me out and teach me things and he also like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like trained you up like a prodigy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Like there was a con that I wasn't going to go to </connor>
<joey> and he personally vouched on my behalf and said </joey>
<joey> this guy's good, he was like, "You need to get him." </joey>
<joey> And like really nice guy. </joey>
<connor> Him and his husband Brandon are both some </connor>
<joey> of the nicest voice actors out there. </joey>
<joey> - I mean yeah, I was just about to say, </joey>
<joey> like, the way that Brandon and I kind </joey>
<joey> of met online was a little like. </joey>
<joey> - You shitting on voice actors that- </joey>
<connor> - No, no, not really, (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> it was like a, so, to give context like, </connor>
<connor> I've never met Brandon IRL yet, but we follow each other </connor>
<connor> on Twitter and we've talked like- </connor>
<connor> - He's one of the nicest dudes I've ever met. </connor>
<connor> - Such a nice guy. - Really centered. </connor>
<connor> - And I can immediately tell, incredibly intelligent. </connor>
<connor> - He's like getting TikTok famous as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah I saw, I saw. </connor>
<connor> But, I did this video, I think it was sometime this year. </connor>
<garnt> It was earlier this year, where I asked my fans on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> to send me videos of them speaking in Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Asking questions about Japanese, and then I respond </connor>
<connor> or like answer their question or whatever. </connor>
<connor> And one of the videos, was Brandon. </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And he was speaking in the most perfect Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever heard. </garnt>
<garnt> Like his Japanese is actually perfect. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And in the video he basically asked, "So, I've seen videos </connor>
<joey> of you in the past, kind of shitting on dubs?" </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> - So he's a, Michael and his husband are both </connor>
<joey> dub voice actors. - They're both dub voicers. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, they're both dub voice actors. </joey>
<connor> - And Brandon used to be a professional translator. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, he was, so hence why he's Japanese is so- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But in the video, in full Japanese, </connor>
<connor> you know, very, very professional Japanese he's like, </connor>
<connor> "So, you've kind of been talking, ill heartedly </connor>
<connor> about dubs and dub voice actors. </connor>
<connor> So, as a translator, I want to know, like, </connor>
<joey> what is the best, what is a solution to that?" </joey>
<joey> And immediately, in the video, you can see immediately, </joey>
<joey> I was just like, "I'm so sorry." </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He had like, Brandon had that shit-eating grin </connor>
<joey> of like, I've completely won here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I have taken the W, now you must hand it to me. </joey>
<joey> - I remember when I saw that on Twitter I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Good Joey, you have to admit that dubs are good now." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> So basically in the video, I was just like, </joey>
<garnt> "Listen, it's not the voice actors usually, </garnt>
<garnt> "it's the voice directors," I did that whole spiel. </garnt>
<garnt> And luckily he was really really cool about it </garnt>
<garnt> and you know because he said it in such a nice fashion </garnt>
<connor> as well to me, I couldn't help, but just being like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay you know what? I'll give you that one." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, you dropped this King, I'll give it to you, all right? </connor>
<joey> Yeah but, yeah, he's, I'd love to meet him IRL and- </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, they're both super nice guys </connor>
<connor> and I mean the reason why I speak so highly of them is just </connor>
<connor> 'cause they've just been so nice to me </connor>
<connor> and so welcoming. - Honestly, </connor>
<joey> every dub voice actor I've interacted </joey>
<connor> with, either IRL or not IRL has been really, really nice </connor>
<connor> to me, considering the fact that I had supposedly </connor>
<garnt> shit-talked a lot of top voice actors. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't been shit-talking the voice actors, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> Just the product. </garnt>
<connor> - Just the dubs. </connor>
<garnt> - You're just trying to deflect the blame, Joey. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) - Yeah, please, </connor>
<garnt> I like you, but. - Deflect, deflect. </garnt>
<joey> - I like you guys. </joey>
<connor> - "Ah, it's the director's fault." </connor>
<joey> Meets a director, "It was the production team." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was the production team's fault. </joey>
<connor> I meet the product- </connor>
<connor> - It was the audio software's fault. </connor>
<connor> It was a Dolby. - It was no one's fault, </connor>
<garnt> you just had a crunch time, that was it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I was deaf in one ear, clearly. </joey>
<connor> - I remember I was still bitter for like two years </connor>
<connor> that you said the, watching Baccano! subbed </connor>
<connor> is better than dubbed, I was like, "What? </connor>
<connor> Well, you're chatting out of your ass." </connor>
<connor> - I mean I still stand </connor>
<joey> by that point but, - You're chatting out </joey>
<connor> your ass man. - (groaning) Oh God damn it! </connor>
<joey> - Look, I'll say that it's better, </joey>
<connor> but I'm not saying that the dub is bad. </connor>
<connor> The dub is good. - The dub's better. </connor>
<connor> - The dub's better. </connor>
<joey> - It's better, it's just better. </joey>
<connor> - Nah. (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Would you, like? - Nah. </connor>
<garnt> - What, no, it's just like. - No, </garnt>
<joey> it's good but it's not better. </joey>
<joey> - It's like one of the few dubs that's, you know, </joey>
<garnt> one of the few shows that are better experienced </garnt>
<garnt> in dubs, just because of the setting and like- </garnt>
<connor> - The reason why most anime are better in Japanese </connor>
<joey> is 'cause, most of the time, the setting matches Japanese, </joey>
<joey> but in Baccano! it's like, it's in fucking 1930s America. </joey>
<joey> We need to have. - In my opinion, </joey>
<joey> there was only one anime where the dub </joey>
<connor> is far superior than the sub, and that's Panty & Stocking. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But that's obviously because it doesn't even look </connor>
<joey> like an anime, it looks like a cartoon. </joey>
<connor> - I think, at least for the notable ones, </connor>
<joey> Panty & Stocking, Baccano!, </joey>
<joey> and Cowboy Bebop. - Cowboy Bebop, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Of course. - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - But Baccano! is like, I watched the sub and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Look, this is shit." - I'm not, </joey>
<joey> no, listen. - This is shit. </joey>
<joey> - It's not shit! </joey>
<connor> - It is a shittier experience compared to the dub. </connor>
<joey> - It is not shit, I'm not saying </joey>
<joey> that the Baccano! dub is bad- </joey>
<connor> - Going from Baccano! dub to sub is like </connor>
<connor> when you have like the premium, triple-ply wipes at home </connor>
<joey> and you go to the fucking restroom, in like public </joey>
<joey> and it's like the sand paper </joey>
<joey> grading your. - It's not that bad. </joey>
<joey> - They're all, it's like 1930s Japan </joey>
<connor> and they're all like Kawaii, like some of the characters. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, mama!" </connor>
<connor> And it's like, shut the fuck up, sound American! </connor>
<connor> You're in 1930s America, sound American, bitch. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know man, like look, listen. </joey>
<connor> To me it's like. - We need to have you, </connor>
<joey> forcibly sit you down, and watch the dub </joey>
<joey> and like, enjoy it. - I've seen the dub. </joey>
<joey> - How much have you seen of the dub? </joey>
<joey> - I've seen it all. </joey>
<joey> - Bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - Yes I have. - No way, no way. </connor>
<connor> - Baccano! is one of my fucking favorite anime, </connor>
<connor> of course I've seen the dub. </connor>
<connor> And also because you won't shut the fuck up about the dub, </connor>
<garnt> so I'm like, "All right, fine, I'll listen </garnt>
<joey> to the fucking dub." - I will not be not contend </joey>
<joey> until I watch you watching the dub. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna sit behind you being like, </garnt>
<garnt> Joey, appreciate this part. - Fine, </garnt>
<connor> I'll do a reaction video. </connor>
<joey> - We're on video, will you please stop fighting? </joey>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I'll do a reaction video to me watching the dub </connor>
<garnt> and then you can do a reaction video to my reaction video. </garnt>
<joey> All right, how's that? </joey>
<connor> - I mean okay, here's another question. </connor>
<garnt> - Can we just get on? </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Can we just get on, please? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, can you name any of the characters </connor>
<connor> that you think are better in the sub than the dub? </connor>
<connor> Like which one do you think, </connor>
<connor> or like is there any dub characters in it? </connor>
<joey> - It's not particular characters, it's just overall, </joey>
<garnt> because maybe it's because I did watch the sub first. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, maybe if I watched the dub first, </garnt>
<joey> might be completely different. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, like Ladd Russo is like one </joey>
<joey> of my favorite dub performances of all time. </joey>
<joey> - So, yeah, it's like. - Of all time. </joey>
<joey> - No, of course, Ladd Russo is fucking incredible. </joey>
<joey> - And he's good in sub, but I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I don't know maybe it's </joey>
<joey> because I understand the language. </joey>
<joey> - It hit different. </joey>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - If you, okay, I know it's. - I'm just saying maybe </connor>
<connor> it's because I understand the language, </connor>
<garnt> and I understand the small little inflections </garnt>
<garnt> that might go over a lot of people's heads, </garnt>
<joey> that I appreciate the sub a lot more than most people. </joey>
<connor> - I mean you just, okay. </connor>
<connor> Even just give me a two second sample of the voices. </connor>
<connor> When you listen to like the gravel in Ladd's English voice </connor>
<connor> in Baccano!, it's like god damn. </connor>
<joey> God damn! - Okay but hold on, </joey>
<joey> from your logic right, you've only brought up Ladd. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, okay well, I think Isaac and Miria are also better. </connor>
<joey> - I think Isaac and Miria sound the fucking same. </joey>
<connor> In the sud and dub. - No, no. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking, in Japanese, it's voiced by Cream </connor>
<connor> from Sonic and it sounds like Cream from Sonic. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it doesn't sound right at all. </connor>
<connor> And, okay, also in the sub- </connor>
<connor> - Okay, but hold on a second, if that voice actor </connor>
<connor> didn't do Cream from Sonic. - No! </connor>
<connor> - Then maybe you'd be like, "Okay, </connor>
<connor> this is actually pretty good." - No, because. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe it's all because you only hear Cream </connor>
<joey> from fucking Sonic the Hedgehog. </joey>
<joey> - To anyone that hasn't watched this, </joey>
<joey> you don't need to have watched it, </joey>
<joey> but, like again, and also in the dub, </joey>
<joey> they cut out a lot of the reaction noises like, ah, oh, </joey>
<joey> or like a bunch of them, which is fucking fantastic </joey>
<joey> 'cause I think it doesn't suit Baccano! having the, </joey>
<joey> (Connor exclaims) </joey>
<connor> and fucking Miriam sounds like fucking Cream the fucking, </connor>
<connor> what's it, the rabbit, that's it. </connor>
<connor> Nodding every two seconds? </connor>
<connor> And she says, "Sukhoi" every two seconds, it is so grading, </connor>
<connor> seeing an American 1930s person going, </connor>
<connor> with a Tommy gun going, "Sukhoi." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's so weird. </connor>
<connor> - I don't mind. - I hate it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't mind it because it's fucking anime. </joey>
<connor> - Oh I, what did you say one of the episodes? </connor>
<connor> It's just cartoons, bro? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it's just a Japanese cartoon bro, chill the fuck out. </joey>
<connor> - No, we all know that someone has to get angry, </connor>
<joey> and I'll do it. - Oh my God of course. </joey>
<connor> Every time dude. </connor>
<connor> Every anime has to have that one faction </connor>
<joey> of a toxic city right? </joey>
<garnt> - I thought I cared about the Baccano! dub, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I realized, man maybe I don't care </garnt>
<joey> about the Baccano! dub. - No, I really don't. </joey>
<connor> I really don't. </connor>
<connor> - I just think you know, </connor>
<connor> scientifically speaking, it's, it's better. </connor>
<joey> - It's a Chinese cartoon voiced in English, like- </joey>
<connor> - Chinese? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) - Just chill out there. </connor>
<joey> - Chinese? </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<garnt> This man, this man's off, </garnt>
<garnt> goddammit. - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - What were we talking about? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even know, we were, oh yeah, </joey>
<garnt> we were talking, no, we were talking </garnt>
<joey> about our favorite people that we've met. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, we were talking about- </joey>
<garnt> (men laughing) - Not that that matters. </garnt>
<connor> - Why do we do this every time? </connor>
<connor> - It's okay, tangents are a healthy part of conversation. </connor>
<joey> - Not when it goes over to like, </joey>
<connor> how did it go from fucking, oh yes I love Jay Michael Tatum </connor>
<joey> to fucking Cream, from Sonic the Hedgehog? </joey>
<garnt> - I felt like I could've gone for a toilet break </garnt>
<joey> and just let you guys duke it out for like </joey>
<joey> the last five minutes. - Yeah, you could've. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you could've. </connor>
<connor> I would've come out on top. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just passionate you know, </joey>
<connor> I just care about the things that I care, </connor>
<joey> which is not many things. - What's the meme </joey>
<joey> on the softboard again, where it's like, </joey>
<joey> I love how Connor interjects with an opinion </joey>
<joey> and thinks he's always right. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Hey man- </joey>
<joey> - And he doesn't let anyone else talk about it. </joey>
<connor> - I fucking hate when I listen to a podcast </connor>
<garnt> when it's like three people who are like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yes. - You know yes, </garnt>
<connor> I guess you have a point, yeah, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I guess I can understand where you're, </connor>
<connor> I want someone who's like, "Fuck you, you're wrong." </connor>
<joey> And it turns out, that that person is completely </joey>
<joey> in the wrong. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And they're on there like, "I don't give a shit." </joey>
<connor> It doesn't matter, that's the last episode. </connor>
<joey> - So what you're saying is you're playing </joey>
<connor> the villain. - You're playing </connor>
<joey> the antagonist again. - You're playing </joey>
<joey> the antagonist again. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, listen, right? </joey>
<joey> I don't give a fuck. </joey>
<joey> And if I'm in the moment, I'm gonna say what I say </joey>
<connor> with full confidence and I'll go home later that day </connor>
<connor> and I'll be like, "I think I was actually wrong, </connor>
<connor> actually, fuck, I mean, we've recorded it." </connor>
<garnt> - Big regret. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I've talked to you enough times to know </garnt>
<garnt> that you do that so many fucking times off the podcast </garnt>
<garnt> as well, so I'm just like, you know what, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I'll just let him have the candy </garnt>
<joey> and just let him realize that- </joey>
<garnt> - Nah. - Sometimes you do it, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you do it on the same day. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, we would have a conversation in the afternoon, </garnt>
<connor> and then as we're having drinks that night, </connor>
<connor> you'd be like, now that I think about it, </connor>
<joey> I might've been talking out of my ass. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'll totally realize later, well, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, yeah, I was actually completely in the wrong </joey>
<joey> in that point but you know. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm glad that I said it with confidence at least. </connor>
<joey> - I mean look, the bottom line is, </joey>
<joey> don't take what we say all that seriously all right? </joey>
<garnt> Take it with a grain of salt, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> - This is three boys just having a fucking laugh. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I, (laughs), god. </connor>
<garnt> - We're not like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> we're not like an authority or anything like that. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I see a lot of people who comment being like, </connor>
<connor> "I can't believe they misquoted something </connor>
<connor> or I can't believe they've spread misinformation." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, no, this is just three boys having </connor>
<garnt> a conversation that we would have off camera. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - This is exactly how we talk off camera, </connor>
<connor> and I'm sure you have conversations </connor>
<joey> with your friends all the time </joey>
<joey> where you've short absolute shit out of your ass, </joey>
<joey> right? - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - So if we say anything that's incorrect, </joey>
<connor> if I'm actually confident about it, </connor>
<connor> don't take that (laughs). (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like the- </connor>
<joey> - In other words, don't ever take us seriously. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, if I'm talking about something </connor>
<garnt> that I am clearly like, knowledgeable about, </garnt>
<garnt> like if I'm talking about voice acting and I say, </garnt>
<garnt> well I know my shit right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay fine, you can take my opinion </garnt>
<garnt> on it seriously. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But, just like take what we say with a grain of salt. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes, we don't know what we're talking about, </connor>
<joey> and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, </joey>
<joey> because a lot of people don't know </joey>
<connor> what the fuck they're talking about, </connor>
<connor> and how we learn, is how we sometimes, </connor>
<joey> you say stupid, stupid shit. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, all the time. - And then we find out </joey>
<garnt> we're wrong about it. - And luckily we have, </garnt>
<connor> you know, you guys to very nicely remind us in the comments </connor>
<joey> how wrong we are. - I don't give a fuck man. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> I know that it's not something that we've tailor, </connor>
<connor> you know, really sat there and thought, </connor>
<joey> oh, is that the correct thing to say? </joey>
<joey> Wait, have we done enough research? </joey>
<joey> - Hold on guys, let me check Wikipedia </joey>
<joey> real quick. - I'm talking out </joey>
<joey> of my ass and sometimes I'll say shit </joey>
<connor> that is just like completely wrong, and that's okay, </connor>
<joey> because it's. - And we know </joey>
<joey> that its hilarious. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I just wanna preface that, if we do say something, </connor>
<garnt> sure you can believe us, but you should probably (laughs), </garnt>
<garnt> you know, if you really wanna take our word for it, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe check on your own as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't like quote us on any thesis or anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because this is not the type </garnt>
<garnt> of show. - I mean half the episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> we have alcohol, you know what I mean, it's probably. </garnt>
<connor> - That says a lot. </connor>
<connor> - Would you trust an opinion of someone </connor>
<connor> in a bar being like, "No, no, no, </connor>
<connor> the engineering is structurally sound." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Sips the cocktail, </connor>
<garnt> yeah, it's great, you know. (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why we have guests on who can actually know, </garnt>
<connor> have like, are knowledgeable in situations where we are </connor>
<connor> and where we're not just like talking out of our ass </connor>
<joey> and we would, we would just like- </joey>
<joey> - Put us in our place. - Yeah, </joey>
<garnt> put us in our place basically. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, normally when we're talking off camera, </connor>
<connor> we might pull out our phone and be like, </connor>
<connor> "No Connor, you're actually wrong." </connor>
<joey> And then I'll double down and be like, </joey>
<joey> "No, I don't trust that." - Yeah, I don't care. </joey>
<connor> I don't care what Wikipedia has to say. </connor>
<joey> I think I'm right, therefore I am. </joey>
<connor> - Facts and opinions, </connor>
<connor> facts and logic, sorry. - I know some people hate </connor>
<connor> that like I'll be like, "No, fuck you anyway." </connor>
<joey> But I (laughs)- </joey>
<joey> - I find it fucking hilarious because- </joey>
<joey> - I just, at the end of the day, as much of it, </joey>
<joey> it's a dichotomy, right, 'cause this is a show, </joey>
<joey> but at the same time, it's like, to us, </joey>
<connor> it's kind of not a show, it's like we just talk, right? </connor>
<connor> But we are putting on a show, but we talk like this, </connor>
<connor> the exact same way off show. - I don't know, </connor>
<garnt> I don't feel like we act any differently off camera. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no, yeah. - No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> We just have a microphone in our face, </garnt>
<connor> that's the only difference, right? </connor>
<connor> And cameras on us. </connor>
<connor> - I care about my angle, okay, no. </connor>
<connor> - No, sometimes I purposely lead Connor on </connor>
<connor> with the shit that he's saying, </connor>
<connor> because it's like weirdly heartwarming, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of the same feeling as like, </connor>
<connor> me being a dad and my five-year-old, you know, </connor>
<connor> trying to convince me that Santa Claus is real, you know? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) All right, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Oh, he comes down the chimney, does he? </joey>
<connor> - I'm more than happy to waste my energy in shouting </connor>
<connor> at you and telling you. - Oh, he comes down </connor>
<connor> the chimney, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> Cookies and milk? Okay, okay. (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> I see, I see. Tell me more, please. </connor>
<connor> - Man, you're leading me on. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but what the fuck were we talking about? </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah, people we'd like to meet. </connor>
<joey> - [In Unison] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - What about, what about other stuff that we do? </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) - Why, what do you mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - We did have a topic in mind. - Well, we did have a topic </garnt>
<connor> in mind before we moved on to this. </connor>
<connor> - Ah, really. - And we just wanna </connor>
<connor> break into it, 'cause we're getting close to the hour mark, </connor>
<joey> right? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - And we discussed beforehand that, </joey>
<joey> because we have the Lost Episode, </joey>
<joey> which is probably gonna go down in history </joey>
<joey> as some kind of fabled legend of- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, people will be like, "Whoa, what's that-" </joey>
<joey> - It's actually a shame 'cause I thought it was genuinely </joey>
<joey> a fucking great episode. - It was a great episode. </joey>
<garnt> - So, I'm sure we've mentioned on other episode, </garnt>
<garnt> we recorded an episode, and for some reason the audio </garnt>
<garnt> stopped recording 10 minutes in, so, </garnt>
<connor> completely unusable and we refused to use the camera audio. </connor>
<garnt> It sounds like shit. - It sounded like dog shit, </garnt>
<connor> and I'm just like, I don't even wanna make it, </connor>
<garnt> this a patron exclusive. - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> we now have a system in place where the audio is fine, </garnt>
<garnt> so that'd not happen, but we spoke about fandoms </garnt>
<garnt> that we are, aren't too fond of. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And I know this is gonna be a like, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's like, everyone's getting there, </garnt>
<garnt> which, what am I a fandom of. </garnt>
<garnt> Not like that, not just openly shitting on fandoms, </garnt>
<garnt> although there was some of that. </garnt>
<connor> - Although we are gonna. - Yeah, we are going to, </connor>
<joey> we are going to. </joey>
<garnt> - I like how we made the previous segment </garnt>
<garnt> like perfectly, perfectly segue into this segment, </garnt>
<garnt> where we're just gonna shit on everything, and- </garnt>
<joey> - So, what are we gonna talk about </joey>
<garnt> after talking about the people we love? </garnt>
<joey> Oh yeah, the people we fucking hate. </joey>
<connor> - Listen, I know that fandoms in general are not represented </connor>
<connor> by the minority annoyance that is in the forefront. </connor>
<connor> - Yes of course. - It is, </connor>
<garnt> it is the vocal - But. </garnt>
<garnt> - Minority that are probably what we are talking about. </garnt>
<connor> - This is just us joshing around and chatting shit. </connor>
<joey> - This is what we see, right? </joey>
<connor> This is just what we see. - So Dragon Ball fans. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Don't get offended, okay. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> We're not (laughs). </connor>
<connor> - Go on, well. - If you like Dragon Ball, </connor>
<joey> you are the worst. - You are the. </joey>
<garnt> - What are you doing? Why are you a Dragon- </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey imitates spitting) (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - As a Monkeybrain, I should be a giant fan of. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Okay no, okay I'll start with, Dragon Ball fandom scares </connor>
<garnt> me the most out of any fandom. - No, because. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe it's 'cause I understand the JoJo fandom </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm in the, you know, </garnt>
<connor> behind the scenes. - Which is, </connor>
<garnt> we'll get to the JoJo fandom. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, we'll get </connor>
<garnt> to the JoJo fandom. - We'll get to that, </garnt>
<garnt> we'll get to that right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm sure everyone's gonna be thinking </garnt>
<garnt> that immediately, but like, the Dragon Ball Fandom, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, I feel like it's so separate </garnt>
<garnt> from every other anime fandom. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whereas JoJo fans normally watch a bit of anime, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah okay, they're a bit annoying and what not and whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> But Dragon Ball fans, I feel like a ton </garnt>
<garnt> of them only watch Dragon Ball. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean seasonal anime? </connor>
<joey> There was no Dragon Ball in that season, </joey>
<connor> I don't give a fuck. - Do you mean seasonal </connor>
<connor> new season of Dragon Ball? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah (laughs). </connor>
<joey> - Reruns of Dragon Ball Z? </joey>
<joey> - Like, okay, I mean this is just like, outside looking in, </joey>
<joey> so I'm sure we're chatting out our ass half the time, </joey>
<connor> but like, my God, are they aggressive online about like, </connor>
<connor> and also the YouTube scene scares me so much. </connor>
<joey> - The Dragon Ball YouTubers are- </joey>
<connor> - I just (laughs), I'm sorry I spat. </connor>
<connor> I just had a flash-back to that thumbnail. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - You have to explain that. - Do you wanna </garnt>
<connor> explain that thumbnail? - You have to explain that. </connor>
<connor> - So I was on Twitter- </connor>
<garnt> - Peak content on YouTube. - Oh my God! </garnt>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure it's like parody, </connor>
<garnt> and if it's not, it's parody. - Yeah, I hope, I hope it is. </garnt>
<connor> - Like if, no matter what, it's parody 'cause I either laugh </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it is parody or I laugh 'cause it's not parody. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I follow like Justin Wang on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> and he's the guy that talks about like internet law </garnt>
<garnt> and he retweets the most fucking cursed shit. </garnt>
<connor> And so it was just a thumbnail </connor>
<connor> and it was like, "What would happen?" </connor>
<connor> It was like, "What if Vegeta got coronavirus, </connor>
<connor> was tested coronavirus positive?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "This can't be real." </connor>
<connor> Like, it was just a thumbnail, so I searched it, </connor>
<connor> and it was a two-part series of, </connor>
<connor> what if Vegeta got the coronavirus? </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "what, what is this?" </joey>
<joey> - What was the other part? </joey>
<connor> - It was part two, just part two, I didn't wanna watch it, </connor>
<connor> but there was another one where it was like, </connor>
<connor> "What if Goku tested HIV positive?" </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, (laughs) what is Dragon Ball YouTube? </connor>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> I only watched the first five minutes </connor>
<connor> and I was pretty sure it was parody, </connor>
<joey> I couldn't tell, but it was very, like, dry delivery. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I need to watch the rest of it, that probably get a nice- </garnt>
<joey> - Nice, bring some views. - I need to watch that video. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause the thing about the Dragon Ball fandom </garnt>
<garnt> is that it feels like the Dragon Ball fandom, </garnt>
<connor> I mean, you can be obviously a Dragon Ball fan </connor>
<connor> and an anime fan, but I feel like there are just as many </connor>
<connor> Dragon Ball fans who are just Dragon Ball fans, right? </connor>
<connor> And they like watch nothing else but Dragon Ball. </connor>
<garnt> It's kind of like being like, just like an MCU fan, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughs) - You call yourself </garnt>
<connor> like a comics fan. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird 'cause like the Dragon Ball videos, </connor>
<connor> like I'm just going based off like what I've seen </connor>
<connor> on YouTube, just pure anecdotal stuff. </connor>
<connor> Those Dragon Ball videos come out as often if not more often </connor>
<connor> than most anime YouTuber videos, </connor>
<connor> and get more views or the same views. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And so that must mean, </connor>
<connor> right, that like, again this is just me like, </connor>
<connor> fucking like, aliens, like you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, surely the fandom is fucking gigantic. </connor>
<joey> - It has to be. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And like, I don't know man- </connor>
<joey> - Or it's like a really small group </joey>
<joey> of super dedicated people who are like, </joey>
<joey> "I need to watch this for the 20th time." </joey>
<connor> - And people are so into it man, </connor>
<connor> like I don't understand the videos that are like, </connor>
<connor> "What if Vegeta fought a fucking Luffy?" </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What is that? Who gives a shit?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that's going from like Dragon Ball fan </garnt>
<connor> to like Shonen fandom as a whole, </connor>
<garnt> which also exists in this like, it's own little bubble, </garnt>
<joey> I feel. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> But I don't understand that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's not just Shonen fandom, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's Shonen action fandom. </connor>
<connor> It's not like the Shonen romance fandom </connor>
<connor> or the Shonen harem fandom, 'cause there's like lots </connor>
<connor> of different types of Shonen, right? </connor>
<connor> It's specifically Shonen, like power fantasy battle harem. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean, like the whole fandom, right? </connor>
<connor> Like that's all, it's the Naruto's, </connor>
<connor> it's the Bleach, it's the One Piece. </connor>
<connor> Although, I feel One Piece is kind of separate from </connor>
<connor> everything else. - Yeah, One Piece </connor>
<connor> is on its own. - It's like, </connor>
<connor> One Piece is separate, Dragon Ball is separate, </connor>
<connor> and then, Naruto and Bleach are separate. </connor>
<joey> And then you have like, just like the general like, </joey>
<joey> oh, and then the Seven Deadly Sins fanbase </joey>
<joey> is separate as well. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - This video is sponsored by Mack Weldon. </garnt>
<connor> Mack Weldon is better than whatever </connor>
<connor> you're wearing right now. </connor>
<connor> - For example, Garnt is wearing Mack Weldon right now, </connor>
<connor> are the fabrics premium Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - They are the most premium-este fabrics </garnt>
<connor> I've ever. - Thank you so much Garnt, </connor>
<garnt> I appreciate that. </garnt>
<connor> Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics </connor>
<connor> and simple shopping, I have to say, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I ordered the stuff myself. </connor>
<connor> It was pretty simple to use. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Mack Weldon will be the most comfortable underwear, </joey>
<joey> socks, shirts, under shirts, hoodies and sweatpants, </joey>
<joey> and more that you will ever wear. </joey>
<connor> - They have a line of Silver underwear and shirts </connor>
<connor> that are naturally anti-microbial, </connor>
<connor> which means that they eliminate odor. </connor>
<garnt> - They want you to be comfortable, </garnt>
<garnt> so if you don't like your first pair of underwear, </garnt>
<garnt> you can keep it, and they will still refund you. </garnt>
<garnt> No questions asked, you can keep your smelly underwear. </garnt>
<joey> Not only does Mack Weldon's underwear, socks, </joey>
<joey> and shirts look good, they perform well too. </joey>
<joey> It's good for working out, going to work, </joey>
<joey> going out on dates, just everyday life. </joey>
<connor> - I did work out in the shorts at the gym, can confirm. </connor>
<joey> - I did go out with this beautiful Mack Weldon beanie, </joey>
<joey> and it was very comfortable and wholesome. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] The folks at Mack Weldon have even created </connor>
<connor> their own, totally free loyalty program called Weldon Blue. </connor>
<connor> Level one gets you free shipping, for life. </connor>
<connor> And once you reach level two by spending $200, Mack Weldon </connor>

<joey> - That is a bargain if I've ever heard it, </joey>
<joey> thank you Mack Weldon. </joey>
<connor> - I personally got the silver underwear, </connor>
<connor> and as you guys know, I embarrass myself all the time </connor>
<connor> on my own channel, showing off my boxers </connor>
<connor> in my cosplay videos, and you bet </connor>
<connor> your ass you'll be seeing them soon. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I actually got something a little bit different. </joey>
<connor> I got the beanie, but I also got the </connor>
<connor> Mack Weldon face mask as well. - Yeah, dude, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is perfect for this time- </connor>
<connor> - I didn't think to get the mask, but I'm kind of jealous. </connor>
<joey> - These are actually really comfortable on my face as well. </joey>

<garnt> I repeated myself there. </garnt>
<connor> - Did he say 20%, Joey? I think he said 20% right? </connor>
<connor> - That is a lot of percent. </connor>
<connor> - Damn that's a steal! </connor>
<joey> - Thank you to Mack Weldon for sponsoring today's episode, </joey>
<joey> now back to the video. </joey>
<connor> - Before we get into this, I need a fucking. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, let's whip out the old boys. </joey>
<joey> This conversation requires alcohol. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - You brought up Seven Deadly Sins, </connor>
<connor> I do wanna talk a lot about that later. </connor>
<connor> We'll get into, we'll get into the Seven Deadly Sins. </connor>
<connor> - We're just gonna go through all the fucking Shonens, </connor>
<connor> aren't we? (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Right, Dragon Ball Twitter is the fucking, </connor>
<connor> every time I see a shitty take- </connor>
<connor> - Starting off strong. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you just see the dumbest fucking take, </connor>
<connor> it's always from a fucking Dragon Ball amateur. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Or like someone who like, </connor>
<connor> just tweets about Dragon Ball. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I remember seeing like so many shitty takes, </garnt>
<garnt> like I remember seeing this one tweet that was like talking </garnt>
<connor> about how Vegeta was like the greatest antihero ever written </connor>
<connor> in anime or something like that. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And there was like, the comment thread </connor>
<joey> was like more hilarious than the take itself, </joey>
<connor> and I think my favorite meme was just like, </connor>
<joey> Goku going Super Saiyan, and he was just like, </joey>
<joey> at the top text was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Don't fuck with Dragon Ball fans." </garnt>
<garnt> And the bottom text was, "We only know one anime." </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's true though, what is it about? </connor>
<connor> What is it about Dragon Ball fans </connor>
<connor> that only watch Dragon Ball? </connor>
<connor> Like everything they consume, it's like, </connor>
<joey> you know they're a Dragon Ball fan when they're like, </joey>
<joey> "ah, but GG wasn't that bad. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) Was it, like?" </connor>
<connor> - Did you see the tweet that was like, </connor>
<connor> "You know Goku didn't protest." </connor>
<connor> And it's like. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Are you serious? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like, "Vegeta didn't protest. </connor>
<connor> They just got it done." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh my god, read the room, man. </connor>
<garnt> Read the room. - Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was so funny, the replies were like, "bro, it's anime." </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> Like they're fucking delusional, man. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god, what is it? </joey>
<joey> I've always wanted to know, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I don't personally know anyone who's in that fandom, </joey>
<connor> but I've always been interested </connor>
<joey> in meeting someone IRL who's in that fandom, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I just have so many- </joey>
<joey> - No, no, you'll know, 'cause they're the fucking loudest </joey>
<joey> ones at their conventions. - Yeah, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - They're the ones in the corner, </joey>
<connor> playing like fucking. - Fucking charging up. </connor>
<joey> Trying to be Super Saiyan. </joey>
<connor> - If you ever hear someone go </connor>
<connor> (Connor shouts) (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> you know who they are. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, I've always just wanted </connor>
<joey> to ask them being like, why? </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Why, no, it's like that meme of the fucking, </connor>
<connor> the woman in the car, it's like, "Why are you like this?" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, why are you like this? (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like what like, who conditioned you to be like, </joey>
<joey> there's so much good anime out there, I'm aware. </joey>
<joey> Yes One Piece, I am aware of that show. </joey>
<joey> Naruto, Bleach, I'm aware of all of these. </joey>
<joey> No, Goku is my bae. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> and I will only follow his story. </joey>
<garnt> - It's so weird right, 'cause it's like, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> what I see in the Shonen fandom </garnt>
<garnt> is like everything is like a dick measuring contest. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like you got a fucking sim for your fucking characters </garnt>
<garnt> and you're gonna, you're gonna defend them no matter what. </garnt>
<joey> Like it's (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - Like what? I don't understand. </joey>
<joey> Like, I guarantee, compared to like some </joey>
<joey> of these Dragon Ball fans, like dude, </joey>
<connor> I don't even think Toriyama is as big of a Dragon Ball fan </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) as fucking Dragon Ball fans. </connor>
<connor> You know, at least Toriyama was like, </connor>
<connor> "I mean I like Dragon Ball but like, </connor>
<connor> I like Dragon Quest as well you know, </connor>
<connor> like, I've got all these other things." </connor>
<connor> Meanwhile, Dragon Ball fans are like, </connor>
<joey> "Toriyama, god, I love you. </joey>
<joey> Do more Dragon Ball please." </joey>
<connor> - Too fair, that's classic me with JoJo. </connor>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> Do more, do more of that. - Yeah, but at least </joey>
<joey> Araki's only done JoJo. - True, and </joey>
<joey> I'm not shouting about it all the time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah of course. - I'm just like secretly </joey>
<connor> thinking about it. - Are you sure about that? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) - Not all the time, </garnt>
<garnt> not all the time. - Are sure about that? </garnt>
<connor> - Gentlemen, it's not </connor>
<connor> all the time. - Are you sure about that? </connor>
<connor> So when Connor. - We'll get into that, </connor>
<connor> we'll get into that. - Okay, we'll get into that. </connor>
<connor> We'll get into that. - We'll get into JoJo </connor>
<connor> when I'm willing to talk about that. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I got some shit to say, but no. </connor>
<garnt> Like sticking with the Dragon Ball and Shonen fandom, </garnt>
<garnt> to me it feels like the fucking ghetto right? </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Because. - Ghetto of the anime fans. </garnt>
<joey> - Ghetto of the anime fans. - Because like, they're like, </joey>
<joey> it feels like they're constantly having gang wars </joey>
<connor> with each other and you're just sitting here, </connor>
<connor> watching this like, take place </connor>
<connor> on Twitter. - You're like </connor>
<connor> the suburban white couple. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, I don't. - You're like </connor>
<garnt> the suburban white couple going into the ghetto, </garnt>
<garnt> that are just like, "You don't belong here, do you?" </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just watching this feud go on on Twitter being like, </garnt>
<joey> (table thumps) </joey>
<garnt> "Liverwood beat, Leaf would beat fucking Goku in a fight," </garnt>
<garnt> or something like this shit. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, well, One Piece fans are like, </joey>
<joey> "Cool, I guess, like I don't fucking care." </joey>
<connor> Like what? Why? </connor>
<connor> Why do you care? Why does? </connor>
<connor> Why does the Dragon Ball fanbase want </connor>
<connor> to give Goku like this amazing KD ratio? </connor>
<connor> Like other anime fans. (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I just had this amazing flashback. </joey>
<joey> You remember the time when One Punch Man came out? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like for some fucking reason, there were so many videos </joey>
<joey> of like, "Who will win, Goku </joey>
<joey> or Saitama?" - Or Saitama, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god! - And like, </joey>
<joey> if you dare say an opinion, it's like, </joey>
<connor> get ready to get fucking destroyed by either fandom. </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, what was even worse than that was, </garnt>
<garnt> do you remember when like Death Battle </garnt>
<connor> did Goku versus Superman? </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god! - And that got so toxic, </connor>
<garnt> that they had to redo it, to give the same results! </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) (Connor clapping) </connor>
<connor> - Imagine being, like caring that much </connor>
<connor> about some fictional fan fight. </connor>
<connor> Like, this is literally like four writers in a room </connor>
<connor> who are like, "I think Goku would win." </connor>
<connor> And people are like, "I can't believe it. </connor>
<connor> I can't make sense of this, my day is ruined." </connor>
<connor> - Do they even watch the show? </connor>
<connor> - You would know if you saw the size of Goku's nipples </connor>
<connor> that there is no way he would lose in a fight. </connor>
<connor> It's not possible. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like it's insane, it's actually insane. </connor>
<connor> Like, and I don't understand because I've never cared </connor>
<connor> that much about something in my life, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I have been in like university, </connor>
<connor> I've had my YouTube channel completely demonetized, </connor>
<connor> that's all my income, and I cared less about that. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I cared a lot, I obviously didn't wanna go broke. </connor>
<joey> - What's one thing though that the Dragon Ball fanbase that, </joey>
<joey> like I'm pretty sure, I'm quite correct on. </joey>
<joey> And just shocks me, is that I guaran-fucking-tee, </joey>
<joey> that 99% of the like, hardcore Dragon Ball fans </joey>
<joey> probably didn't even watch the first Dragon Ball. </joey>
<joey> They started from zero. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a controversial take, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guarantee. - That's an assumption Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - It's an assumption, but I'm willing to bet on it. </joey>
<garnt> - Every Dragon Ball fan is now gonna come up and be like, </garnt>
<connor> oh, excuse me, I watched. - Yeah, they've watched it. </connor>
<connor> You've given them fuel now Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean if you have, good on you but- </connor>
<joey> - It is, it is- </joey>
<connor> - I'm gonna say something that has completely no basis, </connor>
<connor> whatsoever. - Okay. Go on. </connor>
<connor> - I think the Dragon Ball fans are one bad day away </connor>
<connor> from being furries, there, I said it. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) Okay, there, I said it, okay. </connor>
<connor> I think they are, I think they act in the same way </connor>
<connor> that furries do in sometimes, there. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, isn't Goku a monk? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - As somebody, </connor>
<connor> as somebody who was a very angry child, </connor>
<connor> I know exactly where that anger's coming from. </connor>
<connor> I know where it's coming from. (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - But that's a jump into the pit. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just saying man, that (laughs), </connor>
<garnt> they're one bad forum click away, man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all (laughs). (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - They're one bad YouTube recommendation away </garnt>
<garnt> from like falling down in that rabbit hole. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're gonna get fucking destroyed in this episode. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh my god! </garnt>
<garnt> - Good thing we're fucking drunk. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) - Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, but what do you mean Garnt? </connor>
<connor> I had like four sips, what do you- </connor>
<garnt> - Just take some sips, just take some sips. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's gonna get worse, the more like, the more we drink. </garnt>
<connor> - I think that my parents didn't love me </connor>
<connor> as much as the fans love Goku. </connor>
<connor> I'll be honest, all right. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know what that says about my parents, but. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, your parents loved you fine, I'm sure. </connor>
<joey> - My parents would not defend me on a comment section. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. - Very aggressively. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - They'd be like, "This on you, Connor." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I just imagine now like, what if Goku was an actual person </joey>
<connor> and he just saw all the comments? </connor>
<joey> - What if Goku, has Goku committed war crimes? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Do we know if Goku's done that? </joey>
<joey> Would they defend Goku? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, we know what would happen if he was HIV positive, </joey>
<connor> right, but we don't know. (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> But we don't know what would happen. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's great that Goku is advocating </connor>
<connor> for HIV awareness. (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I think that's great, you know. </connor>
<connor> More power to him, you know, I don't know </connor>
<connor> if that's in the agenda- </connor>
<joey> - I have to start a parody series now, </joey>
<joey> where I just go through every show and then protagonist </joey>
<connor> and just go into hypothetical situations </connor>
<connor> of if they were HIV positive. - What if Saitoma had (laughs) </connor>
<connor> syphilis? (laughs) (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Would Saitoma be able to punch syphilis? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, would he be able to punch the syphilis off his dick? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I mean okay, I love to clout on Dragon Ball fans, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they are like the brick wall of opinions. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - It's like it doesn't matter </joey>
<connor> what you say, it's just like- </connor>
<joey> - We can't take you seriously. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean it's because most of the time, </garnt>
<joey> they're arguing a point that can't be proved anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - It's all like situational, </joey>
<joey> because who cares about power levels? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you can't really argue about power levels, </joey>
<joey> unless you watch Death Battle, you know? </joey>
<joey> And people still disagree with that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, even then, it's like, if there's no basis. </joey>
<joey> - Even if you put science into it, </joey>
<joey> people are gonna like, rep the shit no matter what, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It's like a fucking religion, you know- </connor>
<joey> - It is a religion. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I know. - It's like a cult, </connor>
<connor> It's a cult. </connor>
<connor> - It's the cult of Dragon Ball, that's exactly </connor>
<garnt> what it feels like. - Dragon Ball fans </garnt>
<connor> watching this be like, "Shit." (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh shit, they're onto us. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just a level of excitement that I've never felt for, </connor>
<connor> or like passion that I've never felt for anything. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if that means that I'm lacking in something </connor>
<connor> in my life, but then I see how passionate they are, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I'm kind of glad that I have hobbies. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Other than Dragon Ball. </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm glad I have other things that I can like </joey>
<connor> put my time and energy. - It can be like, </connor>
<joey> go read gay porn, Connor, like. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I- </connor>
<garnt> - How many burns can we get on like one episode? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Like don't get me wrong, like I'm sure all three of us, </joey>
<connor> love Dragon Ball right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like we grew up with that shit, </connor>
<connor> of course it's fucking epic, </connor>
<connor> but we like other things. - Oh wait no, </connor>
<joey> I never grew up on it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh you didn't? </joey>
<joey> - No, because I was always so fucking confused </joey>
<joey> at what was happening. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, how were you confused? </joey>
<garnt> What was confusing about it? - When I was a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> I would watch a fight. </garnt>
<joey> And then the next episode was them like talking </joey>
<joey> before the fight. - Yeah, we talked about it </joey>
<joey> in a previous episode. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It was like, </joey>
<connor> it was completely out of order so I was like, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna watch. - That's fair, that's fair. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But I mean like, </connor>
<garnt> but I mean, you know, it is a very inoffensive </garnt>
<garnt> show right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. - Because it's hard </garnt>
<connor> to hate Dragon Ball. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - I feel. - Okay, like okay. </joey>
<joey> - I love the charm of Dragon Ball. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I love the mainstream, </joey>
<connor> like everyone knows Dragon Ball. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And, dude, </connor>
<connor> when you're listening to a rap song, </connor>
<connor> and you hear like a Dragon Ball reference as an anime fan, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "What?" - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - He's Akrillon. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I don't even know who that is, but that's cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because what I don't understand is like, </garnt>
<garnt> how Dragon Ball is still, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> as loved as it is because, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - It's got such as huge pop and like mainstream </connor>
<garnt> referencing power. - Yeah, because </garnt>
<garnt> I love Dragon Ball Z, but my god, </garnt>
<connor> I could not watch Dragon Ball Z today. </connor>
<connor> - No. - No, no. </connor>
<joey> - No way. - It has not aged well </joey>
<connor> at all in terms like the pacing and everything. </connor>
<joey> And I remembered like trying </joey>
<joey> to watch the newest Dragon Balls </joey>
<connor> and I can't even remember the fucking name. </connor>
<connor> What's the new Dragon Ball? </connor>
<connor> - Super? - Dragon Ball Super, </connor>
<connor> that was it. </connor>
<connor> And I remember trying to watch like Inako too, </connor>
<garnt> and it was just exactly the same as Dragon Ball Z. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like slightly faster paced- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, just cleaner line-up right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But like my god, like I don't know how this, </garnt>
<garnt> how there are still so many passionate fans, </garnt>
<connor> whereas like Naruto fans, they saw Boruto, </connor>
<joey> and were like, "Fuck that shit, Boruto fucking sucks." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Whereas Dragon Ball fans are here </joey>
<joey> repping Dragon Ball Super, where </joey>
<joey> I think it's an okay show you know? </joey>
<joey> And that's- - You're gonna get flamed </joey>
<joey> for that one dude. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> How dare he just said it was okay. </joey>
<connor> - It was okay, it was- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like Dragon Ball is a fandom </connor>
<connor> that is just like, where the creators are just like, </connor>
<connor> "I guess just give them the same thing again? </connor>
<connor> "Slightly different, Goku has blue hair now." </connor>
<connor> Is that correct? Am I saying- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, he can go Super Saiyan black now as well. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, is that the clip where they say, </connor>
<garnt> "Don't shoot, he's black?" - I'm sorry, </garnt>
<joey> he's the strongest. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - In the universe now, how can we up that up? </joey>
<garnt> Multi-verse. - Yeah multi-verse, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Let's have a tournament arc, but we get the lord </joey>
<joey> of each universe to fight, and then they become, </joey>
<connor> I'm pretty sure that's, </connor>
<joey> if I'm wrong, I'm sorry. - Like, I get it. </joey>
<joey> It sounds really fucking cool on paper. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, it's the reason why I think God of High School </joey>
<connor> is kind of mad, it's like it's all just like, </connor>
<joey> a dick-measuring contest, like you said. </joey>
<joey> And after a certain point you're like, </joey>
<joey> damn, Rent-A-Girlfriend's story is kind of good though. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like you know what I mean like, </joey>
<garnt> you kind of just need something more. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. - It needs more Waifu's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not even Waifu's, just some substance. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure the fans would argue it does, </garnt>
<garnt> but for me, it just doesn't, and I'm sorry Dragon Ball fans </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm openly shitting on you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what you're into, I get it dude, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm into some weird shit. - You're not sorry. </garnt>
<connor> - I like, he's not sorry. </connor>
<connor> I like Dragon Ball as you kid. - You can shit on my stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Dragon Ball wasn't my fucking childhood, </connor>
<connor> but growing up, I still hold it close to my heart, </connor>
<connor> but I can't watch that shit, you know. </connor>
<garnt> I don't have the patience to go through </garnt>
<garnt> what I did as a kid, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - But that's what I find interesting, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that like, this kind of super, </joey>
<joey> super committed Dragon Ball fan base, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't exist in Japan. </joey>
<connor> There aren't people today who are like, </connor>
<connor> hyper committed to Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Super </connor>
<connor> or anything Dragon Ball related. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Now, here, than there are people like in America </connor>
<connor> and like overseas. - I hear you don't </connor>
<joey> see that much of it. - You don't. </joey>
<connor> - Like, it's normally, like they'll have a section for it. </connor>
<joey> - Like there are people, like Dragon Ball here, </joey>
<joey> at least in Japan now, is just kind of put </joey>
<connor> in the Hall of Fame of like, this is an anime that- </connor>
<connor> - Everyone knows. - Everyone knows. </connor>
<connor> - Everybody knows, it's like Naruto, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's like Naruto, Bleach, </connor>
<connor> Dragon Ball, they're all finished series. </connor>
<garnt> Their TV anime is finished, their manga is finished. </garnt>
<garnt> They're in the Hall of Fame, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If you like it, cool, you'll hear it in passing. </garnt>
<garnt> But it isn't like, I have committed my entire life </garnt>
<connor> to wondering if, what would happen if Goku was HIV positive? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> I need to know. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> You're not gonna get that here. </connor>
<connor> - I just realized the irony of me getting very defensive </connor>
<garnt> about the Baccano! dub and then me just shitting </garnt>
<garnt> on them, right? - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally two minutes later- </garnt>
<garnt> - Toxic (imitates spitting). </garnt>
<garnt> - I can get fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> if you like Dragon Ball. - Hypocrite, hypocrite. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hypocrite. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey, if you wanna defend it, that's fine. </garnt>
<connor> I just think it's funny to like (laughs) joke about shit. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> You can shit on one I like, it's totally fine. </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit. </connor>
<joey> - But like speaking, but like speaking </joey>
<joey> of super addicted fan bases, like I'm, </joey>
<connor> I used to think that way about the Naruto fan base. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right, because I was never in the Naruto fan base. </connor>
<connor> I never got into Naruto as much as other people did, </connor>
<connor> but as you said, the moment Boruto dropped, </connor>
<joey> the Naruto fans are like, "Naruto, me? </joey>
<garnt> "Naruto, no, no. What are you talking about?" </garnt>
<joey> - No, excuse me, I'm a Naruto fan, </joey>
<connor> I don't wanna watch fucking Boruto. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't want a Boruto video, but I watch a 50 minute video </garnt>
<garnt> on why Naruto's power scaling is the most </garnt>
<garnt> perfectly balanced thing in existence. </garnt>
<garnt> I see a lot of those videos pop up on my recommended </garnt>
<garnt> that are like, Naruto, what's his fucking, some character </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know like Madara, is that his name? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - That character. </garnt>
<connor> And it'd be like, I remember there was </connor>
<connor> like a 90-minute video on my recommended that was like, </connor>
<connor> "Why his power was the best." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "This is 90 minutes long?" </connor>
<connor> Dude, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> This is insane. - Yeah, they go through </connor>
<joey> every single scenario of Madara, </joey>
<connor> right? - And it's cool, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think it's great that like, </connor>
<connor> I imagine, I mean like, when I see a JoJo video </connor>
<connor> that's super in depth I'm like, "That's fucking sick." </connor>
<connor> But then I'm from the outside looking in, it's like, </connor>
<joey> "Whoa, that seems so excessive." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - But I guess </joey>
<connor> it's really fucking awesome if you're in the fandom. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but you can say that about any fandom, right? </joey>
<garnt> - What like, I don't understand is how, </garnt>
<connor> how a lot of the fandom still has like so much momentum- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's strange. - Even like, </connor>
<connor> after the series has ended, 'cause you normally think </connor>
<connor> of an anime series, after it ends, </connor>
<connor> there's like this cool-off period. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that does. - And then it kinda, like, </connor>
<connor> goes, into like memory and everything, </connor>
<connor> but with a lot. - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Of like the biggest Shonen titles, even if they've ended- </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, </connor>
<connor> it's really weird. - Yeah, like </connor>
<connor> I'm genuinely like curious how they've been able </connor>
<garnt> to maintain that momentum- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm jealous, I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> how do you keep coming up with this content? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughs) - Like I can't do that. </garnt>
<joey> - The Naruto YouTubers, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I admire it, man, like I mean, </joey>
<joey> the fact that you can still keep an audience going. </joey>
<joey> - It's honestly like admirable. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause most of the time they just talk about the show. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, 'cause. - Yeah, </garnt>
<connor> and like the audience that just does not lose that passion, </connor>
<connor> no matter how much time has passed, </connor>
<connor> no matter how many new series has come out, </connor>
<joey> they still are like will consume </joey>
<joey> all this stuff. - Yeah, it's insane. </joey>
<garnt> - Where there's like no new media coming out. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause the manga ended, like, what? </joey>
<joey> Like four, five years ago or something? </joey>
<garnt> It was a long time ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which one are we talking about, </garnt>
<garnt> Naruto? - Naruto. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - It was a while ago. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's funny because all of the Naruto videos </garnt>
<joey> I've seen are just on like the Naruto segment part. </joey>
<joey> Nobody's talking about Boruto. </joey>
<joey> - No one's talking about Boruto. </joey>
<connor> - No one gives a shit about Boruto. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I like those kinds of videos. </joey>
<connor> I think, okay going back to Dragon Ball, </connor>
<connor> I just had a fucking flashback. </connor>
<connor> I remember this one channel, I don't know what it's called. </connor>
<connor> And I'm sorry if you're watching this. </connor>
<connor> There was a guy who made fights </connor>
<connor> between Dragon Ball characters and his OC. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And this channel had like tons of videos, </connor>
<connor> and it had like 200 K subs I think. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "This is insane." </connor>
<connor> Like people, thousands of people are watching, </connor>
<connor> a dude's OC fight Dragon Ball characters. </connor>
<connor> And I couldn't. - Why is that so funny? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I can kind of, I can understand </connor>
<joey> why you might be interested in a death battle </joey>
<joey> between, I mean I think </joey>
<joey> it's cool. - Two known characters? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, that's cool, you wanna see the outcome? </garnt>
<garnt> You wanna? - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But, when it's someone's OC. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, my mind was blown. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, wait, people are into this? </garnt>
<connor> This is how desperate people are for Dragon Ball content. </connor>
<connor> And like- - That's so funny. </connor>
<connor> - I'll give the Naruto people props, </connor>
<connor> at least they have like, the majority </connor>
<connor> of the content that seems to be doing really well </connor>
<connor> is the content that is like, 50 minute analysis videos. </connor>
<garnt> Which is like, I'm sure you love that if you're into it. </garnt>
<connor> But, you know. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I find it, like what's more entertaining </connor>
<connor> than the content itself, for me, </connor>
<connor> is watching people react to the content. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God! - Because it's like, </connor>
<connor> okay so, I remember I did like an AniTube rewind </connor>
<joey> and people were like, asking me why </joey>
<joey> I put like Double4anime in the AniTube rewind- </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause he's the legend. </joey>
<joey> - Because, how are you not entertained </joey>
<joey> watching a shirtless dude scream his fucking ass off, </joey>
<joey> watching Goku versus Cigna? </joey>
<joey> What was it, like it was Naruto versus? </joey>
<joey> - Naruto versus Goku, I think. </joey>
<joey> - I think it was Naruto versus Ichigo maybe? </joey>
<joey> - Something like that. - Yeah, something like that, </joey>
<connor> it was Naruto versus Ichigo, and he was just shirtless, </connor>
<garnt> screaming his ass off- </garnt>
<joey> - He wasn't shirtless, he wasn't shirtless, </joey>
<garnt> he didn't have a shirt on, but he had this massive scarf on </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Without a shirt, I'm like, that's an interesting fashion </garnt>
<connor> statement. - Yeah, like. </connor>
<connor> - How is this not entertaining to you? </connor>
<connor> - I respect that man, that sounds like great content. </connor>
<connor> - It was fucking, 'cause I found out </connor>
<connor> about that video through the AniTube rewind and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I have to go watch this video." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) So I found it, </connor>
<garnt> and I watched the entire thing and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This was the best entertainment this entire week." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's so hilarious, just, he was screaming </garnt>
<connor> at the top of his voice, like a fucking 10-year-old girl. </connor>
<connor> And so excited by the fact that Naruto won. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like damn, I wish I could get that excited </garnt>
<connor> about a fucking death battle. </connor>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<garnt> That's so admirable. </garnt>
<joey> - I wish I could get that excited about anything. </joey>
<joey> - I know, right? </joey>
<connor> - Man, I feel like Naruto fans are just </connor>
<connor> like toned down Dragon Ball fans to some extent. </connor>
<connor> They're not near as bad. - I feel like, </connor>
<connor> in terms of like, passion and like the the cultness of it, </connor>
<connor> is what I'm gonna call I guess, </connor>
<connor> is like, Dragon Ball is definitely up there </connor>
<garnt> at the top of just passionate, dedicated fans. </garnt>
<joey> - I think every anime fanbase is just </joey>
<garnt> a toned-down version of the Dragon Ball fanbase. </garnt>
<connor> - I think Dragon Ball is by far the most aggressive </connor>
<garnt> and like- - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - This is what we want- </connor>
<garnt> - But it's funny because like, Dragon Ball is pretty much </garnt>
<connor> as close to a mainstream anime as you can get. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But there's a difference between people </connor>
<connor> who know Dragon Ball, and people who are anime fans, </connor>
<garnt> who also grew up with Dragon Ball, </garnt>
<garnt> and then just Dragon Ball fans. </garnt>
<joey> - And then people who are Dragon Ball. </joey>
<joey> - Like you know, 'cause there'll be </joey>
<joey> at the gym wearing some Goku shit or something. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah of course. (Connor laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yo, bench press me. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> The fucking Goku, Goku under-armor- </connor>
<joey> - I just realized the perfect analogy </joey>
<joey> for the dragon Dragon Ball fandom. </joey>
<joey> It's just, if tyler1 was a fandom. </joey>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Dammit, I love tyler1 though. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) (Joey yells) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so true though. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - I wouldn't be surprised if tyler1 is a Dragon Ball fan. </joey>
<connor> - He likes anime. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Tyler1, come on the podcast </joey>
<connor> and talk to us about anime. - Please come on with us. </connor>
<connor> Oh my god! </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We need the Monkeybrain here. </connor>
<joey> - But it's so interesting, I find, I guess the difference </joey>
<connor> between these massive Shonen fanbases, right? </connor>
<connor> Because even though, because for example, </connor>
<connor> you don't hear about the Bleach fanbase anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, on YouTube you see some of those- </connor>
<joey> - I don't know about that one. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I don't see it. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, the Bleach fans are like the kid in the corner </joey>
<connor> who you're worried might like, you know, </connor>
<connor> bring something sketchy into school. </connor>
<connor> It's like, did he bring a knife? </connor>
<joey> - I wanna see some Bankai's goddammit. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the Bleach fans, </joey>
<joey> the ones who sit in the back of the class </joey>
<joey> and they're like, they said they were gonna bring a knife </joey>
<joey> and you're like, should I be concerned </joey>
<joey> that he's gonna do it? - Yeah (laughs). </joey>
<connor> - Like that's the Bleach fans. </connor>
<joey> - Don't worry, it's a knife that I haven't Bonkai'd yet. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause when Bleach, like, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I liked Bleach up to like the, I think past the- </garnt>
<connor> - Aizen arc? - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> To like the Soul Society. - I don't know much </garnt>
<garnt> about Bleach, but I know the Soul Society arc is garbage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, no, no. - The Soul Society is </garnt>
<joey> the best. - The Soul Society is good. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, which one's the one that's a bad arc? </joey>
<joey> - Aizen arc, which is. - Okay, that's the one. </joey>
<joey> I hear about it all the time. - After the Soul Society arc. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, Bleach fans are also very passionate </garnt>
<joey> about their show, but I remember </joey>
<connor> when the new anime got announced, </connor>
<connor> and I mean, I liked Beach at the point </connor>
<connor> and then I kind of fell out of love with it. </connor>
<connor> But like when the new animate got announced, </connor>
<joey> I was like, "I don't know why, </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty fucking hyped man." </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I'm hyped for this. - Same, same. </garnt>
<joey> Honestly same. </joey>
<joey> - I guess 'cause it could be like that kind </joey>
<joey> of thing of like, all right, well I was like a teenager </joey>
<joey> when I enjoyed this, a young adult. </joey>
<connor> It's like, oh, I need to get that back. </connor>
<garnt> That excitement. </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - But, when that anime got announced, man, </garnt>
<garnt> all of the Bleach fandom, they'd been like holed up </garnt>
<garnt> and they suddenly, they all rose up together. </garnt>
<garnt> - Rise up, rise up. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - They all came out of their bunkers </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like, "Is it safe to leave? </garnt>
<garnt> Finally? Is the fallout over?" </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you go to like normies, and like, </joey>
<joey> you just have like normal people be like, </joey>
<connor> like taking off their shirts and like, </connor>
<connor> "Yes, I was a Bleach fan all along." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) "Yes." </connor>
<garnt> - I read all of it, I've seen all the anime. </garnt>
<joey> Join me and mosh. - They're all </joey>
<connor> like the Peter Parker Superman, where they're just like, </connor>
<joey> "Yes, I'm a Bleach fan." </joey>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> But like what other, 'cause like I'm thinking, right. </joey>
<connor> So there's the Dragon Ball fanbase, </connor>
<connor> which we've already established. </connor>
<connor> The Naruto fanbase, Bleach fanbase. </connor>
<connor> What other one would there be? </connor>
<connor> I mean, obviously the JoJo fans base. </connor>
<connor> - I think, another Shonen fandom that is like, </connor>
<joey> the little shit brother is the Seven Deadly Sins fandom. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They're like the little runt. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Dude, no one gives a shit about you." </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> "Stop fucking making noise." </connor>
<connor> (Joey claps) </connor>
<connor> Dude, it's a shame 'cause like, </connor>
<connor> I actually really enjoyed Seven Deadly Sins. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - I wasn't a fan, </connor>
<connor> I didn't give a shit about it, like, </connor>
<connor> I thought it was pretty like epic, turn your brain off, </connor>
<joey> monkeybrain, don't focus, entertainment. </joey>
<joey> Like it was that perfect, like Shonen white noise. </joey>
<connor> The way that I thought that the other Shonens </connor>
<connor> were a bit too boring. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - It's weird, </connor>
<garnt> because Seven Deadly Sins is the one Shonen </garnt>
<connor> that I really, really tried to get into. </connor>
<connor> - Really, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean like, I think Seven Deadly Sins has been the show </connor>
<connor> that I've tried to get into the most that I just couldn't. </connor>
<connor> I've given it four chances. </connor>
<connor> Four, and I still can't- </connor>
<connor> - What turned you off to it? </connor>
<connor> - Just the fact that there wasn't any like, </connor>
<connor> in season one at least, because I haven't gone </connor>
<connor> past season one, there wasn't any doubt </connor>
<connor> that the heroes were like. - Meliodas would win, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That like Meliodas or whoever was </connor>
<connor> on the heroes team would win. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, </connor>
<connor> that's true. - Because in season one, </connor>
<joey> the only threat to the main characters </joey>
<joey> are the main characters, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And, I don't know, like I get </joey>
<connor> that everyone is so ridiculously overpowered </connor>
<connor> and that's like kinda the charm of the series, </connor>
<connor> but I just couldn't get past that point </connor>
<connor> that I'm just like, "Man, why am I watching this fight </connor>
<garnt> when I know that there's not even like a hint of a threat." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - See, I didn't even get </joey>
<garnt> to that point, like I just look </garnt>
<garnt> at the Seven Deadly Sins fanbase and I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> I'm not putting my foot into that mine field man. </joey>
<connor> - I watched everything up until the new season, </connor>
<connor> episode one, then I was like, "No." </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not gonna lie. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then after that when you saw the fucking GIF, </garnt>
<garnt> like when you saw the fight between Meliodas </garnt>
<joey> and Escanor, and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Ooh, it feels bad to be a Seven Deadly Sins </joey>
<joey> fan, doesn't it." - I'm not gonna lie, when </joey>
<garnt> I saw the clip of that </garnt>
<garnt> on Twitter. - Oh my god, </garnt>
<connor> oh my god. - Where people were like, </connor>
<connor> "This has to be fan made." </connor>
<connor> - I fucking lost it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I lost it but I was also like, </joey>
<connor> "I kind of wanna watch it." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - If you don't know, Seven Deadly Sins, </connor>
<connor> super popular show and then they handed it off </connor>
<joey> to which studio was it, Da, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Dean, no, no. - It was Dean, I think it was. </joey>
<joey> - They handed off to Studio Dean, </joey>
<connor> and it ended up looking like this. </connor>
<garnt> This is one of the stills. </garnt>
<connor> I know you shouldn't judge the stills- </connor>
<connor> - I think we've talked about this </connor>
<garnt> on like the very first episode </garnt>
<connor> of the podcast. - No, no, we didn't. </connor>
<connor> It's from the lost episode. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. - Was it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was from the lost episode. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even remember, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I thought like, I think I mentioned something </joey>
<connor> about it must suck to be a Seven Deadly Sins fan. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) Because you just- </connor>
<connor> - It does. - At least, you know, </connor>
<connor> if you're Dragon Ball fan, you get good animation, right? </connor>
<connor> Like the Seven Deadly Sins anime, </connor>
<connor> we'll just play like one second of animation, here you go. </connor>
<connor> It looks fucking god-awful. </connor>
<connor> - You can go onto YouTube, there's tons of clips of just, </connor>
<connor> the entire Meliodas. - It's embarrassing, like. </connor>
<joey> - And Escanor fight is fucking hilarious. </joey>
<joey> - And when I first watched that episode </joey>
<joey> of like season three, I think it is, </joey>
<connor> I was like just please say psych. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, please say psych, like the whole 20 minutes was like, </connor>
<connor> "Please say psych." </connor>
<connor> Just be like, and now it's time for the real animation. </connor>
<joey> - JK, this was the animatic. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It was like "No, no!" </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I thought it was good enough right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man, the fans, I didn't realize how like out there </garnt>
<connor> they were online, like they are like hardcore about- </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't know how popular Seven Deadly Sins was. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh it's really fucking popular. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know how popular it was until like, </connor>
<connor> I kind, it was kind of the series that I thought </connor>
<joey> was just like, gonna fade into obscurity, </joey>
<joey> but then the more years passed, the more popular it got </joey>
<joey> and the more things I heard about it and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I didn't know where these fans were when the series </joey>
<garnt> started 'cause maybe I was just fucking blind." </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know it was this popular when it started. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Easily though, the worst part </connor>
<joey> of Seven Deadly Sins is the fucking main character, </joey>
<joey> Meliodas. - Yeah, really. </joey>
<joey> I've heard that. - I cannot fucking stand him. </joey>
<joey> - I've heard that the entire time. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause this whole character's thing is like, </joey>
<connor> "He he, I'm OP and also I-" </connor>
<connor> - I touch women. - I touch women </connor>
<connor> and that's charming, and it's like. </connor>
<connor> - Yikes. - And it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know who is this appealing to, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm watching this and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm over the age of 18." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I like, I don't understand who this is charming to. </connor>
<joey> - Well clearly to people who have never touched women </joey>
<joey> in their life right? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Just saying. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I'm sitting there and I'm literally just like, </connor>
<connor> "Am I losing my mind or am I the only one who hates this?" </connor>
<garnt> - No, because I remember when I first watched </garnt>
<garnt> Seven Deadly Sins, I actually made the tweet </garnt>
<garnt> where like, I remember watching the first episode </garnt>
<joey> and I remember thinking, "Man, what can we do </joey>
<joey> to give Meliodas like a quirky, like a quirky quirk." </joey>
<joey> Like the anime quirk. </joey>
<joey> "Let's just make him accidentally touch women's breasts." </joey>
<connor> - Make him a molester, molester. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, molester, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, you know, I'm like totally against </connor>
<connor> work culture and everything but I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> it's not enough for me to like turn me off the anime </connor>
<connor> or turn me off like the entire thing. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But at the same time, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Couldn't you have thought of, </connor>
<connor> couldn't we think of something better?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, again, like you said, I am not all for being like, </connor>
<connor> "You can't do that," I'm like, "I don't give a shit." </connor>
<connor> But, every time it happened on screen, </connor>
<connor> it was like when you've got a whiff </connor>
<garnt> of a really disgusting fart, you're like, "Oh, fuck!" </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> "God, really?" </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, "Who's that cat girl in fucking-" </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, in Fire Force right? - Fire Force, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Who's the cat girl? - The one </garnt>
<joey> that keeps getting naked? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And that's her entire quirk? </joey>
<connor> - Like I've never been so turned off by fan service </connor>
<connor> in my entire life until I watched Fire Force, man. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. - It's like, </joey>
<connor> it needs to be tasteful. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like as a full-blown degenerate, </connor>
<connor> Fire Force is the first time I've actually watched, </connor>
<connor> like, I've actually seen full on fan service </connor>
<connor> and been like, "Why does this need to be here?" </connor>
<connor> - This doesn't matter, get this outta here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Seriously, </connor>
<connor> right in front of my salad? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, you'd have this really cool looking fight, </connor>
<connor> and like, I'm invested in this fight, right? </connor>
<connor> And I love, I love that. - Just dropped out. </connor>
<joey> - I love my fucking fan service, </joey>
<joey> but just don't put it in front of my fights. </joey>
<joey> - Like did they expect to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay this fight scene's gonna go for 10 minutes, </joey>
<joey> but we know the audience isn't gonna pay attention. </joey>
<garnt> All right, it's been five minutes, </garnt>
<joey> quick, drop a titty, drop a titty right now." </joey>
<joey> - My problem with it is that you take a break </joey>
<garnt> from the fight to look at the fan service, right? </garnt>
<connor> And like, I hate that 'cause that disrupts the flow </connor>
<connor> of the fight, if the fan service was like separate </connor>
<connor> from the flights, like in something </connor>
<connor> like High School of the Dead, </connor>
<connor> where, something like High School of the Dead, </connor>
<connor> where like. - I don't know man. </connor>
<connor> - Fan service and fights are like, </connor>
<garnt> oh come on, you didn't like the fights </garnt>
<connor> in High School? - No, I love the fights. </connor>
<connor> I mean, there's iconic scenes </connor>
<garnt> in there. - Yeah, exactly, </garnt>
<garnt> where the fan service is just like a part of the fight. </garnt>
<garnt> That fucking great. - Yeah, </garnt>
<joey> High School of the Dead did it right </joey>
<joey> because it's like, we're gonna dedicate an entire episode </joey>
<connor> to just the raunchiest fucking fan service. </connor>
<connor> No action whatsoever, so you know what it's gonna be. </connor>
<garnt> And then we're gonna get right </garnt>
<joey> into the fight the next episode. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but if you like take a break from the fight </garnt>
<connor> to look at the fan service, it's just like </connor>
<connor> that eye-rolling moment where, </connor>
<connor> even if you fucking love fan service </connor>
<connor> and you have no fucking problem with it, </connor>
<connor> it still disrupts the fucking fight, so, </connor>
<connor> that's why I just couldn't get into like, </connor>
<joey> I mean, there's a lot of reasons </joey>
<joey> I couldn't get into Fire Force. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - That was one of the reasons. </joey>
<garnt> - But it's a shame, right, </garnt>
<garnt> because you know. - David Productions </garnt>
<connor> fucking killed it. - David Production did </connor>
<connor> such a good job on the animation, and like, </connor>
<garnt> the art design and the character designs are fucking cool, </garnt>
<garnt> you know? - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Massive Soul Eater you know. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm a massive Soul Eater fan as well. </garnt>
<joey> - As a massive Soul Eater fan all right? </joey>
<garnt> So I'm just like hell yeah, new Soul Eater basically </garnt>
<joey> in 2020 but with a lot of fire. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like Fire Force is one of those shows </garnt>
<garnt> where I've really, really wanted to fucking like, </garnt>
<garnt> but for some reason I just could not get into it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I'm same. - I got like four episodes </garnt>
<connor> in and I was like, I'm pretty </connor>
<garnt> okay. - Yeah, three </garnt>
<joey> or four episodes was my limit. - I think my problem </joey>
<joey> with it was I felt like a mid-2000s Shonen, </joey>
<joey> where Shonen has like evolved past that. </joey>
<connor> I feel like My Hero Academia and Black Clover </connor>
<connor> have taken like, what has worked, </connor>
<connor> and put their own twist on it and then evolved onto that, </connor>
<connor> whereas Fire Force feels like it still belongs </connor>
<garnt> 10 years ago with better animation. </garnt>
<connor> - Mentioning, My Hero Academia, </connor>
<connor> it's got a pretty notorious one. </connor>
<connor> Now I don't know, now I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay? </joey>
<joey> - If this is a result of it just being </joey>
<connor> the most mainstream anime right now, probably. </connor>
<connor> I imagine a lot of it has to do with that. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. - But, there's a lot of like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I mean, okay, the thing is </connor>
<joey> with the My Hero Academia fandom, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that. (Garnt burps) </joey>
<joey> - Hell yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I feel </joey>
<joey> about My Hero Academia fandom. - That's how I feel about. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Is that, I think it's the case of like, </connor>
<connor> the same like 10 people who have the shittiest takes </connor>
<connor> on Twitter, that are like- </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, it's not just My Hero Academia, </garnt>
<connor> it's any like popular Shonen that becomes </connor>
<connor> very mainstream. - Very mainstream. </connor>
<connor> This always happens. </connor>
<connor> - Like My Hero Academia happened, </connor>
<connor> - [All] Demon Slayer. </connor>
<joey> - And now Uzaki is like, it's always the talk of town. </joey>
<connor> - What's that like, how many times during My Heroes' </connor>
<connor> like airing period was there like tweets be like, </connor>
<connor> "Look at it, it's disgusting. </connor>
<connor> It's not even remotely close to the manga." </connor>
<connor> And then they had the manga right next to it. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, one fucking like leg- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, I love re-tweeting, </joey>
<connor> like quote retweeting people like that, </connor>
<garnt> like I think there was one of, I think it was a screenshot </garnt>
<garnt> from later episode of season two or something. </garnt>
<connor> And the caption, I'm guessing it's like a- </connor>
<connor> - We both retweeted it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like a 14-year-old girl probably, </connor>
<connor> captioned it being like, "I can't believe </connor>
<connor> they would do this to my boy." </connor>
<joey> It was something like that. </joey>
<joey> And I literally quoted it being like, </joey>
<joey> "Am I blind or is there literally no fucking difference?" </joey>
<joey> - No 'cause I remember seeing that tweet, </joey>
<garnt> and I remember thinking, "Wait, what's the problem?" </garnt>
<joey> Is there a problem? </joey>
<garnt> Is this like pouty right now? </garnt>
<joey> - Are you're upset that this is colored in now? </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> - This happened so many times, </connor>
<connor> they would just have the still of the animation, </connor>
<joey> and a still the manga and there was barely any difference. </joey>
<joey> Yes, there's gonna be some detail missing. </joey>
<connor> It's a the fucking manga page. </connor>
<joey> - But in my opinion it's like, </joey>
<garnt> if you're that upset, just read the fucking manga. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Like why are you watching the anime? </joey>
<garnt> - Like I remember logging onto Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever Demon Slayer was in its peak </garnt>
<connor> or when My Hero Academia was in it's peak. </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, "Surely there can't be a shittier </connor>
<connor> take than yesterday appear on my tablet." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And sure enough, there was like, </connor>
<connor> it was like everyone was competing. </connor>
<garnt> They were having a tournament arc of shitty takes. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it was like when they were airing </garnt>
<garnt> in their peaks, man (chuckles). </garnt>
<joey> - I definitely do think though, that the winner </joey>
<joey> of that tournament arc was that fucking person </joey>
<connor> who was like, "Oh, Tundura's earrings." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - You know, it's very bad. </connor>
<connor> It's got the Japanese Imperial flag on it. </connor>
<connor> And people were just like, "No." </connor>
<connor> - That's not what it is. - No, that's not what it is. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a hana. - It's a hanafuda. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "What are you talking about?" </connor>
<connor> And I remember, I don't usually call people out on Twitter </connor>
<connor> because I don't wanna give those people attention. </connor>
<connor> But sometimes I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> "I don't give a shit if this gets attention, </joey>
<joey> This is fucking hilarious." - I mean, </joey>
<connor> it's like you get so many people who are like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh dude, I found that out. </joey>
<joey> I found the way to like call them out, </joey>
<joey> and get the woke points on Twitter." </joey>
<garnt> And they call it out everyone's like, </garnt>
<connor> "Dude, shut the fuck up, no one cares." </connor>
<garnt> - And sometimes they're like so, it's </garnt>
<connor> so hypocritical. - So stretching. </connor>
<connor> - Because okay, I remember this one time I saw like, </connor>
<connor> this tweet about like My Hero Academia and the girls </connor>
<connor> and like, you know, don't sexualize the girls, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause they're in high school and whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you go on their profile, </garnt>
<garnt> and they're talking about shipping Todoroki and his dad. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like what, what is going on here? </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - There was one girl who was like, </garnt>
<connor> there was like a poster that Horikoshi had drawn </connor>
<connor> as like a thank you for like season three end. </connor>
<connor> And it was all of the UA girls in like swimsuits. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right, </connor>
<connor> and some girl had retweeted being like </connor>
<connor> how dare Horikoshi sexualize these 14-year-olds? </connor>
<connor> And literally the top reply was someone who screenshoted </connor>
<connor> that person's likes list, and it was just Todoroki. </connor>
<connor> Like Yaoi, </connor>
<connor> just straight up. - Oh my god, </connor>
<connor> oh my god. - Like Todoroki Yaoi, </connor>
<joey> being like, "Dude, is this you?" </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Who's this man? - Yeah, who's this man? </connor>
<joey> Yeah, it's just (sighs) I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - What was the other one, there was like a My Hero, </connor>
<joey> another, 'cause of course there is, </joey>
<joey> they find anything to get mad at. </joey>
<joey> - That wasn't the Maduta one? </joey>
<connor> - Which one's the Maduta one? </connor>
<joey> - It was like one of the scientists in season- </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. - That was, </connor>
<connor> that was China though. </connor>
<connor> - There was another one which is like Bakugo's birthday </connor>
<connor> is the same birthday as Hitler's. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Remember that one? </connor>
<connor> - I don't remember that one. - You don't remember that one? </connor>
<connor> I saw that on Twitter being like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I logged onto Twitter one morning, </connor>
<connor> and I saw My Hero Academia tweet, you know, trending. </connor>
<connor> And so I was like, "Oh god what now?" </connor>
<connor> And so I went onto it, and it was like, </connor>
<connor> some person was like, okay so the official birthdays </connor>
<garnt> of all of the UA students came out, and I just found out </garnt>
<garnt> that Bakugo's birthday is the same as Hitler's. </garnt>
<connor> Does that mean Horikoshi supports war criminals? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "You can't be serious, right?" </joey>
<connor> - The worst thing about that doctor one is? </connor>
<joey> Like the Japanese, like war crime dude? </joey>
<connor> Is that I looked at it and I was like, </connor>
<joey> "That's my birthday." (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Does CDawgVA support war criminals? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, is my birthday just canceled now </joey>
<joey> because somebody who was born </joey>
<garnt> on my birthday did a bad thing? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that it? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's ridiculous. </garnt>
<joey> - And I was like, I'm like, "What do I think?" </joey>
<connor> Like what is, this is dumb, right? </connor>
<joey> - No, because the Bakugo is Hitler's birthday tweet </joey>
<joey> was so funny because all the replies were like, </joey>
<joey> "That's my birthday." (men laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Just like yeah, there was 365, maybe 366, </garnt>
<connor> like it's obviously gonna overlap. </connor>
<joey> - It's just a fucking day (laughs) of the year, </joey>
<joey> like, it's not like, since when was somebody like, </joey>
<joey> oh, April 25th is Hitler's birthday. </joey>
<connor> - Another one, another dumb thing was like, </connor>
<joey> I think they were like, in the anime, I think they made them </joey>
<joey> like slightly thinner compared to the manga. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - People lost their their fucking shit, </joey>
<joey> they were like I can't believe this. </joey>
<joey> - I can't believe they're fat shaming with these characters. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, it's literally two pixels. </joey>
<connor> - And I'm just there with my flaming hot Cheetos, </connor>
<connor> just sitting there like, "I don't fucking care." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't give a fuck mate. </connor>
<connor> It's, who gives a shit? </connor>
<connor> I mean, half the time they don't even do that consciously. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't like get the whole redrawing art </garnt>
<joey> or fixing art trends or whatever </joey>
<joey> that's happening on Twitter. - Oh my god. </joey>
<connor> - That shit pisses me the fuck off. </connor>
<garnt> - It is like the most toxic thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro, I stay, dude, artists arguing on Twitter, </garnt>
<connor> it's like the most like, they're just </connor>
<connor> throwing the same grenade back and forth. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I'm not touching it. </connor>
<joey> - It's like two cancer cells fighting. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh Joey. - Oh my god! </connor>
<connor> Going for the throat, Joey. - What the? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I've tweeted about it, </connor>
<connor> I don't really care. - I am not affiliated </connor>
<connor> with Joey in any way, artists, I like your work. </connor>
<connor> - It's like two cancer cells fighting. </connor>
<joey> It's like either way I'm dying from cancer, </joey>
<connor> you know, I don't really care. - You can never like porn </connor>
<connor> on Twitter ever again Joey. - Yeah, how dare I. </connor>
<garnt> How dare I. - No more porn for you Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - All the artists are gonna come after you now. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's 'cause I remember there was one girl who, </garnt>
<connor> they did it with Persona 5 as well, </connor>
<connor> it was like how fucking dare you do with Persona 5. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like there was this new character </connor>
<connor> in Persona 5 Royal that came out, called Kasumi. </connor>
<connor> And she's supposed to be like a professional gymnast. </connor>
<garnt> Right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And if you don't know anything about the Persona games, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like the regular character design </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's your like persona character design. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. - Where, </connor>
<connor> so the character, had a gym uniform, right? </connor>
<connor> Like the usual like female gym uniform. </connor>
<connor> And it was based around that. </connor>
<connor> And there was this person who, got that and was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh how dare Atlas sexualize, </connor>
<connor> this like, I think she's like 16 </connor>
<connor> in the game?" - It was a gym outfit. </connor>
<connor> - And there was like, and so like they colored in, </connor>
<connor> like pretty much like the leotard part out. </connor>
<connor> To make it just look like she was wearing a fucking </connor>
<connor> like skin tight suit. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It looked like shit. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, "I fixed it Atlas, </connor>
<connor> this is what the character should look like." </connor>
<connor> And then what pissed me off even more is when, </connor>
<joey> a tweet like that gets popular. </joey>
<joey> And then they replied to their own tweet being like, </joey>
<joey> "By the way guys, follow me on Deviant Art. </joey>
<joey> I'm an artist, please hire me." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Look, artists out there, don't do that." </joey>
<joey> That's not how you get hired. </joey>
<connor> - No. - Who are you to say </connor>
<connor> what artwork is correct, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, to me that's like, it's like if we made a video </connor>
<joey> and someone's like there I corrected it, </joey>
<joey> I dubbed over it and made it funny. </joey>
<joey> It's like, okay, so what? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's 'cause what you're doing is </garnt>
<garnt> you're basically just putting like a giant middle finger </garnt>
<garnt> at the original artists, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> And you don't know what the fuck their intention was. </garnt>
<garnt> They just made a piece of artwork, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Especially when it's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> the cultural difference between in Japan and- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah but like I think </joey>
<joey> the thing I had, the biggest gripe I had </joey>
<joey> with the whole Persona thing and a lot </joey>
<connor> of these like, "I fixed your art things," </connor>
<connor> is that like, there isn't anything inherently wrong </connor>
<connor> with the original art. </connor>
<connor> It's just your fucking prerogative that you think it's bad. </connor>
<garnt> - Like Twitter's a shit show, </garnt>
<joey> which we all say. - Yeah, yeah of course. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, this recent controversy with the Uzaki-Chan design </garnt>
<garnt> is just the most stupid. - Oh my god! </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking thing I have seen. - It's so dumb. </garnt>
<joey> Why is it even an argument? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Why is it even an argument? </joey>
<connor> - I just, I look at that shit and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "How do you motherfuckers have the energy? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, how do you wake up every day and decide, </connor>
<connor> you know what I'm gonna do today? </connor>
<connor> Argue on Twitter for two hours?" </connor>
<joey> - I'm gonna get angry about the design </joey>
<joey> of this fictional character. </joey>
<garnt> - Who's ever changed their mind 'cause of a fucking tweet? </garnt>
<joey> Like, who in the history of humanity, </joey>
<joey> has seen a tweet and been like, </joey>
<joey> "You know my opinions, they're fucking wrong." </joey>
<joey> - You'd be surprised. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I have changed my mind and I've made a mistake. </connor>
<connor> You were right all along, I've never- </connor>
<garnt> - I had a relapse of judgment. </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> - My god! </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, going on to other fandoms. </connor>
<connor> - So, JoJo fans. </connor>
<garnt> - So can we talk about JoJo fans? </garnt>
<connor> The locusts of the animate community. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because that's what they are. - Is that what we're gonna </connor>
<garnt> call them? - Locusts. </garnt>
<connor> - The religious plague of the animate community. </connor>
<joey> - They're the frogs that most weighing down. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna head out. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - No, no, I mean, we can't, we can't shit talk, </joey>
<garnt> I mean we can shit talk. - No, we can </garnt>
<garnt> shit talk JoJo fans. - No, you can shit-talk me, </garnt>
<garnt> You can shit talk me. - But we can shit talk </garnt>
<joey> because we are in that fandom, </joey>
<joey> right? - No, no, because we are in </joey>
<garnt> that fanbase, we're JoJo fans. - I feel like we're varying </garnt>
<connor> degrees of. - We're varying degrees, </connor>
<joey> like there's like, it's like a gradient right? </joey>
<connor> And you've gotten better, recently. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) - I went to rehab. </connor>
<connor> I went to rehab. - But my god, </connor>
<connor> when Connor discovered JoJo, </connor>
<garnt> he was the most annoying JoJo fan you could ever imagine. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, in the church of JoJo he went </joey>
<garnt> from like alter boy to the Pope, </garnt>
<garnt> like he just ascended. (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, everything has to be JoJo. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, when did you first properly get </joey>
<garnt> into JoJo, 'cause, was it when you were like </garnt>
<garnt> in peak JoJo toxicity. - Yeah because, </garnt>
<joey> I'm curious because, </joey>
<garnt> from my point of view. - It's kind of happened </garnt>
<connor> out of nowhere. - It kind of happened </connor>
<connor> out of nowhere, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I've watched, when I was moving house once, </connor>
<connor> I downloaded, 'cause only at the time, </connor>
<connor> only Stardust Crusaders had finished. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Before part four started, and I downloaded it all </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Well, you know, </connor>
<connor> this guy talks about it a lot on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> He says it's quirky." (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> So, and I fucking hated the art style. </connor>
<connor> I thought it looked like shit. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Why is it so fucking ugly?" </joey>
<joey> Which is what I hear a lot from JoJo fans </joey>
<joey> and I totally understand- </joey>
<joey> - Wait, wait you downloaded 'cause I mentioned it? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you- </garnt>
<connor> - I've created a monster. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Oh my god! - He did this. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my god! - You're like the scientist </garnt>
<joey> that created Frankenstein, you're like- </joey>
<joey> - I feel like maybe you had a part to play </joey>
<connor> in the catalyst of like, you didn't start it </connor>
<connor> but maybe you definitely accelerated it a bit. </connor>
<connor> So I downloaded it and I was moving house </connor>
<connor> and I had no internet for about a week. </connor>
<connor> And it didn't even take me a week, like three days. </connor>
<connor> So I watched and, oh my fucking god dude, </connor>
<connor> Stardust Crusaders part one? </connor>
<joey> The first watch, fucking boring. </joey>
<joey> That shit was so long, why was there an Orangutan? </joey>
<joey> There was a boat, what is that Araki? </joey>
<joey> I mean now, now I love it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, now it's hilarious, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Now I think it's amazing, but at the time I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I hate this, I hate this so much." </connor>
<connor> Part two had a good thing going, </connor>
<connor> why are you ruining it Araki? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Part one, okay here's what it is, right? </connor>
<garnt> And I sympathize a lot with JoJo fans who come, </garnt>
<connor> not JoJo fans, people who wanna get into JoJo who are like, </connor>
<joey> "I just can't get into it, it's hard." </joey>
<joey> Yes, it is hard to get into. </joey>
<joey> It is just such a weird thing and it's so different </joey>
<joey> from what you're used to </joey>
<joey> that it's grated. - Dare I say </joey>
<joey> it's an acquired taste. </joey>
<joey> - I think some parts, it is, and there's a lot of people now </joey>
<connor> who really want to like it just to get the memes </connor>
<connor> and be in the know, and it's like, </connor>
<connor> "You don't have to. I don't care if you do or don't." </connor>
<garnt> - Which is, the biggest thing about JoJo fans, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna say, is that please stop trying </garnt>
<connor> to get absolutely everyone into JoJo. </connor>
<connor> Not everyone should get into JoJo </connor>
<connor> because it's not something that appeals to everyone. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And it is a commitment, as much as I like, you know. </connor>
<joey> I have to basically say to people, </joey>
<joey> "If you make it past Starters Crusaders, </joey>
<joey> you're probably in for the long run." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, that is nearly what, like 70 episodes? </joey>
<joey> 70 episodes? - Yeah, something like that. </joey>
<joey> - It's 48 plus, yeah, </joey>
<joey> it's about 71 episodes. - It's like 20 volumes </joey>
<joey> of the manga. - So, asking someone </joey>
<connor> to be like, "Hey, it gets good 72 episodes in </connor>
<connor> to the point of no return," it's like, that's a hard sell. </connor>
<connor> Anyway so, I'll get back to that. </connor>
<connor> So I watched it and then I kind of was like, </connor>
<connor> didn't think anything of it, like, </connor>
<connor> and then I watched part four, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "This is really good." </connor>
<connor> Part five hadn't come out, I was adamant on, </connor>
<connor> I actually tried to read the manga. </connor>
<connor> But I couldn't, I couldn't do it, I was like- </connor>
<connor> - Really? - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> 'cause at this point I didn't start reading manga. </connor>
<connor> I was strictly not reading manga. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "No, I can't do it." </connor>
<joey> And I've read the first chapter of part five, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "No, no." </joey>
<connor> What is this, who's this fucking Giorno cunt? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> So then I started watching part five as it aired, </connor>
<connor> and I got about three episodes in and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I really want to know what happens." </connor>
<connor> And so I started reading ahead and then it became like, </connor>
<connor> I read part five in like, like a day I think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - And then I read part six the next day. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then I read part seven over like two, three days. </connor>
<connor> And part seven was like by far my, </connor>
<connor> and part seven is when I think it solidified my obsession </connor>
<connor> with it, 'cause part seven was so fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> And if you have finished all the anime, </connor>
<connor> and you're one of the anime-only peeps, </connor>
<connor> like I was for a long time, please give it a shot. </connor>
<connor> The manga is so, so good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, part six and seven's manga is so good. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, then I became like obsessed and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay well, I wanna go back and read all the manga now," </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel that it was kind </connor>
<connor> of a really different experience </connor>
<connor> and I got to go through it a lot faster. </connor>
<joey> And a lot of the pacing issues I felt in the anime, </joey>
<connor> at least at part three, could be resolved with the manga. </connor>
<connor> So I went back and I re-watched it </connor>
<connor> and I just became fully obsessed. </connor>
<connor> And I think whilst I was reading part seven, </connor>
<connor> I was meeting up with you a bunch </connor>
<connor> and I slowly became more annoying. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Because like, the thing I hate about JoJo fans is that, </garnt>
<garnt> they assume that nobody watches JoJo, like in the old days. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know what I mean? - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - They are the most vocal fan base out </garnt>
<garnt> of fucking any other anime fan base. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's always the same fucking- </garnt>
<joey> - We wanna talk about a dick measuring contest, </joey>
<joey> like JoJo fans, it's a dick-measuring contest. </joey>
<joey> - I actually feel sorry for any musician </joey>
<connor> who Araki chooses to like name as the star. </connor>
<connor> - Oh dude, you go to their comment section on YouTube- </connor>
<connor> - And it's like the JoJo fans have taken over. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god! - Which is like, </connor>
<connor> which is like, I called them locusts right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they like invade, they take all the crops, </connor>
<connor> they take everything and then they move on to the next one. </connor>
<connor> It's like the Independence Day aliens right? </connor>
<connor> Where they just like, make this fucking world uninhabitable </connor>
<connor> and then they move on </connor>
<connor> to the next world. - Move on to the next one. </connor>
<connor> - Did you see when the Star Wars released their new like, </connor>
<joey> R2D2 thing, and it was called Dio? </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) - Oh my god. </joey>
<connor> - All the comments were "Kono Dio, Da." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like all of them. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And so, when Connor was in like peak JoJo fandom, </connor>
<connor> this kind of came out of nowhere </connor>
<garnt> 'cause he would just start making JoJo references, </garnt>
<garnt> like in everyday life, and like, I remember in England, </garnt>
<garnt> we still hung out like pretty often. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah like once or twice a, every, one a week, </connor>
<garnt> every two weeks, whatever. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And just every time I would hang out with Connor, </garnt>
<garnt> he would just keep making JoJo references. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, I thought JoJo fans were annoying online. </garnt>
<garnt> Hanging out with a JoJo fan in real life, </garnt>
<garnt> as a fan of JoJo, made me start to hate JoJo. </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I didn't know that was physically possible </connor>
<connor> until I started to hang out with Connor. </connor>
<connor> Like we would be like eating a meal </connor>
<connor> in some Italian restaurant, and Connor would just be going </connor>
<connor> through this fucking menu, being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, Prosciutto, that's a JoJo character." </connor>
<connor> "Oh look, you ordered the black pasta. </connor>
<garnt> This is like that scene from part two where." </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ, that's a JoJo. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I would just be sitting there being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Motherfucker, I'm just trying to eat my fucking pasta. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you not right now?" (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I remember I would just do it on purpose at some point </connor>
<connor> then be like, "Oh you approached me." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause when we were like drunk, I know, I know- </connor>
<connor> - I remember that one party we went to, </connor>
<connor> and we got fucking wasted, and every time someone walks </connor>
<garnt> towards you, you would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, you're approaching me, you're approaching me, oh." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> And it was like- </joey>
<joey> - I'm so glad I wasn't in the UK </joey>
<connor> that one- - It was funny </connor>
<garnt> like the first two times but like the 50th time that night- </garnt>
<garnt> - The worst part was everyone </garnt>
<connor> at the party started doing it though. </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I had done it so much that everyone was saying it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god. - But like they didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> what even, they were even referencing most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - They were just copying, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my god. - Yeah, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> needless to say that I get it, because the passion </connor>
<connor> for it when you first get into, </connor>
<connor> like really into it, is so intense. </connor>
<joey> And like you love everything about it. </joey>
<joey> - Because everything about that is so quotable. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like you can take anything out </connor>
<joey> of context and it's quotable. </joey>
<connor> - I think that it's like, the way I try and describe it, </connor>
<connor> is like the selling point is that, </connor>
<garnt> like it's such a unique experience in anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - And in a manga that you just, nothing comes close. </garnt>
<garnt> I know everyone says that, but it really is. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think also because, being especially, </garnt>
<connor> I think the reason it's done so well in the West is that </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's kind of almost accessible, 'cause a lot </connor>
<connor> of the western references make it really easy to digest. </connor>
<joey> - It's because Araki, as well, has said that he's like, </joey>
<joey> his biggest influence was western comics. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - And it's so cool </connor>
<connor> because it feels like it's like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, anime is kind of like acknowledging us, </joey>
<joey> our kind of like thing, right? - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, I fucking love Earth, Wind & Fire, </joey>
<joey> and when I first saw like the Stand Earth Wind and Fire, </joey>
<joey> I was like I fucking love that band. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> You know, when you see a band that </joey>
<connor> you listen to, it's so hype, you know? </connor>
<joey> - And then when you see it again in part seven </joey>
<connor> you're like hold on a sec. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, wait, did Aki do a mistake. </connor>
<connor> But no, it's like, I think it's so easily digestible </connor>
<connor> in some ways and it's such a, no author does anything </connor>
<connor> like this in any other way. - No. </connor>
<connor> - And the absurdity of it, but also, </connor>
<connor> it's so dumb yet clever at the same time, </connor>
<connor> it's really just an overall experience, </connor>
<connor> and such a good style like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well that's why it's one of the most parodied Shonen Jump </connor>
<connor> titles ever by other Shonen Jump artists. </connor>
<joey> - I'm reading Eyeshield 21 at the moment, </joey>
<joey> and they fucking, when they throw the ball, </joey>
<joey> some of them shout "Aura." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And it's like, just gonna casually- </connor>
<joey> - Like literally every Shonen Jump artist </joey>
<joey> has probably parodied or referenced JoJo in some way. </joey>
<garnt> - But it's like so unique, so that's why it's infinitely </garnt>
<connor> like fucking quotable and people can reference </connor>
<connor> this all day long and people do reference this all day long. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] A little too much. </connor>
<connor> - Which is what gets annoying at some point </connor>
<connor> because, I remember when JoJo first started airing </connor>
<connor> in like parts one and two, I remember talking </connor>
<connor> about it. - No one gave a shit. </connor>
<connor> - I remember talking about it. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, I think it was like </connor>
<connor> in my very first year review, when it was like 2013. </connor>
<connor> And I was like talking about JoJo being like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, there's this like long forgotten anime </connor>
<joey> that's being, long forgotten manga, </joey>
<joey> that's being adapted called JoJo. </joey>
<joey> You guys should probably watch it." </joey>
<joey> Not knowing how big it would become, </joey>
<joey> fucking seven years later, 'cause now everyone </joey>
<joey> in the anime community knows JoJo, </joey>
<garnt> but I don't think everyone in the anime community </garnt>
<garnt> should get into JoJo, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No, no. </garnt>
<connor> - It's hard, like as much as I love it, </connor>
<garnt> there's so many pitfalls that would put someone off </garnt>
<garnt> in the first few parts where he's really coming </garnt>
<connor> into his own as an author, like, </connor>
<connor> I think part four is really where he starts to be like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, from part four onwards, </joey>
<joey> you're getting a fucking amazing experience." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, I agree. </connor>
<joey> - But there's so many growing pains in between that. </joey>
<connor> And yeah, it's a- </connor>
<joey> - Part one and three mostly, I feel are the growing pains. </joey>
<connor> - And I think that's also one of the annoying parts, </connor>
<connor> is that people who love part two then go to part three </connor>
<connor> and they get something totally, kind of different. </connor>
<connor> And it's hard to be like- </connor>
<connor> - It's hard to adjust, yeah. - Just kind of put up with it. </connor>
<connor> Like, I wonder, like if I had internet, you know? </connor>
<connor> I had any form of internet, would I have dropped it? </connor>
<connor> Like I wonder about that, would I? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I, the only reason I watched it </connor>
<connor> is I had no other anime downloaded, except for this. </connor>
<garnt> And I remember being like, "Fucking come on, man." </garnt>
<garnt> "Ah, gee, this fucking fight's so boring." </garnt>
<garnt> Like, "Come on." </garnt>
<garnt> - And I don't know, it just feels like nowadays, </garnt>
<garnt> people will still make JoJo references, </garnt>
<connor> and the JoJo fandom still acts </connor>
<connor> like it's this really underground kind of show </connor>
<connor> that everyone should get into, </connor>
<connor> and it's just not that case anymore. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] No, no. (Connor inhales) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we are an annoying fandom. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think they understand </garnt>
<garnt> that they might be pushing a lot of people away </garnt>
<garnt> from the show, and now, just because of how vocal they are. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I like to, now, at least publicly, </connor>
<joey> with my JoJo references, I like to be sparing </joey>
<connor> and like save it for a good moment, </connor>
<joey> 'cause a good JoJo reference at the right time, </joey>
<joey> hits differently. - Right, that's the thing, </joey>
<connor> it does hit differently, but like that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Is like, I think, as well, that a lot </connor>
<connor> of people are just getting fucking sick of JoJo </connor>
<connor> is because it is so quotable in any situation. </connor>
<connor> And like, so many of the JoJo memes now are just like, </connor>
<joey> "Dude, come on, like." (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Dude, come on. </joey>
<joey> Come on, you can do better than that." </joey>
<joey> Like, please. </joey>
<garnt> - Like there are a lot of good memes. </garnt>
<joey> - There are a lot of good memes, </joey>
<joey> don't get me wrong. - I think it's like that now </joey>
<garnt> because there's no new anime airing, </garnt>
<garnt> but whenever there's a new anime airing- </garnt>
<joey> - Oh dude, when part six, like becomes an anime, </joey>
<garnt> whenever that may be, the memes </garnt>
<connor> are gonna be fucking top tier. </connor>
<connor> Like, we already know. </connor>
<connor> But in the meantime, this is just the dead moment </connor>
<connor> of just dead memes, where it's just kind of </connor>
<garnt> putting the JoJo fanbase in a little bit of a bad light, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel, because they're just shitting out </garnt>
<garnt> these memes everywhere and people are just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Alright, I get it." - They do go a bit ham. </joey>
<joey> - But like, for you as a JoJo fan, </joey>
<garnt> do you ever feel defensive whenever someone shits </garnt>
<garnt> on JoJo, or like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, it depends what for. </garnt>
<connor> Like, if they're shitting on it, like just to shit it, </connor>
<connor> which many people are, because you know, </connor>
<connor> the fandom's super fucking annoying, right? </connor>
<connor> So, I mean. - And it's a popular show. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I get annoyed by it, right, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I read this and I'm like, "Dude, you're 12. </connor>
<connor> Don't talk on the internet." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Who gave you permission? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> your profile picture is Meliodas, please stop. </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, I mean, (sighs) it's hard, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like watching your little brother, </connor>
<connor> like shit his pants in public, </connor>
<connor> it's like, come on, man, like come on. </connor>
<connor> - Not now. </connor>
<connor> - You're making me look bad, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause there's so many like cool things in JoJo, </connor>
<garnt> Like, okay, the JoJo like fashion is like </garnt>
<garnt> the coolest fucking shit. - Dude it </garnt>
<garnt> is fucking next level. - It's, by far, </garnt>
<joey> I think the best animate fashion, like, </joey>
<connor> I don't think anything comes close </connor>
<joey> to it. - I mean, you know, </joey>
<joey> that's how they did a collab with like, fucking- </joey>
<connor> - Gucci. - Oh, Gucci. </connor>
<joey> Right, yeah. - I am so fucking sad </joey>
<connor> that I don't own anything from the Gucci collection. </connor>
<garnt> You know if they do another JoJo </garnt>
<garnt> Gucci collection. - Was it Gucci </garnt>
<connor> or Louis Vuitton? </connor>
<connor> - They did both. - It was Gucci. </connor>
<garnt> They did Louis Vuitton as well? </garnt>
<joey> - I think they did Louis Vuitton as well, right? </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure. - No, they did BVLGARI. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, BVLGARI. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> They did the figures with the gems in them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - We know fashion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Gucci, 'cause they did a, I think, Araki wrote a short, </connor>
<joey> I think it was a 12-page or a 13-page- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, with Kishibe Rohan, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right, Kishibe Rohan Gucci promotion, </joey>
<joey> and it's fucking amazing and I wished that I had, </joey>
<connor> like no anime comes close to like pure like fashion style </connor>
<joey> as JoJo. - No, it really doesn't. </joey>
<garnt> - Araki did a fucking JoJo exhibition at the Louvre. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's like no other anime artist can do that. </joey>
<joey> - It's not even close, and the reason why is </joey>
<connor> 'cause anime is such a, I feel like it's been like, </connor>
<connor> watered down style, right, almost. </connor>
<connor> Like the style is so same at this point. </connor>
<connor> And then you have something like JoJo, </connor>
<connor> that yes, is very grating to look at in the start, </connor>
<connor> but the more you come into it and the more you get into it, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "Holy shit, okay. </connor>
<connor> This is really fucking cool." </connor>
<garnt> - No, 'cause I feel like after about, </garnt>
<connor> I think it's part four or part five, where Araki- </connor>
<connor> - Gets gay. </connor>
<connor> Gets gay, he just gets gay, </connor>
<connor> like let's just be honest. - Part five is hella gay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, part five is hella gay, </connor>
<connor> and I love it. - There's so much shekchu. </connor>
<joey> There's so much gay tension. - It's so good. </joey>
<connor> - In part five, it's like perfect. </connor>
<connor> - I've never seen that many open chests in my life </connor>
<garnt> as in part five. - And you can see. </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> And you can see how much of like a- </connor>
<connor> - Fashion is rubbed off. </connor>
<connor> - How much fashion has like rubbed off </connor>
<connor> onto his like character designs </connor>
<garnt> and just like the entire aesthetic of- </garnt>
<connor> - Most of the poses from like part four </connor>
<joey> or five onwards are all like, just Vogue. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just Vogue. - Vogue covers </joey>
<garnt> or like fashion shots that are taken. </garnt>
<connor> And they're just like, amazing in anime form. </connor>
<joey> Like, it's so obvious that he had like an appreciation </joey>
<connor> for fashion that I don't think many authors had. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's someone in the comments who's, </connor>
<connor> "Um, actually," but, you know, in just super mainstream, </connor>
<garnt> we just haven't seen that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's someone who </connor>
<connor> obviously loves fashion, but has been able to integrate it </connor>
<connor> in such a unique way. - So well, so well. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you know, there's a difference between having like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how to put this into words, </connor>
<connor> but like having characters wear good fashion. </connor>
<connor> Like one of the things I love about Rent-A-Girlfriend </connor>
<connor> actually, is how like their outfits change. </connor>
<connor> And, it was one of the few like anime you see </connor>
<connor> where every episode, the character is wearing </connor>
<connor> like a different outfit. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - You can tell like, </connor>
<connor> the authors. - The authors cared, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Put thought into this, but like, </connor>
<connor> what I feel about JoJo fashion </connor>
<connor> is just that it embodies fashion. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not just the clothes but just like the whole </connor>
<connor> aesthetic. - The whole feel. </connor>
<garnt> - The whole feel, and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It feels like runway models with personality. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Like dare I say- </connor>
<connor> - And superpowers. - Oh my god, </connor>
<garnt> that is like, so JoJo. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Like from part five onwards, it does feel like everyone </connor>
<joey> is a runway model. - It's runway models </joey>
<joey> with superpowers, that's what it is. </joey>
<joey> - That's genuinely like what it feels like. </joey>
<joey> And it, and like, I never gave a fuck about fashion, </joey>
<connor> but ever since like getting into JoJo, </connor>
<connor> like, when I saw like high fashion stuff, </connor>
<connor> like expensive shit, I'm like, "It kinda like looks </connor>
<garnt> pretty fucking gorgeous." (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's true though. </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally never, I always used to think like, </garnt>
<joey> "$10 for a T-shirt is the max level." </joey>
<joey> No more, and then the more I got, like, </joey>
<joey> I started looking at JoJo, I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "Why is that guy hot? </connor>
<connor> Like he looks fucking dumb, but like, it's hot though." </connor>
<connor> Like, like. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And then I was like, dude his outfit is fucking cool. </garnt>
<connor> - Does that drip clean. </connor>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that drip clean man, like, </joey>
<joey> and you're like, okay, maybe I can start </joey>
<connor> to appreciate fashion a little bit. </connor>
<connor> That's when I last. - Oh yeah, </connor>
<joey> I definitely came to the same, because I mean, </joey>
<joey> you know, there's this brand in Japan called Glamb, </joey>
<joey> which does a massive. - If you're wondering </joey>
<garnt> where we get most of, like, </garnt>
<joey> anime T-shirts now. - Anime T-shirts. </joey>
<garnt> - It's probably from Glamb. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, all of the JoJo shirts that you've seen is probably </joey>
<connor> from Glamb. - Yeah, like, </connor>
<connor> I scoffed the first time I saw </connor>
<connor> when the T-shirt was like $80. </connor>
<connor> That is a lot, and that pained me to pay that, </connor>
<connor> but after a while I'm like, this shit looks so good. </connor>
<connor> I would rather have one of this T-shirt </connor>
<connor> than eight shitty T-shirts. - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - Just 'cause like, there's only a few places </joey>
<joey> where I can rep like my favorite anime </joey>
<garnt> and not have to worry about- </garnt>
<garnt> - Being a fucking embarrassment. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Being that cringy weeb, right, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause like there's some anime fashion which, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no other way I can put it, but just it's just tacky. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so, put a fucking giant logo. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - It's just like </garnt>
<joey> the kind of shirts you only wear to anime conventions, </joey>
<joey> and that's it, you know? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or as pajamas, that's the only time, right? </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, but some of like the JoJo fashion I've seen </joey>
<joey> just looks fucking fantastic. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And you can like, you can be a weeb just like </joey>
<garnt> in public, you know, and still- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that Diavolo jacket I have, </connor>
<connor> that King Crimson jacket I have is like </connor>
<connor> so fucking sexy. - Yeah, exactly, </connor>
<garnt> it's so cool. - I love wearing that jacket. </garnt>
<joey> Goddamn. - It's so fucking cool. </joey>
<garnt> - Basically there is a lot to love about JoJo. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the last dick suck I will do of JoJo. </connor>
<connor> Yes, the fandom is probably one of the worst, </connor>
<joey> if not the worst right now, publicly. </joey>
<joey> Like it's pretty fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, it's pretty bad. </joey>
<connor> - I wish you guys would chill the fuck out a little bit. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause like. </connor>
<connor> - You got it. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I feel like, the only time </connor>
<garnt> I've had a knee jerk reaction about someone saying </garnt>
<garnt> they're speaking about JoJo. </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I had that, I had the exact same. </connor>
<garnt> I had the exact same thing. - Like, </garnt>
<garnt> I became everything I hated. </garnt>
<connor> And me and Connor have already talked about this, </connor>
<garnt> but it's Cr1TiKaL, it's when Cr1TiKaL did a, </garnt>
<garnt> what did he do a video on again? </garnt>
<connor> - He was talking about, it was Dunkey's video </connor>
<connor> about how. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - About how Final Fantasy fans are the worst </connor>
<connor> and like, they're like so aggressive about their opinion. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so it's a Cr1TiKaL video </garnt>
<garnt> that's called "Dunkey Has Gone Too Far," </garnt>
<connor> I think that's what it was. - Something like, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so Charlie talks about how, you know, </connor>
<connor> these rabid Final Fantasy fans </connor>
<connor> have taken Dunkey's opinion way too seriously. </connor>
<joey> Right? - Yeah, kind of. </joey>
<joey> - And then he goes in this, he uses this analogy. </joey>
<joey> And of course, of course he uses JoJo fans. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And I was, when he brought up JoJo, I was ready </connor>
<connor> to be like (claps hands) you're right, king. </connor>
<connor> - Totally right. - Like you are totally right, </connor>
<garnt> I totally get this. - Part one sucks, </garnt>
<connor> part three sucks, we get it, cool. </connor>
<garnt> - And then he goes on to say that, I think, </garnt>
<connor> he prefers part one and two to part three and four, </connor>
<connor> and I just had this (table thumps). </connor>
<connor> Chotomate. </connor>
<connor> - I've never hit the space bar with such aggression, </connor>
<connor> like (table thumps) "What?" </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> "What?" </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I've heard most opinions about JoJo. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've heard shitty takes, </garnt>
<connor> but that was the shittiest take. </connor>
<connor> Charlie, what was that? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Charlie, part four is amazing! - Charlie! </garnt>
<connor> I just want to, no, no. - What? </connor>
<garnt> - I just want to understand. </garnt>
<connor> No, no. - Come on the podcast Charlie, </connor>
<garnt> explain yourself. - But look, look, look. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to be that JoJo fan right now, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm going to fully morph into that JoJo fan </garnt>
<joey> 'cause like, I've heard, you know, if you don't like JoJo, </joey>
<joey> that's fine, I've heard that take so many times. </joey>
<joey> Where I'm just like, JoJo's not for you, </joey>
<joey> that's good, that's fine, you know. </joey>
<connor> But I've never heard the take where </connor>
<connor> someone. - I've never heard that, </connor>
<connor> I've never heard that. - Someone prefers parts </connor>
<connor> one and two over parts three and four. </connor>
<connor> Maybe like, maybe part two over part three, </connor>
<connor> but part one, part one. - Over part four. </connor>
<connor> - Over three and four? </connor>
<garnt> - Four? Four is amazing! </garnt>
<joey> It is so good. - I don't like </joey>
<joey> the personified powers, I'd rather see the powers </joey>
<joey> that I can't fucking see. </joey>
<garnt> - Charlie, Charlie, this, this, you know, </garnt>
<joey> I just wanna understand, I want </joey>
<joey> to understand, please. - Please, please, </joey>
<joey> I need to know. - There's a spot right here, </joey>
<joey> Charlie, for you, so explain yourself. </joey>
<connor> - This is not hate, I just want to know. </connor>
<connor> I want to know. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause me and Connor are both like space bar this, </connor>
<garnt> go to the comments section and nobody was talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Nobody's was talking about it. - Yeah no one was, </garnt>
<garnt> I was so furious. - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, why is nobody talking about this? </garnt>
<connor> This is the biggest issue in 2020. </connor>
<connor> Why is nobody? - Probably because </connor>
<connor> they're all off on like ask slash JoJo, </connor>
<connor> being like, "Did you this? </connor>
<connor> Did you see this bullshit?" </connor>
<connor> - I've never had a reaction like that in my life. </connor>
<connor> I've normally been like, yeah, king, whatever you want, man. </connor>
<joey> Like, and I was like, "No, no, that is wrong. </joey>
<garnt> That is wrong, what is that?" </garnt>
<connor> - That's just wrong. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's literally the first time </connor>
<connor> I've heard this opinion. </connor>
<connor> - I have never heard that. </connor>
<connor> - I thought I was prepared for anything. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, Charlie, come on and defend yourself. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> I, we need to, we need to talk. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we do need to talk- </joey>
<joey> - Come to Japan when. - Come to Japan. </joey>
<connor> - When America stops imploding, after. </connor>
<joey> - Come to Japan, not only because we want you as a guest </joey>
<connor> on the show, but mostly because we wanna hear </connor>
<connor> your opinions on JoJo, your garbage, garbage opinions. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Just kidding. </connor>
<connor> - Moving on from JoJo, which is probably the worst fandom </connor>
<connor> right now, we all agree, right? </connor>
<connor> JoJo's the worst fandom right now. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean. - Dragon Ball </garnt>
<connor> is a close second. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Whenever, like whenever a JoJo anime is airing, </garnt>
<connor> it's just like, the anime community </connor>
<connor> is just like a minefield. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. - Oh, yeah, it's great, </connor>
<garnt> I love it, I love it. </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> As a guy who can navigate the minefield comfortably- </connor>
<connor> - As someone who is going into the field, </connor>
<joey> planting new mines. (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Laying the mine to myself. </joey>
<connor> I think another kind of fandom that we haven't touched on, </connor>
<connor> we've only touched on Shonen fandoms, </connor>
<connor> is arguably the horniest fandom, which is the Yaoi fandom. </connor>
<joey> - See, I don't really see it. </joey>
<connor> - Really? I do. </connor>
<garnt> - All that much, I mean, I know you do. </garnt>
<garnt> - You would be more of the expert than I am. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Like what is- </joey>
<joey> - The Yaoi fandom is imagine if, </joey>
<joey> instead of being passionate about Dragon Ball, </joey>
<connor> you're passionate about dudes fucking. </connor>
<joey> Like, that's, that level of passion. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, good on them I guess. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I read a manga recently and it's, it was one where, </connor>
<connor> the whole kink was that he had inverted nipples </connor>
<connor> and that was the selling point. </connor>
<connor> - I saw that on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - It was like, and it's just crazy, </connor>
<connor> 'cause people'll get so into this stuff, </connor>
<connor> and I love reading it 'cause it's so funny </connor>
<connor> and absurd but some people love this shit. </connor>
<joey> And they get so aggressive about it. </joey>
<joey> But then, it's equally on the other side, </joey>
<joey> there's like, "Don't fetishize this shit, it's not healthy." </joey>
<joey> And there's always like a war going on. </joey>
<joey> - What, about inverted nipples? </joey>
<connor> - About like gay relationships and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> it's 'cause it's like women, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - But I mean (laughs). </joey>
<joey> Fucking Kathy, it's stupid either way. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - Who takes </joey>
<joey> this shit seriously? </joey>
<connor> No one cares, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - The fucking inverted nipples shit killed me. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, there's tons of it. - Because like, </connor>
<connor> it killed me because I knew it wasn't a parody. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, no, no. - I was like this, </connor>
<joey> I know this is real. </joey>
<connor> - The whole plot of that Yaoi as well, </connor>
<connor> was a really fun, stupid one as well. </connor>
<connor> I'll explained it to you, so it's great, </connor>
<connor> 'cause even conceptually, explaining it </connor>
<connor> to you is so absurd. (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And Meilyne knows it, Meilyne's read it. </connor>
<connor> So- </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I have not, why would you- </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - She has. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Why would you assume that? </connor>
<connor> - So, this guy needs to get a new house, right? </connor>
<connor> And he finds this amazing share house that, </connor>
<connor> it looks amazing, it's so cheap. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And the reason why he gets it for so cheap </connor>
<connor> is that the owner of the house only lets like hunks in, </connor>
<connor> like absolute eye candy as he prefaces it. </connor>
<connor> And this Yaoi starts off, right, by one of the other hunks </connor>
<connor> who lives in the house (laughs). </connor>
<joey> Is like, come on, let's take a bath together. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause they have like an onset or something </joey>
<connor> in this house. - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And he sees his inverted nipples and he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Dude, that's hot as shit!" </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> "Like that's my kink." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "You know, if you get you turned on enough, </connor>
<connor> they'll invert back to normal." </connor>
<connor> - What? - And so, </connor>
<connor> immediately starts doing shit to him. </connor>
<connor> And then it turns out that he had hired a prostitute </connor>
<connor> and that wasn't the prostitute, </connor>
<connor> it was just the new housemate or something. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, this is insane. </connor>
<connor> The plots that they come up with in Yaoi </connor>
<connor> are just insane. - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - And okay, I get it, a lot of people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh god, sounds gay, I'm not into that." </connor>
<connor> It like, no, please read it, it's so fucking funny. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, I wanna read it. - I wanna read it. </connor>
<connor> - Just the stories alone are so absurd, </connor>
<connor> like the leaps that they take, </connor>
<joey> they get, yeah. - That's why I wanna get more </joey>
<connor> into Yaoi, because like, out of the few that I've read, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, this is too funny </connor>
<connor> not to go further in. - If you genuinely </connor>
<connor> wanna read like a decent Yaoi with like a great story, </connor>
<joey> I think 10 Dance is pretty good. </joey>
<joey> It's about ballroom dancing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've heard that on. </connor>
<joey> - Hella gay, but so fucking good. </joey>
<connor> Actually like an amazing story, kinda ironically, like- </connor>
<joey> - I love how we went from Dragon Ball fanbase </joey>
<joey> to here are some Yaoi I recommend. </joey>
<connor> - Because I genuinely think that Yaoi fans, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause you don't really see them, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you guys probably don't like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - No. </garnt>
<connor> - They are like the Dragon Ball fans, but like for gay porn. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Kinda, kinda, like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Do they have like power levels on dick size </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that? (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Sadly no, and they don't care who can suck dick the best. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> They're not like, "Yo, Saitama can out-suck Goku </connor>
<connor> any day of the week." </connor>
<connor> "Oh, Goku can handle at least a 10-inch girth </connor>
<connor> any day of the week." </connor>
<connor> - "Goku has a 10-inch girth." </connor>
<connor> - You know, "Goku can still suck dick even with HIV." </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> No, it's like, it's just like this kind of, almost, </connor>
<connor> like you'll say, "Oh, I like a Yaoi." </connor>
<connor> But if you say you like a Yaoi, </connor>
<connor> you better be prepared for people like, </connor>
<connor> "Read this one, oh my god, you have to read this one." </connor>
<joey> "This one's great!" </joey>
<joey> - Do you know how many fucking Yaois </joey>
<joey> I got recommended after you and I did </joey>
<joey> that Yaoi a sama video? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because, Yaoi fans will not be content </connor>
<garnt> until you've read their favorite Yaoi. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I mean, there's, </garnt>
<connor> there's like a lot of fandoms like that as well. </connor>
<connor> - True, true, true. </connor>
<connor> - Like, the Fate fandom I think is definitely </connor>
<connor> one of that, where they hear that you're into like </connor>
<joey> one Fate and then they're, okay- </joey>
<garnt> - How dare you haven't seen every </garnt>
<connor> Type-Moon franchise. - I am that Fate fan. </connor>
<garnt> - Well Fate fans are the, if Dragon Ball's the ghetto, </garnt>
<garnt> Fate are the crack dealers. </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's the way I see it. </joey>
<connor> They're like, they're the ones who are profiting </connor>
<joey> off. - Yeah, it's like, </joey>
<connor> so you want more, huh? </connor>
<joey> Oh, I got more. </joey>
<connor> - We got more, what do you want? </connor>
<connor> You want the Waifu, do you want the story? </connor>
<garnt> We got it all. - Yeah, </garnt>
<connor> their gateway drug is heroin, and then it only gets worse </connor>
<connor> from there, like it's, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> we need a full like, ecosystem to know who is the failure </connor>
<connor> in society. - It's like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, you finished all the Fate, huh? </joey>
<joey> Have you heard of Sukihima?" </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> "I know you wanna get into that." </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you like Saber? </connor>
<connor> It's like the different kinds of marijuana strains. </connor>
<connor> Saber, it's like, oh, you like Saber of the dank, do you? </connor>
<connor> - Saber of the dank. - We finally have </connor>
<garnt> every kind of Saber now, 'cause cast of Saber </garnt>
<connor> just got recently released in the JP servers </connor>
<joey> and now we can, we can go full Saber. </joey>
<joey> All the Sabers, give me more Sabers. </joey>
<joey> - We don't need any more Sabers, Type-Moon. </joey>
<garnt> Stop it, stop it. - It's free real-estate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Type-Moon. </garnt>
<joey> (garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Thank god. - No, like, </joey>
<joey> another toxic fandom I can think of that </joey>
<connor> have just covered. - Just checking off, </connor>
<connor> who are we gonna piss off now? </connor>
<connor> - Like, no, okay, let's just piss off </connor>
<joey> everyone now. - We're gonna piss off </joey>
<joey> everybody. - Who haven't </joey>
<joey> we pissed off yet? </joey>
<joey> - Do we have any more beers? </joey>
<joey> Do we have any? - Web Toon readers. </joey>
<connor> Web Toon readers. </connor>
<connor> Okay, so because, like- </connor>
<connor> - Do we even count them? </connor>
<garnt> They're, come on. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Is that even a fanbase? </joey>
<joey> I don't even know. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because like, I didn't realize how passionate </garnt>
<garnt> they were until Tower of God started airing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I remember making a Tower of God video </garnt>
<garnt> and like, when I tweeted it out or anytime </garnt>
<garnt> I would tweet anything out about Tower of God, </garnt>
<garnt> it was the most toxic like Twitter chain </garnt>
<garnt> you could ever thing of. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, where people like, Tower of God fans </joey>
<joey> are that dedicated fandom, and from what I've seen, </joey>
<joey> a lot of the Web Toon fan base are the same. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I've seen like equally, </connor>
<joey> with like the God of High School fandom as well. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Where they will defend the show </connor>
<joey> as like, the greatest piece of literature </joey>
<joey> that's ever been made. (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> Right, and I'm like, yeah, I like Tower of Gods. </connor>
<joey> You know, God of High School, I haven't read the Web Toon, </joey>
<joey> So that could be better, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I think the anime is pretty mediocre as it is. </joey>
<garnt> But like, they will like go to war </garnt>
<garnt> to like make sure everyone knows how good this Web Toon is. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm really scared now because I'm pretty sure </joey>
<connor> next season we're getting the Noblesse anime, right? </connor>
<connor> Which basically completes the trifecta of like the Web Toon, </connor>
<garnt> right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause you know when you have like a slight problem </connor>
<connor> with like, or like a slight criticism </connor>
<joey> with like this certain anime or show or manga </joey>
<joey> and then you make like a tweet about it, </joey>
<joey> and then the billion fucking tweets you get </joey>
<connor> to be like, "Um, excuse me. </connor>
<connor> No, this criticism is wrong. - How dare you, oh my god. </connor>
<joey> - And that's like what I've seen with like Web Toon's fans, </joey>
<joey> like times a hundred. - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, or at least like with Tower of God, </joey>
<joey> 'cause like, that was my experience with Tower of God, </joey>
<joey> where I was like, "I like Tower of God," </joey>
<joey> but then I've read like the comments chains, </joey>
<garnt> and a lot of it just really put me off, </garnt>
<garnt> like the Tower of God fandom, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? - Jeez, I never got </garnt>
<joey> that at all, in my head, I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Damn, this has got a fucking good soundtrack." </joey>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I heard, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, it's Kevin, hey!" - Kevin, Kevin, </garnt>
<garnt> you did good. </garnt>
<connor> - You did good, Kevin, you did good Kevin. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck the Oxygen fandom, you know, fuck those guys. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Who needs Oxygen man, they have real stuck-up, </connor>
<connor> no, who haven't we pissed off yet then? </connor>
<connor> Wait, is there a good fandom? </connor>
<connor> No. - No (laughs). </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the more I go through it, I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Love Life, garbage, Band Dream, garbage." </joey>
<joey> Every single fan. - Fairy Tail. </joey>
<joey> - Fairy Tail, oh my god, Fairy Tail is awful. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Fairy Tail is, man, it's like, </connor>
<connor> the people who like Fairy Tail are the ones </connor>
<connor> who kept those mats, you know, the kids with the town? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - You know, </joey>
<joey> they're the people who kept those. </joey>
<connor> That still use them. (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> They have little cars go around, no (laughs). </connor>
<joey> - I remember one time there was this fucking like, </joey>
<joey> I think it was supposed to be a smear campaign </joey>
<joey> against me, right? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, 'cause you said that Fairy Tail was garbage? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I said that Fairy Tail was garbage </joey>
<joey> in one of my Let's Fight videos, </joey>
<joey> and there was a moment on Instagram </joey>
<joey> where people were like tweeting out, </joey>
<joey> like posting this like picture </joey>
<joey> of like Natsu and Lucy, and it was like, </joey>
<joey> "Protect Fairy Tail from the anime man." </joey>
<joey> And there was like 30 people on Instagram being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yes, let's protect our favorite show because some dude </joey>
<joey> on the internet said it was a garbage show." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "Oh my, all I said was </joey>
<joey> that this show sucks," like, just chill. </joey>
<connor> Like chill out. </connor>
<connor> - Is it a natural occurrence that, </connor>
<connor> at a certain age, you just stop giving a fuck </connor>
<joey> if someone hates on what you like? </joey>
<joey> Or is it a thing that some people have? </joey>
<joey> - It's just. - 'Cause I don't, </joey>
<joey> I genuinely don't know anyone our age </joey>
<connor> who gets that angry about, do you? </connor>
<garnt> - No. - 'Cause I don't. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't, I mean like, I like </connor>
<connor> to have like arguments, not arguments, </connor>
<garnt> or like debates. - I love chatting shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I love talking outta my ass and getting angry </garnt>
<joey> at Joey about the Baccano! dub, but like, </joey>
<joey> that's not like actually- </joey>
<joey> - Like I'm not gonna be offended by it. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, I mean 'cause we're friends right? </joey>
<joey> But I'm not gonna, on Twitter, get actually angry </joey>
<joey> at someone 'cause, I mean, a lot of the context </joey>
<joey> and the humor is lost if I do. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. - Yeah, I mean like, </garnt>
<connor> on Twitter especially, which I feel like we're putting </connor>
<connor> most of this, like most of our opinions- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this is normally coming from Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Rarely anything else. </connor>
<connor> - I'd say, 90% of what I see has come from Twitter. </connor>
<connor> It is just not like, not the right platform </connor>
<connor> for this kind of like debate. - No. </connor>
<connor> - And argument, like I said, who's ever changed </connor>
<connor> their opinion 'cause of a fucking tweet? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> You don't have enough characters to make a poignant argument </connor>
<joey> that can really. - No. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm not gonna sit through a fucking like, </joey>
<connor> seven tweet thread, right? - The first thing </connor>
<connor> you think when you get like what, </connor>
<connor> a fucking 20-page paragraph? </connor>
<connor> Your immediate is not to like, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna consider what they've said. </connor>
<connor> You're like, how do immediately counter this. </connor>
<connor> Is your first thought on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> It always is, it's everyone's first thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like, what's the fucking point? </connor>
<connor> Like, you just, you know, go </connor>
<connor> and fucking watch Meliodas touch up a girl, </connor>
<connor> who fucking cares, go do what you want. </connor>
<joey> - If you enjoy it, then cool, but just be aware </joey>
<joey> that there are people out there who don't think that way, </joey>
<joey> right, who don't agree with the fact that- </joey>
<connor> - It's not a personality trait to touch women. </connor>
<joey> Just saying, I'm gonna say it. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna say it, I just think it's stupid. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, it is. </joey>
<connor> - Why does Meliodas need to do it? </connor>
<joey> I don't know, I still wonder. </joey>
<connor> I wake up in a cold sweat at night, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, why does- </connor>
<joey> - Do you wake up like Meliodas did </joey>
<garnt> in the fucking thing? - Yeah, I'm like. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I think- </joey>
<connor> - Why is Meliodas assaulting women? </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Now I'm not a simp, right I. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I just think it's 'cause of like, </connor>
<connor> when did they originally come out? </connor>
<connor> Like, it was like mid-2000s, right? </connor>
<connor> - Was it okay in mid-2000? </connor>
<connor> - No, 'cause remember this time in mid-2000s </connor>
<joey> where entire character quirks was, </joey>
<joey> oh, let's trip over and touch an anime girl? </joey>
<joey> Like it was like. - Literally every </joey>
<joey> harem protagonist? - Yeah, </joey>
<garnt> literally every harem protagonist, that was like the quirk. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a difference between tripping up </connor>
<connor> though and being like... </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - True, true, true. </connor>
<connor> - And like, as an adult male, an adult monkey-brained male, </connor>
<connor> I watched that, and I sat there and I thought, </connor>
<joey> "Who is this appealing to, this character trait?" </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm wondering who. </joey>
<joey> Chris, do you know 'cause I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> It's gotta be 12-year-olds, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's gotta be 12 year olds. </joey>
<joey> - That's how like most of my arguments are done. </joey>
<joey> Like, who likes this, 12-year-old, must be. </joey>
<connor> Probably isn't, but to my head, </connor>
<connor> no adult who's functioning in society. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> Maybe I just answered my own question. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there you go. (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's not appealing to those </connor>
<joey> who function in society. - If you are over the age </joey>
<connor> of 18, do you like that Meliodas touches people? </connor>
<connor> If so, can you tell me why, 'cause I'm genuinely curious. </connor>
<connor> Like, what about it is fun? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like I can understand if you don't have a problem </garnt>
<connor> with it, but like, if you actively like- </connor>
<joey> - Enjoy it, like that's a good, like yeah, </joey>
<garnt> that's what I mean. - Yeah, I'm genuinely curious. </garnt>
<connor> - They're like hell yeah, Meliodas, you feel up </connor>
<connor> that bitch. - 'Cause like I said, </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit, it's just kinda </connor>
<joey> like smelling a bad fart, like I'm like, fuck it, </joey>
<connor> (groans) disgusting, carry on, but like I don't care. </connor>
<garnt> Like its not gonna stop me from watching it, </garnt>
<connor> I just think it's dumb. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, bad animation is more likely </garnt>
<connor> to stop you from watching it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's way worse. - Yeah, that's way worse. </connor>
<garnt> That's a way worse, that's a way better reason </garnt>
<garnt> to stop fucking watching it. </garnt>
<connor> - God, what did they do to you? </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry Seven Deadly Sins fans, they did you dirty. </connor>
<joey> - I think, what this episode has given the realization of </joey>
<joey> is that, if you put the blank fandom. </joey>
<connor> And you put any anime in that blank, </connor>
<connor> it's probably gonna be a shit fandom. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I mean, I mean. </connor>
<joey> - As long as a fandom exists, it's probably gonna suck </joey>
<joey> in some way. - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> think of any fandom and you'll find </joey>
<connor> annoying ass fucking memes or dumb shit they say. </connor>
<connor> So, if you are a fan of any anime in general, </connor>
<connor> don't take what we said personally, </connor>
<connor> we just like to talk shit out of our ass. </connor>
<joey> - We hate all fandoms equally. </joey>
<connor> - None of this is serious, if you're a Dragon Ball fan, </connor>
<garnt> please don't think that you can't talk to me. </garnt>
<connor> You can't, actually, no, no. (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - You can, as long as it's not about Dragon Ball. </joey>
<connor> - Only if you're here to discuss the benefits </connor>
<garnt> of having Goku be HIV positive. </garnt>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> - JoJo fans, please just chill the fuck out. </joey>
<connor> Not everyone needs to watch JoJo. </connor>
<connor> We love JoJo, not everyone </connor>
<garnt> will love JoJo. - What we've said </garnt>
<connor> is not serious at all, it's just us talking shit </connor>
<joey> for two hours, just having a fun time. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, exactly. - And hopefully, </joey>
<joey> none of you took what we said seriously today, </joey>
<connor> although, if you are offended by this, </connor>
<connor> odds are you didn't make it this far </connor>
<garnt> before you typed your comment. - Actually, let's </garnt>
<connor> make this fun. </connor>
<garnt> What other fandoms piss you off? </garnt>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Let's make it. - Like on the comments. </garnt>
<connor> - Let's make the comment section </connor>
<garnt> an entire fucking minefield. </garnt>
