<joey> - Did you get an
overwhelming amount of people </joey>
<joey> in your Twitch chat </joey>
<connor> asking if we were going to Garnt's wedding </connor>
<connor> or when Garnt's wedding was?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - As if they were also planning to go? </joey>
<connor> - They were like, "You're
gonna film it, right?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "No. </connor>
<joey> No." </joey>
<joey> - Times people are like, </joey>
<connor> "So this is a 'Trash
Taste' special, right?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Joey fucking rocks up </connor>
<joey> with one of the fucking film cameras, </joey>
<connor> just like, "Yeah, what's going on?" </connor>
<joey> - GoPro on every corner of the room. </joey>
<garnt> - Connor's got a GoPro on his
fucking forehead like POV. </garnt>
<connor> (gentle rhythmic music) </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> I'm Connor and I'm with
the boys, Joey and Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Hey, guys.
- It me. </connor>
<garnt> - How many weeks has it been?
- Many. </garnt>
<garnt> - It has been many weeks-
- Like a month, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - You do not know this, </garnt>
<garnt> but I've flown back to England </garnt>
<joey> and flown back to Japan in the time. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Since the last, not
even the last recording. </joey>
<garnt> - And then you gotta
go a week later again. </garnt>
<connor> - So why'd you leave us, Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - Why did I leave? </garnt>
<garnt> Basically, I had to do
a marriage interview. </garnt>
<connor> Now, normally people do it </connor>
<connor> a year or something before their wedding, </connor>
<connor> but unfortunately, due to-
- (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, due to travel restrictions, </connor>
<garnt> I didn't have the opportunity
to go back to England </garnt>
<garnt> to basically do this marriage
interview, which is legally- </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, so fill me in, </joey>
<garnt> what do you have to do
at a marriage interview? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, I'll- </garnt>
<joey> - Can they be like, "Yeah,
you haven't got the job"? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I'll get- </connor>
<joey> - So why do you wanna get married? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'll get into why I had to do it </joey>
<joey> but legally, if I wanted
to be married in the UK, </joey>
<joey> you need to give something
called a notice of marriage </joey>
<joey> which is basically you're
telling the government </joey>
<joey> that you're planning to get married </joey>
<joey> and so it brings you to
the legal proceedings </joey>
<joey> to allow you to get married. </joey>
<joey> - Now-
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - So normally you can do
that a year or months before. </joey>
<garnt> Unfortunately, due to travel restrictions </garnt>
<garnt> and us not being able
to travel back to the UK </garnt>
<garnt> or just it being incredibly difficult, </garnt>
<garnt> we put that off and we put that off </garnt>
<garnt> and we put that off and we put that off. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you have to legally give it </garnt>
<garnt> at least 28 days before you get married. </garnt>
<garnt> And by the time we gave it, it was 35 days </garnt>
<garnt> before we got married, so. </garnt>
<connor> - So you're still in the guidelines. </connor>
<garnt> - It's still in the guidelines </garnt>
<garnt> but it was awkward because
I had to leave the boys </garnt>
<garnt> for two weeks or something. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like that kid who
finishes the assignment </joey>
<joey> the day before it starts. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I got plenty of time, </joey>
<garnt> I got a couple of hours left. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so I was looking at the schedule </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Fuck,
we got 'Trash Taste'" </garnt>
<garnt> and all this other work stuff
that we need to be doing </garnt>
<connor> and I gotta give my notice of marriage </connor>
<connor> otherwise I can't legally get married </connor>
<garnt> and I've put this off
for as long as possible </garnt>
<garnt> but it just makes it a bit awkward </garnt>
<connor> because otherwise, I would
have traveled back to the UK </connor>
<connor> a little bit later. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because now I'm back just
for literally about eight days </connor>
<connor> just to do my filming commitments </connor>
<connor> and film all the "Trash Taste"
episodes we need to film. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, yeah, I don't even know
if I'm going to tweet out </connor>
<connor> that I'm back in Japan </connor>
<connor> because- </connor>
<connor> - It's honestly not worth it, right? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause by the time I tweet it out, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be tweeting out,
"Okay, I'm back in the UK now." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so another thing </connor>
<connor> is that this is probably </connor>
<joey> the most timely "Trash Taste" episode </joey>
<joey> you'll ever be able to see, </joey>
<joey> because we are filming
this, what, three days- </joey>
<joey> - Three days. </joey>
<connor> - Three days before it actually
airs or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It is, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so it's the one time </connor>
<connor> where we can talk about current topics </connor>
<joey> and it's the one time </joey>
<garnt> where it's just like there
isn't really any current topics </garnt>
<joey> to talk about.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Before we started, we were
like, all right, guys, </connor>
<connor> it's finally time. </connor>
<joey> We can talk about some timely things. </joey>
<joey> And we just sat here for five minutes </joey>
<connor> trying to think of a timely subject. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And we couldn't think of anything. </connor>
<garnt> - We should just pick
something really irrelevant. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, oh, that Will Smith slap. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's crazy. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> Basically this notice of marriage, </connor>
<garnt> it was mostly just
about lawful procedures. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Just making sure that we
can be lawfully married. </garnt>
<garnt> So normally they just
ask you normal questions. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I was being asked,
spell your fiance's name. </garnt>
<garnt> What is her name? </garnt>
<garnt> Hopefully I know her name. </garnt>
<connor> They ask her-
- Wait, really? </connor>
<connor> That's the gotcha? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's like, spell her name, </garnt>
<garnt> then asked, what is her birthday? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't actually know
what would have happened </garnt>
<garnt> if I failed, by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What if I didn't know her birthday? </garnt>
<connor> - You don't really love her, do you! </connor>
<connor> - My last name's a pretty
tricky one to spell. </connor>
<connor> It makes no sense </connor>
<connor> so if someone got it wrong, </connor>
<connor> it wouldn't be like, "Ooh,
ooh, ooh, oh, got 'em!" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because- </joey>
<joey> - Like people who have
dyslexia and have a- </joey>
<joey> - Oh my gosh. </joey>
<connor> - And have a Polish fiancee-
- So it's like a- </connor>
<garnt> - With 17 Zs in it.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just like, "Uh?" </joey>
<joey> - Because I think they wanna check </joey>
<connor> that it's not a sham marriage </connor>
<joey> - Right, of course, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like you're not getting married- </connor>
<joey> - Like you're not just doing
it for the VISA or anything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> But, yeah, hopefully you can
spell your partner's name, </joey>
<joey> know their birthday. </joey>
<connor> If you don't, now that you
know what's gonna be asked. </connor>
<connor> You need to know where
you're getting married. </connor>
<garnt> - This'll be on the test. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is a test </garnt>
<garnt> because they separate you, right? </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, "Okay, </garnt>
<garnt> we're just gonna be asking some
simple questions, whatever." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And even though I know
it was simple questions, </garnt>
<garnt> just being separated, it was kinda like, </garnt>
<garnt> it kinda felt like being
in an interrogation </garnt>
<garnt> like, "Why are you here! </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you getting married!" </garnt>
<joey> Like, "Is she your real wife? </joey>
<joey> Is she gonna be your real wife?" </joey>
<joey> It was nothing bad like that, </joey>
<joey> it was just details about, </joey>
<joey> basic details you hopefully should know </joey>
<joey> about your future wife
and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> And then we get to the
end of the interview </joey>
<joey> and then they fucking throw
you a curve ball, right? </joey>
<joey> So here's me asking- </joey>
<joey> - Why are you gay? </joey>
<garnt> - Here's me being asked
to spell Sydney's name. </garnt>
<garnt> What is Sydney's name,
what is Sydney's birthday, </garnt>
<garnt> where are we getting married,
when are we getting married, </garnt>
<garnt> what are my parents' names,
et cetera, et cetera. </garnt>
<garnt> And then out of nowhere,
they just ask you, </garnt>
<garnt> "Are you in any way related
to Sydney Ann Poniewaz?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "What
do you mean, related? </garnt>
<garnt> As in, brother, sister,
cousin, anything like that?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, hopefully I'm about to be. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just fucking, the
fucking "Oreimo" music </garnt>
<garnt> starts playing in my mind. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, yo, is this
person a (indistinct) fan? </joey>
<joey> It was so out of left field </joey>
<joey> that I literally just... </joey>
<joey> And then I let out a laugh </joey>
<joey> and I looked him in the eye </joey>
<joey> and they just looked me dead
ass back, just like, "No." </joey>
<garnt> This is a serious question. </garnt>
<garnt> This is a serious question. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "No, I am not related. </garnt>
<garnt> I am not brother or sister. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not her cousin or anything like that." </garnt>
<joey> - What if they were just like, </joey>
<joey> "Does this song ring any bells?" </joey>
<garnt> And just plays "ClariS." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> It's like, "Does this give
you any weird feelings?" </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, they actually said afterwards, </garnt>
<garnt> "You'd be surprised how
many people say yes." </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't realize I was getting married </garnt>
<garnt> in the state of Alabama here.
- Yikes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Apparently it's surprising
how many first cousins </garnt>
<garnt> try to get married in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess there's a lot of groups </connor>
<connor> that have a tendency to
marry within families. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Do you fail the test
if you say yes to that? </joey>
<joey> Or do they just, they're like, "Okay." </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know.
- Uh... </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the incest test, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> What happens if you fail the incest test? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I wonder. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I got positive
on the incest test. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You can't legally marry if
it's certain closeness, right? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> You can't- </connor>
<connor> - Can you marry first cousins? </connor>
<connor> - I believe in the UK. </connor>
<connor> You definitely can't marry
if you're brother or sister, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not sure about first cousins. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I didn't really- </connor>
<garnt> - How many degrees of separation- </garnt>
<garnt> - Luckily, I'll never
need to worry about that. </garnt>
<connor> - How many degrees of
separation does it have to be? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Not that, I'm asking for a friend. </connor>
<connor> - This is like Google, when
you Google this too much, </connor>
<connor> Google's like, "For real?" </connor>
<garnt> Oh, he nasty, man. </garnt>
<joey> - [Camera Person] Perfectly legal </joey>
<joey> for first cousins to marry in the UK. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it? Is it actually? </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so if you say
yes to that question, </joey>
<garnt> then they'll be like, "We'll allow it, </garnt>
<garnt> but we're just gonna silently judge." </garnt>
<garnt> - Because they didn't just ask, </garnt>
<garnt> legally by blood, they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We include step siblings as well." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's "Domestic Girlfriend" all over again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt's like, "Please don't get horny, </garnt>
<garnt> please don't get horny." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, "I've been
training my entire life </garnt>
<joey> for this moment." </joey>
<garnt> - How did they know what
my favorite tags were? </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Just stands up, knocks the
coffee over with his boner. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm just nervous, I
swear, I'm just nervous. </connor>
<connor> - What do they want you to
do a 23andMe to prove it? </connor>
<connor> What do they... </connor>
<connor> If you just say, "No," are
they like, "All right then"? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you look identical? No. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I was wondering </connor>
<garnt> because we were legally, </garnt>
<connor> we had to legally prepare
most of the documents </connor>
<connor> that we-
- Thought you were gonna say, </connor>
<connor> we were legally brothers then, </connor>
<connor> it was like, ah, we're legally cousins. </connor>
<connor> - No, so we had to prepare documents </connor>
<garnt> which is all the standard documents </garnt>
<garnt> you would think you would need </garnt>
<garnt> to prepare for a marriage interview. </garnt>
<garnt> Your passport, your,
since we were flying in, </garnt>
<garnt> your tickets for flying in, </garnt>
<garnt> your proof of address, all
the standard legal documents </garnt>
<garnt> so everything else could be
easily proved via our documents. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how you prove
whether you're incest or not. </garnt>
<garnt> What if you say, "Yes"? </garnt>
<connor> What documents would you need to provide? </connor>
<connor> - They just fucking high five you, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "Nice, dude." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing)
Nice. </connor>
<connor> Me too, dude. </connor>
<connor> I was just asking, I just wanna... </connor>
<garnt> - That wasn't a legal-
- Anyway, you failed the test. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was just for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there a fucking
incest Tinder or something </connor>
<connor> where you... </connor>
<garnt> I believe that's called
Facebook, isn't it? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the code, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just Facebook, right? </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] God. </garnt>
<joey> - Have you joined any of
these Facebook groups? </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> Was it hard to get the
marriage certificate? </connor>
<connor> Like, nah, kinda just documents? </connor>
<connor> I mean, I guess you've lived in Japan </connor>
<connor> so maybe getting documents
for stuff is easy mode. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's actually, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's harder to get the documents </garnt>
<garnt> now that we live outside of Japan </garnt>
<garnt> because originally we
wanted a church wedding </garnt>
<garnt> and the more we looked into it, </garnt>
<garnt> the fucking harder it was. </garnt>
<garnt> Mostly because one, I'm not Christian. </garnt>
<garnt> It's only Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> And also a lot of churches in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> are very strict about who they
allow to get married there </garnt>
<garnt> or the priests. </garnt>
<garnt> So a lot of the times </garnt>
<garnt> you need to be a regular at the church. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you're not, already have attended </garnt>
<garnt> when you're a kid or a regular
or your family goes there, </garnt>
<garnt> then you need to attend
for a month or something, </garnt>
<garnt> just so the priest knows you. </garnt>
<garnt> And that just wasn't an option for us </garnt>
<garnt> because it's hard enough
taking a two week holiday </garnt>
<garnt> away from the boys, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't just go back to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Guys, I gotta attend church for a month." </garnt>
<garnt> - I gotta go to church. </garnt>
<garnt> - I gotta see the Lord. </garnt>
<garnt> - I gotta see the Lord, so, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately we couldn't
get a church wedding, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, that's all fine. </garnt>
<connor> We can still. </connor>
<connor> Everything is all ready now legally. </connor>
<connor> We've booked the place.
- Nice. </connor>
<connor> - We've booked the registrar.
- Nice, excited to go. </connor>
<connor> - I am so excited to go. </connor>
<connor> I'm so excited for you boys to go as well. </connor>
<connor> - All you can eat, right?
- Huh? </connor>
<connor> - All you can eat, right, I heard. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, boy! </connor>
<garnt> - I won't spoil everything
that we have planned- </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't do it, I'll be excited. </garnt>
<garnt> - Before the wedding- </garnt>
<joey> - My only question, is there food? </joey>
<garnt> That's all I need to know. </garnt>
<joey> - There is food. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, aside from
planning my own wedding, </garnt>
<garnt> I actually also was able to
attend a friend's wedding </garnt>
<joey> while I was back as well. </joey>
<garnt> It was a very, very packed,
very, very packed trip for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally attended this wedding </garnt>
<garnt> the day after I flew back to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> to meet the other boys, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - The other boys. </joey>
<garnt> - My other spouses, as Sydney says. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course, of course. </connor>
<connor> - My boyfriends. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it was so surreal </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was the first
mate's wedding I've been to </garnt>
<garnt> and it was so surreal
because a lot of weddings now </garnt>
<garnt> have been delayed to this year. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause obviously with
COVID and everything. </connor>
<connor> That includes me. </connor>
<garnt> So this year is just
fucking packed for weddings. </garnt>
<connor> I think you're-
- I'm going to three. </connor>
<garnt> - You're going to three
weddings this year, aren't you? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm going to yours, I'm
going to my friend's in Ireland </joey>
<connor> and then I'm going to
my cousin's in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And all of them were supposed
to happen two years ago. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's just all this year. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> So a lot of weddings have
been postponed to this year. </garnt>
<garnt> So I basically just got, </garnt>
<garnt> I basically got to see what
a wedding is going to be like </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing my mate get
married and everything </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing everything from
the audience perspective </garnt>
<garnt> before I'm up there,
standing up there myself. </garnt>
<garnt> - You did the beta test. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did the beta test, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Like, this looks pretty good. </joey>
<joey> I think we can go full launch soon. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I'll be honest, mate, </garnt>
<connor> I was fucking nervous as fuck. </connor>
<connor> Holy shit.
- Really? </connor>
<garnt> - It was- </garnt>
<connor> - But for someone else's wedding? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, someone else's wedding, right </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I've known this guy </garnt>
<garnt> for almost as long as
I've known Sydney, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember just being in the audience </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing him stand up there </garnt>
<garnt> and waiting for the bride to come out, </garnt>
<garnt> just seeing him try to keep it together </garnt>
<garnt> just made me think, "Fuck, man." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm feeling your nerves right now </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I know everything
he's going through. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "This
is gonna be me in a month." </garnt>
<garnt> I thought to myself,
"Fuck, if I'm this nervous </garnt>
<garnt> in the crowd, how am I going
to be when I'm up there?" </garnt>
<connor> When I'm up there standing- </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt just passes out. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's gotta be an element
of stage fright, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you just have to do something </garnt>
<garnt> in front of all your friends. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Kiss, kiss. </connor>
<garnt> - It was actually so funny though </garnt>
<garnt> because it was like we
were waiting in the venue </garnt>
<garnt> where all the family was and
the groom was up there on stage </garnt>
<garnt> with the wedding party and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, they had
this beautiful harp playing </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone was silent. </garnt>
<joey> And then there was just
this small pause, right. </joey>
<joey> As the harpist was
changing to the next song. </joey>
<joey> The bride was already, I
believe five to 10 minutes </joey>
<joey> after the ceremony had already
been scheduled to happen. </joey>
<joey> So we weren't nervous,
but it was just tense. </joey>
<joey> You could cut the tension with a knife. </joey>
<joey> Everyone wasn't talking. </joey>
<joey> And then there was this brief silence. </joey>
<joey> And then out of nowhere, </joey>
<garnt> because Sydney was one of
the bridesmaids, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Out of nowhere, we just
hear in the corner, </garnt>
<connor> just someone going, "Yes, God, yes!" </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone just started laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> And the tension was gone, </garnt>
<garnt> tension was just instantly gone. </garnt>
<joey> - Give whoever said that a metal plate. </joey>
<connor> - But no, it was, yeah... </connor>
<garnt> It's weird attending a mate's wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm curious to see- </garnt>
<connor> - I'll let you know. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm curious to see how
you guys react as well. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause for me, I was
just, after it was over, </connor>
<connor> it's just such a nice feeling. </connor>
<connor> It was the most, like every
cliche you could imagine, </connor>
<connor> but it's cliche in a nice way. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's how everyone
describes being at a wedding </connor>
<connor> but you're just drunk on positive vibes. </connor>
<connor> You're just so happy for
the couple and the future </connor>
<connor> and the bride and the groom </connor>
<connor> and just seeing them tie the knot </connor>
<connor> and just seeing them go through all that </connor>
<connor> after you know both of them </connor>
<connor> and after you've seen them
build up their relationship. </connor>
<connor> It's just such a weird moment </connor>
<garnt> just to see everything culminate </garnt>
<garnt> into this one awesome moment </garnt>
<joey> and it's just awesome to be- </joey>
<connor> - It's just so wholesome. </connor>
<connor> - It's so wholesome.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God, I was just. </connor>
<connor> I'm still glowing from
positive vibes from that event. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Damn, man." </connor>
<connor> I can't wait, I can't wait. </connor>
<connor> I can't wait. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm hype, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm very hype for it.
- I'm hype. </garnt>
<garnt> - Interesting 'cause it's
like my friends in Japan </garnt>
<joey> and my friends in the UK
are gonna see each other. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So it's the same thing for you. </connor>
<connor> It's gonna be strange. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was
talking to Connor earlier </garnt>
<garnt> where mostly it's like,
for a lot of people, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just gonna be our Japan lot </garnt>
<connor> and our UK friends
meeting for the first time </connor>
<connor> and Connor's the only one </connor>
<connor> who is kinda, got- </connor>
<connor> - Bridging between... </connor>
<connor> - Bridging between both. </connor>
<connor> - I know everyone, I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<garnt> - He knows everyone, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's gonna be interesting.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause normally, when your friend groups </connor>
<garnt> live in other countries, </garnt>
<garnt> they don't normally
interact with each other. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's gonna be really interesting. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Actually, one of the funnest
parts of the wedding planning </connor>
<garnt> 'cause we've been doing a
lot of wedding planning, </garnt>
<connor> some of it's stressful, some of it not, </connor>
<connor> but by far the most funnest points </connor>
<connor> is I get to choose who
sits to next to each other- </connor>
<connor> - Oh man. </connor>
<connor> Puzzle level difficulty. </connor>
<connor> - Just segregating all
the Japanese white people </connor>
<garnt> to one side- </garnt>
<garnt> - 10 out of 10 difficulty level puzzle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so a lot of, </garnt>
<garnt> some wedding parties,
they do a soft segregation </garnt>
<garnt> between the- </garnt>
<garnt> - Soft segregate... </garnt>
<garnt> - And it is what it feels like. </garnt>
<connor> - Bit of discrimination is
always necessary, you know. </connor>
<joey> - But it's not discrimination, </joey>
<garnt> it's soft segregation. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what we're calling it, </joey>
<joey> that's what we're calling it, right? </joey>
<joey> Because sometimes you go to a wedding, </joey>
<joey> you can clearly see,
that's the family table, </joey>
<garnt> that's the one friend group table, </garnt>
<garnt> that's the other friend group table. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you always have people
you have to invite, right, </connor>
<garnt> who you're like, I have to invite them </garnt>
<connor> but I know they're gonna cause problems </connor>
<garnt> if I put them near other people. </garnt>
<garnt> - So we decided to do
something a little different. </garnt>
<garnt> Without spoiling who sits next to who. </garnt>
<garnt> We had a fun time being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Who would get along with who </garnt>
<garnt> while not knowing each other too well?" </garnt>
<garnt> So we had a think </garnt>
<garnt> about what kinda
personalities would get on </garnt>
<garnt> so we didn't sit people next to each other </garnt>
<garnt> who they might be so familiar with. </garnt>
<garnt> Not too far away from just
being complete strangers. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was a fun time
just pairing people up </garnt>
<garnt> and pairing friendship groups up </garnt>
<garnt> and just seeing the absolute
state of some of the tables </garnt>
<garnt> that we have planned </garnt>
<garnt> because we've basically just put all </garnt>
<garnt> of the fucking big
characters on one table. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - And, yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun </connor>
<connor> just to see if you guys get
along well with each other. </connor>
<connor> Because it's like, as you said, </connor>
<connor> it's like two friendship
groups kinda merging </connor>
<connor> because I don't actually
have so much family </connor>
<connor> coming to my wedding. </connor>
<connor> It's actually a small
wedding in comparison </connor>
<connor> to other weddings I've been to. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, what do you
guys count as a small wedding? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, </connor>
<garnt> most of the weddings I've been to </garnt>
<connor> have been very much dominated by family. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Ours is 80% mates. </connor>
<garnt> - Ah, that's good, then.
- Yeah, that's good. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, that's good? </connor>
<connor> Small weddings or medium sized wedding </connor>
<garnt> is different depending on
whatever culture you're from. </garnt>
<garnt> 100 people is, I'd say
a medium sized wedding, </garnt>
<connor> that's medium. </connor>
<connor> 100 people is tiny compared to
an Indian wedding, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I was talking to a guy who
went to an Indian wedding </garnt>
<garnt> and they had 1,000 people
going or something. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a concert. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Indian weddings are
basically what happened </garnt>
<garnt> if you actually go on your Facebook group </garnt>
<garnt> and you invite everyone
in your friend group. </garnt>
<joey> - And everyone said yes. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and everyone said yes! </connor>
<connor> - And then they all get
to bring a plus one. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Part of the reason, because
we do have a massive family </garnt>
<garnt> but we didn't want a
massive, massive wedding </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause that's just such a headache </garnt>
<garnt> so we were just like, "You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> We're gonna have the
main wedding in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> and then we'll bring the
wedding to the family. </garnt>
<garnt> We'll go on tour, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> We'll go on tour." </garnt>
<garnt> - The wedding tour. </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, we're having a
different reception thing </garnt>
<garnt> for our family in the US
and Thailand way after- </garnt>
<connor> - That'll be nice, though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, way after the wedding. </garnt>
<connor> - Go and hit up the globe, dude. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry? </connor>
<connor> - Going hitting up all
the spots in the globe. </connor>
<garnt> - Mr. Worldwide. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mr. Worldwide here-
- Is going on tour. </garnt>
<connor> Wedding on tour. </connor>
<connor> - Has to let the world know- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you only had one wedding? </connor>
<connor> Cringe, dude. Cringe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I want to be able to talk
to everyone at my wedding </connor>
<connor> and share the positive vibes, but- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right, right, of course. </connor>
<connor> - When you get over to 100 or 150 people </connor>
<connor> which, it definitely would
have been our wedding </connor>
<connor> if we invited all of the family </connor>
<connor> from both our sides from abroad. </connor>
<connor> You get to a point where it's our wedding, </connor>
<connor> it's meant to be our happiest moment </connor>
<connor> but you don't get time to
share it with the people </connor>
<connor> that you want to share it to. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - You see everyone talking </connor>
<connor> but you, most of your interactions </connor>
<connor> are just, "Oh, you having a good time?" </connor>
<connor> You have a five-minute
conversation and that's it. </connor>
<connor> It's basically just like going
to a convention, you know? </connor>
<connor> And going to a panel or something </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's the amount
of interaction I have </connor>
<garnt> with people who line up
for a meetup or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- But I want </garnt>
<garnt> more of an interaction and more time </garnt>
<garnt> to get to vibe </garnt>
<garnt> with people at my own
fucking wedding, I guess, so. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know people handle </garnt>
<garnt> massive fucking weddings of
300, 500, whatever, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I've been to, </joey>
<joey> I went to my friend's
wedding, Japanese guy </joey>
<joey> who I went to university with </joey>
<joey> and it's a tradition, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it's a full on tradition </joey>
<joey> but usually the tradition is
if you have a full-time job, </joey>
<connor> you already have a job- </connor>
<connor> - You invite your colleagues. </connor>
<connor> - You invite your colleagues
and you invite your bosses. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, the boss has to come as well. </connor>
<connor> - The boss has to go as well-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So I went to it </garnt>
<garnt> and there was soft segregation happening </garnt>
<garnt> and I was on the table </garnt>
<garnt> of mates who I went to school with table </garnt>
<garnt> but we realized </garnt>
<garnt> that was one table out of
40 tables that were there. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<joey> - Because there was probably
400 people at this wedding. </joey>
<joey> All work colleagues, all
bosses and all family </joey>
<joey> and there was just me
and three school mates </joey>
<joey> who were there just being
like, "Yeah, so how you been? </joey>
<garnt> It's been a while. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know any of these other
people, but good wedding." </connor>
<garnt> - Did you have to line
up to give your blessing? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I've been to some weddings </connor>
<connor> where we have to do that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to- </garnt>
<connor> - Line up to give your
blessing? What's that? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah because there is so many people </garnt>
<garnt> at the wedding, right, </garnt>
<connor> and the bride and groom
only have so much time- </connor>
<connor> - Everyone takes a turn lining up in line? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I went to a Thai wedding </connor>
<connor> where we literally had to line up </connor>
<connor> to be like, "Congratulations, guys." </connor>
<garnt> And they had this stage </garnt>
<garnt> where they sat on a
fucking sofa or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - I've only been to white
people weddings, so I don't... </connor>
<joey> - I literally had to line up </joey>
<connor> to shake my mate's hand.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because after the
reception and everything </joey>
<connor> and during the food and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> and they're walking around and stuff, </connor>
<connor> saying hello to everyone-
- That's cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It's a very
good system, though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's a good system </connor>
<connor> but it was also weird just lining up </connor>
<connor> next to a bunch of salarymen </connor>
<connor> to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, I'm just here to
shake my mate's hand, you know." </connor>
<joey> - Efficient, I like it. </joey>
<connor> I like the efficiency of it all. </connor>
<connor> Oh, you didn't see me at the wedding? </connor>
<connor> Shut up, we got five minutes
and a handshake, fuck off. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's like an idol handshake. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is, right. </connor>
<connor> (Connor grunting) </connor>
<connor> - How many of my albums did you buy? </connor>
<garnt> - I bought 10 of your CDs, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You're just in the wedding like, ch, ch. </connor>
<connor> - [Camera Person] Asian weddings as well, </connor>
<garnt> when you're lining up, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you can slip
some money to pass it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - [Camera Person] I got you. </connor>
<connor> - What, like a back alley deal? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if this
feels correct in saying </connor>
<connor> but it just feels like the
Supreme store of weddings, </connor>
<garnt> Asian weddings are. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like how much can you flex? </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone brings in Supreme. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's like-
- Oh yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, oh look at this spread, dude, </garnt>
<garnt> way more food than you'd ever need. </garnt>
<garnt> Bring everyone you know. </garnt>
<garnt> Why? </garnt>
<connor> Just so I can have the
capacity bigger on Facebook. </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause a lot of Asian
weddings I've been to, </garnt>
<connor> it's like a statement. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's like a flight. </connor>
<connor> - It's about sending a message. </connor>
<garnt> - It is literally about sending a message. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it trying to tell people
how successful you are? </connor>
<joey> Or it's like, what's the? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's more so about,
look at how happy we are </joey>
<garnt> and this is the physical representation </garnt>
<joey> of how happy and well off
we are for being happy. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because the
amount of wedding politics </garnt>
<garnt> that go into an Asian, it is a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> It is a thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's not even about inviting </garnt>
<garnt> your immediate friends and family. </garnt>
<garnt> You got your parents'
immediate friends and family </garnt>
<garnt> and people you grew up with
and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> If you are not invited
to an Asian wedding, </garnt>
<garnt> you have fucked up in some way. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - This legit sounds like the Red Wedding </connor>
<garnt> from "Game of Thrones." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] It is! </garnt>
<connor> - You failed to invite me to the wedding </connor>
<garnt> thus you have betrayed my clan. </garnt>
<connor> - It is!
- You will die now. </connor>
<connor> You have insulted the House of Maneetapho, </connor>
<connor> you will not be forgiven for this. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why I didn't want that side </garnt>
<connor> just involved in my wedding. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a peace envoy. </connor>
<connor> Fear not, there is another! </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> The scroll comes down. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've gotta appease the family. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Fear not, we are bringing
the wedding to you! </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Burst open the doors. </garnt>
<connor> - This is some "Game
of Thrones" shit, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, every
Asian wedding I've been to </connor>
<garnt> is the most extra thing
I've ever seen in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's unfortunate that it's
also extrapolated by the fact </garnt>
<joey> that every Asian family I
know is fucking massive. </joey>
<joey> It's absolutely massive. </joey>
<joey> You have to invite-
- Especially Southeast Asia. </joey>
<garnt> - Especially, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> If I had my wedding in my, </garnt>
<connor> I'd then have to invite all my cousins </connor>
<connor> and all my-
- Cousin's colleagues. </connor>
<connor> - Just the entirety of
Bangkok, essentially. </connor>
<garnt> - My cousin's colleagues. </garnt>
<connor> - The entire population of
Bangkok at Garnt's wedding. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - So yeah, that's, </joey>
<joey> I definitely would not
have been able to plan that </joey>
<joey> along with just being outside the country. </joey>
<garnt> So I was like, "Fuck that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna have a
small, manageable wedding </garnt>
<garnt> and just enjoy it, right?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And just enjoy the wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Fuck yeah, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- That sounds nice. </garnt>
<joey> I'm excited for it, man. </joey>
<joey> - Did you get an
overwhelming amount of people </joey>
<connor> in your Twitch chat </connor>
<connor> asking if we were going to Garnt's wedding </connor>
<connor> or when Garnt's wedding was?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - As if they were also planning to go. </connor>
<connor> - They were like, "You're
gonna film it, right?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "No, no." </connor>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<joey> - I got that so many times. </joey>
<connor> People were like, </connor>
<connor> "So this is a 'Trash
Taste' special, right?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like the wedding special. </connor>
<connor> It's like, no! </connor>
<connor> Could you imagine if I just rocked up </connor>
<connor> with a fucking camera </connor>
<connor> being like, all right, so challenge. </connor>
<connor> - Joey fucking rocks up </connor>
<garnt> with one of the fucking film cameras, </garnt>
<connor> just like, "Yeah, what's going on?" </connor>
<joey> - We got fucking 10 different video crews </joey>
<joey> just filming every angle of this wedding. </joey>
<garnt> - GoPro on every corner of the room. </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor's got a GoPro on his
fucking forehead like POV. </garnt>
<connor> - Pretty bad, four out
of five, tier list review </connor>
<garnt> of all the free drinks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean-
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was actually, </garnt>
<garnt> I barely took any pictures
at the wedding I attended. </garnt>
<garnt> Because one, I just felt like, </garnt>
<garnt> we have some pictures, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was more pictures to
share in between our mates </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, we might,
we'll probably share. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Me and Sydney will probably
share a few pictures. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you got a wedding
photographer, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know how much </connor>
<garnt> we're gonna share to social
media yet, I don't know yet. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of, I will decide- </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt will be wearing a suit </connor>
<connor> and Sydney will be wearing a dress, </connor>
<connor> that's kind of, spoiler alert. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And everyone will be nicely
dressed, that's about it. </connor>
<connor> - It's not gonna be any different </connor>
<connor> just 'cause we're YouTubers. </connor>
<connor> We're not like, whoa, wacky! </connor>
<connor> It's just, I don't know,
it's gonna be a wedding. </connor>
<joey> - Just a gold play button
in the middle, right? </joey>
<connor> - That'd be hid. </connor>
<garnt> - Susan comes down, dude. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Yo, Garnt, dude, really
happy for "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> Really happy for you. </connor>
<garnt> - Susan comes and gives her blessing. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> We say our vows in front of Susan. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just one get out of
demonetization free card. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'll take that. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, just this once. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> there have been other YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who have very much
documented their wedding </connor>
<connor> and everyone's different
in terms of choosing </connor>
<connor> how much they wish to share and
it's entirely up to everyone </connor>
<connor> but you have to understand
that everyone's a bit different </connor>
<connor> in terms of how much they choose to share. </connor>
<joey> Because it is a very private event. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you gotta respect the privacy. </joey>
<joey> - It's a wedding so the way I see about it </joey>
<joey> is that, I'm only gonna
get one wedding in my life </joey>
<garnt> so how much of this do I
want to share with the world? </garnt>
<garnt> How much of this do I want
to keep between myself </garnt>
<garnt> and my close mates and family? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know yet. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know yet. </joey>
<joey> I'll think about it and we'll decide. </joey>
<connor> - Content, content, content, content. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, 'cause the one- </connor>
<garnt> - You only get one
wedding, Garnt, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause you always have
to battle the thought </garnt>
<garnt> of you know that whatever you post, </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna get the most engagement- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- Of course, of course! </garnt>
<garnt> - That you're ever going to get- </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I post a video of this, </garnt>
<garnt> I know it's gonna get fucking
two, three million views, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Easy, easy. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's free content, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even have to,
I'm gonna do it anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just free content! </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, "Honey, I know
this is a really personal thing </joey>
<joey> but that click rate through, though." </joey>
<connor> - What's up, guys, I'm at the altar </connor>
<joey> with the boys, about to say my vows. </joey>
<joey> - Seven mid rolls on that shit. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> Whoo! My God. </connor>
<connor> - Might forward jump into that. </connor>
<connor> And our sponsor for the day. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Might be a good place to
actually put it, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Bro, imagine if we
fucking livestream that. </garnt>
<garnt> Imagine the fucking Super Chats, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - IRL. </garnt>
<garnt> - VTubers could dream of
getting the Super Chats- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- We would get </connor>
<garnt> at the wedding, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Please, Garnt will not say his vows </connor>
<connor> until we get at least two grand. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> We are not moving from this spot... </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, are you excited to go, </garnt>
<joey> are you guys excited to
go to England, though? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause-
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's gonna be your second
time in England, right? </connor>
<connor> - Second time. </connor>
<garnt> - First one didn't count. </garnt>
<garnt> First one doesn't count.
- What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - You barely saw anything. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you were there for how long? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even remember. </joey>
<joey> Five days, I think? </joey>
<joey> Not even a week, I don't think. </joey>
<connor> - Take you to a good
Wetherspoons this time. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you took me to-
- A shit one. </joey>
<connor> - Arguably one of the shittiest ones. </connor>
<connor> - It was probably the
shittest Wetherspoons. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Take you to a good one. </connor>
<joey> - You still haven't taken me to fucking... </joey>
<joey> You still haven't given
me a Tesco meal deal </joey>
<joey> or anything like that. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, we'll do that too. </connor>
<connor> I thought maybe, should
I do a tier list video? </connor>
<connor> I probably shouldn't say that on camera </connor>
<connor> 'cause then people will now expect it. </connor>
<connor> I want to do a meal deal tier list. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey and Garnt] A meal deal tier list. </connor>
<connor> - Of the optimum thing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause someone, we spoke about. </connor>
<connor> Wait, did we speak
about it on the episode? </connor>
<connor> No, no, we didn't.
- Not sure. </connor>
<connor> - Can't remember. </connor>
<connor> Oh fuck it, I won't speak about it. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, what am I gonna say now then? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Meal deal tier list. </connor>
<connor> - I'll do a meal deal tier list. </connor>
<joey> - How many meal deals are there? </joey>
<joey> - Combination's are endless, Joey. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - Endless.
- Damn. </connor>
<connor> - There's quite a lot actually. </connor>
<connor> And depending on which stores
you go to, different things. </connor>
<connor> So it's really-
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is that what the
wedding food's gonna be? </connor>
<connor> - I love how Garnt's like,
my wedding, my wedding. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yo, the meal deal combinations, </connor>
<connor> though, it's gonna... </connor>
<connor> - Let me show you about that. </connor>
<joey> - That's what's gonna be
at Garnt's wedding, right? </joey>
<connor> Garnt's like, </connor>
<joey> "You can choose any Tesco
meal deal you want, baby." </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone else is gonna get
a nice, fancy five-course meal </garnt>
<garnt> and on Connor's desk, we're
just gonna give him a meal deal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Meal deal. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll be like, you're all
clowns, you're all clowns. </connor>
<connor> This is worth five pound retail. </connor>
<connor> I got it for three pound 50. </connor>
<connor> Mic fell down, bro. </connor>
<connor> He's like, yo, you get a meal deal, what? </connor>
<joey> - No, I'm excited though, 'cause- </joey>
<connor> - We'll take you to Greggs as well. </connor>
<connor> Yo, you gotta go Greggs.
- What's Greggs again? </connor>
<joey> - Pasties. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the pasties place. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotta try this, </joey>
<garnt> I gotta try these pasties. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, like, 'cause we're
probably gonna be there- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Pasties, pasties. </garnt>
<garnt> - A little longer now,
at least a week and a bit </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm planning, hopefully </garnt>
<joey> for Connor to take me to Wales. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we'll see if we can do that. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I can do that.
- We'll see if we can do that. </connor>
<connor> - I told my parents, I was
like, yeah, maybe I'll see you. </connor>
<connor> Maybe.
- Yeah, maybe. </connor>
<connor> - We'll see, we'll see.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Wales is fun though. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause otherwise, let's be real, </joey>
<joey> I'm never gonna go to Wales otherwise. </joey>
<connor> - Beautiful place. </connor>
<garnt> - It'll be the only chance, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- It'll be the only chance. </garnt>
<connor> - Amazing hiking in Wales.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause you guys are gonna be there </connor>
<garnt> and a lot of other people </garnt>
<garnt> are gonna be flying in as well </garnt>
<garnt> so it's gonna be really busy. </garnt>
<joey> I guess to the days leading up </joey>
<garnt> and the even days that you fly in. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<joey> - I'm hype, though.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm hype. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Should be good. </garnt>
<joey> - It's gonna be way more packed </joey>
<joey> than your last trip to England, I think. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I can't remember, </joey>
<garnt> why did you come to your
last trip to England? </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause Aki and I were already in Europe. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that's it. </garnt>
<connor> - Because we went to a con in Finland </connor>
<connor> and we were just like, "Let's
just go on a Europe tour." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So and then, yeah, the
last stop was the UK. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we were like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I've never been
to the UK, weirdly," </connor>
<connor> even though I have a lot
of mates who live there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was good though. </connor>
<connor> Brighton was cool. </connor>
<connor> I liked Brighton.
- Brighton's a cool city. </connor>
<connor> - I like Brighton. </connor>
<garnt> Mid, mid. </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll have a </garnt>
<connor> lad's night out there.
- Mid city. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause Kevin's been fucking
messaging me every day </connor>
<garnt> about how keen he is for a lad's night </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Okay, Kevin." </garnt>
<garnt> - He's always keen for a lad's night out. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's always keen for a lad, </garnt>
<garnt> Kevin, when aren't you
keen for a lad's night? </garnt>
<garnt> Let's be honest, Kevin. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> did you get to see a
lot of London last time? </garnt>
<connor> Because I don't know- </connor>
<connor> - Not really. </connor>
<garnt> - No, 'cause he was in
Brighton most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You were in Brighton
for most of the time </connor>
<connor> and I don't know </connor>
<garnt> if you showed him any
of London, that's all. </garnt>
<joey> - London's hard to- </joey>
<joey> - You took us to a bunch of the, </joey>
<connor> well, I mean you, 'cause Aki's parents </connor>
<connor> were there as well, right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you took us to all of
the touristy places, I guess. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Luckily London is really
convenient for tourist stuff </joey>
<joey> where they put everything
really close together. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So you can smash it all out </connor>
<connor> in a day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, with
London, it's kind of hard </connor>
<connor> if you don't drink. </connor>
<joey> - The only place I remember </joey>
<joey> was you took us to the
"Harry Potter" place, </joey>
<connor> the King's Cross, whatever it is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the Platform 9
3/4 where you run into it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so weird taking
people to King's Cross </garnt>
<connor> because I just see it as a train station. </connor>
<connor> - It is.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and it is. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think how people imagine it </connor>
<connor> is just going to the "Harry Potter" land </connor>
<connor> in Universal Studios or something, right? </connor>
<joey> Where you have fucking Diagon Alley, </joey>
<joey> they serve you whatever the beer is there. </joey>
<joey> - The butterbeer.
- Butterbeer or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And it's not, it's just one- </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Cart in the wall. </joey>
<joey> - One half cut out train trolley </joey>
<connor> and a shop </connor>
<connor> and then the rest of it is
just a fucking normal station. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty busy, though. </connor>
<garnt> - It is really busy.
- It's always busy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's always busy. </garnt>
<joey> - Luckily, they put it out
of the way of the station </joey>
<joey> so if you're gonna get a train, </joey>
<joey> you don't actually go near it. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But there's a pub
behind it that sometimes, </connor>
<joey> I don't know why I've been to it </joey>
<joey> but it's kind of annoying to, </joey>
<joey> you've gotta get through all the tourists. </joey>
<connor> - Is it "Harry Potter" themed at all </connor>
<connor> or is it just a regular pub? </connor>
<connor> - No, it's a normal
pub, it's a normal pub. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's just a normal pub. </garnt>
<garnt> - Very normal pub.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a pub though. </garnt>
<garnt> I do miss pubs, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't wait to go to the pub again. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what I've been missing. </connor>
<garnt> That's it, really. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I will say, </garnt>
<connor> England has definitely
upped up their bar game </connor>
<connor> since I've been away.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a lot more gaming bars </connor>
<garnt> and themed bars as well.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anything's better than the
gaming bar you guys took me to. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I went to a better one </joey>
<joey> when I was back last time and it was good. </joey>
<connor> It's just, again, really expensive. </connor>
<connor> Really, really expensive. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's the price you pay. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, literally that's
the price you pay for the- </garnt>
<garnt> - We live in a society. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - For the-
- What a price to pay. </connor>
<connor> - For the upscale of just themed bars </connor>
<connor> and everything like that </connor>
<connor> 'cause I know we've
complained about it before </connor>
<connor> on "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> and I remember this time </connor>
<connor> we also celebrated a birthday as well </connor>
<connor> and Sydney's maid of honor, </connor>
<connor> I say maid of honor </connor>
<connor> because her maid of
honor is actually a guy. </connor>
<connor> He booked this very weird, not weird, </connor>
<connor> but it was a themed bar </connor>
<connor> where it was basically a cowboy themed bar </connor>
<connor> but it's not just a themed bar, </connor>
<connor> it was a whole experience. </connor>
<connor> It feels like I'm undermining it </connor>
<connor> just calling it a themed bar </connor>
<connor> so you go in and it's like
you just woke up in the South, </connor>
<connor> Southern America during deep, </connor>
<connor> when was the cowboy fucking years? </connor>
<connor> I don't remember. </connor>
<connor> - 1800s?
- Like 1800s? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Basically "Westworld." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically "Westworld." </connor>
<connor> Everyone's talking in a Southern accent </connor>
<connor> and they have this, </connor>
<connor> basically it's like bring
your own booze, right? </connor>
<connor> And what they do is they take your booze, </connor>
<connor> whatever you choose to bring </connor>
<connor> and then they will make
whatever drinks is suitable </connor>
<garnt> with all of the booze that you brang. </garnt>
<garnt> So you don't even buy alcohol there, </garnt>
<garnt> you get served alcohol there
based on what you bring </garnt>
<garnt> and you get taken in
and everyone's a cowboy </garnt>
<garnt> and then suddenly a sheriff walks in </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's this
whole fucking storyline </garnt>
<garnt> that's going on. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, you know-
- I just wanna get drunk. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> They serve you fucking
moonshine down a back alley </garnt>
<joey> and all this stuff. </joey>
<garnt> And it's this entire
experience, entire storyline </garnt>
<garnt> that you get put into </garnt>
<garnt> that is basically just a bar experience. </garnt>
<joey> - This sounds a like
Universal Studios ride. </joey>
<garnt> - It kind of is! </garnt>
<garnt> It kind of is except with- </garnt>
<garnt> - Except they serve you booze. </garnt>
<connor> - Except with a lot of alcohol. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I got, because-
- That's awesome. </connor>
<connor> - Because you bring your own booze there </connor>
<connor> and there's no limit or
there's no regulation </connor>
<connor> for what you have to bring there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You mix a lot of fucking drinks there. </garnt>
<garnt> So you end up getting very drunk </garnt>
<garnt> and then you wake up </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just seeing </garnt>
<garnt> a bunch of fucking
cowboys go at each other. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, "Where the fuck am I? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in the middle of London right now." </garnt>
<joey> It's so fucking weird. </joey>
<garnt> I gotta take you guys there, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just sounds like a challenge. </garnt>
<joey> - That sounds so strange. </joey>
<joey> - To bring all your own booze, right? </joey>
<joey> And then it's just like, </joey>
<connor> I guarantee there's been instances </connor>
<connor> where just someone just brings in bottles </connor>
<connor> of just nothing but hard liquor. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Probably. </connor>
<joey> - Just puts it on the thing
and just be like, "Make it." </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Just vodka, make me a drink. </connor>
<garnt> - What you gonna do? </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, there is a lot more choice now </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of just interesting
bars, bar experiences. </garnt>
<garnt> It's definitely leveled up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, London seems to be changing a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is changing a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> Brighton's changing a lot as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I hardly even recognize the
city I grew up in anymore </garnt>
<garnt> just because it's become
this hip modern place. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's gone to the point where, </garnt>
<garnt> you know you go to some American
bars or some bars abroad </garnt>
<garnt> and you just think, yeah, man,
every bar needs its thing. </garnt>
<garnt> So I went to this, I was
just perusing Brighton. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there was just this
bar with a zip liner on it </garnt>
<garnt> or a zip line on it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, that's the weirdest gimmick </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever seen.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But, fuck, I wanna go on it, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, a zip liner going out of the bar </joey>
<garnt> or a zip liner going into the bar? </garnt>
<garnt> - A zip line going out of the bar. </garnt>
<garnt> So basically there is a bar
which just shows, in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> any gimmick can work if
there's a bar next to it. </garnt>
<garnt> So I think what happened, right </garnt>
<garnt> is they built the zip
line on the sea front </garnt>
<connor> and so there's a zip line, </connor>
<connor> so you can climb up and
you can zip line down and- </connor>
<connor> - Sounds like a dangerous
combination with alcohol. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can see the
beach and everything. </connor>
<connor> And then on the bottom of the
zip line, there's just a bar. </connor>
<joey> So it's just now the bar
with the zip line on it. </joey>
<joey> - So people literally just zip line </joey>
<joey> into the seat of the bar, just like. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> You start off in the bar </joey>
<garnt> and you can buy tickets
to go on the zip line </garnt>
<garnt> and just zip line down to the
opposite side of the beach </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that.
- Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's the bar. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just the bar.
- Fair enough. </garnt>
<joey> - To be fair, I would probably go on that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I would probably do that, </joey>
<garnt> that sounds really fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just shows in the UK,
if you wanna come up </garnt>
<garnt> with a concept for a bar, </garnt>
<garnt> just come up with a wacky concept. </garnt>
<garnt> Doesn't matter what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Go karts.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - With alcohol. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just put some-
- They serve you </garnt>
<connor> while you're on the go. </connor>
<garnt> - Just put some activity and alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> and British people will come to it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's yeah
fairly accurate, I'd say. </connor>
<garnt> Pretty spot on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so, so yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm excited for you to come, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm excited for you guys to
come back to London this time </garnt>
<garnt> because there is a lot more to do now, so. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sure we can plan
out a lot more fun things </garnt>
<garnt> for you to do, Joey.
- Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't remember what
I showed you last time. </garnt>
<joey> I took you to Devil's Dyke, which is- </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah! </joey>
<joey> Which is still one of the
most questionably named places </joey>
<garnt> I've ever been to. </garnt>
<garnt> It's basically, it's just a hill. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just a hill.
- It's a really nice hill. </garnt>
<garnt> That's about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just laughing the entire way </garnt>
<connor> when I found out what it
was called and I was like, </connor>
<connor> they really didn't think that one through. </connor>
<garnt> - English is a funny language. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - English is a very funny language. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a nice place, </garnt>
<garnt> that was a nice drive.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's about it really. </garnt>
<joey> - That's about it. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember </joey>
<garnt> 'cause you didn't stay
in the UK for that long. </garnt>
<joey> - No.
- I don't remember. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, we also drank at Brighton beach </joey>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But other than that, that's about it. </connor>
<connor> - What have you been up to, Joey? </connor>
<connor> Since Garnt has been gone? </connor>
<joey> - A lot of stuff I can't talk about yet. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - But I hung out with Nano the other day. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. I saw that.
- Oh, nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - She wanted to hang out
and we went to karaoke </garnt>
<garnt> and apparently she hasn't
gone to karaoke in 15 years. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well that's her life. </garnt>
<joey> - She sings for a job. </joey>
<connor> - I get it, but still, I
mean, it's unavoidable. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<garnt> - She just goes to karaoke on stage </garnt>
<joey> and in the studio, right? </joey>
<joey> - And then she sang, </joey>
<joey> and then we got, we sang a bunch of songs </joey>
<garnt> and then I was like, "Can
you sing one of your songs?" </garnt>
<garnt> Just jokingly.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause she has her songs on karaoke </garnt>
<garnt> so I was like, "You have
to seize that opportunity." </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - And she's like, </garnt>
<connor> "I've never sung my own
songs at karaoke before." </connor>
<connor> And so I thought that was gonna be a no. </connor>
<garnt> That was a nice way of her saying no. </garnt>
<connor> She then proceeds to put
in literally every song. </connor>
<connor> - You're like, "Oh, I got a concert." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Maybe- </garnt>
<joey> - I basically just got a free concert. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe no one asked her before. </garnt>
<connor> - No one had the gall.
- Who asked? No one. </connor>
<connor> - She's like, "I've been waiting
for someone to ask me this </connor>
<joey> my entire life, Joey." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the audacity of this guy to ask. </joey>
<joey> Nah, but she was really fucking cool </joey>
<garnt> and we got to hang out </garnt>
<garnt> and we're gonna hang out a lot more. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Other than that, I've just been, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> every day I've just been hanging
out with someone different. </connor>
<connor> - Nice.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's always fun though.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Nice.
- Just going out </connor>
<connor> and yeah, it's been good. </connor>
<connor> It's being sociable
again after the pandemic </connor>
<connor> has been really nice. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, right. No kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you had a chance
to hang out with Aki a lot </garnt>
<garnt> because there's a lot of
things we can't talk about, </garnt>
<garnt> but one thing I will say </garnt>
<garnt> is that Joey didn't get to
see a lot of Aki last month. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I think I saw her-
- Like not at all. </garnt>
<joey> - For a week, maybe, </joey>
<joey> so she was like, "Yeah, let's
hang out a little more," </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Yeah, we
should probably do that." </joey>
<joey> - That's like a-
- I did, I did though. </joey>
<joey> I did. </joey>
<joey> We hung out a lot. </joey>
<joey> We go on once a week dates </joey>
<joey> just to nearby places
and hang out and stuff </joey>
<joey> and yeah, it's really good.
- Oh yeah? </joey>
<joey> - I've discovered a lot of Tokyo
in this past week, I think. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Just because I've been going out </connor>
<garnt> to all sorts of different places </garnt>
<garnt> with all sorts of different people. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was in Shibuya just yesterday </garnt>
<connor> for my friend, Luke's birthday. </connor>
<connor> And we went to all these new
places I'd never been before. </connor>
<connor> We were in areas of
Shibuya where I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, this is"- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Shibuya's huge.
- "This exists." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, it's
got really cool bars. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just so weird </garnt>
<garnt> that Tokyo's just one of those places </garnt>
<garnt> where everything is just so tight knit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And kind of hidden </garnt>
<garnt> that there are just entire areas of cities </garnt>
<joey> you've probably never seen before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you're just like,
"Oh, oh, this place exists. </joey>
<joey> And this is kind of cool, yeah." </joey>
<connor> - My Google Maps is fucked </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've saved so many
restaurants and bars I liked. </connor>
<joey> None of them mean anything now </joey>
<connor> because I don't know which one is which. </connor>
<connor> - You literally have to fucking- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, when I'm trying to remember a bar, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, there's no search function </joey>
<joey> so I'm literally, I'm like,
I think it was this area </joey>
<connor> and I'm just checking all
my hearts in that area </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "Okay, great, </connor>
<connor> it's not a fucking,
it's great, I'm fucked." </connor>
<garnt> There's no way to categorize. </garnt>
<connor> - I've actually started doing that now </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I didn't do that before but because </garnt>
<connor> when you go to so many different places </connor>
<connor> and you're trying to recall
that one place in Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right, right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the hardest fucking city </connor>
<connor> 'cause in most other cities, </connor>
<connor> you can be like, "What is this bar?" </connor>
<garnt> And you type in the
description of the bar. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, "Great, there's
only one bar in this area. </garnt>
<garnt> It's five minutes away." </garnt>
<garnt> You type in the vague description in Tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> and seven different bars pop up </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, "It was
one of these, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know if I'm
describing it right." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- You know? </connor>
<connor> - It's great 'cause when Emily
and Daidus just moved here, </connor>
<connor> it's like, all right,
what food do you want? </connor>
<joey> I have a thing for that. </joey>
<joey> Oh, what kind of bar vibe do you want? </joey>
<connor> All right, I've got three of each kind. </connor>
<connor> Oh, we're in this area? </connor>
<connor> Okay, we'll go to this one. </connor>
<connor> I have a thing. </connor>
<connor> I've saved everything so I've
got every kind of restaurant, </connor>
<connor> every kind of vibe you'd want. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- So I've got a bunch. </connor>
<connor> So it's fantastic. </connor>
<joey> - But it's become so extensive now </joey>
<connor> that you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, so you're going for a
specific vibe, specific food, </connor>
<connor> I know eight places." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Which one of these
eight places do you want? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and then it's like, "All right, </joey>
<joey> how expensive do you want?" </joey>
<joey> Okay, (indistinct), do you wanna be </joey>
<connor> a five-minute walk from the station, </connor>
<connor> 10-minute walk from the station? </connor>
<connor> Okay, we're gonna go to
this bar afterwards though, </connor>
<connor> is that okay with you? </connor>
<connor> And then it's like, all right, okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> But I'm still trying to find more as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So many places, I'll
never get to see them all. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Honestly, yeah, </joey>
<joey> even just in Shibuya, </joey>
<connor> there's just so many places
to just eat or drink out </connor>
<connor> that you could-
- Oh yeah, Shibuya's- </connor>
<garnt> - You could go out every night to a bar. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Somewhere different </connor>
<joey> just in Shibuya and it'll
probably take you years. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> One thing I definitely noticed </garnt>
<garnt> going back to the UK
for two weeks that I did </garnt>
<joey> is that I've definitely taken for granted </joey>
<joey> how easy it is to find somewhere
to stay out late in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - Ha ha ha ha, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I've forgotten about
that in the UK 'cause- </connor>
<connor> - It hits 12 and it's impossible. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it hits 12 and every
bar closes, every pub closes, </connor>
<connor> so the only place that you
can vibely go to basically, </connor>
<connor> is a club. </connor>
<connor> And most of the time, I don't
wanna go clubbing, you know? </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna go to a club. </connor>
<connor> I wanna continue the
conversation I'm having. </connor>
<connor> So I've definitely
gotten used to in Japan, </connor>
<connor> you hit up the karaoke
or there's this one bar </connor>
<connor> that's open till 4:00 a.m., </connor>
<connor> or there's so many places open till late. </connor>
<connor> And I've forgotten that
in the UK, it hits 12 </connor>
<connor> and you try to Google where
the next place to go to is. </connor>
<garnt> And there's nothing,
there is just nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> You just come out blank and
you're like, "Well, fuck, </garnt>
<garnt> we gotta keep this going somehow, right?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And there's just no options
available, unfortunately. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the UK sucks for that. </connor>
<garnt> I do remember that.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every night at 12 it's
like, all right, fuck, </garnt>
<connor> we have to really look to find a place. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like someone
went to the power bank </joey>
<joey> and just went pew. </joey>
<connor> Everything just goes
down like an apocalypse. </connor>
<connor> - Well yeah, on Sundays
shops shut at 4:00 p.m. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> What, just supermarkets? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Or some places just don't even open. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I mean, I get the don't even open </joey>
<connor> but what's the point of
being open for five hours? </connor>
<connor> - I think London has laws of on Sunday, </connor>
<garnt> a shop can only remain
open for X amount of hours </garnt>
<garnt> so they choose the busiest hours </garnt>
<joey> from 10 til 4:00.
- Oh, I see. </joey>
<joey> - I can't remember what
the exact hours were </joey>
<joey> but I know at least, </joey>
<connor> where I lived in London, it was that rule. </connor>
<connor> So all the shops shut and opened </connor>
<connor> at the same time on Sundays.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's kind of
been like that right now. </joey>
<garnt> With it being Golden Week in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And when I was hanging out with Nano, </garnt>
<connor> we were trying to find a lunch place. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's either it's
closed during Golden Week. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> - Or it's got 200% capacity. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> If you come to Japan,
try and avoid this period </connor>
<connor> 'cause hotels and flights
and everything is doubled. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God, I saw
pictures of Haneda Airport- </joey>
<connor> - Oh God.
- This week. </connor>
<joey> It is a nightmare. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause it's
basically the only week off </joey>
<garnt> that most working Japanese people have, </garnt>
<garnt> where they have a full week off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So they all travel,
they all go to hotels. </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah, try and avoid this
week if you come to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's rammed.
- It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the week where every
manga chapter takes a week off. </garnt>
<connor> That's how you know, that's how
I remember what Golden Week- </connor>
<connor> - Is it actually that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember growing up </connor>
<garnt> and being like, "Man, 'Naruto,'
'One Piece,' and 'Bleach' </garnt>
<garnt> are taking a break on the same week? </garnt>
<garnt> What's going on? What's going on? </garnt>
<garnt> I need to know what's happening, man." </garnt>
<joey> - That's how manga readers tell the time. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Oh, 'Ode'
is taking a week off, </joey>
<joey> must be Golden Week." </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] True. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause it's not only
that bars close as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I forget, combinis are a thing here </garnt>
<garnt> so if you need access to alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> if you're going round a
mate's house, whatever, </garnt>
<joey> you've always got the combini. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- But you wanna go </joey>
<joey> to a Tescos or a Sainsbury's or something, </joey>
<joey> you better hope that you plan ahead </joey>
<joey> and you get it before 11, which is, </joey>
<joey> some places close at 11 </joey>
<garnt> and that's the latest some places close. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you pay double the price of alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you're at a corner
store that's shitty </garnt>
<garnt> and they make all their money
from upcharging alcohol. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But even, there are some
corner stores you go to, </garnt>
<garnt> especially in London
where you know, it's open, </garnt>
<garnt> but they don't serve alcohol past 12. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh.
- Oh. </garnt>
<connor> - So it's like, "Well, fuck, man." </connor>
<garnt> You literally have no options, so. </garnt>
<joey> - But I discovered that the other day </joey>
<garnt> when I was coming home late and
it was last train and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh man,
feeling a bit hungry. </garnt>
<connor> Might just pop over to a McDonald's, </connor>
<connor> just do a quick little
Maccas run before I go." </connor>
<connor> And it was 1:00 a.m., right? </connor>
<connor> And the McDonald's are still open. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, sick,
amazing. Let's go in." </connor>
<connor> So I walk in and the
guy's like, "Drink only." </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] What? </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Who the fuck
is walking into a McDonald's </joey>
<joey> to get a drink?" </joey>
<connor> - No, look, I'll close
the sign for you, bro. </connor>
<connor> Let me close the sign. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, literally, why are you open? </joey>
<joey> - Shut it down, dude, shut it down. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, I could just go to a combini. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's so stupid. </joey>
<joey> - Bro, who's going to a... </joey>
<joey> - Who's going to a McDonald's being like, </joey>
<joey> "One Sprite, please"? </joey>
<garnt> - At 1:00 a.m. as well, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - At 1:00 a.m., like. </garnt>
<garnt> - How much money are they
making from the drinks </garnt>
<connor> to warrant staying open only for drinks? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I thought it was a bit weird </joey>
<joey> being like, oh, okay, it's still open </joey>
<joey> but there's no one in here right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Sus, dude.
- Now I know. </joey>
<garnt> - Sus.
- Man, you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> your target audience
if you're at 1:00 a.m. </garnt>
<garnt> and you're serving drinks only. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - There isn't a special drink </joey>
<garnt> that's only served at
McDonald's, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mate, there's only one reason </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to McDonald's at 1:00 a.m., </garnt>
<garnt> it's to smash a fucking- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like, give
me a fucking burger. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna smash a burger. </garnt>
<joey> - Smashing a burger or
ordering those 20 nugs </joey>
<joey> which you would never
order except at 1:00 a.m. </joey>
<garnt> at a McDonald's, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not here to smash an
orange juice at a McDonald's </joey>
<connor> at 1:00 a.m., yeah? </connor>
<joey> I can do that anywhere. </joey>
<connor> - I always get the milk. </connor>
<connor> - Milk? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I just get the milk. </connor>
<joey> - I only exclusively
drink McDonald's milk. </joey>
<garnt> - I go there for milk, that's it. </garnt>
<joey> - Ronald's milk. </joey>
<connor> - Why do you go there for milk? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't, no. </garnt>
<connor> I used to order it,
though, it was all right. </connor>
<connor> Tastes like shit. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> I don't know why I- </joey>
<connor> - How do you fuck up milk? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, man, Ronald, man. </connor>
<connor> Ronald's secret sauce. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Ronald's fresh squeeze. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't really been up to much either. </connor>
<connor> I've kinda just been working. </connor>
<connor> I've been to barbecue
a bunch, that was fun. </connor>
<connor> Barbecuing was chill.
- Nice. </connor>
<connor> - It was nice. It was raining though. </connor>
<garnt> - How's the weather been here? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I guess I was gonna, </garnt>
<connor> literally you answered my question </connor>
<garnt> as I was processing what I was going say. </garnt>
<connor> - So this place I stayed at </connor>
<connor> had a place outside where
you could still barbecue </connor>
<connor> even if it was raining
'cause it was covered. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- So that was fun. </connor>
<connor> And it was, yeah, it was fun. </connor>
<connor> I like barbecuing. </connor>
<joey> - It's a good time for
barbecuing right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's just just warming up. </joey>
<joey> - Weather was nice.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So that was chill. </joey>
<joey> Got to do that. That was fun. </joey>
<joey> I just smelled of smoke for three days. </joey>
<joey> It's fun. </joey>
<joey> And then we had a bonfire
and then it was very fun </joey>
<joey> 'cause you just keep adding </joey>
<joey> and we had to chop our own wood as well. </joey>
<connor> That was fun. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that's fun.
- Just camping vibes again. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's very nice. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause we had- </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you have an ax and everything? </garnt>
<connor> - It was a hammer and there was a thing </connor>
<connor> where you put the log on </connor>
<garnt> and it was like a metal thing like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh nice, nice.
- And you smack it into it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh, cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Could just hear the, I don't know, </garnt>
<connor> the dwarf for music from
"Lord of the Rings" in my head </connor>
<connor> just while I was smacking away. </connor>
<connor> Just like bring me another log. </connor>
<connor> Do do do do do. </connor>
<garnt> - As you were chopping and
your beard just extensively- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Should have put one of those lumberjack- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I should have, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, dude, this is what it's all about." </connor>
<connor> They're bringing my logs over like this. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "All in the fire we go." </connor>
<garnt> - The red and black
checkered shirt, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - It was so fun. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why chopping wood was so fun. </joey>
<joey> - Your hair just turns red. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I definitely- </connor>
<joey> - It's like, oh, I'm a ginger now. </joey>
<garnt> - Definitely am a monkey, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like smacking it was fun. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, dude, it's the best feeling. </connor>
<garnt> - So fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like there's just
something primal about that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I just went to Costco before </connor>
<connor> and bought a bunch of
food and barbecued it </connor>
<joey> and I bought way too much food. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was really hard to eat it all. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it is Costco, right? </joey>
<joey> - I know, I know, </joey>
<joey> it was so much food, but
it was so fucking good. </joey>
<connor> It was so delicious. </connor>
<connor> Barbecuing, I love barbecuing.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How long were you there for? </connor>
<connor> - Three days, so pretty chill.
- Oh, nice. </connor>
<joey> - Pretty chill.
- That's nice. </joey>
<joey> - It was nice to relax, get away. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And just chill for a bit </connor>
<joey> before I guess I'm gonna go away again, </joey>
<connor> but it's just 'cause this
next two, three weeks </connor>
<connor> are just all work. </connor>
<garnt> So, and then going back to the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Have a little bit of work. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, like-
- Weddings and stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm trying to pack as much as I can </garnt>
<connor> before I fly back to the UK. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right, right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's definitely,
I was like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I can work at home. </connor>
<connor> I have a dedicated office
where I can work and stuff </connor>
<joey> if I need to. </joey>
<joey> But it's just something
about being out of Japan. </joey>
<joey> My body's just like, "You
are in holiday mode now." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Why do you need to work? </joey>
<garnt> People are out. </garnt>
<garnt> People want to see you. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm telling myself I'll be like, </joey>
<garnt> I'll have a bit of time in
the UK to do some stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I could probably just sneak it in. </garnt>
<garnt> I know though, the moment
I get there, I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Yeah, so, pub, pub?" </joey>
<connor> - I wanna livestream </connor>
<connor> but I just feel like </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be stream sniped
into oblivion in London. </connor>
<connor> If I'm drinking at a pub, people- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It could be fun though. </connor>
<garnt> - "Trash Taste" is definitely, </garnt>
<garnt> it's definitely changed
things for me in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I was about to ask, </joey>
<joey> how much were you recognized in the UK? </joey>
<joey> Compared to before? </joey>
<joey> - A lot. </joey>
<garnt> I don't, like the fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> at this wedding I went to, </garnt>
<garnt> the bartender was a fan
of "Trash Taste," right? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No way. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's awesome. </garnt>
<connor> - Mates rates, mates rates. </connor>
<garnt> - Mates rates. </garnt>
<garnt> And fucking Sydney cajoled him </garnt>
<garnt> to giving him a free drink </garnt>
<garnt> because she was like, "You recognize him </garnt>
<garnt> but you don't recognize me? </garnt>
<garnt> How dare you, how dare you!" </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Well, you're not fucking
Sydney's "Trash Taste," </connor>
<connor> what the fuck's she on about? </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - She managed to get a free drink. </joey>
<joey> She's literally been on the show one time </joey>
<garnt> and she's like, "I'm the one
who was on 'Trash Taste.'" </garnt>
<joey> - Do you know who I am? </joey>
<garnt> I am getting married to him, actually. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - So I am basically also "Trash Taste." </connor>
<garnt> - She was also very
intoxicated at this time, </garnt>
<garnt> as we all were. </garnt>
<connor> But no, but yeah, because
Brighton has become, I guess- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's a YouTuber city for the- </connor>
<garnt> - The influencer city. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so weird. </garnt>
<connor> I can't, sometimes I'll just
be sitting at my local pub </connor>
<connor> which I won't say but it is my local pub </connor>
<connor> so it is within the
vicinity in which I live </connor>
<connor> and it's very nerve-wracking </connor>
<connor> whenever I get recognized there </connor>
<connor> because one, it's weird to go
to the pub that you grew up in </connor>
<connor> and that you always went
to and you grew up there. </connor>
<connor> And now you go there </connor>
<connor> and sometimes, the odd person </connor>
<connor> just recognizes you from "Trash Taste." </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's always "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> It's all like-
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> So sometimes people recognize me, </garnt>
<garnt> even though I got the mask on
when I'm walking in Brighton. </garnt>
<garnt> It's super super surreal </garnt>
<garnt> because obviously it's
the place I grew up in. </garnt>
<garnt> And now it's become </garnt>
<garnt> this really hip, happening
influencer city, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - It's basically the LA of UK
when it comes to YouTubers. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, definitely, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's actually, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I got recognized
more in Brighton per se, </garnt>
<garnt> than I did in London </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause London's a bit more spread out. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a bit more- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, it's (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a bit more dispersed. </garnt>
<joey> I do get recognized the
odd place in London, </joey>
<joey> but definitely in Brighton, </joey>
<joey> it's way more concentrated. </joey>
<joey> Whenever I go to the city center, </joey>
<joey> there's normally one or two people </joey>
<joey> that recognizes me from "Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- That's cool. </joey>
<garnt> - Probably be the same
for you guys as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe. </garnt>
<connor> I blend in really well though. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> So. </joey>
<connor> - Can't quite say the same thing for me. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> It's gonna be interesting
because we haven't really, </garnt>
<garnt> since "Trash Taste" started, </garnt>
<garnt> we haven't really had that yet, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you know, the
borders have been closed here </connor>
<joey> so not as many foreigners coming to Japan. </joey>
<connor> I mean, a little more recently I'd say. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you've noticed, </connor>
<joey> but the past month or
so I've been like, "Oh." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I got recognized twice- </connor>
<joey> - There's a lot of white people around. </joey>
<joey> - Twice in one day the other day. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really?
- Oh, nice. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've noticed there's
a lot more people now. </connor>
<joey> - Whereabouts? </joey>
<garnt> - Shinjuku. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Well that makes sense.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that was like, I was
like, "Whoa, that's weird." </garnt>
<garnt> This is happening a lot more. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Because people are coming in now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - They've made it a lot
easier to get in the country. </garnt>
<connor> At least my experience was. </connor>
<connor> This time I spent an hour
and a half in the airport </connor>
<connor> as opposed to four hours- </connor>
<connor> - That's good.
- Which was nice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Which is nice. </connor>
<connor> - That's really nice. </connor>
<connor> - The first thing I noticed </connor>
<connor> is that they removed
the fucking cattle tag </connor>
<connor> that they give everyone.
- Oh, thank God. </connor>
<garnt> - So I didn't feel like livestock, </garnt>
<garnt> which was a nice positive.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't imagine if you're
waiting for years to come in </garnt>
<garnt> on your work VISA. </garnt>
<garnt> Finally, the fucking country opens </garnt>
<garnt> and the first thing they do is
tag you like fucking cattle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Brand you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking brand you, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> So, you know- </garnt>
<garnt> - Welcome to Japan, tss. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank God they've removed that system. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Everything's just a
lot more streamlined now. </connor>
<connor> And I mean, it's a lot easier </connor>
<connor> traveling outside of the country as well. </connor>
<connor> I mean, England, </connor>
<connor> I didn't even-
- Thank God. </connor>
<connor> - Need to get tested </connor>
<connor> or give a vaccine certificate or anything. </connor>
<connor> It's just back to normal, right? </connor>
<connor> - Geez. </connor>
<connor> - God bless the queen, eh? </connor>
<joey> Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> It's kinda crazy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Hopefully it lasts </connor>
<connor> 'cause the one thing I'm
really fucking worried about </connor>
<connor> is while we're overseas,
say at Garnt's wedding, </connor>
<joey> and then they'll just,
discovered a new strain, guys. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's go. </joey>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<connor> - Feel like even if they do,
people are gonna be like, "No." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think so. </connor>
<garnt> - Well the one thing that I am, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I'm looking forward to </garnt>
<garnt> or dreading is the next
convention we go to. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause shit, we can't
announce what it is yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - We are going to a convention. </connor>
<connor> - We're going to several conventions </connor>
<connor> but I remember what it was
like before "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> I can't imagine what going to a convention </connor>
<connor> is going to be like after "Trash Taste." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, conflu was always a thing, </garnt>
<joey> and now it's like conflu
on steroids is a thing now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, one thing we've
definitely had to plan around </garnt>
<garnt> that we've never needed to
do before in conventions </garnt>
<connor> is planning what we're doing
and the events we're going to </connor>
<connor> is that technically, we
are now a fire hazard. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- In some conventions. </connor>
<connor> - At some conventions,
we are now a fire hazard. </connor>
<garnt> So that's something that I
never had to think about before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was people asking,
"Do you want security?" </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, "Oh, that feels so weird." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Do I really want </connor>
<connor> a guy just following me around? </connor>
<garnt> But then I guess I don't wanna get hurt, </garnt>
<garnt> but I mean, it feels weird, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it does. </connor>
<connor> - It definitely feels weird </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it's definitely a
different kind of planning </garnt>
<garnt> than any of the conventions
I've been to before. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I've always seen, </joey>
<joey> there's been a couple of big guests </joey>
<joey> at conventions I've been to, right? </joey>
<joey> That have security guards and security. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, "Look at this guy." </joey>
<joey> - Big dick on campus here. </joey>
<joey> - Look at this guy, oh the big
dick brigade coming through. </joey>
<connor> And now I'm about to be that guy. </connor>
<joey> And I don't know how to feel about that. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I don't wanna be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Guys, I don't need all this extra shit. </connor>
<garnt> Come on, guys, come on, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just a guy, I'm just a guy." </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> especially being back this time, </garnt>
<garnt> being like, I can't even
walk down my local street. </garnt>
<garnt> How's it gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> where all of the weebs
and all of the people </garnt>
<connor> that are interested in your content </connor>
<connor> and your content field are
going to be concentrated </connor>
<connor> in one place </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, that's pretty scary </connor>
<connor> now that I think about it. </connor>
<connor> I've never-
- It's pretty cool though. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I'm excited-
- It's gonna be cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't seen it in a while. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm excited to see what it- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the last fan meetup
I had, I can't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> There was a decent amount of
people that showed up to it </garnt>
<garnt> so I don't even know </garnt>
<connor> if I can even a do a fan meetup this time. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I was talking to Alan </garnt>
<garnt> and he was just like, "Yeah,
remember when you used to do </garnt>
<connor> unofficial fan meetups?" </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't think
that's happening this time </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, "Yeah,
because it is a fire hazard." </connor>
<connor> Or that has to be taken into account </connor>
<connor> when we do any kind of meetups now. </connor>
<garnt> How are we gonna arrange
people who come to see us? </garnt>
<garnt> And are we blocking anything </garnt>
<garnt> that could potentially be
a health and safety hazard? </garnt>
<garnt> - It sucks though 'cause I miss- </garnt>
<connor> - Don't wanna piss off
the convention people. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It sucks though </connor>
<connor> 'cause I used to do those
kinds of casual fan meetups </connor>
<connor> every now and then with
Aki and I miss that shit. </connor>
<garnt> - I miss that shit as well. </garnt>
<joey> - It's 'cause it's so chill. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's like, you
know, you just tweet out </joey>
<garnt> being like, "Hey, we're gonna
be here for a couple of hours. </garnt>
<garnt> If you wanna hang out,
just come hang out." </garnt>
<garnt> And it's usually 50 people max </garnt>
<connor> and that's a sizeable amount </connor>
<connor> to be like, yeah, okay, you know what? </connor>
<connor> This is- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this is-
- This is kinda chill. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you can talk to people. </connor>
<connor> (speakers drown each other out) </connor>
<connor> - You can talk to everyone, </connor>
<connor> you can have a conversation with people. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Interesting to hear
where people have come from </connor>
<connor> and why they've come- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've met so many cool
people through that </connor>
<connor> and now it just sucks that, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> It's a fire hazard now. </garnt>
<joey> - Now it's an Indian wedding. </joey>
<connor> - And now it's an Indian wedding. </connor>
<garnt> - So now here's the stray, </garnt>
<garnt> if you see me outside of the convention, </garnt>
<garnt> you can talk to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - But that's like playing gotcha. </connor>
<connor> - That's luck. </connor>
<connor> (speakers drown each other out) </connor>
<garnt> You'll probably never see
me outside of a convention </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I don't leave my room </garnt>
<garnt> but maybe if you do, we
can talk a little bit. </garnt>
<connor> Unless I'm in a rush, then
I'll be like, "Sorry." </connor>
<connor> - Because then it's always that instance </connor>
<connor> of if someone recognizes you </connor>
<connor> in those kinds of outside
convention settings. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - All it takes is for one person </joey>
<joey> to be like, "Oh my God, Connor!" </joey>
<joey> For everyone to just fucking
whip their heads around </joey>
<connor> and then a crowd gets forward. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Conventions when those crowds of people </joey>
<joey> normally wanna see what the crowd's about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - So, yeah, it's pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> - I remember the worst I saw it before </connor>
<connor> was you at the Singaporean Convention </connor>
<connor> where it was like traveling
next to fucking Justin Bieber. </connor>
<connor> We had this- </connor>
<connor> - That was pretty crazy, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - We had panels to go to </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember it was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you could not take two
steps without being stopped. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And- </joey>
<joey> - That was the first time
I had to get security. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like-
- Did you get security? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - I had to because the
con was literally like, </connor>
<connor> "If you keep going, you're
gonna be a fire hazard." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And so I was like, "This is cool, </connor>
<joey> but also really fucking weird." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, a fire hazard. </connor>
<connor> But just because you're
blocking walkways or something, </connor>
<connor> it's not like it's a big deal </connor>
<connor> but if you're- </connor>
<connor> - It's not like someone's
there with a fucking match. </connor>
<connor> - But 'cause people are stopping, right </connor>
<garnt> so if you just stop in
a hallway or something, </garnt>
<connor> it's technically a fire hazard </connor>
<garnt> and a lot of the venues can be punished </garnt>
<connor> if it gets shown around
that that's happening. </connor>
<garnt> - You know, 10 people stop,
that's fine, that's manageable, </garnt>
<connor> 50 people stop, you're kind of- </connor>
<garnt> - Not ideal, but- </garnt>
<connor> - You're kind of getting
in the way of people. </connor>
<connor> If 100, 200 people stop, </connor>
<joey> then you are stopping the
flow of people walking about. </joey>
<joey> You're causing literal. </joey>
<garnt> I was gonna call it human traffic. </garnt>
<garnt> But is there a word? </garnt>
<garnt> - You are human traffic. </garnt>
<garnt> - You are human trafficking right now. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the
word is or the term is </connor>
<connor> but it's basically- </connor>
<connor> - Human traffic jam. </connor>
<connor> - A human traffic jam, I guess. </connor>
<connor> - I went to a convention. </connor>
<connor> I think you went to the same one. </connor>
<joey> I won't name it just in
case they get annoyed </joey>
<joey> that apparent, one year </joey>
<joey> they had Markiplier at the convention. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And apparently this
is the first convention </joey>
<joey> that Markiplier ever did. </joey>
<joey> It was in the States.
- I know which con </joey>
<joey> you're talking about, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they spoke about this </joey>
<joey> like it was the zombie apocalypse, dude. </joey>
<connor> Because apparently,
right, what happened was </connor>
<connor> is that, you know, I think
some, did Jacksepticeye go too? </connor>
<joey> - One of the years, I think, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I remember it was a really
big, big fucking deal. </connor>
<connor> And the convention runners didn't, </connor>
<garnt> they knew YouTube and they
knew that it was a big deal, </garnt>
<garnt> but they didn't quite understand. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - How big of a deal it was. </garnt>
<garnt> So they were woefully unprepared. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - For Markiplier's audience. </garnt>
<garnt> And apparently they were
just like, it was insane. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- The security barriers, </connor>
<connor> they didn't have anything really. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And so, </connor>
<connor> apparently it was stampedes. </connor>
<connor> People were just getting hurt. </connor>
<connor> And they had one security
guy for 1,000 people </connor>
<garnt> when only 100 people should have turned up </garnt>
<garnt> and they didn't plan, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> And they had, 'cause
they'd paid, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> God knows amount of
money for that one extra </garnt>
<garnt> in that one Marvel movie. </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like,
"Well, he's the big deal, </garnt>
<garnt> he was in a Marvel movie." </garnt>
<joey> So it's kinda like they
just didn't get it. </joey>
<joey> And apparently it was
an absolute nightmare. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they talked about it </joey>
<connor> as if it was a scene </connor>
<connor> ripped straight out of
"Dead Rising" or something. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Like "World
War Z" or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like "Dead Rising." </connor>
<connor> It's just like.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was insane, apparently. </connor>
<joey> - But like- </joey>
<joey> - Every single time
anything would come up, </joey>
<connor> they'd be like, "The event
that shall not be named." </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause apparently it was such a disaster </joey>
<connor> trying to manage this, that they, </connor>
<connor> the convention, I think
that their reasoning was </connor>
<connor> that they banned him from coming back. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, </connor>
<connor> that sounds like it was
your problem, though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, definitely.
- Interesting. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I can't remember exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - How dare you be too popular. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right.
- For our convention. </garnt>
<connor> - I think that's something like, </connor>
<connor> it was really like they
fucked up massively </connor>
<garnt> and not considered how. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I think it's events like this </garnt>
<garnt> that have thankfully
made events and people </garnt>
<garnt> and not just events but
also influencers themselves </garnt>
<garnt> know, I know, I know, I
hate the word, I hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Show off. </garnt>
<garnt> - But people like us. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - We are not the same. </connor>
<garnt> - We're not like those other people! </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, 'cause the
reason I talk about it </connor>
<connor> like YouTubers or TikTokkers or whatever </connor>
<connor> is that we came from, </connor>
<connor> we all came from the same place </connor>
<connor> and we don't wanna feel
like we don't need security, </connor>
<connor> we don't need to worry about this. </connor>
<connor> We're like the man of
the people, you know? </connor>
<connor> But at the same time, </connor>
<connor> there's been enough incidents
like the Markiplier thing, </connor>
<connor> like Tanacon, like a lot. </connor>
<connor> There's been enough other influencers </connor>
<connor> who have set the precedent </connor>
<connor> to be like things can go
really, really fucking wrong </connor>
<connor> if you don't plan shit out </connor>
<connor> because we know that you wanna
be seen as the casual person, </connor>
<connor> the same as everyone else </connor>
<connor> but you do have a massive audience </connor>
<connor> and it's gotten to the point </connor>
<garnt> where a lot of people need to think </garnt>
<garnt> about how did they manage
the audience they have IRL </garnt>
<garnt> because you see a number, you
see a number on your YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like,
"That's 10,000 people," </garnt>
<garnt> or, "That's 100,000 people,
it's just a number." </garnt>
<garnt> But when you translate that number, </garnt>
<garnt> even if it's just a 10th of the number </garnt>
<garnt> you see on your YouTube
channel to real life, </garnt>
<joey> that fills up a- </joey>
<joey> - That's like a football stadium. </joey>
<connor> - That's what really sucks
about not going to a convention </connor>
<connor> at all recently is that we can't tell </connor>
<connor> 'cause you know, it would
slowly ramp up, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We'd go to more convention. </connor>
<connor> - I have no clue.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know what's gonna- </garnt>
<connor> - What our IRL situation is. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause normally with how
"Trash Taste" has grown </garnt>
<connor> over the past two years. </connor>
<garnt> Normally we'd get to ramp up
the experience to be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Okay, guys, I think
we're reaching that point </connor>
<connor> where we need to start
thinking about this, </connor>
<connor> kind of start thinking about that." </connor>
<connor> But because it's just been two
years of us talking in Japan, </connor>
<connor> we have no idea what it's going to be like </connor>
<connor> when we, I guess return
to the rest of the world </connor>
<connor> and conventions and stuff like that. </connor>
<garnt> We're just playing a guessing
game a lot of the time </garnt>
<garnt> in what we're gonna need and
how we're gonna manage it. </garnt>
<connor> - Last time I went to AX, </connor>
<connor> I could easily walk through it all. </connor>
<connor> And there was maybe, I
don't know, 50/50 chance </connor>
<connor> that someone would recognize me. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And that was when I had what,
400,000 subs or something? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So, and that was before
"Trash Taste," obviously. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- So that's, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it's gonna be like now. </joey>
<joey> I mean, who knows? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, ah, dude.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Not excited for it. </joey>
<joey> - Well-
- I'm excited- </joey>
<joey> - I'm excited but dreading. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, oh God, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna cause any
problems for anyone. </joey>
<joey> - It's like equal amounts- </joey>
<connor> - But I wanna meet everyone! </connor>
<connor> I wanna say hi to you guys. </connor>
<garnt> - It's equal amounts excitement,
equal amounts terrifying. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Same here. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm nervous in both ways. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm excited to go experience conventions </garnt>
<garnt> and just go see the vibe
and everything again. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm scared to see how things have changed </garnt>
<garnt> after last the two years. </garnt>
<connor> - More so mourning the loss </connor>
<connor> of my weird convention
stories, probably now. </connor>
<connor> I don't get to stay in
random Discord Airbnbs </connor>
<connor> where I met people online- </connor>
<connor> - All right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's not gonna happen anymore. </connor>
<connor> That sucks.
- Sad. </connor>
<joey> - That was fun, fun stories. </joey>
<joey> Weird moments in my life. </joey>
<joey> - He will reminisce as he
sits in his five-star hotel. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just like you, for real. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - No, he doesn't miss that, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor's just like, "Give me
the fucking five-star hotel." </garnt>
<garnt> - Give me the Sheraton right now. </garnt>
<connor> - No, it's fun but also
it's like God damn, </connor>
<connor> that was no way to live. </connor>
<connor> - It's like damn, bitch,
you live like this? </connor>
<connor> - I think I got all my really stupid ideas </connor>
<connor> out of my head and now I'm
trying to be more sensible </connor>
<joey> and take care of myself and yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's time to adult now. </connor>
<connor> This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </connor>

<garnt> - Okay, well I guess </garnt>
<garnt> we've literally got approval from Meilyne </garnt>
<joey> that we can announce actually. </joey>
<joey> - What are we announcing? </joey>
<joey> - One place that we're going </joey>
<joey> is going to be Anime Expo. </joey>
<joey> - Aah! </joey>
<garnt> - That should have been the obvious one. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like us announcing
Anime Expo is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> well of course, of course, that's- </garnt>
<garnt> - I also eat food. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, I am an anime YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> - No one knew if it was
even happening this year. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I certainly
got fucking bombarded </joey>
<garnt> by my Twitch chat being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You going to Anime Expo? Anime Expo?" </garnt>
<joey> - So if you're going to
AX, you can see us all. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) staff. </joey>
<connor> I don't know what else. </connor>
<joey> - We got, hopefully, a bunch
of cool things planned. </joey>
<garnt> - Can we announce, can we
announce the rest of the shit </garnt>
<joey> that we're doing? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think-
- Not sure yet. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> We do have something special. </joey>
<joey> - There's some cool stuff happening, so. </joey>
<joey> - We do have, it's not just
gonna be us turning up at AX, </joey>
<garnt> we do have some cool stuff
planned for AX as well. </garnt>
<connor> - So if you're going, we'll see you there. </connor>
<garnt> And if you see me around, say hi. </garnt>
<connor> Buy me a drink and I'll- </connor>
<connor> - Don't say that, you're gonna be like- </connor>
<connor> - 200 drinks deep. </connor>
<garnt> - You're gonna be intoxicated. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm kidding, don't
do that, don't do that. </garnt>
<connor> - What am I gonna do
with all these drinks? </connor>
<connor> - Don't bring me a drink. </connor>
<garnt> If we're in a bar, then
you can buy me a drink. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's gonna just be a
line to the SeaDog VA panel </garnt>
<garnt> just be like, here's a
drink, here's a drink. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like an offering. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna say this now </connor>
<connor> 'cause this always happens. </connor>
<connor> Please don't bring me food. </connor>
<garnt> It is an absolute nightmare </garnt>
<garnt> to try and carry around with me. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want food, don't bring me food. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm also fat enough,
I don't need anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you do see me
outside of the convention, </joey>
<joey> buy me drink as well. </joey>
<garnt> As long as I'm not carrying
five drinks at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I might buy you a drink as well. </garnt>
<joey> - The only food I will accept, however, </joey>
<joey> is Flamin' Hot Cheetos. </joey>
<connor> You can bring me as many of those- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no, no </connor>
<connor> 'cause everyone will
bring one, don't say that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's exactly what I want. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, that's-
- Just give it to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a Joey thing.
- Just give it to me. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a Joey thing. </joey>
<joey> - Bro, his hotel's </joey>
<joey> gonna be a fucking hot
Cheeto landfill, dude. </joey>
<joey> It's gonna- </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna just open the window </joey>
<connor> and just throwing fucking
Cheetos to the crowd. </connor>
<joey> You get some Cheetos. </joey>
<connor> - Nah, I'm excited, dude. </connor>
<joey> I'm really hyped.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - First time in, geez, when
was the last AX we went to? </joey>
<garnt> Three years ago? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it was literally the
last convention I went to. </joey>
<joey> - February, 'cause it was one of my, </joey>
<garnt> it's always one of my
favorite conventions to go to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I always get to meet everyone. </connor>
<connor> - It's not just a convention, </connor>
<garnt> it's basically just like, yeah, it's- </garnt>
<joey> - An AniTuber meetup. </joey>
<garnt> - It is an AniTuber meetup. </garnt>
<joey> - How the British people get
to see the American people. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Pretty much, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause we're all not American. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder how many people
are gonna go there this year </garnt>
<connor> in terms of-
- Yeah, don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Other content creators
and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> - Call to action. </joey>
<joey> - Well, if you're any
content creators going to AX, </joey>
<connor> hit us up, whatever. </connor>
<connor> - See you there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, big small- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, we'll be
in LA as well, so, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Let us know. </connor>
<connor> - I wonder if we're gonna have
the annual AniTuber meetup. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause did you guys go to
that last year, last time? </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> - I did not. </joey>
<garnt> - Because there's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Where was the last one? </garnt>
<joey> Not the one at the bowling alley. </joey>
<joey> - There was one at a bowling alley? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - [Camera Person] Oh
no, that's Funimation. </connor>
<joey> - Funimation Party. </joey>
<connor> - You wanna explain what this is? </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - You wanna explain what this is? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so every, when did it even start? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even remember when it started. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was five, six
years ago or something, </garnt>
<garnt> but as long as I've been to AX, </garnt>
<garnt> there's always been one, </garnt>
<joey> but there there's always been </joey>
<joey> this unofficial AniTuber meetup thing </joey>
<joey> where basically it used to just be done </joey>
<garnt> outside of the convention hall, </garnt>
<garnt> in that open area where
all the cosplays are </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like, it doesn't
matter how big or small </garnt>
<garnt> of an AniTuber you are, </garnt>
<garnt> you can just come to this
event, kinda meet everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause at the end of the day, </garnt>
<garnt> especially five, six years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> the AniTuber community was
so fucking small, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So there'd be 30 people, max. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The last one I went to, though, </garnt>
<garnt> there was 100 people. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, oh, it's getting big now. </joey>
<connor> - It's getting big now.
- Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - I think 'cause that one was like, </connor>
<joey> people were asking for invites </joey>
<joey> and then people were asking
them for invites, and- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then there were people there </joey>
<connor> who definitely weren't
making YouTube videos. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> There were people just showing up. </connor>
<connor> - And they were just showing up </connor>
<connor> 'cause they knew Gigguk would be there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - So it was like, I don't know, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I don't know
how it's gonna work nowadays </garnt>
<garnt> but there's normally one
AniTuber or something </garnt>
<joey> who has just rented out a house. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that's just now become
the unofficial AniTube meetup. </joey>
<joey> - Pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - Well, they just rent out a house </joey>
<connor> and they just invite a
bunch of people, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that one was chill. </connor>
<joey> - That one was awesome. </joey>
<garnt> - I enjoyed that one. </garnt>
<joey> But yeah, the last time we did
one outside of the convention </joey>
<joey> was five years ago, I think. </joey>
<joey> And there was maybe 50, 60 people there. </joey>
<joey> Obviously way too many
people to actually meet </joey>
<connor> and get to know personally, but yeah, </connor>
<garnt> I miss those. </garnt>
<connor> I met a lot of really cool
AniTubers at that event. </connor>
<connor> I met John for the first time,
Super Eyepatch Wolf there. </connor>
<connor> - Love seeing John.
- The first time. </connor>
<garnt> - Love hanging out with John. </garnt>
<connor> - He was the crowd favorite that year </connor>
<connor> because he'd never been to a convention </connor>
<connor> and never shown his face. </connor>
<joey> So everyone was like
"Yo, Super Eyepatch Wolf! </joey>
<garnt> Let's go, dude!"
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Amazing.
- Also, </garnt>
<joey> absolutely chill dude, as well. </joey>
<joey> - Absolute chill dude, absolute Chad. </joey>
<connor> He's the mega Chad of AniTube. </connor>
<connor> In terms of looks. </connor>
<joey> - Man's got a fucking
jawline and a half, dude. </joey>
<connor> - Dude, I'm hype, man, I'm really excited </connor>
<connor> to go to conventions. </connor>
<connor> I think not being able to see
the viewers for a long time </connor>
<connor> has made my brain go too YouTuber-y. </connor>
<connor> I got YouTube brain. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<garnt> What's YouTube brain? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all numbers for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all numbers to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't mean anything to me, </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't seen anyone. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just data.
- I haven't left my house. </garnt>
<garnt> I just stay in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Even more isolated. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanna be drinking at a bar </garnt>
<garnt> and then someone strikes
up a conversation, </garnt>
<garnt> being like, "Oh, I love your stuff." </garnt>
<garnt> And we just have a nice,
chill conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> That's some of my
favorite fan interactions, </garnt>
<joey> because as much as I wanna have </joey>
<joey> the longer conversations
with people come to meetups, </joey>
<joey> it's like, yeah, you're in
like Indian wedding head space </joey>
<joey> where it's just like, you have a, </joey>
<joey> if you're lucky, a few
minutes with everyone </joey>
<joey> but when you're just chilling </joey>
<joey> and that random guy
recognizes you or random girl, </joey>
<garnt> you're just having a nice conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're just like, "Ah,
I remember why I started </garnt>
<garnt> what I'm doing right now. </garnt>
<joey> It's for moments like this, man." </joey>
<garnt> - I weirdly have a lot of
those though in Japan, I think </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't get recognized </garnt>
<garnt> as often in Japan,
especially nowadays, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So the one person who does
find you on the street, </garnt>
<joey> you actually, as long as
you are not in a rush, </joey>
<joey> you actually have, at least me, anyway, </joey>
<joey> I have at least a three or
four-minute conversation </joey>
<joey> being like, "Oh, you know,
what are you doing here?" </joey>
<joey> All that kind of stuff. </joey>
<garnt> And those are the best. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Those are the best. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, in Japan, it's different </garnt>
<garnt> because right now, no one
here is a tourist, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So everyone here is doing something </garnt>
<garnt> or has an interesting story, </garnt>
<joey> or is working here or
something like that, and- </joey>
<joey> - Lots of students now. </joey>
<joey> - Lots of students. </joey>
<connor> - Now there is lots of students now. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, 'cause when did they start </connor>
<connor> letting people in again? </connor>
<joey> - A month ago?
- Like, a month ago? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I've noticed there's loads more- </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I've barely been
in Japan for the last month. </connor>
<garnt> How's it been for you guys? </garnt>
<connor> - I did a stream recently
and I got stream sniped </connor>
<joey> a lot more than last time.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I think that was interesting. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It was fun, though. </connor>
<connor> - It's definitely gone to
the point now where, again, </connor>
<joey> I've just noticed, there's
a lot more foreigners now. </joey>
<joey> And then I just remembered, oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> there's just a lot more students now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then obviously, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you have more of a
chance to get recognized. </garnt>
<garnt> I was in butt fuck middle
of nowhere the other week </garnt>
<garnt> outside of Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And there was just </garnt>
<garnt> two random dudes who just recognized me. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like,
in my head, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is weird." </garnt>
<connor> But then I was like, "No, this
is what it used to be like." </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So now it's just this weird whiplash </joey>
<joey> of being like, "Oh, fuck, </joey>
<joey> we're slowly going back to
normal, finally, hopefully." </joey>
<joey> - The world is healing.
- It is truly healing. </joey>
<joey> - Hopefully-
- Shit is healing. </joey>
<joey> - Rage. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause your plan </connor>
<garnt> is to go back to Australia
this year as well, aren't you? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna go see my family </joey>
<joey> for the first time in three years. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, the trip
to the UK for your wedding </joey>
<joey> is the first time I'm gonna be overseas </joey>
<joey> in three years. </joey>
<joey> - Deported, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know, it's- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, 'cause the last time </garnt>
<connor> you attempted to go overseas, </connor>
<connor> you got deported, right? </connor>
<connor> - I got deported. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt cackling) </connor>
<garnt> And you've been waiting
three years since then. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - It's like PTSD now. </joey>
<joey> The last time I went on
an international flight, </joey>
<connor> I got deported, so. </connor>
<joey> - That's a cool story. </joey>
<joey> - It is a cool story. </joey>
<joey> It's a cool story to tell the kids </joey>
<connor> but, yeah, yeah, I'm going
down to see my family </connor>
<connor> and mates and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> so that's gonna be very weird. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just seeing the city I
grew up in completely change </connor>
<connor> 'cause my sister was saying that, yeah, </connor>
<garnt> it's completely changed
in the past three years. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, this is gonna be weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was very weird going
back to my home city </garnt>
<connor> and just seeing it
completely changed as well. </connor>
<connor> And even just seeing
London slightly changed- </connor>
<connor> - Well, the skyline of London, </connor>
<connor> there's loads more skyscrapers now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There was two and now
there's tons more being built. </connor>
<garnt> It's crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder how it managed to
not get them for so long then. </garnt>
<connor> It's pretty strange. </connor>
<joey> - But now I'm gonna be so
scared of what you experienced </joey>
<connor> of just being at a place </connor>
<connor> that's very local and familiar to me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If I go to my local mall, </connor>
<joey> I'm just gonna be like, "No
one recognize me, please." </joey>
<garnt> Not here, don't follow me home, please. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> That's what I was worried about, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - God. </garnt>
<joey> - Be like, "Come in my
house for some tea." </joey>
<joey> - Meet my parents. </joey>
<connor> - Have some crumpets and
biscuits, come on, come on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, London's become very bougie. </connor>
<connor> I called an Uber, it was
my first Uber in London- </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And a fucking Tesla shows up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was just like,
this is an Uber, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I just called an Uber. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, a fucking Tesla shows up. </garnt>
<joey> And I'd never ridden in
a Tesla before, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Have you guys ever ridden in a Tesla? </joey>
<joey> - No, I haven't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I didn't know how they worked </joey>
<joey> because the first thing you normally go </joey>
<joey> when you go to a car </joey>
<joey> is you go and you pull the handle. </joey>
<joey> Right, so I go up to this Tesla </joey>
<joey> and there's no handle. </joey>
<joey> It's literally a flat handle place </joey>
<joey> so I didn't know you
were meant to push it in </joey>
<joey> and the handle comes out. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Daddy Elon has designed </joey>
<garnt> some fucking futuristic
travel to Mars fucking stuff." </garnt>
<garnt> It's probably electric </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm standing there
in front of the Tesla </garnt>
<garnt> thinking it's an automatic door going. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, uh. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Did he have to open it for you? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, he had to come out </joey>
<garnt> and just tell me just
to push the handle in. </garnt>
<joey> - I just imagine Garnt
just being like, "Open! </joey>
<garnt> Open!"
(all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Daddy Elon, please. </connor>
<garnt> - Where is it? </garnt>
<garnt> Uh! </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Was it fun though? </joey>
<connor> Riding in a Tesla? </connor>
<joey> - It was very fun.
- Yeah? </joey>
<connor> - It was-
- It's a toy. </connor>
<connor> - Huh?
- It's like a toy </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's so futuristic. </connor>
<garnt> - It is, it is. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm excited.
- It's cool though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was weird
seeing the pad at the front </garnt>
<garnt> just completely track
everyone, all the cars </garnt>
<garnt> but when it came to pedestrians, </garnt>
<garnt> it was just fucking freaking the fuck out </garnt>
<garnt> because there's so many
pedestrians in London. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, in London, yeah, true. </garnt>
<garnt> - So just seeing humans
appear then disappear, </garnt>
<garnt> then this dog was a human then it wasn't. </garnt>
<connor> But it was very cool. </connor>
<garnt> It is very much a toy. </garnt>
<garnt> I know our mates' parents
owns one as well and- </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, never shuts up about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Huh? </garnt>
<garnt> - Never shuts up about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, never shuts up about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - He drives it </garnt>
<connor> and he's like, "Oh, my
mum bought it, though." </connor>
<connor> He doesn't mention that. </connor>
<garnt> He says, "My Tesla." </garnt>
<connor> Our Tesla. </connor>
<connor> - Our Tesla. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause he took you on plenty of- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I went in his Tesla. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I got shit in the car. </connor>
<garnt> I tell you about that? Remember that? </garnt>
<garnt> I almost shit in the car, remember? </garnt>
<connor> - Have we told that on- </connor>
<connor> - No, I haven't. </connor>
<garnt> - Have we talked about
that on "Trash Taste"? </garnt>
<connor> - No.
- We haven't. </connor>
<connor> - So we were driving in this
Tesla in the countryside </connor>
<garnt> and the Tesla, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it had been sitting there all day, </garnt>
<garnt> I had the window down.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - (chuckles) And I can't
remember exactly what happened, </garnt>
<garnt> but we were driving along
this really country road </garnt>
<connor> and then, oh no, I remember what happened. </connor>
<connor> We're driving along this country road. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of dirt road. </connor>
<connor> It's not the cleanest road, we're going. </connor>
<connor> And then he's trying to show
off that it can go 0 to 60 in, </connor>
<connor> you know, as every car owner does, </connor>
<garnt> they have to prove that the car's fast. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - As if normal cars don't go fast. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're going fast. </garnt>
<connor> And as he speeds up, there's a, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's a harvester </connor>
<joey> or something plowing
the fields next to us. </joey>
<connor> No, it's the machine that spreads manure. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So as it's spreading it, we're going by </connor>
<connor> and then before I know it-
- Oh no! </connor>
<connor> - I'm chilling like this in the car </connor>
<garnt> and then suddenly just
a fucking wave of manure </garnt>
<garnt> starts hitting my face
and goes in the car. </garnt>
<connor> and it's launched into this Tesla. </connor>
<connor> And then everyone is doing
that thing of kind of like, </connor>
<connor> aah, aah, aah, aah, oh God, oh God! </connor>
<garnt> Aah! </garnt>
<connor> And then there's just shit
everywhere in his Tesla </connor>
<connor> and he just got it cleaned a week before. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's white seats as well- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's white seats.
- Pure. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's white seat Tesla.
- Oh no. </garnt>
<connor> - And the inside is pure white. </connor>
<connor> Absolutely dickhead white.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - You should never have
your interior this color </connor>
<connor> for this reason </connor>
<connor> and so there's just, oh God. </connor>
<connor> And the entire car journey,
it just smells of cow shit. </connor>
<connor> It just absolutely reeks of cow shit. </connor>
<garnt> And he's freaking out cause
it's his parents' Tesla </garnt>
<garnt> and he's borrowing it. </garnt>
<connor> And so he's like, (spluttering). </connor>
<connor> Oh, what am I gonna do? </connor>
<connor> Oh, oh. </connor>
<connor> He's freaking out. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Don't worry,
we'll get it cleaned, </connor>
<connor> we'll get it cleaned." </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Oh my God, my
parents are gonna kill me." </connor>
<connor> And so we- </connor>
<connor> - So anyway, about that 0 to 60. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And there's chunks this
big of manure in the car. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's just, and then
the smell is just everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] My God. </connor>
<connor> - So we go into a Pizza Express afterwards </connor>
<connor> and we just stink of shit
and we're just eating pizza. </connor>
<connor> And then I think he goes to get it- </connor>
<joey> - They must have been so confused </joey>
<joey> because the people working there's, </joey>
<connor> it's just a bunch of dudes </connor>
<connor> just smelling like shit eating pizza </connor>
<connor> and they're like, "Oh, man,
they fucking live like this?" </connor>
<joey> Meanwhile, they head
back into their Tesla. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It was so-
- Like what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - It was so, and then I think
he got it cleaned the next day </connor>
<connor> or the day after 'cause he was so angry. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "I have to get it cleaned, </connor>
<garnt> I have to get it cleaned." </garnt>
<garnt> So he got it cleaned. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I remember him building up </garnt>
<garnt> that he's like, "Oh my God, </garnt>
<garnt> my parents let me borrow the Tesla. </garnt>
<garnt> Guys, I'm driving the Tesla,
I'm driving the Tesla." </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just this massive
event in our friend group </garnt>
<garnt> that Eugene's coming in a fucking Tesla. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn. </garnt>
<garnt> - Day after, Connor's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Guys, I got shit in Eugene's Tesla." </garnt>
<connor> - We were going a country road, </connor>
<connor> I'm the kinda guy, I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why people wanna do this </connor>
<joey> but I just wanna put my arm like this. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> I get that.
- I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I get that. </joey>
<joey> - And so yeah, then obviously
I couldn't have predicted </joey>
<garnt> that a bunch of manure
was gonna fly in the car. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it did.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a funny story. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember just feeling bad for Eugene, </garnt>
<garnt> but also laughing </garnt>
<garnt> - It was very funny.
- Laughing very, very hard. </garnt>
<connor> - I was covered in shit, </connor>
<garnt> but it was so funny at his anger </garnt>
<connor> that his Tesla was covered in shit </connor>
<connor> that it canceled out me
being covered in shit. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] It was worth it. </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't too bothered
about being covered in shit. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it wasn't like I was going </garnt>
<connor> to a formal dinner or something. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was going to Pizza Express
and I'm gonna get drunk. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Whatever, fine. </connor>
<connor> I'll just clean it,
I'll clean the clothes. </connor>
<connor> Not the end of the world." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- That's so funny. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, it was good. </connor>
<connor> - I also, recently I
watched, yesterday in fact, </connor>
<garnt> this is good timing, </garnt>
<garnt> I watched the new "Doctor Strange" movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, how was that?
- Oh, how is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Very mid. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- Is it actually? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was probably one of
the most boring movies </garnt>
<connor> I've watched in the long time. </connor>
<garnt> - Really?
- Oh wow, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I heard-
- Damn- </garnt>
<joey> - A lot of good things about it. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm sad, I was really excited for it. </garnt>
<connor> - Watch it, make your own mind up. </connor>
<connor> I also watched it in Dolby Atmos </connor>
<connor> and I was way too close to the front </connor>
<connor> and I really regret it </connor>
<connor> 'cause some of that fucking sound effects. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's this one sound
effect in the start </connor>
<connor> where he summons a saw and I swear to God, </connor>
<connor> it nearly punctured my
ear, this saw sword. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, no, it was weird. </connor>
<connor> It was all over the place. </connor>
<connor> The thing that I don't like
about "Doctor Strange," </connor>
<connor> and I don't know if
anyone else feels this way </connor>
<connor> is that I don't know what
the fuck his powers are. </connor>
<connor> It's just whatever he needs to do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, he's like, oh, ta-da- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] He does the circle thing, right? </connor>
<connor> - I do a circle, then
now I summon a monster </connor>
<connor> and now I summon a boat and it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what fuck
the your abilities are. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> No one has ever taught, </connor>
<connor> there is never a scene where
he's learning these powers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Individual spells. </connor>
<connor> How does this work? </connor>
<joey> - I've always just said his power </joey>
<connor> is like the Metronome move in Pokemon, </connor>
<connor> where it's just like, he
just waggles his fingers. </connor>
<joey> And then something happens, you know? </joey>
<connor> - It's like, I don't know
what the fuck is going on. </connor>
<connor> And the entire movie feels
like when you're kids </connor>
<connor> when you're eight years old </connor>
<connor> and you pretend like
you have a magic fight </connor>
<connor> with your childhood friend. </connor>
<connor> You're like, "And I summon this,
I do this, I do this back!" </connor>
<connor> That's what the whole movie felt like. </connor>
<garnt> It was just that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Isn't that just a JoJo fight? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But at least JoJo,
there's some tense to it. </connor>
<connor> There's some intensity. </connor>
<connor> This entire fight was like, all right, </connor>
<connor> well of course he's gonna win. </connor>
<connor> And then there's just this. </connor>
<connor> And there's just like, what
the fuck is this movie? </connor>
<connor> I don't know what fuck the is going on. </connor>
<connor> It's so stupid. </connor>
<connor> This entire movie was just like, </connor>
<connor> all right, now this, all right, now this. </connor>
<garnt> And now this! </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, "What is happening?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I heard from comic book fans </connor>
<garnt> that Doctor Strange is meant to be </garnt>
<garnt> one of the most powerful beings
in the Avengers or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they've just completely
nerfed him in the MCU </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I have no idea what
the fuck his ability is </garnt>
<garnt> apart from just summoning the circle thing </garnt>
<garnt> and summoning the teleport. </garnt>
<garnt> Basically, it's just Paul, right? </garnt>
<connor> He just has the Paul guy. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe the character in
the comics is interesting </garnt>
<connor> but I was so fucking bored in this movie </connor>
<connor> and then halfway through they, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's the multiverse </connor>
<connor> and then they introduce
other Marvel characters </connor>
<connor> from other Marvel. </connor>
<connor> And then it's supposed to be, </connor>
<connor> I guess just comic book boner moments </connor>
<connor> where I'm just supposed
to be impressed that- </connor>
<connor> - They included that scene! </connor>
<connor> - That a guy from the X-Men turned up </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> I'm not impressed by this." </connor>
<connor> There's just a moment where he'll come in </connor>
<garnt> and then the music will play, </garnt>
<garnt> the stereotypical, oh, it's a character </garnt>
<garnt> you're supposed to know. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dun, dun! </garnt>
<garnt> And then it's like, all right, cool. </garnt>
<garnt> And now, and then he's dead. </garnt>
<connor> And then it's like all right, okay, cool. </connor>
<connor> Okay, fair. </connor>
<connor> What is happening, dude? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, is it because you
just haven't watched </garnt>
<connor> many MCU movies since? </connor>
<connor> - I've watched a lot of them,
I've watched a lot of them </connor>
<connor> and this was, the only one I
haven't watched was "Eternals" </connor>
<connor> 'cause I heard it was complete doo doo. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And "Captain Marvel," I didn't watch. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I heard it was really bad. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is probably one of
the worst ones I've watched. </connor>
<garnt> - So you've watched every Marvel movie </garnt>
<garnt> post "Endgame" as well? </garnt>
<connor> - Post "Endgame," what has that been? </connor>
<connor> Just "No Way Home." </connor>
<garnt> - There's been "No Way Home," </garnt>
<garnt> there's been "Black Widow"- </garnt>
<connor> - I've watched "Black
Widow," that was God awful. </connor>
<connor> - [Camera Person] (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (speakers drown each other out) </connor>
<garnt> - They've been taking big Ls, I feel. </garnt>
<connor> These movies have been... </connor>
<garnt> - I just feel like they
are still building up. </garnt>
<connor> - "No Way Home" was really good. </connor>
<garnt> - "No Way home" was fucking great. </garnt>
<connor> - But that was 'cause I got
what I wanted outta that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I was like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I kind of expected to see, </connor>
<connor> it's part of that movie, and yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm sad because I'm not that hyped </garnt>
<garnt> for any new Marvel movies coming out. </garnt>
<garnt> And "Doctor Strange" was one of the few </garnt>
<garnt> I was actually hyped about. </garnt>
<garnt> I was really hyped about "No
Way Home" and that met my- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] That was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - That met my expectations. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, okay, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, he's already here? </connor>
<connor> - I just felt that it was like, </connor>
<connor> You know when you watch a movie </connor>
<connor> and I wanted to watch
it to give my thoughts. </connor>
<garnt> But at the same time, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> fuck, I didn't wanna give them money </garnt>
<garnt> so they think that I want more of this. </garnt>
<connor> - Right.
- 'Cause I don't want more </connor>
<connor> of this.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I heard "Morbius" was really, really bad. </connor>
<garnt> - I've heard that's the worst Marvel movie </garnt>
<garnt> of anything Marvel related of all time. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not Marvel is it? </connor>
<connor> It's Sony. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, that's not MCU. </garnt>
<connor> - So it's not exactly MCU </connor>
<connor> but obviously Jared Leto
is apparently really bad. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, maybe watch
it and give me your thoughts </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm really torn on it </connor>
<garnt> 'cause there were some moments </garnt>
<garnt> that I thought was really interesting </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought, okay, this is good. </garnt>
<garnt> But the rest of the time, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> this just felt like a
movie they wanted to make </garnt>
<garnt> just because they were like, well, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess we could get Benedict
Cumberbatch to act himself out </garnt>
<garnt> through times and that could be fun. </garnt>
<connor> And it's just like, all right. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know, it was just
really long winded and boring. </connor>
<connor> And the moment my popcorn ran
out, I was kind of out of it. </connor>
<connor> - Kinda done. </connor>
<connor> - I was kinda like, I was like- </connor>
<connor> - That was the final straw. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, well, there's no
reason for me to be here now. </connor>
<connor> - I went with Emily and Daidus </connor>
<connor> and they were just laughing
all the time as well </connor>
<connor> at some of the, </connor>
<connor> some of the dialogue was so bad. </connor>
<connor> - Did they enjoy it? </connor>
<connor> - They thought it was really bad as well. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<joey> - So they were enjoying
it ironically, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there were some lines of dialogue </connor>
<connor> that it was just like, "Who wrote this?" </connor>
<connor> This was completely absurd. </connor>
<garnt> This is like a four-year-old wrote it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, maybe
viewers, maybe I'm wrong, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe you disagree with me. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me know what you think. </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't looked at any
critical reviews of it </garnt>
<garnt> so I don't know critics are saying, </garnt>
<connor> but I would give it a four- </connor>
<garnt> - It's the 10 out 10 masterpiece! </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - For me, it's a four out of 10. </connor>
<connor> I was very bored. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it the worst Marvel
movie you've seen? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - What's the worst one you've seen? </connor>
<connor> - "Thor 2" was pretty bad. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, that was pretty bad. </garnt>
<joey> - That just sounds bad from the name. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] "Thor 2" is pretty boring. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm looking forward to the new "Thor." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, just seems fun. </connor>
<connor> - That seems fun.
- "Thor 3." </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, "Thor 4." </garnt>
<garnt> - "Thor 4"! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, "Thor 4." </garnt>
<connor> - Four! </connor>
<connor> - I don't know.
- "Thor 4." </connor>
<garnt> - "Thor 4." </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you have Marvel movie fatigue? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like-
- I don't know- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just make "Blade" and
make it good (indistinct). </garnt>
<connor> - I definitely have Marvel movie fatigue </connor>
<garnt> in the sense where I'm just watching it </garnt>
<garnt> just to keep up and there are few- </garnt>
<joey> - I had Marvel movie fatigue </joey>
<connor> after "Iron Man 2." </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like they're
fumbling right now. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "What are these movies? </connor>
<garnt> What are they making?" </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck
they're trying to sell out. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think they're fumbling, </connor>
<garnt> I just think once you end with "Endgame" </garnt>
<connor> and it's just an end
of 10 years of buildup, </connor>
<connor> it's just like, well, fuck, </connor>
<connor> how long is it gonna take
to build up something </connor>
<connor> that's going to be as exciting? </connor>
<connor> Because right now, </connor>
<connor> I'm not even invested in
the characters as much </connor>
<connor> that I was fucking Iron
Man or Captain America </connor>
<connor> or the main guys in the
previous generations. </connor>
<connor> So it's like, who's going
to be that main guy? </connor>
<connor> And I thought it was
gonna be Doctor Strange. </connor>
<connor> I thought that was a possibility. </connor>
<garnt> - Probably will be.
- Possibility, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just a resident sleeper, dude, </garnt>
<garnt> that entire... </garnt>
<connor> I kinda shut off for the first hour. </connor>
<connor> I was really bored.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Watching "Shang-Chi" was cool </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm just like, I'm
watching a (indistinct) movie </garnt>
<garnt> and then you have </garnt>
<garnt> you're barely relating this
to the MCU somehow, whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not really, I don't
really care about that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm here for the cool fights. </garnt>
<connor> - I was watching YourMovieSucks </connor>
<connor> and he was doing his review
of all the films of the year- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And 70% of them, he was
like, "I didn't finish, </connor>
<connor> it was shit."
- Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And then a lot of people got angry </connor>
<connor> 'cause they were like, "Oh,
how can you review a film </connor>
<connor> if you didn't finish it?" </connor>
<connor> But I was like, I mean, surely
if you can't finish a film </connor>
<connor> that says-
- That says something. </connor>
<connor> - More than anything. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like how critical
do you want to be. </garnt>
<garnt> It's more like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, you can say you really
didn't fucking like a movie </garnt>
<garnt> and not finish it </garnt>
<garnt> because I've done that plenty
of times with anime, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> But if you want me to
properly critique it, </garnt>
<garnt> then there's only so much I can critique </garnt>
<garnt> without seeing all of it
because I didn't see all of it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a nuanced argument, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think you should very
much be allowed to say, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I thought something sucked </garnt>
<connor> because I didn't finish it." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know? </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- I know, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I feel like if I was watching
that many movies as well, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't be- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you gotta start using
your time wisely, right? </joey>
<connor> You don't wanna waste
your time on something </connor>
<garnt> that you think is just gonna be, </garnt>
<connor> your opinion's not gonna change on it </connor>
<joey> regardless of if you finish it or not. </joey>
<joey> - You know what the best TV show </joey>
<garnt> that I've watched that came out recently? </garnt>
<connor> - "Severance." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, dude.
- I watched that too. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude.
- What the fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was gonna talk
about some good shit </connor>
<connor> that I've watched recently. </connor>
<connor> - "Severance" is probably
one the most interesting </connor>
<joey> and best TV shows I've
watched in a long time. </joey>
<joey> - Sell it to me. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm gonna do a bad version, </joey>
<joey> then Garnt can do the good version. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - The plot of this world </joey>
<garnt> is that there is a
procedure that you can get </garnt>
<garnt> that'll split your mind into two. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have two consciousness, </garnt>
<connor> one that goes to work and one
that does everything not work. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So essentially there'll
be two characters </connor>
<connor> in the same body. </connor>
<joey> And they don't have any
memories of the other. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - So the person in work
only existence is work </joey>
<joey> and they don't know anything else. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And the person outside of
work only has outside of work </joey>
<joey> and doesn't know anything else. </joey>
<joey> And so it's kind of really interesting </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's dealing with, all right, </joey>
<joey> well, if you only worked all the time, </joey>
<connor> you would probably get miserable </connor>
<connor> and want to not work all the time. </connor>
<connor> So then they're trying to, </connor>
<connor> there's really interesting side plots </connor>
<connor> of when they're trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> what their outside person is doing. </connor>
<connor> And then the outside
person's trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> what the inside person's doing. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh cool. </connor>
<connor> - And the company they work
at is really mysterious. </connor>
<connor> We don't really know what they do. </connor>
<connor> And so it's kind of like, </connor>
<connor> and it's very, very creepy and- </connor>
<connor> - Cool. </connor>
<garnt> - It's pretty interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> You should watch it. </garnt>
<connor> - So what's the good version? </connor>
<garnt> - That was actually pretty good. </garnt>
<connor> - You did it. </connor>
<connor> - Try and sell extra, fluff it up. </connor>
<connor> - I'll do the bad version, I guess. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine "Black Mirror" was good again. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But they had a good
premise and they ran with it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, okay, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I watched the season </garnt>
<garnt> and it felt very "Black Mirror"-esque </garnt>
<connor> but when "Black Mirror"
had very interesting ideas </connor>
<connor> and wasn't just fucking just- </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Miley Cyrus, Hannah Montana. </garnt>
<garnt> - Going to the bottom of the barrel, </garnt>
<connor> being like, yeah, we can make
a fucking episode about this. </connor>
<joey> But it has a very interesting
concept, as Connor just said. </joey>
<joey> And they run with it and they
explore every single facet </joey>
<connor> that I wanted to explore out of it. </connor>
<connor> They definitely bring out </connor>
<connor> the ethical aspect about it as well </connor>
<connor> of just, is, if you
separate your memories, </connor>
<connor> is that person essentially a new person </connor>
<connor> or is it just still you? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause in a certain argument, </connor>
<connor> they are both the same person </connor>
<connor> because you come from
the same personality. </connor>
<connor> You just don't share
the memories of working </connor>
<connor> and the life outside of work. </connor>
<connor> But if you separate the memories, </connor>
<connor> does that mean that's two separate people </connor>
<garnt> that are living in one body as well? </garnt>
<connor> - Chris really liked it too. </connor>
<connor> And Chris, funnily enough, watched it. </connor>
<connor> It's on Apple TV though, which- </connor>
<joey> - Well, if Chris watched it,
it must be a masterpiece. </joey>
<connor> - Chris really liked it too. </connor>
<joey> Everyone I know who's watched it- </joey>
<joey> - No, that sounds really cool, though. </joey>
<connor> - Literally, everyone
I know who watched it </connor>
<connor> really enjoyed it. </connor>
<joey> - That definitely sounds
like a show I would like. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and no one's talking about it </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's on Apple TV. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The only reason that
I was able to watch it </connor>
<connor> was because we were luckily
provided iPads by GeeXPlus. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right.
- To use for work. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like, great, </garnt>
<garnt> I have a device to watch it on now. </garnt>
<garnt> Perfect, 'cause I couldn't do that before. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh cool. </connor>
<connor> - I pretty much just saw an
article where they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Apple TV has some really
interesting shows," </connor>
<connor> and it came up and I thought,
wow, that looks really good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And then the reviews </connor>
<garnt> were insane.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I thought, wow, okay. </connor>
<garnt> And yeah, honestly I really hope </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't mess up the landing </garnt>
<connor> 'cause season one was really, really good. </connor>
<garnt> - Season one is really,
really good and holy fuck, </garnt>
<connor> did they end-
- That cliffhanger </connor>
<joey> - On a cliffhanger.
- Oh boy. </joey>
<garnt> - God fucking dammit. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, but that's also scary, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause people were saying </joey>
<joey> the same thing about
"Black Mirror" as well. </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Damn, season one, though. </joey>
<connor> Hope they stick the landing." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think "Black Mirror's" </joey>
<joey> basically not gonna continue </joey>
<connor> 'cause it's in legal
battles for ownership. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really?
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's in legal trouble. </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit. </connor>
<connor> - I think when they sold their rights, </connor>
<connor> something was iffy and there's arguments </connor>
<connor> over who owns the rights
to "Black Mirror." </connor>
<connor> So I think pretty much,
"Black Mirror's" dead. </connor>
<garnt> - Damn.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I think. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, that doesn't sadden me too much </garnt>
<connor> because they were definitely- </connor>
<connor> - Running out of ideas. </connor>
<garnt> - They were definitely
running out of ideas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Something scratched that itch though. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was the show, so I'm glad. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm glad we got something. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that's good.
- (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> with "Black Mirror," I remember
season one and season two </connor>
<connor> being fucking incredible.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then season three was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, there are some really good episodes </connor>
<connor> and then some are just
really weird episodes." </connor>
<connor> And then season four onwards </connor>
<connor> was just, why are you
putting Miley Cyrus in this? </connor>
<connor> - That's- </connor>
<connor> - I didn't even get to that point. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And season five was even worse, Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't even watch season five, no. </connor>
<connor> - It sucked. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I mean,
there's only so many ideas </connor>
<connor> you can come up with </connor>
<connor> with it being an anthology
of different ideas </connor>
<connor> but "Severance," fucking great </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it's just one idea
just explored to the fullest. </garnt>
<connor> Very happy. </connor>
<garnt> - Such good acting as well.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The acting is so good. </garnt>
<connor> All these characters are so creepy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And believable. </connor>
<connor> - It's so cool.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was perfectly casted, as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Definitely check it out </connor>
<garnt> before it gets too hype. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And then you won't watch it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, then I won't watch it, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> If another person starts talking about it, </joey>
<connor> I'd be like, no, I don't wanna- </connor>
<connor> - Currently, no one is talking, </connor>
<connor> I literally don't know
anyone who's talking, </connor>
<connor> I never see anyone talk about it so, yeah. </connor>
<joey> If you want a really interesting TV show- </joey>
<connor> - I gotta watch it before
this episode goes live </connor>
<joey> in a couple of days. </joey>
<joey> - I guarantee, if you watch
one episode, you'll be hooked. </joey>
<joey> It's one of those shows </joey>
<connor> where it starts so strong
and it's really interesting. </connor>
<connor> - Sure, sure. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, watch it if you can. </connor>
<connor> It's really interesting. </connor>
<garnt> Actually, yeah, amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Amazing show.
- Cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Speaking about something </garnt>
<connor> that everyone seems to
be talking about now </connor>
<connor> that I hang out with </connor>
<connor> - "Spy x Family." </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking "Spy Family."
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't know how
big it had gotten here. </garnt>
<connor> In the UK, even people
who barely watch anime, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "Yo, you
watching "Spy Family"? </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- Or "Spy x Family"? </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh my God."
- Fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - Everyone-
- I pronounce the x </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm a chad. </connor>
<joey> - It's pronounced
Spike's family, actually. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing)
- Spike's family. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, I mean, it's been a while </garnt>
<garnt> since I've just seen an anime </garnt>
<garnt> just blow up this
quickly, I guess, 'cause- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, right from the get
go, it was fucking solid. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, the manga was
insanely popular in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think it was- </connor>
<connor> - But I remember I was so scared </connor>
<joey> 'cause I've been a fan
of the manga for ages now </joey>
<garnt> and when I was about to
watch the first episode, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, please, please let it be good. </garnt>
<garnt> Please don't fuck this up. </garnt>
<garnt> And thank God they didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right.
- But I wasn't expecting, </garnt>
<connor> yeah, as you're saying,
I was not expecting it </connor>
<joey> to be the talk of the town, essentially. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I expected, </garnt>
<garnt> because I just feel like holy fuck, </garnt>
<joey> Shonen Jump are just on a
different level right now </joey>
<joey> in terms of making mega hitters </joey>
<joey> because it feels like, </joey>
<connor> it feels like when Shonen
Jump release new anime, </connor>
<connor> it's like Shonen Jump, and
then every other anime. </connor>
<joey> - True.
- Pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it doesn't even feel </joey>
<joey> like you're talking to a anime fan </joey>
<garnt> if they say they watch Shonen Jump stuff </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone's
watching Shonen Jump stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - Imagine if we got a
good "Berserk" adaptation. </connor>
<connor> - Just imagine. </connor>
<connor> But even so, </connor>
<connor> I even don't think it would be
as popular as "Spy x Family" </connor>
<connor> or "Demon Slayer" or something like that. </connor>
<connor> I think the only IP </connor>
<joey> that can really stand
up to Shonen Jump IPs </joey>
<joey> is "Attack on Titan."
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that's the outlier, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Which is just a
different Shonen magazine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Final season part one deluxe edition. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- (indistinct). </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but I mean, it's just, </joey>
<joey> I haven't read the
manga of "Spy x Family," </joey>
<garnt> it's just a really, really good show. </garnt>
<connor> - I haven't watched it
yet, I've been saving it </connor>
<connor> 'cause I wanna binge it all
for one big serotonin boost. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's really solid.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Even from a manga read, </connor>
<garnt> it's really, really
solid adaptation, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's nothing I
can really say about it </garnt>
<connor> other than it's just a
good show from a good manga </connor>
<connor> with a fucking amazing adaptation. </connor>
<connor> They nailed Anya. </connor>
<garnt> As a character- </garnt>
<joey> - We're gonna be seeing
reaction images of her </joey>
<garnt> for the next four months, at least. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, right, I know. </garnt>
<connor> She's so-
- Every Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, she's so fucking adorable. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - She will single handedly </connor>
<garnt> save Japan's fucking
aging population, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Depression been mad
quiet since Anya came out. </joey>
<garnt> - The Japanese population that
aren't having enough babies, </garnt>
<garnt> one Anya.
- You can have this! </garnt>
<garnt> You can have this right now! </garnt>
<connor> - This is all you can have, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - This is what you're missing out on! </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, 'cause that was the
only thing I was worried about </joey>
<joey> was because the dialogue </joey>
<connor> is what made "Spy Family"
so fucking good in the manga </connor>
<connor> so I was like, </connor>
<connor> if they nail the voice
acting and the casting, </connor>
<garnt> this is gonna be huge. </garnt>
<garnt> And they fucking nailed the casting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - At least, especially the Japanese one. </garnt>
<joey> The voice for Anya is perfect. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the big thing </garnt>
<garnt> that really makes it stand out </garnt>
<garnt> is the cast really nailed the chemistry </garnt>
<garnt> between the mum, dad, and the daughter. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Obviously Anya gets all the spotlight </garnt>
<garnt> but just the dynamic, </garnt>
<garnt> seeing the dynamic play out between, </garnt>
<joey> if you don't know the
premise of "Spy x Family," </joey>
<joey> it's a family that has a
spy in it and assassin in it </joey>
<joey> and Anya who is a kid- </joey>
<joey> - Can read minds.
- Mind reader, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That has telepathy, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's a really, really weird mix of people </garnt>
<garnt> but they nail this
family dynamic perfectly </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I remember just
it's equal parts funny </garnt>
<garnt> and wholesome as well. </garnt>
<joey> I remember seeing- </joey>
<joey> - It's like an (indistinct)
that's actually funny. </joey>
<garnt> - Little bit of everything. </garnt>
<joey> - Little bit of everything. </joey>
<connor> - A little bit of everything. </connor>
<garnt> - A little sprinkle of everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, a little bit of everything </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I remember coming back
from the wedding last weekend </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember, oh, the newest episode </garnt>
<garnt> of "Spy x Family" just came out. </garnt>
<garnt> I watched it and I just thought, </garnt>
<garnt> I was already high up on positive vibes </garnt>
<garnt> and "Spy x Family" gave
me such wholesome vibes </garnt>
<garnt> that I almost fucking cried </garnt>
<garnt> just 'cause I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> just 'cause of how
fucking happy I felt, man. </garnt>
<joey> - I love how you're just
like, "Fuck the wedding, </joey>
<garnt> a new 'Spy Family' episode
just came out, dog." </garnt>
<garnt> That's where my happiness is right now. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Real shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the real shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never thought I could
burst full of wholesomeness- </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt's at the altar like this, bro. </garnt>
<joey> Oh shit, oh fuck. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, yeah happy for you. </joey>
<connor> Oh, Anya. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm just like,
"Hold on Sydney, hold on. </garnt>
<garnt> Before you say your vows,
all right, I'm ready now. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm ready, I'm ready." </garnt>
<connor> - Opens his wallet, </connor>
<joey> it's just a picture of Anya. </joey>
<joey> It's like, that's what I'm fighting for. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Real shit. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what I'm fighting for right now. </joey>
<joey> - Are you watching the
anime of "Spy x Family" </joey>
<garnt> or are you just- </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no, I am actually watching it </joey>
<joey> because, yeah, I watched the first episode </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Oh shit, </joey>
<joey> this is actually a fucking
amazing adaptation." </joey>
<joey> So, yeah, I am watching it. </joey>
<joey> I'm not caught up to the
latest latest episode, but. </joey>
<joey> I'm watching it kind
of on and off and yeah, </joey>
<joey> it's fucking great. </joey>
<joey> I can see why people are hyped about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, you know, you were saying that, </joey>
<joey> oh yeah, Anya's the new favorite </joey>
<joey> but I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> I've seen a lot of fucking Yor- </joey>
<joey> - I have, I have, I have. </joey>
<connor> - Pictures and it's like oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I know which character
you're talking about, </connor>
<connor> I don't even know what their name is. </connor>
<connor> You said the name, but-
- Yor. </connor>
<connor> - I'm guessing it's the woman, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like oh my God, first
time in God knows how many years </connor>
<joey> where waifu of the season
is not a high schooler. </joey>
<joey> So thank God.
- Yeah, I know, right? </joey>
<joey> - Well done.
- It's a mother, it's a MILF. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a mother.
- It's a MILF. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's actually a MILF, thank you. </garnt>
<garnt> Well done, guys. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess I'll have to check it out. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, it's so weird </connor>
<connor> just 'cause obviously I
expect it to be popular. </connor>
<connor> I didn't expect it to be
this popular this quickly. </connor>
<connor> Even "Demon Slayer" took 18 episodes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - To really burst in popularity. </connor>
<joey> - "Spy Family" just literally took two. </joey>
<connor> - Be good to see if it sticks
around for the entire run. </connor>
<joey> - I think it will. </joey>
<joey> - I would be very surprised
if it's only one season. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the manga's doing insane
numbers right now as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I saw the manga sales
of the last month in Japan </garnt>
<connor> and it's number one, number two, </connor>
<connor> number three, number four, number five, </connor>
<connor> all volumes of "Spy x Family." </connor>
<garnt> - That's how it always is with the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause an anime comes out, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> and manga gets a giant boost in sales. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause people wanna read the manga. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I'm like, man, Shonen Jump </garnt>
<garnt> just can't miss right now 'cause this, </garnt>
<connor> I didn't even think "Spy x Family" </connor>
<connor> was going to be the big show
that they released this year. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was gonna be- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey and Garnt] "Chainsaw Man." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And then "Spy"-
- When is that coming out? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's coming out this year as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I think it's the summer, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay-
- Summer- </connor>
<joey> - Next season, I think. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like that's been, </joey>
<joey> everyone's like, "I'm so hype for that." </joey>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Yeah,
weren't we hype a year ago?" </connor>
<joey> Wait, what's going on with that? </joey>
<joey> - Dude, Fujimoto just released
three one-shots in that span. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my God, dude. </connor>
<connor> - Which you fucking need to read. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> He brought out a, </garnt>
<connor> I recently read a one-shot
called "Goodbye, Eri." </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - By him, and it's fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> It's probably one of the best
one-shots I've ever read. </connor>
<connor> The dude manages to
basically give the plot </connor>
<connor> of a movie's worth of plot in 200 pages. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - And it's fucking incredible. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I read it the other
day 'cause Twitch chat </connor>
<connor> was like, "Have you read
it, have you read it, </connor>
<connor> have you read it yet?" </connor>
<connor> And so I was like, </connor>
<connor> and you can read it for free as well. </connor>
<connor> On the Jump+, I'm making
it sound like an ad. </connor>
<connor> I'm not even paid for this shit. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] (indistinct). </garnt>
<joey> - Thanks, Shueisha. </joey>
<garnt> I'll wait for my royalties. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do they need us to shout them out </garnt>
<garnt> to know that Shonen Jump exists? </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> So Jump+ is on another
fucking level right now. </joey>
<joey> - It's like being like, yeah, </joey>
<connor> shout out to Disney, by the way. </connor>
<connor> Loving the stuff you're
doing with Marvel, whatever. </connor>
<connor> - They own the entire world. </connor>
<joey> - Waiting for the royalties soon, Disney. </joey>
<joey> Walt, I'm waiting for your call, Walt. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause even Disney now </garnt>
<garnt> have also come into the anime
race, you know, fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> They've picked up one of the
best seasonal animes, I think, </garnt>
<connor> is (indistinct), </connor>
<connor> which is like "Summertime Render," </connor>
<connor> which no one can really
watch right now because- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Is it on Disney+? </connor>
<connor> - It's on Disney+.
- It's on Disney+. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's on Disney+ </connor>
<connor> and it's a Disney+ exclusive. </connor>
<connor> But they're not releasing it- </connor>
<connor> - Back in my day, all the anime </connor>
<garnt> was on one platform. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Camera Person] One
more anime that was aired </garnt>
<garnt> a couple of seasons back
is in Disney+ as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Camera Person] (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it actually?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck.
- I see ads on Facebook, </garnt>
<garnt> everywhere's like,
(indistinct) on Disney+. </garnt>
<joey> - Fuck.
- That's so weird. </joey>
<garnt> What a weird timeline we're living in </garnt>
<garnt> where Disney is like, </garnt>
<joey> "You kids ever heard of anime before?" </joey>
<garnt> That's so weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so surreal to think
that it's gotten to this point </garnt>
<garnt> where now Disney is getting
involved in the anime arms race. </garnt>
<joey> I thought they just, </joey>
<joey> they had their thing
with Ghibli, you know? </joey>
<joey> I never thought they
cared about anything else </joey>
<garnt> outside of Ghibli. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I always thought
Disney's idea of anime </garnt>
<joey> was just "Princess Mononoke." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- That's a movie. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Anyway. </joey>
<connor> - Is it made by Hayao
Miyazaki or not, okay? </connor>
<connor> I guess it just doesn't exist then. </connor>
<connor> - Doesn't exist.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - I saw you finally
completed Elden Ring as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I did, Elden Ring was very fun. </connor>
<garnt> - How was that? </garnt>
<connor> - Great game, when are you gonna play it? </connor>
<joey> - When I-
- When I have free time. </joey>
<joey> - When I have time to invest
on being addicted to something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's amazing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </connor>
<connor> Elden Ring's amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I saw you playing it </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, God fucking damn, </connor>
<connor> that looks so fun but I know- </connor>
<connor> - It is, it's really fun. </connor>
<garnt> - But I know as soon
as I start Elden Ring, </garnt>
<connor> it's just gonna be like </connor>
<connor> when I started Breath of the Wild again </connor>
<joey> where-
- Goodbye productivity. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, goodbye productivity, </joey>
<joey> goodbye free time </joey>
<connor> 'cause I am doing nothing
but playing this game. </connor>
<joey> - How many hours did you sink into it? </joey>
<joey> - Nearly 70, I think.
- Okay, that's not too bad. </joey>
<connor> - On my first play through. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's really, really fun. </joey>
<connor> I got to say it's probably
one of the best games </connor>
<connor> I've played ever. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I know people who sank 200 hours </joey>
<connor> and still haven't beaten it. </connor>
<connor> - Well, yeah, 'cause I mean, </connor>
<connor> I like to play games on stream </connor>
<connor> and I don't really wanna, </connor>
<connor> right now, I don't wanna
keep playing it on stream </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've streamed it a shit ton </connor>
<connor> but I could easily do
multiple play throughs </connor>
<connor> and enjoy every second of it. </connor>
<connor> There's some, I didn't even see all of it. </connor>
<connor> I missed so much stuff. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's open world </connor>
<connor> so there's just so much to do. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, honestly, really,
really amazing game. </connor>
<connor> So many cool fights, really
fun, really satisfying. </connor>
<connor> One of the best game
designs just hands down. </connor>
<connor> The world, oh my God, dude. </connor>
<connor> The world building in that game </connor>
<connor> is just second to none. </connor>
<connor> You've never seen a world built like that. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<garnt> - I've never heard you talk
about world building before. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I never cared. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, Connor,
what, it must be fucking. </connor>
<connor> - You know something's up </connor>
<connor> when Mr. Game Mechanics over here </connor>
<joey> is like "World building, though, ooh!" </joey>
<connor> - I've never cared. </connor>
<joey> But the fact that they build
so many cool set pieces. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just these giant areas
that you go to once </connor>
<garnt> and you're like, how much hours </garnt>
<garnt> did they sink in building this? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And you're there for
10 minutes, you're gone. </connor>
<connor> Or this one boss fight. </connor>
<connor> And they built this whole giant thing </connor>
<connor> leading up to the boss
fight, and it's like, what, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Like, oh my God, just some
of the areas you're like, </connor>
<joey> this is so cool and creative. </joey>
<joey> How the fuck did you come up with this? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Miyazaki, man. </joey>
<connor> He's build-
- It's insane. </connor>
<connor> It's insane. </connor>
<connor> The whole, I've never cared
about how a game world looks </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's like, okay,
you go into a place, </connor>
<connor> the boss arena, you leave. </connor>
<connor> No, every single aspect of this world </connor>
<connor> is just so cool and tells
an interesting story. </connor>
<connor> And it's honestly such a good game. </connor>
<garnt> Really, really fucking good. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, one thing that's
really surprised me </connor>
<connor> about what I've seen people
talking about about Elden Ring </connor>
<connor> is how friendly it is to beginners. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah-
- And how accessible it is. </connor>
<connor> - You can do whatever you need to do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I feel like
because it's open world </connor>
<garnt> and because there are so many options, </garnt>
<garnt> in previous Souls games, </garnt>
<garnt> you get to a hard boss or something </garnt>
<garnt> or you get to this one point </garnt>
<garnt> and people who were not as
pro-gamer, whatever, you know- </garnt>
<joey> - There's a hard skill cap, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there is a hard skill cap </joey>
<garnt> where they could do nothing
aside from try to beat this boss </garnt>
<garnt> and if they couldn't beat this boss, </garnt>
<connor> then I guess they just give up </connor>
<connor> or they just do something else </connor>
<connor> but because Elden Ring is open world, </connor>
<connor> there is just so much more opportunity. </connor>
<connor> If they find a hard boss, </connor>
<connor> then they can try doing something else, </connor>
<connor> they can grind up a bit </connor>
<connor> or I've heard that there
are many different builds </connor>
<garnt> and many different variations </garnt>
<garnt> to whatever type of play
style you wanna do as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And some are definitely
easier than others. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, some are completely busted. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> What's the busted ones, then? </garnt>
<connor> - It's the blood one. </connor>
<connor> There's a bleed mechanic in the game </connor>
<connor> with certain swords
that cause 'em to bleed </connor>
<connor> and does percent damage. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - So percent damage on bosses
you can imagine is quite big. </connor>
<garnt> And some swords can apply
it very, very quickly. </garnt>
<garnt> So you can just chunk
through bosses in seconds </garnt>
<garnt> with some builds.
- Right. </garnt>
<connor> - And other builds, not so much. </connor>
<connor> But I messed around in
the hard area a bunch. </connor>
<garnt> And then I went to the easy area </garnt>
<garnt> where I think I was supposed to go. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you can do
whatever you want, really. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then I absolutely
steamrolled this area, </connor>
<connor> two shotting bosses and stuff.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I had gone messed around
in the really hard area </garnt>
<garnt> that I shouldn't have been in, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's the way I
enjoyed playing the game, </garnt>
<garnt> it was really fun. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it got really
difficult towards the end, </garnt>
<garnt> but that was really fun as well. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I was kind of
over leveled a little bit </garnt>
<connor> and so it was really fun. </connor>
<connor> I just, I had a really great time. </connor>
<connor> There's not many boss fights
that I thought were bad. </connor>
<connor> All of the main bosses were sick. </connor>
<connor> So fucking cool, dude.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Such cool bosses. </connor>
<connor> Just a fun time. </connor>
<connor> Really fun time streaming it as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Would you say it's as difficult </garnt>
<garnt> as people make it out to be? </garnt>
<garnt> - Again, it's as difficult
as you want it to be. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You can summon spirits and stuff. </connor>
<joey> So things that come in the fight for you </joey>
<joey> and that helps a lot
'cause it just takes aggro. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The boss will stop hitting
you and hit something else. </connor>
<connor> So then that's more useful
than them doing damage. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But some of them do
damage as well, a lot. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<garnt> - So yeah, I mean, it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> Play it, it's fun. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really, really fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I will definitely play it. </garnt>
<joey> - I will, I just need to
find the time to do it. </joey>
<joey> - I want to there to be, </joey>
<garnt> I hope there's a game that
can get game of the year </garnt>
<garnt> over this game 'cause I'd welcome that. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] That would be
incredible if there was- </connor>
<connor> - I don't know how that would happen- </connor>
<connor> - If there was a game of the year. </connor>
<connor> - I hate being that guy that's like, </connor>
<connor> "It's game of the year,"
but I don't know what- </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, man, </joey>
<connor> have you played the
new Kirby game, though? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what could- </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty fucking poor. </connor>
<connor> - In my mind, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what could top this this year </connor>
<connor> for a gaming experience </connor>
<connor> that is collectively agreed upon </connor>
<connor> to be an amazing. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I'd be shocked
if it wasn't that game. </joey>
<connor> - I'd be shocked.
- I'd be very shocked as well </connor>
<joey> - I'd welcome it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that means more games for me. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I haven't even played it </connor>
<connor> and I reckon it's gonna be it. </connor>
<connor> - The only other game that's
probably better than it </connor>
<joey> is Metal Gear Revengence </joey>
<garnt> which I played. </garnt>
<connor> That was fun, that was great. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just so happy the Revengence memes </connor>
<connor> have come back. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Have you played it? </connor>
<garnt> - I haven't played it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] You haven't played it. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I feel like I've
experienced 90% of it </garnt>
<garnt> just through memes itself. </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, it's so good. </connor>
<connor> I played it, I did it on stream </connor>
<garnt> and yeah, it was amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> What a fun game. </garnt>
<connor> Cut scenes were as amazing as you think. </connor>
<garnt> - Armstrong is one of my
favorite video game characters </garnt>
<connor> of all time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - How did the Japanese portray America </garnt>
<garnt> better than most American games, right? </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's so good.
- So good. </connor>
<connor> - It's just so cool seeing a game </connor>
<garnt> that just goes beyond time. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so impactful that it
doesn't matter how old it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think one thing
that really impressed me </garnt>
<garnt> with seeing people play
Metal Gear Revengence </garnt>
<connor> is just the music is just fucking insane. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Dude, it's so good. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not just insane </garnt>
<garnt> but it kind of matches up </garnt>
<connor> with the scene or the level
that you're playing as well. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, the amount of, </connor>
<connor> that's what sells Revengence to me </connor>
<connor> because I love anime, </connor>
<connor> like Fooly Cooly that makes it feel </connor>
<connor> like you're watching a
music video or something </connor>
<connor> as you're watching the anime. </connor>
<connor> But Revengence feels like
you're playing a music video </connor>
<connor> as you're going along. </connor>
<connor> And that's the biggest
selling point for me </connor>
<connor> with Revengence.
- It's just so good. </connor>
<garnt> It's such a fun game </garnt>
<garnt> and the mechanics are so tight </garnt>
<garnt> and the cut scenes are just hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's so overly political </garnt>
<garnt> that it's so funny </garnt>
<garnt> but also it's like some things he says, </garnt>
<connor> you're like, "Oh, wow,
kinda little on the nose." </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And then obviously all the
memes that came out of it </garnt>
<garnt> are so good.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - If you haven't played the
game, again, I recommend it. </connor>
<garnt> - How long did it take you to complete? </garnt>
<connor> - I played it on hard
and I kind of regret it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I felt like there's
just so many very hard moments. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I wasn't very good at the game </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's very fast.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the medium is
probably the best way </garnt>
<garnt> to enjoy the game initially. </garnt>
<garnt> And it'd be like five hours,
but it took me 10 hours </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I was playing on
hard and failing on bosses </connor>
<connor> all the fucking time.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you play it in
one sitting, one stream? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, one sitting, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh, okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the last fight is so worth it. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause the Armstrong is
just such a fun fight. </connor>
<connor> And it's crazy, dude. </connor>
<garnt> And the button mashing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - One way is just fucking standing there, </connor>
<connor> you're just like-
- Yeah, he's... </connor>
<connor> Nano machine, son. </connor>
<connor> I feel I'm part of the
meme experience now. </connor>
<connor> That's why, I'd played it before, </connor>
<garnt> but I'd gotten halfway and I quit. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I got stuck
'cause it's a hard game. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Some of the boss
fights are fucking hard. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- So yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I mean play on normal, </garnt>
<garnt> if you want a chill
time or more easy, even. </garnt>
<joey> - I definitely wanna play it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You can do it in five hours. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, okay. </joey>
<joey> Just one stream. </joey>
<joey> - And two hours is cut scenes. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, brilliant, brilliant. </garnt>
<connor> My favorite. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's literally- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it is a Kojima game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's-
- You know, of course. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<connor> If you haven't played it, go and watch it. </connor>
<joey> You've probably watched all
the incorrect telling of </joey>
<joey> and all that, </joey>
<joey> where the names come from. </joey>
<joey> And that I made it the fuck up </joey>
<joey> and making the mother of
all omelets here, Jack. </joey>
<garnt> I love that-
- I fucking love that line. </garnt>
<garnt> That's my favorite line.
- It's so good. </garnt>
<connor> - So good.
- Such a good game, fuck. </connor>
<connor> What a game, what a game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I feel like I would game, </connor>
<connor> there's one console I
really, really fucking want </connor>
<connor> and it's the Steam Deck. </connor>
<connor> - You want the Steam Deck?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause so many times, I'm just not in- </garnt>
<connor> - That'd be a fun game to play
on the Steam Deck, actually. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's less about
just the Steam Deck itself </garnt>
<connor> and it's more of, there's so many games </connor>
<connor> I just wanna play on the go. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Because, especially now
we're traveling so much </connor>
<connor> and I don't stream as often as you guys. </connor>
<joey> There's less time where I
sit down in front of the PC </joey>
<joey> or on a couch and I game, you know? </joey>
<joey> But if there was, that's why I like, </joey>
<connor> the console I game the most on </connor>
<connor> is probably whenever I play a Switch game </connor>
<connor> because it's just so easy to just pick up </connor>
<connor> whenever I need to play it </connor>
<connor> and just continue it
at my own convenience. </connor>
<connor> And I was always looking for a console </connor>
<connor> to play the more intensive games on. </connor>
<connor> While also going on the go </connor>
<connor> and the Steam Deck seems perfect for that </connor>
<connor> but, my God, is it
impossible to get right now? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The waiting list for that is... </connor>
<garnt> - I know some people who've got it </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, "How the
fuck did you get it? </garnt>
<garnt> Who did you sell your blood to?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've seen the prices on eBay </garnt>
<garnt> and they're twice to triple the price </garnt>
<joey> and the waiting list, I think
right now is a few months </joey>
<joey> so it's not too bad. </joey>
<joey> - Only a few months. </joey>
<joey> - I say that's not too bad </joey>
<joey> 'cause I know the people who
got the first shipping of it, </joey>
<garnt> they had to sign up a year
plus before, I believe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking- </garnt>
<connor> - I've heard mixed things about it. </connor>
<connor> There's some good things, some bad things. </connor>
<garnt> But overall, I think it's good. </garnt>
<garnt> From what I've seen. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the mixed things
you've heard about it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I saw that the,
some games it struggles with. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember what I saw. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember there was some downsides. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember though. </garnt>
<garnt> Weeks ago, I watched these videos. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember it wasn't perfect. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, when is it? </connor>
<connor> - When is it, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm not, </connor>
<connor> I don't really care about the frame rates </connor>
<connor> or the FPS or whatever too much. </connor>
<connor> No, I just want a competent
gaming experience on the go </connor>
<connor> for some games that I would
normally play on the PC </connor>
<connor> or somewhere else. </connor>
<connor> And that seems that's all I really want </connor>
<connor> from the Steam Deck </connor>
<connor> and that seems like the perfect console </connor>
<connor> to what I need right now. </connor>
<connor> - Seems so, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Definitely.
- Man. </connor>
<garnt> - What are you playing now, Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> How's Kirby? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I haven't done
the post-game stuff yet </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I've just kinda been fucking around </garnt>
<garnt> just trying to play a bunch of stuff. </garnt>
<connor> I started playing Kaizo Emerald </connor>
<connor> which is one of the hardest Pokemon mods. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - That mod is hard as shit. </connor>
<connor> It took me six hours
to beat the first gym. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's hard as shit. </connor>
<connor> - Well, why is it hard? </connor>
<garnt> - Because not only is, well, first of all, </garnt>
<garnt> every trainer is unavoidable.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you have to fight every trainer </garnt>
<garnt> and every trainer is optimized. </garnt>
<garnt> So literally every trainer fight </garnt>
<garnt> is like fighting a
professional Pokemon player. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - So the moves are optimized.
- Oh. </garnt>
<connor> - And all the IVs are
optimized and everything </connor>
<connor> and you're basically
just going against that. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - And it's intense as fuck. </joey>
<connor> - Have you seen those people
beating the Pokemon games </connor>
<joey> with level one Pokemon? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they beat-
- How is that possible? </connor>
<joey> - Like Smallant and stuff, right, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause you swap
out poison, substitute, </connor>
<connor> basically all the moves that make you rage </connor>
<connor> when you have it, </connor>
<garnt> you're like, I'll try and
play Pokemon competitively. </garnt>
<garnt> You play and then someone's just like, </garnt>
<connor> substitute, mimic, poison spikes, reflect, </connor>
<connor> and it's like (hand slams) stop! </connor>
<garnt> Let me hit it! </garnt>
<garnt> Let me hit your Pokemon! </garnt>
<joey> - Literally, I knew it was bad </joey>
<connor> because for one, the first rival fight, </connor>
<connor> it just spammed sand attack seven times </connor>
<connor> and then it just slowly drained my Pokemon </connor>
<joey> to the point where I
lost the first battle. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, this isn't
gonna go well at all. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, fuck. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I wanna do more Pokemon runs. </joey>
<joey> The Pokemon runs are so fun. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm probably gonna continue that </joey>
<joey> 'cause that's just like, you know? </joey>
<joey> As a long-time Pokemon gamer, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> this is the first time where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Finally, a Pokemon game
is actually a challenge." </joey>
<garnt> - Finally a worthy opponent.
- Finally a worthy opponent. </garnt>
<garnt> You thought Nuzlockes were hard, </garnt>
<garnt> this game is fucking hard, yeah, so. </garnt>
<garnt> - So what's the base game that it mods? </garnt>
<joey> - Pokemon Emerald. </joey>
<connor> - Emerald, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - All the mods are on Emerald, right? </connor>
<joey> - Weirdly. </joey>
<connor> - It's usually third gen, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wonder why. </connor>
<joey> - Usually Emerald or, I don't know, </joey>
<garnt> maybe it's because it's- </garnt>
<garnt> - Easy to.
- A fan favorite. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's a solid game. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But there's also </connor>
<joey> a lot of mods for gen
four and stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> - There's tons of mods for
Breath of the Wild and stuff. </connor>
<joey> I don't know how they do it, I mean, </joey>
<connor> it sounds cool, though. </connor>
<joey> - I really wanna play mods </joey>
<connor> for Breath of the Wild and Switch games, </connor>
<connor> but I'm also scared to fuck my Switch up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </garnt>
<joey> Well, Breath of the
Wild is one of the games </joey>
<joey> where you can definitely see </joey>
<joey> that being a modders heaven, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you have so much
freedom in that game as it is </joey>
<garnt> in the base game, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't imagine how it would be </garnt>
<joey> if it was like- </joey>
<garnt> - I've seen so many
cool mod videos of that. </garnt>
<joey> - I've seen everything's Among Us. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm not kidding. </joey>
<garnt> Everyone's the Among Us... </garnt>
<connor> I like it, I just like it, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the one, the
fucking PointCrow video </joey>
<garnt> where when he says Shrek, </garnt>
<garnt> it summons 10 Shreks into the game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, I saw that one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is the dumbest video </garnt>
<joey> but it was so fun to watch.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - When is Among Us gonna die? </garnt>
<connor> When am I gonna stop finding
Among Us memes funny? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I thought I would-
- Never. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like they've gotten funnier </connor>
<garnt> and I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's because </garnt>
<garnt> they're starting to
become ironic, that's why. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you see the Among Us VR? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I was gonna say, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It actually looks good. </garnt>
<connor> It looks fun. </connor>
<connor> - That genuinely looks good. </connor>
<garnt> That might be a game I can finally get VR. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just can't wait for
the clips of Xbox mics </garnt>
<garnt> and someone's like this
with their Among Us. </garnt>
<garnt> Dude, you fucking-
- It was this guy. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't wait. </connor>
<connor> I can't wait to do the credit card on VR. </connor>
<connor> You're like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> Ugh! </connor>
<connor> I'm so hype for it. </connor>
<connor> It actually looked awesome. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It looks fun. </garnt>
<connor> - Really fun, yeah.
- I can't wait for it, dude. </connor>
<connor> I'm so hyped. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm hoping they
do include the voice chat </connor>
<connor> within the Among Us games this time. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, proximity.
- Yeah, proximity chat, </connor>
<connor> that'd be awesome.
- Yeah, that'd be fun. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I can't imagine having
to log into Discord in VR </connor>
<garnt> and having to log out. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's gonna have
to be proximity chat. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - It would be also perfect </garnt>
<garnt> if you did it on the
omni-directional moving pad as well </garnt>
<connor> so you literally have to run
through the halls and shit. </connor>
<connor> - That'd be so fun.
- That'd be so fun. </connor>
<connor> - I really wanna own those </connor>
<garnt> but it just seems impractical. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - When's that coming out? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I saw the trailer-
- No idea, </garnt>
<garnt> they didn't have a release date </garnt>
<joey> which normally means whenever
the fuck they finish it </joey>
<joey> which is probably a while. </joey>
<joey> - Which could be next year. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they should, I
hope they charge for it </joey>
<connor> 'cause I want it to be worth their time. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, it feels like this, </garnt>
<garnt> because they completely
just remade the game, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So they've basically just
built a new game, essentially </garnt>
<connor> from the ground up.
- Basically, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I don't think they
could have used anything </garnt>
<connor> from their previous game, </connor>
<connor> which was originally a mobile game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- To going full on VR. </connor>
<connor> - It's gonna be hard.
- So yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'm very excited </connor>
<connor> to try it out.
- Crazy. </connor>
<garnt> Might finally be able to
dust off the Valve Index. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Valve Index which I've never been- </garnt>
<garnt> - I still use mine. </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> VRChat's pretty fun.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, VRChat's good. </connor>
<joey> - It's just such a hassle to set up. </joey>
<joey> I kind of wish I got
the Oculus or whatever </joey>
<joey> which, 'cause that just seems
so much more convenient than, </joey>
<garnt> I get you get more freedom
with the Index and everything </garnt>
<garnt> and it's high resolution, but- </garnt>
<joey> - I still haven't streamed
on my Oculus though </joey>
<joey> just 'cause I'm dreading to set it up. </joey>
<joey> - Optimize the Index </joey>
<garnt> just 'cause I have the
things permanently up there. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's super easy.
- Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally just plug in the headset, </garnt>
<garnt> open up Steam and I'm literally doing it, </garnt>
<joey> so it's super painless for me. </joey>
<joey> Even then, I still get tired doing it. </joey>
<joey> I get exhausted.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - After three, four hours
of running around in VR, </joey>
<connor> I'm spent. </connor>
<connor> - I'm surprised you can
even spend that long. </connor>
<connor> I can't go more than two hours. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In any game, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Seriously, dude, it's really good. </connor>
<connor> VRChat is so good. </connor>
<joey> Like the mods on it and the
games in VRChat are so good. </joey>
<connor> I'm not Zuckerberg. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Shaking his fist. </garnt>
<garnt> - The power's with the people, Zuck. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't you understand? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, but I mean, I
guess this is gonna be, </connor>
<garnt> I guess we have a bunch
of guests coming on </garnt>
<garnt> the next episode, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So this is gonna be the
last boys episode for a while. </connor>
<connor> - For a while.
- For a while. </connor>
<connor> - Which I'm sure people are happy about </connor>
<garnt> 'cause we've had the
longest period of no guests. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel like you can tell </garnt>
<connor> 'cause people are like- </connor>
<connor> - When's the next guest? </connor>
<connor> - To be fair, it's our bad. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's been hard </connor>
<connor> 'cause the guests have been
limited 'cause, you know, </connor>
<connor> Japan has- </connor>
<garnt> - We can't be like, </garnt>
<garnt> let's invite Chris on a
fucking 10th time, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - We could have invited back more guests </connor>
<joey> but we thought, we kinda
just wanna try and- </joey>
<joey> - Keep it trying fresh. </joey>
<joey> Keep it fresh. </joey>
<garnt> - Obviously, Chris is the
fourth member, though. </garnt>
<connor> - Basically. </connor>
<connor> - Chris is welcome back on anytime. </connor>
<garnt> Basically, whenever he's
in Tokyo, he comes on. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so hopefully if you
guys want more guest episodes, </connor>
<garnt> you'll be getting a lot coming soon. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now that the world is opening up, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kinda like the
flood gates are now open. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sure, I can't wait for the, </connor>
<garnt> when are the boys gonna just
go back to the three of them. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause we're probably gonna have </connor>
<connor> a lot of guest episodes in a row. </connor>
<connor> So I know people are gonna say that </connor>
<connor> 'cause people do like the, </connor>
<joey> not that people don't like
the non-guest episodes, </joey>
<joey> people do actually really like them. </joey>
<joey> I know a lot of people </joey>
<joey> say that their favorites. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, yeah, we're gonna
have a lot of guests </joey>
<garnt> and then we'll try and
sprinkle in ours between. </garnt>
<garnt> Be interesting to see how people like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna be a new kind
of "Trash Taste,'" I think. </garnt>
<connor> - Season three. </connor>
<connor> - I guess it kind of is season three. </connor>
<connor> - Kind of is season three. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's gonna feel a bit different. </joey>
<joey> We're not gonna spoil what it is </joey>
<garnt> but yeah, "Trash Taste" is
gonna feel a little different </garnt>
<garnt> for a time, so look forward to that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, hope you enjoy it. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey, look at these Patreons, though. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right.
- Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's been so long </joey>
<joey> since I've recorded an episode, </joey>
<joey> I forgot that we had to
shout out the Patreons. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, </garnt>
<joey> what was the thing we have
to say after this again? </joey>
<joey> - We have to do the
outro as well, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but hey, if you
wanna support the show, </joey>

<connor> now that we've finally
said that in the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, see you there.
- Hopefully. </garnt>
<garnt> - See you there. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so if you're in
the LA area, see you then. </joey>
<garnt> - All right.

<joey> - [All] Bye. </joey>
