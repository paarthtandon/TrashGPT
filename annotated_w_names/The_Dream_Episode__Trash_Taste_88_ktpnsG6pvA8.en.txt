<garnt> feels american </garnt>
<connor> wow </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry we're british too </connor>
<garnt> i had to it's for three weeks </garnt>
<joey> it's been </joey>
<garnt> america in three weeks </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i like i remember when i got it </garnt>
<garnt> i was like i was honestly like a little </garnt>
<garnt> bit salty okay i was i was a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> salty not because obviously getting </garnt>
<garnt> covered sucks right yeah but uh i was a </garnt>
<connor> little bit salty because before i got </connor>
<connor> covered i hardly ever went out at all </connor>
<connor> right i didn't go up because i spent all </connor>
<connor> this time </connor>
<connor> marathoning all like all the great anime </connor>
<connor> of 2021 to make my best of anime 2021 </connor>
<connor> video so i was just like inside just </connor>
<connor> watching watching all the best [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> watching all this anime didn't go out i </connor>
<connor> went out aside from trash chase </connor>
<garnt> recordings i went out once and the only </garnt>
<garnt> time i went out was with these boys </garnt>
<garnt> that was that was literally the only </garnt>
<garnt> time i went out in the past two weeks </garnt>
<garnt> prior to me catching kobe yeah right i </garnt>
<garnt> think i figured it out you think you </garnt>
<connor> figured it out i know why you got it </connor>
<connor> okay okay i think the air when you're </connor>
<connor> six foot is high enough the covey was </connor>
<connor> traveling in the six foot sphere oh i </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<joey> under the sun under the six foot </joey>
<connor> we couldn't breathe it in we couldn't </connor>
<connor> breathe </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> that's the actual </connor>
<connor> scientific that we're not scientists do </connor>
<garnt> not take over yeah </garnt>
<garnt> covert is the height equalizer </garnt>
<joey> we needed this yeah we </joey>
<joey> needed six foot or something yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah so i i remember i remember like </garnt>
<garnt> when obviously when i say positive i </garnt>
<connor> remember messaging these boys being like </connor>
<connor> boys i gotta be honest you should </connor>
<connor> probably be careful because uh i'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna lie the only time i've been out in </connor>
<connor> the past two weeks has uh aside from </connor>
<garnt> trash taste which i'm also with the boys </garnt>
<garnt> uh was with you guys when we uh went </garnt>
<joey> after that one business meeting let me </joey>
<joey> just say i'm glad i got that text while </joey>
<joey> i was on the toilet because i did [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> myself </joey>
<joey> when i read that i was like oh my god oh </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] yourself if you weren't on probably </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i was like thank god my pants are down </joey>
<garnt> and i'm literally taking your [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so i was like brace yourself boys it </garnt>
<garnt> might come it might come um </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the storm's coming and then uh it </garnt>
<garnt> didn't come and apparently i was the </garnt>
<connor> only one who uh got covered in uh in our </connor>
<connor> entire office i mean i say this because </connor>
<connor> i say this i'm happy that no one else </connor>
<connor> got a copy aside from me okay i'm i'm </connor>
<connor> i'm happy why didn't anyone else get it </connor>
<connor> i don't want to be the only ones but as </connor>
<joey> as the guy who does not you know the </joey>
<joey> only the only time i got to make content </joey>

<garnt> anime that gets covered anime gives you </garnt>
<joey> curvy i'm telling you why do you think i </joey>

<joey> yeah no because like uh guess yeah </joey>
<joey> because sydney got it as well right yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah sydney got it around two </garnt>
<joey> days after me right right kind of makes </joey>
<joey> sense uh that was two days after my </joey>
<joey> symptoms that's it uh had set in and i </joey>
<joey> mean like i think i think uh i think i'm </joey>
<joey> glad that obviously i'm glad that i was </joey>
<joey> vaccinated and i think it was omicron as </joey>
<joey> well because my </joey>
<joey> symptoms weren't too bad i remember i </joey>
<joey> remember like i remember </joey>
<joey> i felt something coming and you know </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you know when you wake up and you're </joey>
<joey> like eat like you have a bit of a sore </joey>
<joey> throat and you're like start [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yourself yeah because you're just like </joey>
<joey> oh is this is this is this illness is </joey>
<connor> this it i'm am i getting ill am i </connor>
<connor> getting am i getting paranoid like i </connor>
<connor> remember on like the thursday night </connor>
<connor> because i've been paranoid before about </connor>
<connor> am i ill or am i not ill because i have </connor>
<connor> like a slight sore throat or like cough </connor>
<connor> or something but i remember thursday </connor>
<connor> night here and </connor>
<connor> like your body knows when it's about to </connor>
<connor> get ill or like i i could feel that my </connor>
<garnt> body like that a storm was coming in my </garnt>
<garnt> body right and i was like praying to god </garnt>
<garnt> that it was just the flu or some kind of </garnt>
<garnt> normal other illness right but like </garnt>
<garnt> i kind of knew that something was coming </garnt>
<garnt> and i was like i told timmy sydney like </garnt>
<garnt> i think i'm about to get ill and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm like calling it now i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like calling it out i'm gonna get </garnt>
<connor> ill </connor>
<garnt> honey don't be mad promise you won't be </garnt>
<garnt> mad promise your way man i think i'm </garnt>
<garnt> about to get ill and uh and so like i i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't have a fever but like my body </garnt>
<garnt> started to feel like a little bit groggy </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit fatigued now i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> i've felt this before i've felt this </garnt>
<joey> before i've gotten like the flu or that </joey>
<joey> kind of like illness where like conks me </joey>
<joey> out for a few days so i'm like honey </joey>
<joey> don't be alarmed but i think i might be </joey>
<joey> old and then i went to sleep woke up and </joey>
<joey> i had a pretty high fever for me at </joey>
<joey> least like i remember when we did our </joey>
<joey> second vaccination i had like a fever of </joey>
<joey> like 38 degrees celsius i don't know </joey>
<joey> what that is in fahrenheit but uh on </joey>
<joey> that first day </joey>
<joey> on that it's not </joey>
<joey> on that first day on that first day i </joey>
<connor> started off with a 38 degree fever so i </connor>
<connor> was like okay i definitely got a fever </connor>
<connor> uh once you get tested and then by the </connor>
<joey> time night time came around that fever </joey>
<joey> had gone up to 40 degrees [ __ ] which </joey>
<joey> dangerous which is dangerous and i was </joey>
<joey> like i was like googling right i was </joey>
<connor> like googling when when should i like go </connor>
<connor> to the hospital why spoiler he lived </connor>
<joey> what is that what's the boiling point </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> because normally i normally when i get </joey>
<joey> the flu or something i go up to like 39 </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like even then i'm that's </joey>
<joey> pretty really bad that's a really bad </joey>
<connor> call so i was like it was like i </connor>
<connor> remember measuring myself getting to 40 </connor>
<connor> and then um </connor>
<connor> and then i remember googling how high </connor>
<connor> does your fever need to be to consider </connor>
<garnt> going to the hospital and i remember </garnt>
<garnt> googling it and they said after around </garnt>
<garnt> 41 degrees you should consider going to </garnt>
<garnt> the hospital right and me you already </garnt>
<garnt> drenched in sweat i start sweating even </garnt>
<garnt> more because i'm just like what do you </garnt>
<connor> think what can i do there if you have a </connor>
<connor> fever it's like oh here's a bed lie down </connor>
<connor> like what can they what can they do like </connor>
<connor> placebo where like because you're in a </connor>
<joey> hospital you're gonna get better maybe </joey>
<connor> yeah maybe they're like oh he's an iv </connor>
<joey> maybe they give you like more stronger </joey>
<connor> maybe they give you more stronger </connor>
<garnt> i mean like all i was going to say is i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i feel like it is a bit of a </garnt>
<garnt> placebo but also in case your symptoms </garnt>
<garnt> do get majorly worse there is someone </garnt>
<garnt> there to put you under intensive care </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah just in case but </connor>
<connor> absolutely terrified of hospitals it's </connor>
<connor> like the only thing i'm scared of no </connor>
<joey> same i don't really i don't know anyone </joey>
<joey> who goes to the hospital goes yeah but </joey>
<connor> some people don't mind they're like oh </connor>
<connor> whatever but i'm like i will literally </connor>
<joey> do anything not to go to the hospital </joey>
<connor> yeah which probably means that at some </connor>
<joey> point i'm probably gonna come down with </joey>
<joey> something and i should probably go and </joey>
<joey> get it checked out </joey>
<connor> because i'm i'm so stupid that i'll be </connor>
<connor> like no i'd rather not because </connor>
<connor> when i get ill right i just never ever </connor>
<joey> assume i should go to hospital yeah i </joey>
<connor> just think i should just write it out </connor>
<connor> you hear stories about how people die </connor>
<connor> from that </connor>
<garnt> yeah because i feel like a lot of this </garnt>
<garnt> is part of i mean i i think a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> this is part of growing up in england as </garnt>
<garnt> well because i think there was there's </garnt>
<garnt> definitely a difference in mentality </garnt>
<joey> when it comes to illness especially when </joey>
<joey> i started started you know dating sydney </joey>
<joey> and seeing how she handled getting ill </joey>
<joey> versus how i handled getting ill because </joey>
<joey> i'm just like if i have a high fever i'm </joey>
<joey> just like just just take some </joey>
<joey> paracetamol ride it out whatever just </joey>
<joey> just like start putting in bed yeah </joey>
<joey> sweat it out sweat it out you know uh </joey>
<connor> like because in england if you go to see </connor>
<joey> the doctor by the time you book an </joey>
<connor> appointment and you get the chance to go </connor>
<joey> see the gp um you it's like the fever is </joey>
<joey> already gone right the fever's already </joey>
<joey> gone you're either better or dead yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so so it's either you're bad enough </joey>
<connor> to go to the hospital yeah or you just </connor>
<connor> don't go to the doctor at all yeah </connor>
<connor> but like with sydney because luckily </connor>
<joey> sydney had health insurance when she was </joey>
<joey> in uh when she was growing up in america </joey>
<joey> stop breaking </joey>
<connor> showing sydney's privilege right here </connor>
<joey> yeah she had health insurance okay wow </joey>
<joey> health insurance but uh uh so she would </joey>
<joey> be like you know if she just got </joey>
<joey> slightly old just go see the doctor just </joey>
<joey> to make sure just just in case you use </joey>
<joey> that health insurance </joey>
<joey> use that health insurance because you </joey>
<joey> can just go see yourself so why would </joey>
<joey> you not go see a doctor me being me </joey>
<joey> dying in bed being like i don't see </joey>
<joey> sydney i don't need to see a doctor i </joey>
<joey> don't see a doctor why would i need to </joey>
<joey> see a doctor it's only like a 40 degree </joey>
<joey> fever google says i need to be 41 to go </joey>
<joey> see your doctor sydney come on come on </joey>
<joey> i'm safe i'm saying i ain't a [ __ ] boy </joey>
<connor> ain't a [ __ ] boy </connor>
<connor> that's true though in japan people like </connor>
<connor> that as well i think yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> people they're like i've got a headache </connor>
<joey> i'm going to the clinic what what what </joey>
<connor> no no no </connor>
<joey> yeah i don't know just sleep it off i </joey>
<joey> don't know maybe i'm being too harsh </joey>
<joey> like but then do you find that sometimes </joey>
<joey> you're like i don't know if this is a me </joey>
<connor> thing but sometimes i'm getting sick i'm </connor>
<joey> like no yeah stop body stop </joey>
<connor> stop right now </connor>
<joey> don't do this </joey>
<joey> develop men i think i like have i don't </joey>
<joey> know if this is just like me being </joey>
<connor> stupid but i just completely ignore it </connor>
<connor> when i'm like about to get sick i'm like </connor>
<connor> we are not sick we will continue with </connor>
<garnt> our day like everything is normal that </garnt>
<garnt> just sounds like copium to the max </garnt>
<connor> sometimes i feel like it works though i </connor>
<connor> don't know it's cause i don't know if </connor>
<connor> this is pure luck or it's it's probably </connor>
<connor> my own stupidity like sometimes i get </connor>
<connor> ill i feel like the illness coming and </connor>
<connor> then in my mind i feel like this is like </connor>
<connor> a deciding point in my head i'm like am </connor>
<connor> i going to resign myself to being ill or </connor>
<connor> am i going to be like no i'm not ill i'm </connor>
<connor> going to continue on i'm going to eat </connor>
<connor> healthy i'm going to do it this sounds </connor>
<connor> like some joe rogan-esque [ __ ] i'm </connor>
<connor> saying right now it's not i don't know </connor>
<connor> like for small illnesses obviously if </connor>
<joey> you've got some kind of horrible illness </joey>
<joey> it's like yeah no the flu is controlled </joey>
<joey> by the government of mind power </joey>
<connor> well you know it's like it's like the </connor>
<connor> placebo effect right how like this could </connor>
<connor> be complete like nonsense but we are not </connor>
<garnt> medical professionals </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna say </garnt>
<connor> when it's like a tiny illness right it's </connor>
<connor> like a sore throat you know something </connor>
<connor> like that yeah sometimes i feel like how </connor>
<connor> much of your like mental </connor>
<connor> mental willpower can affect it because </connor>
<connor> you hear about you know uh the the </connor>
<connor> placebo effect </connor>
<connor> affecting how you can perform in certain </connor>
<connor> situations yeah yeah i'm wondering like </connor>
<connor> how much can that affect your your </connor>
<garnt> likeliness to get sick </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i do feel like you're </garnt>
<connor> oh okay this is going to be complete </connor>
<connor> speculation this is all anecdotal yeah </connor>
<connor> any medical professional is </connor>
<connor> completely anecdotal but i do feel like </connor>
<connor> your mentality and your willingness to </connor>
<connor> like i don't know accept something it </connor>
<connor> does i think i feel like it does play </connor>
<connor> like some kind of subconscious effect </connor>
<connor> right because you you hear like </connor>
<connor> you hear about stories about people who </connor>
<connor> you know have like a deadly illness and </connor>
<connor> because they are have like the will to </connor>
<connor> fight it you know they </connor>
<connor> you know some people are able to fight </connor>
<connor> through the illness and some people are </connor>
<connor> more inclined to give in you know yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so i i do feel based on zero </connor>
<connor> zero [ __ ] scientific proof and just </connor>
<joey> based on total anecdotal evidence that </joey>
<joey> there is some kind of effect that your </joey>
<joey> mentality has towards illnesses </joey>
<joey> sometimes sometimes not every time you </joey>
<joey> know i'm </joey>
<joey> just the dark souls of illnesses guys </joey>
<joey> come on you just you just gotta get good </joey>
<garnt> you just gotta take it no that's not i'm </garnt>
<connor> not trying to say i'm saying it's like </connor>
<connor> with like little things with like colds </connor>
<joey> and stuff yeah yeah i feel that like </joey>
<connor> when i'm way more up for being like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you i'm gonna just continue with my day </connor>
<connor> mentally i don't know why it's not it's </connor>
<connor> not like you do anything to actually </connor>
<joey> like prevent it right it's not like you </joey>
<connor> like taking the [ __ ] no i i'm </connor>
<connor> honestly whatever i go out of my way to </connor>
<connor> not take anything like i don't i don't i </connor>
<garnt> never take painkillers </garnt>
<joey> to me like taking painkillers is the </joey>
<joey> point that i admit defeat and i am </joey>
<joey> actually ill you know yeah </joey>
<joey> you know what i mean like it's like </joey>
<joey> because i'm at like even this time when </joey>
<connor> i like i could feel my body like getting </connor>
<joey> ill i was like no no it's it's not it </joey>
<joey> i'm not i'm not ill like i'm not gonna </joey>
<joey> go out obviously because because it's a </joey>
<joey> pandemic but i'm gonna i'm gonna keep </joey>
<joey> working i'm gonna go buy my daily </joey>
<joey> schedule and i woke up and i'm like 38 </joey>
<joey> that's that's like that's like a </joey>
<joey> manageable fever i'll get i'll get </joey>
<joey> tested come back </joey>
<joey> it's pretty [ __ ] high </joey>
<joey> like it's to me to me it was manageable </joey>
<joey> until like i remember like sitting </joey>
<joey> sitting at my pc uh on the first day </joey>
<joey> that the symptoms started you know </joey>
<joey> started rolling in obviously at this </joey>
<joey> time i didn't get any of the test </joey>
<joey> results so i had no it could have been </joey>
<joey> like a cold for all i knew and i was i </joey>
<joey> remember sitting down at the computer </joey>
<connor> trying to work and it was just i as the </connor>
<connor> day went on i was like no body don't do </connor>
<joey> this don't know you're not ill you know </joey>
<connor> what come on buddy you can power through </connor>
<joey> this and i remember it was around like </joey>
<joey> five o'clock where i was like staring at </joey>
<joey> the script and i was like trying to get </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] done and i just like it just like </joey>
<joey> no words would come out because i was </joey>
<joey> just too tired i was like </joey>
<joey> okay i'm actually [ __ ] ill let's let </joey>
<joey> me take some [ __ ] medicine let me </joey>
<joey> take my temperature again and let me </joey>
<joey> like do do the [ __ ] just imagine </joey>
<joey> you're sitting at your computer </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<garnt> illness is just a perception man it's a </garnt>
<connor> perception it's same with like i don't </connor>
<connor> know like painkillers and stuff like </connor>
<garnt> that i have friends who </garnt>
<garnt> will you know they'll take a painkiller </garnt>
<garnt> the moment they even get a slight </garnt>
<garnt> headache yeah but i'm always like really </garnt>
<connor> bored because then they i s the same </connor>
<connor> people like this is completely anecdotal </connor>
<connor> they're just like oh yeah well i i it </connor>
<connor> doesn't work as well anymore because i </connor>
<joey> take it too often and i'm like well </joey>
<joey> that's scary yeah i'm just not gonna </joey>
<joey> take it unless unless i'm really really </joey>
<connor> in pain and then i'll be like alright </connor>
<joey> fine because then what happens if they </joey>
<joey> you know get like say like a really </joey>
<joey> massive headache or you know worse still </joey>
<joey> like where it's like oh god if you don't </joey>
<joey> have pain medicine you're just you're </joey>
<garnt> just [ __ ] you might think yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> might pass out whatever i always worry </garnt>
<connor> about stuff like that yeah yeah i mean i </connor>
<garnt> think the only scary thing for me uh was </garnt>
<garnt> because i'd never gotten covered before </garnt>
<connor> like normally when i get an illness i've </connor>
<connor> been ill enough times to know how my </connor>
<connor> body deals with it right you know like </connor>
<connor> okay i'm gonna be out for x amount of </connor>
<connor> days i need to do this like i've got </connor>
<connor> this down to a science right you know i </connor>
<connor> i you know i wake up with you know like </connor>
<connor> um like what's what's the what's the </connor>
<connor> throat itis uh tom slice or something </connor>
<connor> you know which has happened a few times </connor>
<connor> i'm just like okay i'm gonna be calming </connor>
<connor> out for two days i'm not gonna be able </connor>
<connor> to speak for like three four days and </connor>
<connor> then afterwards i'll be completely fine </connor>
<connor> right but when i tested positive i'm </connor>
<connor> just like [ __ ] i've never i've never </connor>
<joey> done this before so this is all new </joey>
<joey> territory for me man like how's my body </joey>
<joey> gonna react with i've got asthma is that </joey>
<joey> gonna play an effect i'm just like i it </joey>
<joey> it wasn't like this i didn't have a bad </joey>
<joey> time it was more of just like the </joey>
<connor> unknown that uh that scared me the most </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> because it was something completely new </connor>
<joey> that i had never experienced before so i </joey>
<joey> had no prior knowledge about how i </joey>
<joey> should best deal with it or how my body </joey>
<joey> was going to deal with it luckily it was </joey>
<joey> fine second thing that i kind of [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> myself over was the uh everyone's saying </joey>
<garnt> that you might lose your sense of taste </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like you know what i i think uh </garnt>
<garnt> i think i'd rather go to hospital than </garnt>
<connor> lose my sense of taste honestly what do </connor>
<connor> you mean with the bread take you surely </connor>
<connor> do i think a lot of people argue that </connor>
<connor> you already </connor>
<joey> i don't think you have any taste buds to </joey>
<joey> kill </joey>
<garnt> you you know like the first thing that i </garnt>
<joey> did when i tested positive was obviously </joey>
<joey> i needed to inform male 1 to like inform </joey>
<joey> geeks plus and everything in the office </joey>
<joey> that i tested positive and the first </joey>
<joey> thing she messages me about is oh uh </joey>
<joey> i've heard that uh covered might like </joey>
<joey> change your taste buds so maybe you'll </joey>
<garnt> be able to taste bread now i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] you melon </joey>
<connor> were you did you were you hungry at all </connor>
<garnt> did you have an appetite when you </garnt>
<garnt> it was like exactly the same okay so </garnt>
<garnt> like here's the thing i hate about being </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] ill right is that it's like i i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't lose my sense of taste but like </garnt>
<connor> it was just the same </connor>
<connor> like effect to your taste that you have </connor>
<connor> with any illness which just for some </connor>
<connor> reason everything just tastes [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> everything just tastes bland man i get </connor>
<connor> super hungry when i get sick yeah i </connor>
<connor> remember like so weird that's because </connor>
<connor> remember when you got ill like the few </connor>
<connor> weeks before when you got like </connor>
<garnt> tonsillitis yeah you just ate a [ __ ] ton </garnt>
<garnt> and to me like i i can't eat at all i </garnt>
<connor> mean when i'm ill i just i just don't </connor>
<connor> assuming my stomach is okay and like i </connor>
<connor> have any other illness i'll just eat a </connor>
<joey> lot i don't know why for me when i'm </joey>
<joey> sick like just the smell of food is like </joey>
<connor> that one time food poisoning i got food </connor>
<connor> poisoning this one time and then the </connor>
<connor> next day while i was still dying i got </connor>
<connor> so hungry i felt like mcdonald's </connor>
<connor> so i ordered like a [ __ ] ton of </connor>
<connor> mcdonald's and i ate all of it yeah i </connor>
<connor> weirdly i felt a lot better i don't know </connor>
<connor> why i feel like i'm the only person on </connor>
<joey> earth who binged mcdonald's and then </joey>
<joey> felt better yeah yeah because usually </joey>
<joey> that's the thing that gives you food </joey>
<joey> poisoning yeah that's exactly right </joey>
<joey> you think mcdonald's after having food </joey>
<joey> poisoning it's a bold choice it was </joey>
<joey> really weird you're like really doubling </joey>
<joey> down it was okay actually the one time i </joey>
<connor> do regret doing this one time i was </connor>
<connor> really sick again i think with food </connor>
<connor> poisoning the next day i know everyone's </connor>
<connor> gonna laugh i decided to get indian </connor>
<connor> curry </connor>
<connor> that was actually a mistake </connor>
<garnt> why would you do that i was really </garnt>
<garnt> craving like butter curry i don't know </garnt>
<connor> why i </connor>
<garnt> you know i i crave a lot of good food </garnt>
<connor> when i'm ill as well but i'm like i </connor>
<joey> i've had it enough times that you regret </joey>
<garnt> it immediately yeah you take the first </garnt>
<connor> bite that was the only time i've </connor>
<connor> regretted it other times i've gotten it </connor>
<connor> and i feel better i don't know if it's </connor>
<connor> like in my mind i'm like yeah this maybe </connor>
<joey> my body's like oh [ __ ] we got another </joey>
<joey> problem to deal with let's deal with </joey>
<joey> that and then everything just gets </joey>
<connor> better yeah i don't know i don't know </connor>
<joey> it's it's low [ __ ] really your brain </joey>
<joey> works one step at a time </joey>
<connor> i don't know it's all it's all weird i </connor>
<connor> feel like i no one really understands </connor>
<connor> their body we're all just guessing we're </connor>
<connor> all just doing we're like we're like </connor>
<connor> we're like uh </connor>
<connor> plague doctors trying to figure out our </connor>
<connor> thing with our own weird rituals i think </connor>
<connor> we all just have a thing that we feel </connor>
<garnt> comfortable with and somehow it works </garnt>
<garnt> we've sorted it we've done we've been </garnt>
<garnt> ill enough times to know kind of how our </garnt>
<garnt> body reacts to certain things and to </garnt>
<garnt> deal with certain things everyone bodies </garnt>
<connor> is different yeah i'll sit there and </connor>
<connor> like laugh at all these plague doctors </connor>
<connor> from the 18th century and then i'll just </connor>
<connor> be like i'm gonna will power my disease </connor>
<connor> away and so i'm like it's only really </connor>
<joey> have we changed at all i don't think so </joey>
<connor> i think i think we've just gotten </connor>
<joey> smarter wow you know i'll fix my sore </joey>
<connor> stomach mcdonald's dude exactly that's </connor>
<joey> what i'm saying wait but like before </joey>
<joey> covert like how often did you guys get </joey>
<joey> sick like per year once a year </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> food poisonings i feel like food </connor>
<connor> poisoning to me seems to get food </connor>
<connor> poisoning a lot food poisoning to me i </connor>
<joey> don't count us getting like sick </joey>
<joey> no that's definitely </joey>
<connor> that is illness that is illness hit me </connor>
<connor> up because it's like it's like uh if if </connor>
<connor> i poisoned god you wouldn't be like oh </connor>
<joey> god god got sick you're like god was </joey>
<joey> poisoned right it's a different kind of </joey>
<joey> vibe it's just sickness you know what i </joey>
<joey> mean it's not like you treat it's like </joey>
<joey> you got food poisoning yeah you you </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] you're [ __ ] just deal with it </connor>
<joey> wait </joey>
<joey> do you know what food poisoning is yes </joey>
<joey> because it's not like someone slipped </joey>
<connor> cyanide into your mouth no i know i know </connor>
<connor> but it's like it's like it's not caused </connor>
<joey> by like a natural cause of like sickness </joey>
<garnt> or a bacteria or virus it's like </garnt>
<joey> something went wrong no it is it is it </joey>
<joey> is it is i know i know but it's not like </joey>
<joey> you got it by accident or something you </joey>
<connor> know what i mean like you stumble across </connor>
<connor> it it's like something had to go wrong </connor>
<joey> for it to be there no i think it's by </joey>
<joey> accident right yeah no no no no you you </joey>
<joey> wouldn't know something's wrong with the </joey>
<connor> food unless you try it </connor>
<joey> i know right that's what i'm saying like </joey>
<connor> i don't count that as like the natural </connor>
<connor> quota of getting sick because like let's </connor>
<connor> say you undercooked chicken and there's </connor>
<connor> salmonella in it that's just like that's </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] you're done yeah but that's not </joey>
<joey> the fault of the person who cooked the </joey>
<joey> chick under cookie chicken that's the </joey>
<joey> fault of the salmonella that's where you </joey>
<joey> cook the chicken which is the disease </joey>
<connor> that comes right right yeah but that's </connor>
<connor> like you would ever come across </connor>
<connor> naturally right that's not something you </connor>
<connor> would normally come across like let's </connor>
<joey> say what do you mean by come across like </joey>
<joey> like just like on the street </joey>
<connor> something like carried like gaunt is </connor>
<connor> like carrying like a normal i don't know </connor>
<connor> a cold or whatever right it's different </connor>
<garnt> category in my mind i don't know well </garnt>
<joey> like not every raw piece of chicken has </joey>
<joey> salmonella </joey>
<joey> there is a chance that if you have a raw </joey>
<joey> piece of chicken and it's not cooked </joey>
<connor> then the salmonella or the batter so we </connor>
<connor> have steps </connor>
<connor> in the same way that if you uh if you go </connor>
<connor> outside and someone has covered or the </connor>
<joey> flu or something and you stand next to </joey>
<connor> them and they cough and then you inhale </connor>
<garnt> you have a chance particles then you </garnt>
<connor> have the chance of getting it it's right </connor>
<connor> in my mind i should put it differently </connor>
<connor> because food poisoning is normally just </connor>
<connor> due to the lack of like somebody [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> up </garnt>
<garnt> right you mean lack of </garnt>
<connor> lack of like under cooking yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> undercooking and stuff like that or bad </joey>
<joey> bad stuff not all the time though just </joey>
<connor> sometimes they'll just be like a road </connor>
<connor> like e coli and [ __ ] yeah that's that's </connor>
<joey> yeah that's a big [ __ ] up sometimes it's </joey>
<joey> just a matter of like oh you know there </joey>
<joey> was a piece of food there and just you </joey>
<joey> know unfortunately just a rogue you know </joey>
<joey> disease or virus just happened to </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] stumble upon oh i mean you </connor>
<connor> inhale it's different though right </connor>
<garnt> because then we are you saying that food </garnt>
<joey> poisoning is more preventable yeah way </joey>
<connor> more preventable well that's why you can </connor>
<joey> be like your restaurant can be shut down </joey>
<joey> if you keep giving people food poisoning </joey>
<joey> oh yeah it's the majority of the time </joey>
<joey> something like food poisoning is due to </joey>
<connor> somebody [ __ ] up in the in the chain </connor>
<garnt> of pro like </garnt>
<garnt> so basically the the most time to get </garnt>
<connor> ill is uh when </connor>
<connor> someone has [ __ ] up and given you food </connor>
<garnt> poisoning yeah or you [ __ ] up and </garnt>
<connor> giving yourself mainly me i look at it </connor>
<connor> and i'm like ah [ __ ] it </connor>
<joey> mentality now it's not an illness </joey>
<connor> i don't know it's just different in my </connor>
<connor> head </connor>
<joey> i don't know about you i count food </joey>
<garnt> poisoning as an illness i do count food </garnt>
<garnt> boys but then again i've gotten i don't </garnt>
<joey> get sick often but i think i've only </joey>
<joey> ever gotten food poisoning maybe like </joey>
<connor> twice in my life i didn't get it much </connor>
<garnt> till i came to japan i've had it many </garnt>
<connor> times in japan weirdly really yeah like </connor>
<joey> four i've never gotten food poisoning in </joey>
<garnt> japan yeah i've never gotten food </garnt>
<garnt> poisoning in japan i've got it </garnt>
<garnt> like the worst food poisoning i've </garnt>
<garnt> gotten was in china um and also </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes in thailand as well i think </garnt>
<joey> yeah i got really bad food poisoning in </joey>
<garnt> the philippines yeah i think you know um </garnt>
<connor> but i think food poisoning in southeast </connor>
<connor> asia is just like part of the experience </connor>
<connor> right yeah </connor>
<connor> and uh yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i never knew you could get food </joey>
<joey> poisoning from a mango but i i </joey>
<joey> definitely got it from a mango like that </joey>
<garnt> that [ __ ] [ __ ] me up dude </garnt>
<garnt> i swear to god every time sydney has </garnt>
<garnt> oysters she gets like [ __ ] food </garnt>
<garnt> poisoning and every [ __ ] time she's </garnt>
<garnt> like maybe this time i won't maybe this </garnt>
<joey> time maybe like i hear like you hear you </joey>
<joey> know that every now and then there's </joey>
<connor> like there's those foods that's like </connor>
<connor> yeah food poisoning central right yeah </connor>
<connor> oysters being one of them yeah that is </connor>
<joey> poor storage i've never gotten it from </joey>
<connor> oysters it's so weird you probably only </connor>
<connor> eat eaten oysters here in japan right no </connor>
<joey> no everywhere really yeah i had it in </joey>
<connor> the us australia everywhere and i've </connor>
<joey> never gotten it that's a gamble in the </joey>
<garnt> uk really yeah it's very much a gambling </garnt>
<connor> uk and i think a lot of places in the us </connor>
<garnt> as well because it depends how well they </garnt>
<garnt> store it or how fresh it is human error </garnt>
<connor> scene this is why it's why don't you </connor>
<connor> count the same in my head </connor>
<connor> if somebody sneezes at me in public i'm </connor>
<connor> like that can't be helped you know </connor>
<connor> whatever but if somebody if somebody </connor>
<connor> forgot to [ __ ] freeze a piece of fish </connor>
<connor> then served it to me someone [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> and made me sick </joey>
<joey> how is someone sneezing on you not a </joey>
<connor> human error well no you like let's say </connor>
<connor> you're in a plane right someone four </connor>
<connor> suits behind you sneezes whatever they </connor>
<connor> didn't they didn't react quick enough i </connor>
<connor> feel like that's not that's they can't i </connor>
<connor> can't possibly react i could i couldn't </connor>
<connor> then go to like court and be like this </connor>
<connor> person sneezed on the plane behind me </connor>
<connor> and didn't cover up their face you know </connor>
<connor> i feel like it's not you can't hold </connor>
<connor> someone accountable whereas like let's </connor>
<connor> say somebody just didn't store a piece </connor>
<connor> of fish properly that's like negligence </connor>
<connor> on their part and then they served it </connor>
<garnt> yeah i get that that's the why i don't </garnt>
<garnt> treat it the same but i don't treat it </garnt>
<garnt> the same either but it's still an </garnt>
<joey> illness yeah it's it's </joey>
<connor> regardless </connor>
<connor> i feel like because it's like not </connor>
<garnt> a way to i i don't that's like okay </garnt>
<garnt> would you count cancer as an illness </garnt>
<connor> then you don't get cancer from eating </connor>
<connor> fish </connor>
<garnt> but what i'm saying is it's you treat it </garnt>
<garnt> completely differently but it's still an </garnt>
<connor> illness right yeah but like that's true </connor>
<connor> you can just get right that's just like </connor>
<connor> different because that's like </connor>
<connor> that that most the time lung cancer yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah what if like you you smoke enough </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that's on you </connor>
<joey> and then in that case i wouldn't build </joey>
<connor> illness </connor>
<joey> you know stuff like that it's like it </joey>
<joey> only raises your chances right where </joey>
<joey> it's like if somebody just gives you </joey>
<joey> flat out a completely like [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> piece of fish or meat that's been stored </joey>
<joey> in properly you're gonna get sick 100 </joey>
<joey> right whereas like you there are people </joey>
<joey> who have been chained smoking from my </joey>
<joey> age 10 to 100 who don't get it right so </joey>
<connor> it's complete luck on that part but with </connor>
<connor> the with the with the storage food and </connor>
<connor> all that that's like all right somebody </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up you know what i mean that's </connor>
<connor> categorically someone just [ __ ] up and </connor>
<connor> they gave it to you and poisoned you </connor>
<connor> that's what it is it's different to like </connor>
<connor> getting an illness it's totally </connor>
<joey> different </joey>
<joey> doctors in the comments are cracking up </joey>
<joey> right now i have this conversation </joey>
<connor> yeah i actually want to know what people </connor>
<connor> think about this i feel like i'm not the </connor>
<connor> only one who thinks this way towards </connor>
<connor> like food poisoning this is not a weird </connor>
<garnt> thing i mean i i just i it's just you </garnt>
<garnt> getting ill i'll just </garnt>
<connor> say like if you ask me how often do i </connor>
<connor> get ill i wouldn't count that because </connor>
<joey> that's got nothing to do with like </joey>
<connor> an illness no it's not you're literally </connor>
<joey> sick if if i were to just like make </joey>
<connor> myself vomit would you say like i've </connor>
<connor> gotten an illness no well then why would </connor>
<joey> food poisoning count towards that </joey>
<connor> because it's a literal disease well </connor>
<joey> that's got nothing no comment to like </joey>
<connor> how often you get ill that's how often </connor>
<joey> you eat bad [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> no </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> no that's entirely different i mean it </joey>
<joey> all depends on your environment right </joey>
<joey> but obviously if you know if if you're </joey>
<joey> in an environment where a lot of you </joey>
<joey> know where like a lot of people are ill </joey>
<joey> we're going through a wave of illness </joey>
<joey> then you're more likely to get ill in </joey>
<joey> the same way if you live in an </joey>
<joey> environment where people are you know </joey>
<joey> where people are less </joey>
<joey> careful with their food preparation then </joey>
<joey> you're more likely to get ill you know </joey>
<joey> that's that's right that is the thing if </joey>
<joey> you go to southeast asia or you know a </joey>
<joey> lot of places where the food standards </joey>
<joey> aren't as high no like it's true it's </joey>
<joey> true it's true </joey>
<joey> i'm i'm i'm not i'm not throwing shade </joey>
<joey> i'm just saying facts here okay guys i'm </joey>
<joey> saying faxing you know you go to a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] street vendor on the street </joey>
<joey> you're just like how was how is this me </joey>
<joey> prepared where did this me come from </joey>
<joey> they don't [ __ ] know </joey>
<joey> you from the back of my truck yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly right exactly you know </joey>
<joey> um i mean </joey>
<joey> i mean it's it's all it's it's all risk </joey>
<joey> it's all risk at the end of the day you </joey>
<joey> know you can eat raw chicken in japan </joey>
<garnt> you know it's still and apparently here </garnt>
<garnt> it's more safer because </garnt>
<garnt> uh because you know food standards here </garnt>
<garnt> in japan are higher i don't know how </garnt>
<garnt> true that is how not true it is but at </garnt>
<garnt> the same time you're still taking a risk </garnt>
<connor> what if your stomach's just weak well no </connor>
<connor> i mean if the restaurant just gives me </connor>
<connor> like poorly stored sausage i think </connor>
<connor> that's their fault you know that's </connor>
<joey> that's not that's why because the one </joey>
<joey> thing i learned from when i was in the </joey>
<joey> philippines is that like yeah the food </joey>
<joey> standards are a lot lower than normal </joey>
<joey> but people don't get sick because they </joey>
<joey> just naturally have more of like a </joey>
<connor> resistant stomach </connor>
<joey> right from living there always yeah i'd </joey>
<connor> say that's true actually not with </connor>
<garnt> everything though </garnt>
<joey> not with everything not with everything </joey>
<joey> but with a lot of things that visitors </joey>
<joey> to those countries would immediately get </joey>
<connor> sick oh yeah i wouldn't say of a weak </connor>
<connor> stomach i normally don't really have any </connor>
<connor> problem with like gross foods or </connor>
<connor> something that's a little off </connor>
<connor> but i mean there are times where i've </connor>
<connor> eaten something and then i've gotten </connor>
<garnt> really sick and i was like why did i eat </garnt>
<garnt> that well what what do you what do you </garnt>
<garnt> count as food poisoning then </garnt>
<garnt> because like okay you okay you you go </garnt>
<garnt> you go to like you go to a country give </garnt>
<connor> me an example like throw things at me </connor>
<connor> and i'll be like food poisoning or not </connor>
<garnt> okay you go you go to a country right </garnt>
<connor> you taste something that your body has </connor>
<connor> never like tasted before it's like </connor>
<connor> totally new cuisine and your body's just </connor>
<connor> like oh that's not food poisoning i </connor>
<connor> don't like this and then you get like </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] for like five days no that's </garnt>
<connor> not food poisoning [ __ ] isn't the food </connor>
<connor> poisoning yeah yeah if </connor>
<connor> it comes back up </connor>
<garnt> that's food poisoning </garnt>
<garnt> so to me it's like you need to have like </garnt>
<garnt> you know your body is literally you know </garnt>
<garnt> physically reacting in some way where it </garnt>
<garnt> gives you like a fever or a headache or </garnt>
<connor> vomiting you know where i never get </connor>
<connor> normal i never get anything like that </connor>
<connor> from eating food but when i when i do </connor>
<garnt> eat like i can normally remember what it </garnt>
<connor> was that gave me it because i </connor>
<garnt> i very much felt rough immediately after </garnt>
<garnt> eating yeah because i count food </garnt>
<connor> poisoning as i am conked out yeah in bed </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> i've got a fever because that is </connor>
<garnt> it's literally like a bacterial </garnt>
<connor> infection </connor>
<connor> i think if it makes you feel a little </connor>
<connor> queasy and it gives you the [ __ ] no </connor>
<joey> that's not that's just you do have a </joey>
<connor> weak stomach for that yeah but i think </connor>
<joey> if you're if you're throwing up you're </joey>
<connor> you have a fever yeah you you have food </connor>
<joey> poisoning that's what i would yeah but </joey>
<connor> then like i wouldn't in my mind if that </connor>
<connor> happens to me let's say i </connor>
<garnt> you know you get that once a year oh </garnt>
<connor> lately it's been more it's been like </connor>
<garnt> what two three [ __ ] i've only had that </garnt>
<connor> like a few times in my life </connor>
<joey> i order a lot of food right i never cook </joey>
<joey> myself so yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know i think it happens a </joey>
<connor> lot more also </connor>
<joey> that's what i'm saying i think it's you </joey>
<joey> i think it's just you no it's not it's </joey>
<joey> not me </joey>
<connor> i'm not the one cooking i think you just </connor>
<connor> have a weak stomach no no no no no </connor>
<joey> because it's happened where it's not </joey>
<joey> just been me who gets sick from the food </joey>
<joey> like other people have gotten sick or </joey>
<joey> with me right right so maybe they have </joey>
<joey> weak stomachs too no that's not </joey>
<connor> that is not a good defense your honor </connor>
<connor> why did you give people a cold like oh </connor>
<joey> it's got wicked stomachs in it somebody </joey>
<connor> started it they didn't get good but you </connor>
<connor> call it no no no that's not how it works </connor>
<connor> because i i out of the last three times </connor>
<connor> i got food poisoning two times it was </connor>
<connor> sausage and i can distinctly remember </connor>
<connor> eating the sausage and being like hmm </connor>
<connor> really pink really really pink and i was </connor>
<joey> like i think it's okay </joey>
<connor> i'll eat it and then i regretted it </connor>
<connor> after </connor>
<connor> so i learned that and the other bag was </connor>
<connor> the other one was from a a bag of </connor>
<connor> flaming hot cheetos that it was like </connor>
<garnt> four months off </garnt>
<garnt> well well that again sounds like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so that's mine right but when i </garnt>
<connor> okay let's say i i'm an idiot and i eat </connor>
<connor> a four-month-old bag of flamin hot </connor>
<connor> cheetos right </connor>
<connor> to me if i start throwing up that in no </connor>
<connor> way in my mind is in the same category </connor>
<connor> as like let's say i got a i got </connor>
<connor> tonsillitis or something because this is </connor>
<connor> like this is me being a [ __ ] idiot </connor>
<connor> yeah and then i immediately got </connor>
<connor> consequences for it right the only </connor>
<connor> difference is like let's say i got to a </connor>
<connor> restaurant is that i didn't cook it but </connor>
<connor> somebody's still [ __ ] up right let's </connor>
<connor> say the sausage was awful like so in my </connor>
<connor> head it's not in the same category as </connor>
<connor> getting like a an infection from just i </connor>
<connor> don't know where the [ __ ] i got it from </connor>
<connor> right because it's like somebody [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> up with the flaming hot cheetos i [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> up i'm massively [ __ ] up yeah all </connor>
<garnt> right here's the thing okay so </garnt>
<connor> you go to a convention all right all </connor>
<connor> right you go to a convention yeah you </connor>
<connor> party for like every like every day at </connor>
<connor> the convention you get confluent yeah </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> everyone gets [ __ ] conflict yeah a </connor>
<connor> lot of people get [ __ ] up of course </connor>
<connor> does that does that count as the same </connor>
<connor> thing because you know like you're going </connor>
<connor> to a place where you know that you're </connor>
<connor> probably going to get infected with </connor>
<connor> something along the way because there's </connor>
<garnt> a lot of people in a single area and </garnt>
<garnt> you're putting yourself in a position </garnt>
<garnt> where your immune system is going to be </garnt>
<garnt> weaker because you're naturally doing a </garnt>
<connor> lot of [ __ ] does that count as this </connor>
<garnt> illness which category to the future </garnt>
<garnt> yeah where which does corn flu count as </garnt>
<connor> anyone getting sick like normal sick </connor>
<connor> getting normal sick yeah normal that's </connor>
<connor> not that's not food poisoning i feel </connor>
<connor> like food poisoning it is in its own </connor>
<connor> complete like category closer to like </connor>
<connor> self-poisoning to me </connor>
<connor> in my head </connor>
<connor> i don't know how do you understand why i </connor>
<garnt> think that way or you just don't get it </garnt>
<garnt> at all i understand why you think that </garnt>
<connor> because i understand i just don't agree </connor>
<connor> because it's not like i'm going to the </connor>
<connor> con and i'm going around licking floors </connor>
<connor> and i'm licking you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> like i am just i i know that you're at a </connor>
<connor> higher risk because you're around a lot </connor>
<connor> of people yeah people </connor>
<garnt> some people who aren't </garnt>
<joey> sometimes you shake a hand or you're </joey>
<joey> just like oh i don't know i better like </joey>
<joey> sanitizer sometimes you know like my </joey>
<garnt> hand is getting sick yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> and because we're taking photos we're </joey>
<joey> getting close people yeah people want </joey>
<connor> you know people yeah i understand that </connor>
<connor> that's just like a big risk sometimes i </connor>
<connor> get conflict sometimes i don't but </connor>
<connor> that's that's again like it's like </connor>
<connor> that's like me almost squishing like six </connor>
<connor> months of interacting into one weekend </connor>
<connor> so to me it makes sense right that you </connor>
<connor> would there was a very high chance you </connor>
<joey> could get a six yeah yeah but again like </joey>
<joey> it's not the same with food poisoning </joey>
<joey> because again somebody had to [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> in my head </joey>
<joey> i wonder if i'm like the only i can't be </joey>
<joey> the only person who sees it this way </joey>
<joey> there must be a lot of people i mean </joey>
<joey> you're the first in my head you're the </joey>
<connor> first person how many people have you </connor>
<connor> discussed this with right this is not a </connor>
<joey> normal thing to discuss yeah it's not a </joey>
<joey> normal thing to discuss because i think </joey>
<joey> in for most people </joey>
<joey> food poisoning is an illness </joey>
<connor> there's like no question about it if you </connor>
<connor> asked me connor what's up why can't you </connor>
<connor> come in the trip's recording there i </connor>
<connor> might be like i've been poisoned i'd be </connor>
<connor> like no i got sick i gotta say but then </connor>
<connor> in my head i would have this this </connor>
<connor> category that i would label it just </connor>
<connor> happens to now we have to talk about it </connor>
<connor> and i'm explaining it and i didn't </connor>
<connor> realize that people didn't see it this </connor>
<joey> way so the next time you get food </joey>
<joey> poisoning and you say oh sorry guys i'm </joey>
<joey> sick i'm allowed to call you out on that </joey>
<joey> or yeah you can be like who [ __ ] up </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i'll be like i'll be like did you eat </joey>
<joey> another [ __ ] bag of flavored hot </joey>
<joey> cheetos </joey>
<joey> at the restaurant this time </joey>
<connor> who's the culprit here's the thing right </connor>
<connor> if i get sick from a restaurant and you </connor>
<connor> only know me it's like oh oh connor are </connor>
<connor> you let's say you don't know like let's </connor>
<connor> say this restaurant is poisoned like a </connor>
<joey> hundred other people then you would </joey>
<joey> start being like what the [ __ ] is going </joey>
<joey> on why is this restaurant still opening </joey>
<joey> the only difference is that you only </joey>
<joey> hear my side right but obviously </joey>
<joey> normally a restaurant wouldn't be doing </joey>
<joey> that but still </joey>
<joey> i'm not crazy this is just it's </joey>
<connor> perception you know we have i sound like </connor>
<connor> alex [ __ ] jokes </connor>
<garnt> with the water you're just hearing one </garnt>
<garnt> side of the story it's like no i don't i </garnt>
<connor> agree that food poisoning is very hard </connor>
<connor> to argue without sounding [ __ ] insane </connor>
<garnt> i i agree with that food poisoning is in </garnt>
<garnt> the different category than let's say </garnt>
<garnt> the flu or tonsillitis but i would say </garnt>
<connor> that there are a lot of illnesses that </connor>
<connor> exist that can exist in different </connor>
<connor> categories from the flu and food </connor>
<connor> poisoning and a lot of things but at the </connor>
<garnt> end of the day some in my mind </garnt>
<garnt> they're all illnesses </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but in my head i don't treat them </garnt>
<garnt> the same way like like like there are </garnt>
<connor> millions of different illnesses with a </connor>
<connor> million those millions of different ways </connor>
<garnt> to prevent it uh to stop yourself from </garnt>
<connor> getting ill or all this kind of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] in mind that this is not like some </connor>
<joey> kind of hard scientific definition i put </joey>
<joey> in my head this is just like a mentality </joey>
<joey> i have towards thinking don't worry </joey>
<joey> people don't come to trash </joey>
<joey> but there's always so many comments </joey>
<joey> being like i'm gonna post some holes </joey>
<joey> through conor's thoughts and it's like </joey>
<joey> well yeah because i didn't really think </joey>
<joey> that much about it anyways it's just </joey>
<connor> talking out of his arms she's got a </connor>
<joey> rough rough uh estimation i just don't </joey>
<connor> see the benefit in labeling food </connor>
<joey> poisoning as a different thing </joey>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<joey> feel like that's more of like copium on </joey>
<joey> your end to be like </joey>
<joey> i'm not ill i'm not ill why why not just </joey>
<joey> say their own illnesses i don't know </joey>
<joey> because again this isn't something that </joey>
<joey> i ever discussed with people right not </joey>
<joey> something that comes out in the open </joey>
<joey> often obviously now i'm having to talk </joey>
<joey> about it for a million plus people but </joey>
<joey> that was not my intention this is just a </joey>
<connor> soft definition in my head towards how i </connor>

<connor> this conversation how does this even </connor>
<connor> come out how often do you normally get </connor>
<joey> ill </joey>
<joey> that's how that's counting food </joey>
<connor> personally </connor>
<connor> once a year maybe okay okay including </connor>
<connor> food poisoning oh that's exponentially </connor>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<connor> yeah that's three of them with food </connor>
<connor> poisoning though right so one </connor>
<garnt> so like this </garnt>
<connor> one </connor>
<connor> so like aside from this time the last </connor>
<garnt> time i got ill was literally like two </garnt>
<connor> years before this i don't get ill often </connor>
<garnt> very rarely i very rarely get ill as </garnt>
<connor> well like i very i very rarely get ill </connor>
<joey> to the point where i cannot </joey>
<joey> like i kind of work yeah yeah that i </joey>
<joey> need to actually like take a take a rest </joey>
<joey> and take a break because i feel like i </joey>
<connor> don't know i feel like my body </connor>
<connor> obviously this is all talking [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> feel like my body even if like the whole </connor>
<connor> episode's [ __ ] yeah because like </connor>
<connor> there's been there's been points where </connor>
<connor> sydney has been like [ __ ] cocked out </connor>
<connor> in bed with a high fever and all that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] and i get like a mild cough and </connor>
<connor> that's just that's just it and yeah and </connor>
<connor> she's conked out for two days and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<garnt> um how are you doing honey how are you </garnt>
<connor> doing honey this is </connor>
<joey> sick people i get way more scared oh </joey>
<joey> yeah it freaks me out i don't know why </joey>
<connor> is this like a human uh reaction that we </connor>
<connor> have </connor>
<joey> i that we're like </joey>
<joey> natural to be afraid of it yeah yeah i i </joey>
<garnt> feel like that's a big natural human </garnt>
<joey> reaction because yeah you just you you </joey>
<garnt> are adverse to getting ill you know </garnt>
<joey> you're here you are adversely people are </joey>
<joey> sick people die there it's like why </joey>
<joey> would you enjoy a place where people die </joey>
<connor> back when i had him uh when i got back </connor>
<connor> when i had it when it's genetic what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<garnt> that's cute i'm curious it's just a </garnt>
<garnt> state of mind </garnt>
<garnt> that [ __ ] away </garnt>
<connor> boom just like that fly food poisoning </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> so uh i had to go to the hospital a lot </connor>
<connor> when i was a kid because i had to get my </connor>
<connor> blood tested like every uh three months </connor>
<connor> or something or every six months or </connor>
<connor> something like that </connor>
<connor> far too often for my liking yeah um and </connor>
<connor> i hated it because i had to like sit </connor>
<connor> there for like four hours get a test </connor>
<connor> wait get another test and get results </connor>
<connor> and stuff and then the whole time i was </connor>
<connor> just surrounded by like </connor>
<connor> very very ill people and it was always </connor>
<connor> just like really scary it's like an </connor>
<connor> eight-year-old and didn't like keep </connor>
<connor> growing up and just keep seeing this and </connor>
<joey> like oh yeah uh-oh uh-oh and all the </joey>
<connor> offices of like the doctors have always </connor>
<connor> liked really cluttered they're really </connor>
<connor> messy and i was like i was like ah </connor>
<joey> i think i think the one thing i hate </joey>
<connor> about the hospital the most is the smell </connor>
<connor> yeah the smell yeah it's like the smell </connor>
<connor> of a hospital is just like oh it's like </connor>
<garnt> it's hard to explain that there was yeah </garnt>
<garnt> there was also like it smells of illness </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah literally you know like like i </connor>
<connor> said when when you're ill and when i was </connor>
<joey> ill things just smell and taste </joey>
<joey> different you know yeah of course </joey>
<joey> naturally and it it [ __ ] sucks but </joey>
<joey> like when you go to a hospital for some </joey>
<connor> reason you get that same smell where </connor>
<connor> it's just like man everything just </connor>
<connor> smells stale you know yeah </connor>
<connor> it's the stale smell like like the magic </connor>
<joey> like the color has been like taken out </joey>
<joey> of everything you know </joey>
<joey> like that's how i feel when i'm ill i </joey>
<joey> don't know it just feels like it just </joey>
<garnt> feels like life gets gets like a black </garnt>
<joey> and white fill to be put onto it do you </joey>
<joey> like the smell of the dentist </joey>
<joey> no </joey>
<garnt> because i know people who love the smell </garnt>
<garnt> of the dead what is the smell of the </garnt>
<garnt> dentist oh sweeney todd what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like the smell of like uh </joey>
<joey> i don't know what it's it's the smell of </joey>
<joey> uh like </joey>
<joey> i don't know how do you how do you </joey>
<connor> describe the small things i don't i </connor>
<connor> don't go bro i'm british we don't go to </connor>
<joey> the game </joey>
<connor> i don't know i i don't smell the dentist </connor>
<connor> often i'm couched in and out i want to </connor>
<joey> get out there soon it smells like clean </joey>
<joey> teeth but in like the worst way possible </joey>
<joey> well it smells like chemicals it's the </joey>
<garnt> only way yeah i guess i never i never </garnt>
<joey> really thought about it it smells like </joey>
<joey> like hand sanitizer yeah like that kind </joey>
<joey> of fresh kind of flavor but like it's in </joey>
<connor> medical places it smells like the </connor>
<connor> sterile eyes yeah it smells clean but </connor>
<connor> not in a good way </connor>
<connor> really yeah because like you know when </connor>
<joey> you think of like say you know something </joey>
<joey> that's clean right like you know like </joey>
<connor> scented hand sanitizer or whatever right </connor>
<connor> or like you know febreze or whatever </connor>
<connor> right like usually it's like oh that's a </connor>
<connor> good smell like that's like a refreshing </connor>
<joey> smell but like hospitals and dentists </joey>
<joey> for me are just like it's clean but </joey>
<garnt> something no the hospital and dentist is </garnt>
<garnt> smell different to me like no they're </garnt>
<joey> very very like i feel they're in like </joey>
<joey> the same like category of like it's </joey>
<joey> clean but it's not it's not like a good </joey>
<joey> clean </joey>
<joey> it's like too clean </joey>
<garnt> where it's like nothing's here anymore </garnt>
<joey> levels of clean like it's sterilized is </joey>
<connor> a good word yeah so it's it's sterile </connor>
<joey> which i hope they are </joey>
<joey> i would very much hope that they are </joey>
<joey> sterile you know </joey>
<joey> the smell yeah </joey>
<joey> apparently dentist smell of clove oil </joey>
<joey> and tooth dust </joey>
<joey> clove oil and tooth dust what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> is this </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> like literally the dust gross </joey>
<joey> yeah oh you know what </joey>
<joey> i don't know i have </joey>
<connor> yeah it just smells like chlorine </connor>
<joey> no </joey>
<joey> it it has like a faint chlorine </joey>
<joey> maybe maybe the dentist </joey>
<joey> i don't know if it's like what they're </joey>
<joey> shoving in </joey>
<garnt> or whatever but like it smells like </garnt>
<garnt> chlorine how often do you guys go to the </garnt>
<joey> dentist i try to like twice a year just </joey>
<joey> it just is like a checkup </joey>
<connor> did you like put it in your cause like </connor>
<connor> british culture </connor>
<connor> british culture we we don't go to the </connor>
<connor> dentist like a lot and i only really </connor>
<connor> started going uh actually like we i </connor>
<connor> would normally only go to the dentist </connor>
<garnt> before when i'd go to like asia and then </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like because like dentists were </garnt>
<connor> actually like really much cheaper i am i </connor>
<connor> am before the all the british tooth uh </connor>
<connor> jokes in the comments now </connor>
<garnt> but like </garnt>
<joey> do do you have like a schedule of like </joey>
<garnt> oh it's been like three months or six </garnt>
<connor> months i was like where are you yeah </connor>
<joey> they say i think they say when you're an </joey>
<connor> adult you should go at least two or </connor>
<connor> three times a year as for like a checkup </connor>
<connor> right i don't [ __ ] know well like you </connor>
<connor> know because the good thing with the </connor>
<connor> dentist is that like even if you don't </connor>
<joey> have like the cavity or you're not </joey>
<joey> hurting anywhere like they'll at least </joey>
<joey> just like [ __ ] clean your teeth yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah i hated them clearing my teeth </connor>
<connor> though i wasn't drilled so loud oh the </connor>
<garnt> water like pressure thing right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah in japan in japan it's </garnt>
<garnt> horrible no like to me i think the worst </garnt>
<joey> feeling is like getting a filling and </joey>
<joey> like i don't know just like have you got </joey>
<joey> a feeling before i've gotten one before </joey>
<connor> right and i don't know that like that </connor>
<connor> experience as a kid just scarred me for </connor>
<connor> life right because just like i don't </connor>
<connor> know what it is about just </connor>
<connor> like just hearing the drill and just </connor>
<connor> like not being able to see what they are </connor>
<garnt> doing to your mouth and just like do you </garnt>
<connor> want do you want to see do you want tv i </connor>
<garnt> i don't know i don't i don't know what's </garnt>
<joey> scarier right because you know it's like </joey>
<joey> i need to see this in 4k </joey>
<connor> i think it can be arranged </connor>
<connor> no because like just i i i it's like </connor>
<connor> that feeling of just when they hit like </connor>
<connor> a nerve ending for just a second yeah </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> like like i i </connor>
<connor> i i feel that in my nightmares you know </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i like ever since i heard felt </garnt>
<garnt> that was a kid the first time i just </garnt>
<garnt> that put me off going to the dentist </garnt>
<joey> ever again yeah um the worst the worst </joey>
<joey> for me is when you hear the drill sound </joey>
<connor> but it's like deep in your ear so it </connor>
<joey> sounds like it's in your ear yeah i hate </joey>
<joey> it because it just sounds like someone's </joey>
<connor> just getting into your ear like that i </connor>
<connor> had like uh like a night </connor>
<garnt> mold made you know like when you go to </garnt>
<garnt> bed you wear like one of those plastic </garnt>
<garnt> guards yeah i've got that as well </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah um i haven't worn it though so </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's good yeah </garnt>
<connor> i forgot </connor>
<garnt> about that i know sorry </garnt>
<garnt> my dad speaks english too far </garnt>
<connor> i don't know it's really it was really </connor>
<connor> annoying to sleep with for a long time i </connor>
<connor> couldn't sleep with it in yeah it took </connor>
<garnt> it took me about a week to get used to </garnt>
<connor> yeah i woke up drooling everywhere with </connor>
<garnt> it yeah yeah that's that's a normal </garnt>
<connor> experience yeah </connor>
<joey> i think i think i didn't start snoring </joey>
<joey> until i started wearing my mouth guard </joey>
<joey> uh because it literally forced you to be </joey>
<garnt> to be a mouth breather when you when you </garnt>
<garnt> sleep right because </garnt>
<connor> yeah the gap between just like like push </connor>
<connor> my lung </connor>
<joey> i couldn't like breathe comfortably for </joey>
<connor> me why did you need to get it i don't </connor>
<joey> know my dentist was like you don't </joey>
<connor> really need it but it's good to just </connor>
<joey> prevent prevent uh dennis was just </joey>
<joey> trying to [ __ ] you over well i was like </joey>
<joey> 300 bucks so i'm sure they were like </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know </connor>
<connor> yeah you need this you need this they </connor>
<connor> were like they were like yeah i do you </connor>
<connor> grinding your teeth is an issue but it </connor>
<connor> might be so we can get a night guard </connor>
<connor> down if you just want to be careful and </connor>
<connor> we can out and i was like oh uh sure </connor>
<connor> yeah and then they did it and then i </connor>
<connor> just really didn't like it so i just </connor>
<joey> stopped using it because i grinded my </joey>
<joey> teeth as well but my doctor was like if </joey>
<garnt> you don't have this guard your bottom </garnt>
<garnt> teeth are really gonna disappear </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i i didn't really know about </garnt>
<garnt> it until uh until i started getting like </garnt>
<garnt> jaw problems so like i think like in my </garnt>
<joey> mid to late 20s i started like getting </joey>
<joey> jaw problems where it felt like my </joey>
<joey> like sometimes i'd wake up and something </joey>
<joey> will like feel off or like slightly </joey>
<joey> dislocated or yeah it's hot yeah like i </joey>
<joey> like i i never i i didn't know that it </joey>
<joey> was an issue until i started getting the </joey>
<joey> issue and then uh i went to my dentist </joey>
<garnt> and you're like uh yeah you grind your </garnt>
<garnt> teeth a [ __ ] ton and uh you need to wear </garnt>
<garnt> a mouth guard because uh your your bite </garnt>
<garnt> is going to get like more and more </garnt>
<connor> deformed </connor>
<connor> i'm going to schedule an appointment </connor>
<joey> because i forgot to reply to that email </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i hated it when they did the mold thing </connor>
<joey> right they put like all that that gunk </joey>
<joey> in you yeah like the putty thing right </joey>
<connor> yeah it was so confusing figuring out </connor>
<connor> how to breathe for a second where i was </connor>
<connor> like wait [ __ ] my mouth is completely </connor>
<connor> like covered with this gunk how do i </connor>
<connor> breathe without my teeth it feels so </connor>
<connor> weird i wonder if that's how it feels </connor>
<connor> when you have like dentures i don't know </connor>
<joey> just like not having teeth it felt </joey>
<joey> really strange </joey>
<joey> also i remember that they were like do </joey>
<joey> whatever you do do not swallow right now </joey>
<connor> and then i've never had an urge to </connor>
<connor> swallow more of my life </connor>
<connor> is that a challenge </connor>
<connor> they're like blasting [ __ ] in your mouth </connor>
<connor> trying to clean up something like that </connor>
<connor> do not swallow i'm like [ __ ] that all i </connor>
<connor> can think about is swallowing this weird </connor>
<garnt> liquid that smells like apples i want to </garnt>
<garnt> do it </garnt>
<connor> he thinks i won't swallow but i will </connor>
<joey> swallow the poison </joey>
<joey> the next thing you'll say is don't </joey>
<joey> swallow </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> that's true </connor>
<connor> it's awful i don't like dentists i don't </connor>
<connor> think anyone likes the dentist if they </connor>
<garnt> do i don't like i don't think anyone </garnt>
<garnt> likes the hospital as well </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<joey> well yes yeah </joey>
<joey> kids want to play on the the free ps2 </joey>
<joey> that they have there </joey>
<connor> he talked about this </connor>
<connor> it used to be me yeah yeah i used to </connor>
<connor> like it but then the gamecube controls </connor>
<joey> were robbed yeah yeah i wish i went to </joey>
<joey> your hospital because my hospital didn't </joey>
<garnt> have that [ __ ] at all </garnt>
<garnt> have you guys ever had to ride in an </garnt>
<garnt> ambulance no yeah i did like in japan </garnt>
<garnt> actually in japan yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> aki's like aki had a like slight </garnt>
<connor> accident right at our last place and uh </connor>
<connor> like it was pretty bad so like we had to </connor>
<joey> call the hospital and i was riding the </joey>
<joey> hospital </joey>
<joey> right in the hospital right running in </joey>
<joey> the hospital </joey>
<connor> i had to get an ambulance so so i was </connor>
<connor> running the ambulance late at night and </connor>
<joey> like because it was late at night the </joey>
<joey> closest hospital was closed right makes </joey>
<connor> no [ __ ] sense like you think </connor>
<joey> hospitals are open all the time yeah uh </joey>
<connor> so we had to go to like the next pho </connor>
<connor> this one so it was like a 15 20 minute </connor>
<garnt> ride yeah um and uh luckily you know </garnt>
<joey> like aki was okay like she was calming </joey>
<joey> down in the ambulance right and uh it </joey>
<joey> was so [ __ ] up because it's like in my </joey>
<joey> head during that whole ambulance ride </joey>
<joey> like 95 percent of my brain was like oh </joey>
<joey> god i hope you know ugly is okay and </joey>
<connor> sure you know we'll be able to get out </connor>
<connor> of this yeah yeah yeah and five percent </connor>
<connor> of my brain was like oh [ __ ] yeah i'm in </connor>
<joey> an ambulance </joey>
<joey> like whoa this is so cool i've never </joey>
<connor> been a one before this is what it looks </connor>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] i i always just feel really </connor>
<connor> bad i feel like i'm inconveniencing </connor>
<garnt> these workers yeah even though even </garnt>
<garnt> though it's their </garnt>
<connor> job yeah like </connor>
<connor> my leg could be broken oh [ __ ] i'm so </connor>
<joey> sorry for wasting your time yeah it's </joey>
<joey> really someone else has a heart attack </joey>
<connor> or something yeah i'm </connor>
<joey> i was in the emergency room i've never </joey>
<joey> been in the emeralds by the way but i </joey>
<joey> was in the emergency room and this guy </joey>
<garnt> was just holding on to his thumb i </garnt>
<garnt> thought that was really [ __ ] weird </garnt>
<garnt> and he was really calm yeah he's holding </garnt>
<garnt> on to his thumb like this and his i </garnt>
<garnt> could see that holding on to his thumb </garnt>
<garnt> like his thumb was falling off his thumb </garnt>
<joey> had been cut off and he was holding on </joey>
<joey> all like in his hand he was holding onto </joey>
<connor> his thumb what and he was like really </connor>
<connor> calm and they were talking to him being </connor>
<connor> like are you ready mr jones to go to the </connor>
<connor> and he was like yeah it's all right </connor>
<connor> i don't mind waiting a little bit it's </connor>
<joey> really weird </joey>
<joey> it's really strange because i didn't </joey>
<joey> realize what he was doing at first until </joey>
<joey> i like saw the bag of ice with it and </joey>
<joey> then he had a band-aid going around like </joey>
<connor> this and his hand was like like this </connor>
<connor> right like and he had like bandage going </connor>
<joey> around oh i just i just wanted him to be </joey>
<joey> like are you ready mr jones if you like </joey>
<connor> thumbs up haha </connor>
<connor> it's really weird i i've you know i was </connor>
<connor> like tv shows in the uk like like just </connor>
<connor> farmers who like had their arm like cut </connor>
<connor> off yeah </connor>
<garnt> because like if there's one finger you </garnt>
<connor> don't want to leave you don't want to </connor>
<connor> you don't want to do right you don't </connor>
<garnt> want to freak out you want to be calm </garnt>
<joey> that's true i feel like the more you </joey>
<joey> panic the the worse it is for everyone </joey>
<connor> so you're like calm down but i don't </connor>
<garnt> know it's easier said than done yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean obviously like we've never i've </garnt>
<garnt> never been in that situation so it's </garnt>
<garnt> hard to like imagine how you'd react in </garnt>
<garnt> that situation because you've kind of </garnt>
<garnt> never been in that situation yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> weird really because when i've been in </connor>
<connor> situations where i i feel like i have to </connor>
<connor> calm myself down afterwards i'm like is </connor>
<connor> that what you know you see people like </connor>
<connor> freaking out yeah are they like trying </connor>
<connor> to calm themselves down or like what's </connor>
<connor> going through their head it's just what </connor>
<connor> do you mean like when when i'm like </connor>
<connor> let's say like uh if i'm bleeding really </connor>
<connor> badly which has happened a few times or </connor>
<connor> something and i have hemophilia and my </connor>
<connor> my whole focus when i when it's happened </connor>
<connor> i remember distinctly is like i'm </connor>
<connor> literally just focusing on not freaking </connor>
<connor> out that's all i did yeah </connor>
<connor> and i'm like i'm like trying to keep it </connor>
<connor> together yeah i just think like i'm like </connor>
<connor> is that what everyone does i don't know </connor>
<connor> because there's no way to get into </connor>
<connor> someone else's mind right now </connor>
<connor> so i wonder like </connor>
<connor> when some has anything ever happened to </connor>
<connor> you where you're like really scared and </connor>
<garnt> you're like freaking out probably not </garnt>
<garnt> like i've never had anything like life </garnt>
<garnt> threatening or anything like that so i i </garnt>
<garnt> wouldn't know myself how i would react </garnt>
<garnt> but if it's </garnt>
<garnt> if if i know how i react with a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> situations it's just </garnt>
<garnt> yeah calm </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's like trying to force yourself </connor>
<connor> i don't know how to i don't know how the </connor>
<garnt> the human mind is really [ __ ] weird </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i'm like i i'm the kind of guy </garnt>
<joey> who in stressful situations just say </joey>
<joey> nothing like i don't know like </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> okay this is going off tangent now but </joey>
<joey> like i don't i don't physically react </joey>
<joey> when like someone tries to try to jump </joey>
<joey> scare me a lot of the times right i </joey>
<connor> remember i remember like every time </connor>
<connor> there's a jump scare or anytime sydney </connor>
<connor> like tries to like prank jump scare me </connor>
<connor> like i like she goes ah like that or </connor>
<connor> something when i come out the shower or </connor>
<connor> whatever yeah and i'm and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> completely like [ __ ] determinate to </connor>
<connor> zero reaction and she's just like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you and i'm like haha sydney that's </connor>
<joey> right i had a [ __ ] [ __ ] whereas where </joey>
<joey> is inside i'm just like [ __ ] my life you </joey>
<garnt> know like inside i'm like screaming my </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] heart out man so like i don't </connor>
<joey> know like he slowly </joey>
<joey> i am the complete opposite like i hate </joey>
<joey> it when someone comes around the corner </joey>
<joey> and like scares me like i always stop </joey>
<joey> myself from like throwing a fist out </joey>
<joey> because i'm like it's a threat oh no </joey>
<joey> it's not it's not okay thank god </joey>
<joey> my final flight is just like fight no no </joey>
<joey> no no okay i shouldn't i should </joey>
<joey> no but like but it's weird because when </joey>
<joey> i had to call the ambulance for rocky </joey>
<joey> i was like surprisingly calm i thought i </joey>
<joey> was gonna be because i'd never like </joey>
<joey> called the ambulance before right or </joey>
<joey> like you know because i didn't know what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] the procedure was right so the </joey>
<connor> first time i was calling i was in my </connor>
<connor> head i was like oh god what the [ __ ] am </connor>
<connor> i gonna say am i gonna stutter you know </connor>
<joey> what the hell's gonna happen but then by </joey>
<joey> the time i got finished i was like oh </joey>
<joey> that i was a lot calmer than i thought </joey>
<connor> domino's will be here in 15 minutes </connor>
<joey> honey don't worry about it i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> call the ambulance now oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry </joey>
<joey> oh you said ambulance oh i said </joey>
<connor> pepperoni </connor>
<connor> don't worry actually the double peperoni </connor>
<connor> pizza </connor>
<joey> it was surprisingly calming but then i </joey>
<garnt> think it was for me i'm calm in the </garnt>
<joey> moment but then when it's all over </joey>
<joey> that's when it all comes out yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> to me i panic like post when everything </garnt>
<connor> just kind of sinks in to be like holy </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that [ __ ] happened and yeah i </connor>
<connor> went through all this [ __ ] and it's only </connor>
<connor> after the event has transpired that it </connor>
<connor> actually starts to sink in and i start </connor>
<joey> to feel the gravity of everything that's </joey>
<connor> happened yeah yeah at least to me </connor>
<joey> um i do have a question though because i </joey>
<garnt> kind of remembered this uh in the </garnt>
<garnt> experience i had in the past week do you </garnt>
<garnt> guys get have you guys ever got some </garnt>
<garnt> fever dreams </garnt>
<connor> would you buy a fever dream can you find </connor>
<connor> one for me </connor>
<joey> you have when you have a fever when you </joey>
<connor> have a really bad fever and you start </connor>
<connor> dreaming really weird [ __ ] because i </connor>
<connor> thought it was just a saying i thought </connor>
<connor> it was just a term of phrase right until </connor>
<connor> i started dating sydney who gets like </connor>
<connor> such some of like the most [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> weirdest fever dreams i've ever heard in </connor>
<connor> my life while conscious huh like all </connor>
<garnt> like while i'll sleep </garnt>
<joey> i'm like like okay okay so what are you </joey>
<joey> going to walk she's just [ __ ] ravens </joey>
<connor> like she's running around the apartment </connor>
<connor> or she asleep wakes up and then he's </connor>
<connor> like gone you don't believe this dream i </connor>
<joey> had i was president i don't think that's </joey>
<joey> a favorite dream i think that's just </joey>
<garnt> like going psycho </garnt>
<connor> can we get a </connor>
<garnt> definition of where the dream comes from </garnt>
<garnt> okay so so when you have like when you </garnt>
<garnt> have a really bad fever obviously you </garnt>
<garnt> try to rest you your body tries to rest </garnt>
<garnt> right or at least some people's body </garnt>
<garnt> tries to rest um and and then you go to </garnt>
<garnt> sleep and you're like sweating you start </garnt>
<garnt> having a really bad fever you know as </garnt>
<garnt> your body tries to fight off this </garnt>
<garnt> illness and then some people or i'm </garnt>
<garnt> saying some people because the </garnt>
<garnt> experience i've seen it happen to is </garnt>
<garnt> with sydney and she'll just wake up </garnt>
<garnt> drenched full of sweat and was just like </garnt>
<garnt> honey i just saw connor in a bikini </garnt>
<garnt> running on the beach what the [ __ ] is </garnt>
<garnt> going on where am i right now like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's she was saying she'll just wake up </garnt>
<garnt> and just say like the weirdest [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] that happened and i'm like like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like what what what just happened and </garnt>
<garnt> she was like oh it was just a few and </garnt>
<connor> that's that's believable actually that </connor>
<joey> is possible </joey>
<connor> that wasn't a fever dream that was just </connor>
<garnt> an episode </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like i've never had like a </garnt>
<garnt> single fever dream at all or like i </garnt>
<joey> actually i've really ever dreamed the </joey>
<joey> the problem is no no it's it's no dream </joey>
<joey> because i think i'm the exact same way </joey>
<joey> whereas like i don't remember 99 of my </joey>
<joey> dreams </joey>
<joey> and it's [ __ ] up because it's like i i </joey>
<joey> remember i remember some mornings i wake </joey>
<joey> up and i'm like i remember having a </joey>
<joey> really good dream and then as i am </joey>
<joey> waking up and i'm trying to remember the </joey>
<joey> dream again i'm like yeah and it's wait </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] did i just dream about and </joey>
<joey> it's so weird because it it literally </joey>
<joey> like fades away right as i'm trying to </joey>
<joey> think about it </joey>
<joey> but all i remember is that </joey>
<joey> i had a good dream yeah but if he told </joey>
<joey> me to recite it i'd be like i don't know </joey>
<garnt> i don't remember i like because to me i </garnt>
<garnt> think i feel like i've just rarely ever </garnt>
<joey> dreamed i i don't know because like if i </joey>
<joey> have a dream oh you do dream everyone </joey>
<joey> dreams i'm i'm sure i do i'm sure i'm </joey>
<joey> sure i'm sure i do you're not a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> reptile like you do dream anyway i'm </connor>
<connor> joey um </connor>
<garnt> dream sleepers can experience when they </garnt>
<joey> have a fever </joey>
<joey> i'm sure i've had a fever drinking so </joey>
<joey> sure yeah but they happen similar to </joey>
<joey> other dreams that can happen during any </joey>
<garnt> stage of sleep </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it just seems like her dreams when </garnt>
<garnt> she has a fever is just like the wildest </garnt>
<connor> ones you know it's so strange i don't </connor>
<connor> remember my dreams </connor>
<connor> very i very rarely remember them yeah </connor>
<joey> maybe like once every month yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't remember really yeah i probably </joey>
<garnt> can only remember like two nightmares </garnt>
<garnt> but but but like if i have a dream i </garnt>
<garnt> like i remember the fact that i had a </garnt>
<garnt> dream but like most but most nights i </garnt>
<garnt> wake up and i'm just like i there was </garnt>
<garnt> there was just a void in my head there </garnt>
<garnt> was nothing there was nothing i dreamt </garnt>
<connor> nothing can you can you feel the sense </connor>
<connor> of time passing when you're aware that </connor>
<garnt> you're dreaming </garnt>
<garnt> yeah have you ever have you ever had a </garnt>
<joey> lucid dream no i really want to though </joey>
<garnt> those are the funnest ones i've only had </garnt>
<connor> once i've only had it a few times i </connor>
<connor> think i've had situations where what i </connor>
<connor> wanted to happen in the dream during it </connor>
<connor> did happen but i feel like it's a battle </connor>
<connor> i don't know this is so hard to remember </connor>
<connor> this stuff this is what scientists have </connor>
<connor> been trying to like [ __ ] figure out </connor>
<connor> for like hundreds of years yeah i don't </connor>
<garnt> know do you have you ever had a dream </garnt>
<garnt> that's like been so vivid </garnt>
<garnt> that it's kind of like just stuck with </garnt>
<garnt> you for like years and you can still </garnt>
<garnt> recite it because i don't remember like </garnt>
<joey> most of my dreams </joey>
<connor> i have one nightmare i had when i was </connor>
<connor> little that i think is the reason why </connor>
<connor> i'm afraid of heights now right uh so </connor>
<connor> like you know how they say like you </connor>
<connor> can't die in your dream right yeah </connor>
<connor> because you've never experienced it </connor>
<connor> before i think that that's bs </connor>
<joey> well actually i thought it was bs2 until </joey>
<connor> i had time i pretty sure i'd die in a </connor>
<connor> lot of my dreams </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> you're all right i don't know no no no </connor>
<connor> no no food voices </connor>
<joey> i've i've i've done one of those food </joey>
<joey> points i've i've definitely died in my </joey>
<garnt> dreams but i've just woken up </garnt>
<connor> immediately as i've done yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> really do you always wake up is that </connor>
<connor> like guaranteed i feel like i've reset i </connor>
<joey> don't [ __ ] know what </joey>
<joey> is it you just remember </joey>
<connor> you died for real </connor>
<joey> you respawning your dreams i'm pretty </joey>
<connor> sure i've respawned in my dream i'm near </connor>
<joey> certain i've respawned in my dream the </joey>
<joey> the only nightmare i've had that i can </joey>
<joey> still vividly remember is i it was a </joey>
<joey> really short dream but i was like flying </joey>
<joey> in my room </joey>
<joey> and then for some reason i just stopped </joey>
<joey> and then i </joey>
<connor> and then just i just picked a young joey </connor>
<joey> flying yeah i'm just like flying my room </joey>
<joey> like like that yeah uh and then i just </joey>
<joey> stopped i remember i stopped and our </joey>
<joey> house was like uh it was like two </joey>
<joey> stories and we had like this spiral </joey>
<joey> staircase that went down to like the </joey>
<joey> basement floor yeah and i remember i </joey>
<joey> just stopped and i looked down at the </joey>
<joey> spiral staircase and i just dropped </joey>
<joey> like head first </joey>
<joey> and i vividly remember </joey>
<connor> my face got about this close to the </connor>
<joey> ground and then okay </joey>
<connor> right and just [ __ ] myself </connor>
<connor> right and i think from that point on i </connor>
<connor> got afraid of heights huh because i </connor>
<connor> vividly remember the feeling of falling </connor>
<connor> and it was horrible </connor>
<connor> you your brain made a traumatic </connor>
<garnt> experience for you yeah that's so </garnt>
<garnt> strange like like to me like the one </garnt>
<garnt> traumatic dream that i've had that has </garnt>
<garnt> stuck with me for years </garnt>
<garnt> was i remember i remember this one time </garnt>
<garnt> um i was living this dream right </garnt>
<garnt> and i would wake up in my bed in my room </garnt>
<garnt> that i was living at the time and i </garnt>
<garnt> would just go about my day right and </garnt>
<garnt> then </garnt>
<garnt> and then it would just be a normal day </garnt>
<garnt> and then something would happen that </garnt>
<garnt> would just be like out the ordinary like </garnt>
<garnt> i would see </garnt>
<garnt> i would see like </garnt>
<garnt> i would see like a twin </garnt>
<garnt> followed by another twin like i just </garnt>
<garnt> noticed a glitch in the matrix or </garnt>
<garnt> something and then as soon as i saw that </garnt>
<garnt> it would like the dream reset and i'd </garnt>
<garnt> wake up again i would and i would think </garnt>
<joey> that i was in the real world and i would </joey>
<joey> go about my day and then i will notice </joey>
<joey> another glitch in the in reality it was </joey>
<joey> it's it's [ __ ] nightmare fuel because </joey>
<joey> like i literally i literally repeat this </joey>
<joey> cycle and every time i would get more </joey>
<joey> and more paranoid that i didn't know if </joey>
<joey> i was in the dream world or if i was </joey>
<joey> actually awake i was like i was like is </joey>
<joey> this a dream of because like i would go </joey>
<joey> about my day and </joey>
<joey> i remember the exact moment i woke up </joey>
<joey> was about the tenth time when i like i </joey>
<joey> like went through an entire day thinking </joey>
<joey> okay i'm awake i'm awake and i remember </joey>
<joey> going to the toilet </joey>
<joey> and i was uh i was um getting ready for </joey>
<joey> bed and i looked at the mirror and then </joey>
<joey> my reflection turned like </joey>
<joey> turned away and like i [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> freaked out and then i woke up for real </joey>
<joey> like for real real wow and i think an </joey>
<joey> arias to film no no no no no no it </joey>
<connor> sounds like a cool film i woke up for </connor>
<connor> real real and i was [ __ ] myself </connor>
<connor> because i didn't i didn't believe the </connor>
<connor> fact that i was actually awake right it </connor>
<connor> it it literally [ __ ] with my mind for </connor>
<connor> like an entire few days because i </connor>
<connor> i went about those few days being like </connor>
<joey> where's the glitch where's when's it </joey>
<joey> gonna happen when's it gonna come out </joey>
<joey> we're twins yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't know how my mind created such a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] up situation that it literally </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] up my mind in real life </joey>
<garnt> maybe maybe i'm still in the dream maybe </garnt>
<joey> maybe i'm just trash tasting </joey>
<joey> when you're when you're dreaming right </joey>
<joey> are you able so like you mentioned that </joey>
<joey> you like flying right yeah when i'm in </joey>
<joey> dreams and i like let's say i do </joey>
<joey> something that i know is is impossible </joey>
<connor> are you aware that you're like you know </connor>
<connor> it's impossible and that you're dreaming </connor>
<joey> because i often always get i'm aware </joey>
<joey> that it's impossible but i just </joey>
<connor> i i think because like lucid dreaming is </connor>
<connor> where it's like you're aware that you're </connor>
<connor> what you're doing </connor>
<joey> so you take full advantage of that i </joey>
<connor> thought lucid dreaming was where you </connor>
<connor> then controlled said dream yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i can't control cedric to me i know </connor>
<connor> i'm in a dream a lot of the time okay so </connor>
<connor> okay so i can't control my dream when </connor>
<connor> i'm in when i'm in lucid dreaming state </connor>
<connor> but it's more of like </connor>
<connor> it's it's more of like it's more like </connor>
<connor> you realize that you're in gta with </connor>
<connor> cheats on you know that's that's how i </connor>
<connor> imagine it right because </connor>
<connor> there have been times where i'm just </connor>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] dreaming all </connor>
<garnt> right let me let am i dreaming let me </garnt>
<garnt> try flying okay oh i'm flying now yeah </garnt>
<connor> brilliant i'm [ __ ] dreaming this is </connor>
<connor> amazing that sounds like you have cheat </connor>
<joey> signs yeah i can't </joey>
<connor> because i don't have dreams often when i </connor>
<connor> do i yeah at some point in the dream i </connor>
<connor> figure out this is a dream </connor>
<joey> right like something will happen that </joey>
<joey> my brain chose to make happen but i also </joey>
<joey> am aware that that is not possible and </joey>
<joey> that i'm now aware that i'm in a dream </joey>
<joey> but it doesn't change how i behave like </joey>
<joey> i know that i'm in a dream but i still </joey>
<joey> go on the dream this is so strange </joey>
<joey> what's wrong with our brains </joey>
<joey> like i had this dream recently i can't </joey>
<joey> remember the fall of it i told i told </joey>
<joey> the dream on stream it was something </joey>
<garnt> like um i i i was in a </garnt>
<garnt> situation where </garnt>
<garnt> i'd been falsely accused of stealing </garnt>
<garnt> this game cartridge yeah and then i was </garnt>
<joey> then arrested for it and i was like no </joey>
<joey> i'm not getting arrested for this i </joey>
<joey> didn't i didn't steal it i refuse and so </joey>
<joey> then i then i like killed one of the </joey>
<connor> cops and like ran away because he was </connor>
<connor> trying to arrest me over the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> game cartridge that i had nothing to do </connor>
<connor> and then it turned out into this like </connor>
<connor> massive shootout and stuff now then i </connor>
<joey> somehow kept uh getting away and then </joey>
<joey> eventually i got caught and then i went </joey>
<joey> to prison and then i understood i was in </joey>
<joey> a dream at this point so then somehow i </joey>
<joey> magically then got a phone it's like an </joey>
<joey> easy car i had this phone in prison that </joey>
<connor> i was then using to then play games and </connor>
<connor> stuff and like have a normal life in </connor>
<connor> prison yeah and i don't know why then my </connor>
<connor> charger broke and </connor>
<connor> i remember this happened and i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] when my charges broke and then i </connor>
<connor> just skipped and i had a charger and i </connor>
<connor> was like great </connor>
<connor> it was awesome </connor>
<connor> i just skipped the point where my brain </connor>
<connor> had to like think hard enough to come up </connor>
<connor> with the reason why i needed the charger </connor>
<garnt> i have the charger yeah this is great </garnt>
<garnt> this is i don't understand why this </garnt>
<garnt> happens though but did you realize it </garnt>
<garnt> was a dream or yeah about halfway </garnt>
<garnt> through the dream i understood it was a </garnt>
<garnt> dream yeah but i did but you did you </garnt>
<garnt> don't take advantage of it you're just i </garnt>
<joey> don't know how to </joey>
<joey> like because i was about to say like i </joey>
<joey> love how in the dream you still got </joey>
<joey> arrested </joey>
<connor> this is incorrect actually i didn't get </connor>
<connor> the charger i got really this is where i </connor>
<connor> reset so i went to the roof of the </connor>
<connor> prison because i couldn't i couldn't get </connor>
<connor> a charger so i thought what's the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] point if i can't play games yeah </connor>
<joey> i jumped off the roof of the prison and </joey>
<joey> then i reset in the prison </joey>
<connor> i died i died and then i just in my head </connor>
<connor> i remember there was a jump </connor>
<connor> i i remember i died and then i just </connor>
<connor> appeared back in the prison again with </connor>
<connor> the charged iphone with a new charger or </connor>
<joey> something it's like the worst version of </joey>
<connor> edge of tomorrow </connor>
<joey> terrible </joey>
<joey> i just don't know why this was happening </joey>
<connor> why i understood it was a dream why </connor>
<connor> can't i have some control over it </connor>
<connor> they're all [ __ ] dreams i always have </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] dreams </garnt>
<joey> but at least you remember like </joey>
<garnt> because to me like a lot of night like </garnt>
<garnt> say for example like last night right to </garnt>
<garnt> me it's like okay i'm falling asleep </garnt>
<garnt> falling asleep falling asleep one second </garnt>
<joey> later oh it's 7 a.m yeah like there's i </joey>
<garnt> i feel no perception of time no okay </garnt>
<connor> when you wake up can you feel </connor>
<connor> the time without looking at the clock </connor>
<joey> yeah sometimes </joey>
<joey> yes but not accurately i feel like i'm </joey>
<connor> pretty [ __ ] good at it now i don't </connor>
<garnt> know what happened </garnt>
<garnt> it depends on how good my sleep cycle is </garnt>
<joey> at that time um sometimes like now it's </joey>
<joey> a bit [ __ ] up because uh kovit just </joey>
<joey> made me want to sleep all the time so </joey>
<joey> i'm just like okay now now i can't tell </joey>
<joey> because my body's constantly tired but </joey>
<joey> before then i would be like you know you </joey>
<joey> know sometimes you wake up and you're </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be 15 minutes before the </joey>
<joey> alarm goes yeah i mean you look at the </joey>
<garnt> time every time you look at the time </garnt>
<garnt> you're like i'm i'm a [ __ ] genius </garnt>
<connor> the reason why i asked do you know that </connor>
<connor> is because i was like in like if i asked </connor>
<connor> you no dreams right do you do you know </connor>
<joey> that there was a flow of time in your </joey>
<connor> dreams </connor>
<joey> see this is weird i know how much time </joey>
<connor> is passing in the dream in the real </connor>
<connor> world isn't this weird </connor>
<connor> how strange is that that's that's </connor>
<connor> against inception rules though because </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> we all </connor>
<garnt> we all know we all know time passes slow </garnt>
<connor> in the dream world so because i'll wake </connor>
<connor> up right after a dream or whatever and </connor>
<joey> you know it'd be like 5 00 a.m and then </joey>
<connor> i'd be like i like that dream i'm also </connor>
<connor> gonna go back to bed yeah and then i </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> when i'm in the dream how much time is </connor>
<connor> passing because when i wake up the exact </connor>
<connor> amount of time that i thought had passed </connor>
<connor> in the dream had passed in real life is </connor>
<garnt> this so strange i think that's just your </garnt>
<garnt> subconscious might be like like counting </garnt>
<garnt> the time maybe yeah it's almost like an </garnt>
<joey> alternate reality do you have a level </joey>
<connor> like you need to [ __ ] [ __ ] the match </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i am vr </joey>
<garnt> we all had vr in our minds in our </garnt>
<connor> most strangest episodes we've ever done </connor>
<garnt> which this is a weirdest topic </garnt>
<garnt> do you ever like have a really fun dream </garnt>
<connor> and then you get actively pissed off </connor>
<connor> when you like wake up </connor>
<connor> oh my god i remember this i remember </connor>
<connor> some of like the funnest lucid dreams </connor>
<garnt> i've had and then [ __ ] sydney wakes </garnt>
<garnt> up i was like god god let's cuddle and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like [ __ ] off sydney i'm flying </garnt>
<connor> right now i'm flying sydney i was on </connor>
<connor> episode 24 and i was the botanist </connor>
<connor> the worst one for me is like when i'm </connor>
<connor> having a good dream because i don't </connor>
<connor> remember most my good dreams right yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but it's like i remember i wake up </connor>
<connor> and i'm just like man i don't remember </connor>
<joey> what i just dreamed but </joey>
<joey> maybe if i go back to sleep i'll dream </joey>
<joey> it again </joey>
<joey> and so i go back to sleep and i don't </joey>
<joey> dream it again i was like no </joey>
<joey> it's gone forever like like to me to me </joey>
<joey> that there's a point right because to me </joey>
<joey> i've i've had it before where i've had </joey>
<joey> like really really fun dreams and i like </joey>
<connor> you half wake up but before your mind </connor>
<connor> fully wakes up you're like go back to </connor>
<connor> sleep and then sometimes i've been able </connor>
<connor> like to like reinsert myself into the </connor>
<joey> matrix right god i'm getting in the air </joey>
<connor> i'm going in i'm going </connor>
<joey> so i know sometimes like i wake up i'm </joey>
<joey> like if i go to if i go to sleep now if </joey>
<joey> i go to sleep right now i can go i can </joey>
<joey> jack back in and then like </joey>
<joey> i get so sad when i like try to [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> will myself to sleep because you know </joey>
<joey> when you try to will yourself to sleep </joey>
<joey> most of the time it doesn't [ __ ] work </joey>
<joey> right but sometimes like i just like try </joey>
<joey> to like will myself to sleep and five </joey>
<garnt> minute passes i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm awake now [ __ ] my life this is the </garnt>
<connor> this is the real world i think i used to </connor>
<connor> do that but i don't ever try that </connor>
<connor> anymore i think sometimes i'm like yeah </connor>
<joey> whatever just get on with it i'll just </joey>
<joey> i'll just stream it again tomorrow night </joey>
<joey> you have a theme to most your dreams or </joey>
<connor> your dreams because they say that your </connor>
<connor> dreams are normally like reoccurring-ish </connor>
<joey> sort of like they're similar </joey>
<joey> no events ah no not really for me </joey>
<connor> i just die in a lot of my dreams </connor>
<connor> i don't know what that says about me </connor>
<connor> yeah uh maybe some dream expert but even </connor>
<connor> that you know how people are like </connor>
<connor> dreamologists yeah the dreams uh they </connor>
<joey> they </joey>
<joey> your dream if whatever you do in the </joey>
<connor> dream there's a there's a real meaning </connor>
<connor> to it in real life </connor>
<connor> maybe i don't know like if you're </connor>
<joey> stressed out then you're dreaming about </joey>
<joey> your teeth falling out and stuff like </joey>
<joey> that something like that right where </joey>
<connor> they think that every single thing that </connor>
<connor> you can dream of has a real life </connor>
<connor> counterpart emotion that you're feeling </connor>
<joey> right there is to some extent but yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm like it's definitely too complex for </connor>
<garnt> us yeah way too common science yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> get like really high </garnt>
<garnt> high concept dreams sometimes um like i </garnt>
<garnt> get like like i thought i told you like </garnt>
<connor> the the the dream i just had but like </connor>
<connor> sometimes i just dream </connor>
<connor> and then i wake up and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> that's a really cool [ __ ] film idea </connor>
<connor> that's a really cool film </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> basically right you know it's uh i don't </connor>
<connor> know some </connor>
<connor> it's so weird something i i like i don't </connor>
<garnt> know how my mind works because sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like damn i dreamed that that </garnt>
<garnt> was such a cool [ __ ] idea what the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> how the [ __ ] did my mind come up with </garnt>
<joey> that concept what language do you dream </joey>
<garnt> it as as as because all three of us can </garnt>
<garnt> speak two languages right yeah like what </garnt>
<garnt> what language do you usually draw </garnt>
<garnt> english uh english for me is that i've </garnt>
<garnt> rarely like dreamed in time unless i've </garnt>
<garnt> unless it's when i'm like living in </garnt>
<garnt> thailand and i'm like using it more um </garnt>
<joey> more often that's so weird like i </joey>
<joey> remember like 90 of my dreams are in </joey>
<joey> japanese </joey>
<garnt> okay i don't know why what language do </garnt>
<joey> you think in though </joey>
<garnt> depends that's that's probably why </garnt>
<garnt> that's probably why right because like i </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> i don't normally think inside but </garnt>
<joey> there's been points where i've lived in </joey>
<joey> thailand and then my thoughts start </joey>
<joey> getting like jumbled up and i start </joey>
<joey> start thinking in a different language </joey>
<joey> as well which is like it's it's really </joey>
<joey> like how do you describe thinking in a </joey>
<joey> different language as someone who only </joey>
<garnt> speaks one language it's </garnt>
<joey> i don't know how to like properly </joey>
<connor> describe it thinking about how you think </connor>
<connor> is also weird </connor>
<connor> now i'm like i'm like i don't talk to </connor>
<connor> myself when i think i don't think so but </connor>
<joey> maybe i do talk to myself and i think </joey>
<connor> i'm not sure some people can't though </connor>
<joey> all right </joey>
<joey> some people like physically can't think </joey>
<connor> out no </connor>
<connor> now that you're telling me that i'm </connor>
<connor> talking to myself while i'm thinking now </connor>
<joey> i'm doing it but i'm pretty sure i don't </joey>
<garnt> do it i think i should do things </garnt>
<connor> i don't i just don't think i just think </connor>
<connor> i'd talk to myself in my head out loud </connor>
<garnt> if i talk yeah because i remember i </garnt>
<garnt> remember reading about you know deaf </garnt>
<garnt> people thinking in sign language and </garnt>
<connor> that just like that blows my [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> mind you know it just i can't even like </connor>
<joey> come close to conceptualizing it you </joey>
<joey> know but i know i know it happens i know </joey>
<garnt> people do it but like you know it's it's </garnt>
<joey> it's so weird it's so weird to me this </joey>
<joey> episode is sponsored by expressvpn when </joey>
<connor> you use the bathroom you always close </connor>
<connor> the door behind you right of course you </connor>
<connor> don't want random passerby looking in on </connor>
<connor> you so why would you let people look in </connor>
<connor> on you when you go online using the </connor>
<connor> internet without expressvpn is like </connor>
<connor> going to the bathroom and not closing </connor>
<garnt> the door did you know that your internet </garnt>
<garnt> service provider knows every single </garnt>
<garnt> website you visit and what's worse is </garnt>
<garnt> that they sell this information to ad </garnt>
<garnt> companies and tech giants who use your </garnt>
<connor> data to target you is that why this </connor>
<connor> melts in my area well the good thing is </connor>
<joey> that expressvpn puts a stop to all of </joey>
<joey> that it creates a secure encrypted </joey>
<joey> tunnel between your device and the </joey>
<joey> internet so that your online activity </joey>
<joey> can't be seen by anyone i use expressvpn </joey>
<connor> on all of my devices it works on </connor>
<connor> everything phones laptops even routers </connor>
<connor> so everyone who shares your wi-fi can </connor>
<connor> still be protected even if they don't </connor>
<garnt> have expressvpn and the best part is </garnt>
<garnt> using expressvpn is as easy as closing </garnt>
<garnt> the bathroom door you just fire up the </garnt>
<garnt> app click one button and then you're </garnt>
<connor> protected so if you're like me and you </connor>
<connor> believe your online activity is your </connor>
<connor> business secure yourself by visiting </connor>

<connor> trash taste and you can get an extra </connor>
<connor> three months for free </connor>
<connor> back to the show i would i would love to </connor>
<connor> like be able to turn on my lucid dreams </connor>
<connor> if if i if i had that [ __ ] power i'd </connor>
<garnt> be like </garnt>
<connor> like that that is literally so it's not </connor>
<connor> normal for you to be aware you're in a </connor>
<garnt> dream no </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't know that that's not normal are </garnt>
<garnt> you always aware yeah like most of the </garnt>
<connor> time i'd say like 80 of the time i know </connor>
<connor> i'm in a dream oh my god are you serious </connor>
<connor> you're that kid at school that aces the </connor>
<joey> test without studying </joey>
<garnt> why was this decision because </garnt>
<joey> that's not because he knows he's in a </joey>
<connor> dream yeah but he can't control it yeah </connor>
<joey> i can't control it </joey>
<joey> that's like that's like getting the the </joey>
<garnt> becoming a lucid dreamer without having </garnt>
<garnt> the fun part of being a lucid dreamer </garnt>
<connor> it's weird because like i can i'm aware </connor>
<connor> i'm in a dream and i know that i can </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i can want things i know i feel that i </garnt>
<connor> want the thing in the dream yeah but it </connor>
<garnt> doesn't always happen like i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how that have you ever like had a </garnt>
<garnt> superpower when you're like in a dream </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah many times define superpower but </connor>
<connor> then i die normally </connor>
<joey> too much power to handle </joey>
<garnt> for one minute literally like in your </garnt>
<garnt> own mind you're playing on hard mode i </garnt>
<joey> didn't realize it was that possible with </joey>
<joey> all these superpowers i guess i'll die </joey>
<connor> i'm trying to think because like yeah i </connor>
<connor> always know </connor>
<connor> some like i said always some i'd say 80 </connor>
<connor> of the time i'm i'm i feel that </connor>
<connor> halfway through or some period in the </connor>
<connor> dream i know that i'm dreaming because </connor>
<connor> things don't add up in my head when i'm </connor>
<connor> in the dream yeah even it's weeks i feel </connor>
<connor> like i'm conscious in the dream so i </connor>
<connor> know what's happening and i know that </connor>
<connor> some things don't add up yeah and i'm </connor>
<connor> aware that i have the knowledge from my </connor>
<connor> normal human life right and i can i have </connor>
<connor> that instead dream so like if somebody </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] teleports behind me at some </connor>
<connor> point after that happens x amount of </connor>
<connor> times or something i'm aware then that </connor>
<connor> this is now not possible </connor>
<connor> yeah when i die </connor>
<connor> and i just poisoned </connor>
<garnt> his recent mechanics that happens so </garnt>
<garnt> much in your dream what is this no no it </garnt>
<connor> doesn't happen often but when it has </connor>
<garnt> happened like if i die but i'm still </garnt>
<joey> dreaming yeah i immediately know </joey>
<connor> that now i'm in a dream yeah because i </connor>
<joey> died because she died yeah and also </joey>
<connor> gender you can't reset really you know </connor>
<joey> what's weird as well </joey>
<joey> i don't know if this is a strange thing </joey>
<joey> but when i'm in danger yeah that's </joey>
<garnt> normally a good way that i know because </garnt>
<garnt> i'm rarely in life am i ever in danger </garnt>
<garnt> in like weird situations right so being </garnt>
<garnt> in danger is like not a normal emotion i </garnt>
<garnt> ever feel </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean so when i end up coming </garnt>
<connor> across it in the dream like if </connor>
<connor> somebody's chasing me that's normally </connor>
<connor> like a one really weird way that i get </connor>
<connor> like in tune with the fact that i'm in a </connor>
<garnt> dream i yeah cause like i also like very </garnt>
<garnt> rarely dream for one but even more of it </garnt>
<garnt> is for me to get nightmares </garnt>
<connor> i see all of mine like nearly nightmares </connor>
<garnt> i wanna say like again eighty percent </garnt>
<connor> probably in the bad things how do you </connor>
<joey> sleep at night i don't mind okay this is </joey>
<joey> the thing right when something bad's </joey>
<connor> happening to me in a dream i cause again </connor>
<connor> i know it's a dream i feel these </connor>
<connor> emotions towards it but then i also </connor>
<connor> because again i'm aware it's a dream i </connor>
<connor> have this weird sense of like oh i </connor>
<joey> should see what could happen </joey>
<connor> because i don't feel like it has any </connor>
<joey> improvements </joey>
<connor> on my actual emotions i'm aware that it </connor>
<connor> isn't is this strange is this normal i </connor>
<garnt> mean i feel like if you have nightmares </garnt>
<connor> that often yeah and uh that's the thing </connor>
<connor> i don't wake up from a nightmare being </connor>
<connor> like like in the movies well oh that's </connor>
<connor> why i always found that [ __ ] so dumb </connor>
<joey> because we're going for a nightmare </joey>
<connor> bad happens to me what no i wake up from </connor>
<connor> a nightmare i'm like oh shut my phone </connor>
<joey> no i wake up and like oh if it's like </joey>
<connor> really bad nightmares which i've had </connor>
<joey> every now and then like yeah i wake up </joey>
<connor> in an actual sweat i've had like my </connor>
<connor> entire life in every single aspect like </connor>
<connor> ruined in dreams before </connor>
<connor> and like waking up like that's good </connor>
<connor> i'm feeling better now </connor>
<connor> because i because when i wake up i feel </connor>
<connor> much better because i'm like oh goodness </connor>
<garnt> no no no go because i i've had i've had </garnt>
<garnt> nightmares where something was like bad </garnt>
<connor> has happened </connor>
<connor> and then you wake up and you just have </connor>
<connor> like this instant sigh of relief where </connor>
<connor> you're like yeah oh my god thank [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> thought my life was like ruined yeah and </connor>
<joey> like it's it's going it's great it's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] great i'm coffee in this thing </joey>
<joey> i'm not in jail my mom like i i'm i'm i </joey>
<joey> find like so many charging cables </joey>
<joey> i think i've had like a dream where i've </joey>
<connor> like literally had to tell my mom i'm </connor>
<connor> about to go to jail </connor>
<connor> like seeing her cry and break down i was </connor>
<joey> just like that's </joey>
<connor> crazy it's just like the </connor>
<connor> i wake up and i'm just like why does my </connor>
<connor> mind do this to me like that was like </connor>
<connor> the most heartbreaking feeling i've had </connor>
<connor> which is telling my mom i'm about to go </connor>
<joey> to jail and i remember her [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> crying and breaking down god me feeling </joey>
<joey> like a like a vegetable like the worst </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] human in the world i wake up and </joey>
<joey> i'm just like </joey>
<connor> i've never loved my life more than i </connor>
<joey> have now i've never felt more fulfilled </joey>
<connor> i've never had that so you so people in </connor>
<connor> your world have like really depth </connor>
<connor> emotion emotional ability yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah see that's weird because in mine </connor>
<connor> it's like i'm the only person who is </connor>
<connor> aware of like how emotions work and </connor>
<joey> everyone else seems to be like robotic </joey>
<joey> everyone's like an npc </joey>
<connor> kind of yeah like because when i the </connor>
<connor> depth isn't there so like even when my </connor>
<connor> parents are in the dream </connor>
<connor> the reason again it's another weird </connor>
<connor> thing the thing that gives it away </connor>
<connor> though </connor>
<garnt> the thing that normally makes me not </garnt>
<connor> enough world building yeah </connor>
<connor> this is another thing where it wakes me </connor>
<connor> like where i feel like i become again in </connor>
<connor> tune into the dream that i know it's a </connor>
<connor> dream is when people aren't acting the </connor>
<connor> way i i my brain knows they are but it's </connor>
<connor> weird right because my brain is the one </connor>
<connor> making this yeah so why does my brain </connor>
<connor> make the people like this but then in </connor>
<connor> the dream my brain also </connor>
<connor> it's like i'm playing checkers against </connor>
<connor> myself and i'm like fantastic move </connor>
<connor> connor you figured out the plan you know </connor>
<connor> what i mean it's like what is happening </connor>
<garnt> in my brain </garnt>
<connor> even when you sleep you try to beat </connor>
<connor> yourself </connor>
<connor> you're literally creating a you're </connor>
<connor> literally creating a game for you to </connor>
<connor> beat while you sleep like what is </connor>
<connor> happening the absolute stage </connor>
<connor> absolutely </connor>
<connor> like makes so much sense because i swear </connor>
<connor> every one of my dreams is like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> easter guy to me right </connor>
<connor> i literally get transported into my own </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] story in my own [ __ ] world </joey>
<joey> yeah there's depth in the world building </joey>
<joey> there there's like some high concept </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] dreams that i remember like </joey>
<joey> characters actually </joey>
<joey> characters in my dream actually act like </joey>
<joey> characters in real life </joey>
<joey> finally i can self-insult which is like </joey>
<joey> which is like sometimes when i wake up </joey>
<joey> and someone's like done like i remember </joey>
<joey> like one time i had a dream where sydney </joey>
<joey> murdered my family </joey>
<joey> and i remember waking up i remember </joey>
<joey> waking up just as like i like found her </joey>
<joey> don't wait i woke up and i turned to her </joey>
<garnt> with such [ __ ] anger and you're like </garnt>
<joey> you [ __ ] i can't believe you just did </joey>
<connor> that to my mom and dad </connor>
<joey> how dare you you better have a good </joey>
<joey> reason </joey>
<joey> i was about we were about to go to trial </joey>
<joey> i will see you in court </joey>
<joey> because like at the time like the </joey>
<joey> emotions felt so the emotions felt so </joey>
<joey> real to me that i i don't know like </joey>
<joey> sometimes when i woke when i wake up and </joey>
<connor> the dream isn't resolved i still have </connor>
<connor> like those emotions fresh in my body </connor>
<connor> yeah i fresh my mind like it's like hard </connor>
<garnt> to like sometimes </garnt>
<joey> get rid of it it's like it's like those </joey>
<joey> stereotypical like you know the </joey>
<joey> girlfriend dreams about the boyfriend </joey>
<joey> cheating the girlfriend's dream wakes up </joey>
<joey> soon that's the boyfriend it's like what </joey>
<connor> i've never understood that but now i do </connor>
<garnt> i've never spoken about my dreams in </garnt>
<garnt> depth it's the first time i'm thinking </garnt>
<garnt> like oh yeah maybe my dreams are weird </garnt>
<garnt> maybe i'm the weirder i i thought i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't remember much of my dreams but </garnt>
<garnt> now that now that i'm thinking about it </garnt>
<joey> maybe i do just remember a lot of </joey>
<joey> because i don't dream often but when i </joey>
<connor> do dream it's like an event for me you </connor>
<joey> know it's it's it's it's literally like </joey>
<joey> watching a film it's great it's great </joey>
<connor> this one's going into the mirror bank </connor>
<connor> also sometimes i have dreams that i at </connor>
<connor> least i can only remember </connor>
<connor> that are very brief dreams like </connor>
<connor> 30 seconds of a dream that i can </connor>
<connor> remember and i've woken up yeah the </connor>
<connor> latest one i remember i was cooking me i </connor>
<connor> don't remember why yeah i didn't know i </connor>
<joey> was in that street </joey>
<connor> i just woke up and i was probably the </connor>
<connor> thing that gave me food poisoning i </connor>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<connor> i remember i was cooking meat and uh </connor>
<connor> food in your dreams </connor>
<connor> that's another thing i don't think i </connor>
<connor> ever get sick in my dreams from all the </connor>
<connor> ones i've remembered i don't think i've </connor>
<connor> ever gotten ill in a dream i don't think </connor>
<joey> i've ever well i mean you're you've gone </joey>
<joey> one step above and you just straight up </joey>
<connor> dying </connor>
<connor> i never die from like it's never like a </connor>
<connor> dream of me on the bed and i'm like </connor>
<connor> like it's yeah it's like i'm always </connor>
<connor> getting stabbed getting thrown getting </connor>
<garnt> shot like </garnt>
<garnt> i mean in your dream you're </garnt>
<connor> you should be in like your peak </connor>
<connor> performance like </connor>
<connor> your peak formula i think it'll be </connor>
<joey> pretty sad if your imagination is just </joey>
<joey> like now you're you're a frail </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] you're a frail [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> in your dreams now you can't fly how </garnt>
<connor> many times would you like to die </connor>
<connor> i've had dreams that other people have </connor>
<connor> been sick in them and i've been around </connor>
<joey> just like the whole dream has been </joey>
<joey> around this person who's progressively </joey>
<connor> getting more ill yeah and that was those </connor>
<joey> dreams are really depressing yeah </joey>
<connor> because even though again i'm aware i'm </connor>
<connor> in a dream i can't do anything to help </connor>
<connor> them i feel like but i don't and i still </connor>
<connor> feel sad because seeing this dream sad </connor>
<connor> version that i've made up that i'm </connor>
<connor> getting more dead is really saddening </connor>
<connor> this is so strange this is really </connor>
<connor> bizarre i i think one of this is why </connor>
<connor> inception was so good i think one of the </connor>
<garnt> weirdest i think one of the weirdest </garnt>
<garnt> dreams i had which actually would be </garnt>
<garnt> like a cool concept is i remember i </garnt>
<connor> remember one time i like i i remember </connor>
<connor> one time i woke up and i for some reason </connor>
<connor> i was just i knew i was like the second </connor>
<connor> coming of christ </connor>
<connor> like i i'm like i knew i knew i was the </connor>
<connor> chosen one i knew i was the messiah </connor>
<garnt> right i knew i was the messiah but the </garnt>
<joey> problem is right so so i think that's </joey>
<joey> called the sigma male grant </joey>
<connor> so the problem is right the problem is i </connor>
<connor> knew i was the messiah yeah but for the </connor>
<connor> life of me i could not prove it to the </connor>
<connor> world right so so like so like i would </connor>
<connor> try to go outside every crazy guy </connor>
<connor> so i would go out and i would like </connor>
<connor> perform miracles i would i would go out </connor>
<connor> and i would like walk on water and [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like this and then and i remember i </connor>
<connor> would be like guys i am the messiah and </connor>
<connor> everyone be like that's a magic trick </connor>
<connor> that's where where's the mirrors at </connor>
<connor> where's the mirror </connor>
<connor> and it was just it was just me </connor>
<connor> progressively getting more more and more </connor>
<connor> more angry i think i like even [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> went on joe rogan at one point in this </connor>
<joey> stream right to be like jesus christ </joey>
<joey> you're like i am jesus christ and you </joey>
<connor> guys proves it and i remember like i </connor>
<joey> turned the frog right now i remember i </joey>
<connor> took my hand out and i like i just like </connor>
<connor> made fire in my hand and he's like </connor>
<connor> that's not impressive i've i've seen </connor>
<connor> magicians do that </connor>
<connor> do something real do it do a real </connor>
<connor> miracle all i'm hearing is the the dream </connor>
<connor> god wasn't actually about </connor>
<connor> you becoming a god it was that you're </connor>
<connor> furious with the current state of magic </connor>
<garnt> catching up to real life because it was </garnt>
<garnt> it was me thinking if there was an </garnt>
<garnt> actual messiah that got born into our </garnt>
<connor> world </connor>
<connor> how would they go about proving it </connor>
<connor> what would like what would they be taken </connor>
<garnt> visas </garnt>
<connor> that was that was just like it is very </connor>
<connor> hard in the modern era yeah special </connor>
<joey> effects yeah now that you say that </joey>
<joey> someone's going to make a [ __ ] jesus </joey>
<joey> guy </joey>
<joey> literally take that concept so i </joey>
<garnt> remember jesus </garnt>
<connor> i was just like that's a really cool </connor>
<joey> concept i'm i'm glad my that was a cool </joey>
<joey> concept </joey>
<garnt> copy right there right now yeah yeah now </garnt>
<garnt> that i've said it someone someone can go </garnt>
<joey> write a story but i don't [ __ ] know </joey>
<joey> have you guys ever had sleep paralysis </joey>
<garnt> yes one time one time yes i have </garnt>
<joey> literally seen sleep paralysis demons </joey>
<garnt> have you yes i have okay i've never seen </garnt>
<joey> this with me </joey>
<joey> i've never gotten to the demon part but </joey>
<joey> i've definitely </joey>
<joey> had because i didn't believe in sleep </joey>
<joey> paralysis until i got it and it's so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] weird because it's like </joey>
<joey> for those to explain what sleep </joey>
<joey> paralysis is basically you're awake but </joey>
<connor> your body's asleep yeah essentially so </connor>
<garnt> your mind's awake but your body yeah so </garnt>
<connor> like i believe when you go to sleep your </connor>
<joey> body like excretes like cremate uh your </joey>
<joey> mind is called a chemical okay your mind </joey>
<connor> is a chemical that paralyzes your body </connor>
<connor> while you're sleeping i believe </connor>
<connor> and so it's like some hunter hunter [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah and and so what sleep paralysis is </connor>
<connor> is that that chemical is still in your </connor>
<connor> body so you can't like move but your </connor>
<connor> mind is still awake yeah it doesn't </connor>
<connor> sound right is that is that right ashley </connor>
<connor> can you can you can you google it </connor>
<connor> so basically uh it's basically </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's you're conscious </connor>
<connor> but you are not able to move yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so i i've only had it once in my </connor>
<connor> life and i thought this was nonsense </connor>
<connor> before yeah and it was like i i was it </connor>
<joey> was on joey's couch yeah really </joey>
<connor> yeah when </connor>
<connor> your sister was there your sister would </connor>
<connor> come and i remember it was weird because </connor>
<connor> they were speaking about me and i was </connor>
<connor> trying to get up yeah say hello but i </connor>
<connor> couldn't </connor>
<connor> i was face down on joey's couch </connor>
<connor> trying my best to wake up </connor>
<connor> i was fully aware i couldn't open my </connor>
<connor> eyes but i was fully awake and i </connor>
<connor> couldn't move my arms or legs yeah but </connor>
<connor> it didn't feel that like i was paralyzed </connor>
<connor> it felt that like even though i was like </connor>
<connor> willing my body to wake up like my arms </connor>
<connor> and my legs like my whole body wasn't </connor>
<joey> listening yeah i'll see your eyes were </joey>
<joey> closed because when i had sleep palaces </joey>
<connor> my eyes were open oh my eyes were closed </connor>
<joey> and i i could feel i was well aware that </joey>
<joey> i was awake and i was aware of </joey>
<joey> everything that was going on around me </joey>
<joey> yeah but i couldn't like it just took a </joey>
<joey> moment and i felt like there was a </joey>
<connor> battle when i was like telling myself to </connor>
<connor> wake up it like wasn't doing it like i'm </connor>
<connor> pulling a chainsaw cord you know yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah she's like i could feel that i was </connor>
<connor> trying to get through and it wasn't </connor>
<connor> happening i didn't understand why </connor>
<joey> eventually i woke up for me it was so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] because like i remember i clearly </joey>
<connor> just remember opening my eyes looking </connor>
<connor> around i was like five in the morning i </connor>
<connor> saw the clock you know you could you </connor>
<connor> could you were looking </connor>
<connor> your eyes were moving around i was </connor>
<connor> literally i was darting my eyes around </connor>
<joey> and i'm like why can i not talk or hear </joey>
<connor> anything or move my body yeah oh sorry i </connor>
<connor> couldn't hear anything i couldn't hear </connor>
<joey> anything either i couldn't hear anything </joey>
<joey> i tried to like open my mouth to say </joey>
<joey> something and my mouth just wouldn't see </joey>
<connor> this is one of those things where i feel </connor>
<joey> like it's definitely the mind like this </joey>
<connor> is like a like a [ __ ] a glitch yeah </connor>
<joey> what what what the [ __ ] else do you </joey>
<joey> think it is the demons but like this is </joey>
<connor> why i think when he's like it's a </connor>
<connor> chemical i'm like i don't know there so </connor>
<connor> to me it just sounds like a a neuron </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up in your head that's like really </connor>
<connor> like you hear that </connor>
<connor> so it's just like restarting like it's </connor>
<garnt> like trying to figure out so what </garnt>
<garnt> happened did you go back to sleep after </garnt>
<joey> your sleep players no no i woke up after </joey>
<connor> like 15-10 minutes yeah oh i went back </connor>
<joey> to sleep oh i because this was like i'd </joey>
<joey> had a full sleep and i was waking up and </joey>
<joey> i and i woke up and i just couldn't move </joey>
<joey> my arms or legs for a little bit it </joey>
<joey> wasn't like a </joey>
<joey> it wasn't like i was trying to move in </joey>
<joey> it wasn't moving like i couldn't even </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> like figure out how to move it right </connor>
<garnt> really strange i don't understand how </garnt>
<garnt> this worked so i remember the one time i </garnt>
<joey> got sleep paralysis and i literally saw </joey>
<connor> her sleep paralysis </connor>
<connor> what did it look like okay so i i called </connor>
<connor> it a sleep paralysis demon it just </connor>
<connor> looked like a ghost so what happened is </connor>
<connor> like uh so i was sleeping on my bed </connor>
<connor> and then like i like i remember like not </connor>
<connor> waking up immediately but yeah i </connor>
<connor> remember just like opening up my eyes a </connor>
<connor> bit and seeing like this kind of like </connor>
<connor> ghostly figure i was like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> is that immediate like immediately i </connor>
<connor> like punch my eyes open and like i see </connor>
<connor> like this female figure like kind of </connor>
<connor> like praying above me or something </connor>
<joey> no but it was literally like this this </joey>
<joey> uh this like looked like a nun or </joey>
<joey> something that was just like praying </joey>
<connor> like above me and i start like freaking </connor>
<connor> out because i'm just like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> there is a literal ghost floating above </connor>
<connor> me right now right right how old are you </connor>
<connor> i was around 24 okay yeah so it was i </connor>
<connor> wasn't young i was uh yeah </connor>
<connor> around 24. and i remember i remember </connor>
<connor> like i said i'm like i remember my mind </connor>
<joey> going into fight or flight mode just </joey>
<joey> like just like i was i started panicking </joey>
<joey> because obviously if you see like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ghosts floating above you you </joey>
<joey> start [ __ ] panicking so i like try to </joey>
<joey> start like moving my [ __ ] body to </joey>
<joey> like like do something and i remember my </joey>
<joey> body just would not move and it was like </joey>
<joey> it was [ __ ] it was a terrifying </joey>
<garnt> experience right strange yeah it was it </garnt>
<garnt> was a terrifying [ __ ] experience and </garnt>
<garnt> i remember it took me about like 10 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes 10 to 15 minutes of me like </garnt>
<garnt> screaming at my body it's like just like </garnt>
<joey> ah gone move move you're gonna die </joey>
<joey> you're gonna die you're gonna die now </joey>
<garnt> that sounds like a dream it could it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't a dream because like it felt like </garnt>
<garnt> no because like it felt like a dream and </garnt>
<garnt> not like a dream at the same time right </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> i was obviously in my room but like </garnt>
<garnt> after about 10-15 minutes i actually </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> finally was just like able to will my </joey>
<joey> body to like just like sit up yeah i </joey>
<joey> remember i immediately sat up i looked </joey>
<joey> up and i could see like the the figure </joey>
<joey> just like literally fading away as i sat </joey>
<joey> up </joey>
<joey> it was like super super like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> surreal so that's that's why i'm just </joey>
<joey> like oh that was at the [ __ ] sleep </joey>
<garnt> paralysis even that everyone [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> memes about you mean that thing actually </garnt>
<garnt> exists what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> that's so weird oh that was like some </joey>
<garnt> persona [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it was just my stance </garnt>
<joey> i don't know man you just lost your </joey>
<joey> standing </joey>
<connor> another question when you dream </connor>
<connor> do you see like visually see your </connor>
<connor> surroundings this exact same way because </connor>
<connor> i don't like i mean like when i'm okay </connor>
<connor> like i'm seeing this right now right i'm </connor>
<joey> seeing like the the real world in like i </joey>
<joey> don't it's it's like way fuzzier when i </joey>
<joey> see my dreams like i let's say i know </joey>
<joey> there's a table there yeah but i can't </joey>
<joey> like give you the detail of it like i </joey>
<joey> can i can </joey>
<joey> i know what everything is around me yeah </joey>
<joey> i know everything's around me but i </joey>
<connor> can't like visually see everything </connor>
<garnt> that's happening really strange do you </garnt>
<garnt> have this as well no mine's mine's in </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] rtx on 4k </joey>
<joey> 60 fps why is it like a fisheye lens </joey>
<connor> that's that's why like for me that's </connor>
<connor> like like for me sometimes it's like so </connor>
<connor> hard for me to tell the difference </connor>
<connor> between when i'm dreaming and when i'm </connor>
<connor> awake because my dreams are so vivid and </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> i don't know like i said they have a lot </connor>
<connor> of depth to them that sometimes i wake </connor>
<connor> up and </connor>
<connor> sometimes i immediately know that i've </connor>
<connor> just woken up and sometimes it takes me </connor>
<connor> a few </connor>
<connor> few moments to realize okay i'm i'm </connor>
<garnt> actually awake now this is the real </garnt>
<garnt> world i'm not i'm not in the dream world </garnt>
<joey> anymore i think for me things that are </joey>
<joey> fuzzy is things that don't exist in </joey>
<connor> reality huh so it's like like if it's </connor>
<connor> like a table for instance then it's like </connor>
<joey> i can clearly see that it's a table but </joey>
<joey> if it's like a [ __ ] fairy then i'll </joey>
<joey> be then then it'll probably look fuzzy </joey>
<connor> well you know when you're you're trying </connor>
<connor> to remember a moment that happened yeah </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> you have a picture of it in your head </connor>
<connor> you don't have it like in 4k rtx the way </connor>
<connor> that you saw it right it's not this kind </connor>
<connor> of fuzzy </connor>
<joey> you remember where everything was you </joey>
<joey> think you you know what i mean yeah like </joey>
<joey> the way that you recall things that </joey>
<joey> happened it's kind of like that the way </joey>
<joey> i see stuff in dreams it's like i don't </joey>
<connor> see it perfectly like if i'm focusing on </connor>
<connor> like this table yeah i know god's there </connor>
<connor> for example but i can't like see gone </connor>
<connor> does that make sense </connor>
<connor> i know i'm aware that are there in the </connor>
<garnt> dream i don't see them unless i'm then </garnt>
<garnt> paying attention to them </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because then your brain has to </garnt>
<connor> render out right it's rendering </connor>
<joey> because because you know it's there but </joey>
<joey> like your brain's just like i didn't </joey>
<joey> want to render us out </joey>
<joey> i know that god's there i just don't </joey>
<garnt> want to render it now you're going to </garnt>
<connor> upgrade your brain's graphics </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> now right i don't need to see that joe's </connor>
<connor> in the corner of my eye yeah because </connor>
<connor> it's in the corner of my heart but when </connor>
<joey> i'm trying to remember the whole picture </joey>
<joey> in my head when i'm in the dream it's </joey>
<joey> like that yeah </joey>
<garnt> rendering right right it's like a 1060 </garnt>
<garnt> what's going on my draw distance is like </garnt>
<garnt> lowest possible </garnt>
<connor> like when i'm walking up to the building </connor>
<connor> it starts to come in a frame it's like </connor>
<joey> it's it's a load of [ __ ] a weird [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dream what a weird [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's like that though where like i the </joey>
<connor> dream doesn't exist unless i'm focusing </connor>
<garnt> on it in the dream so have you ever had </garnt>
<garnt> a dream that's taken place in somewhere </garnt>
<garnt> that you're like very familiar with or </garnt>
<joey> like somewhere like you know all of my </joey>
<joey> dreams are in places that i've been to </joey>
<connor> in real life right see most of most of </connor>
<connor> the time my dreams are in new places </connor>
<connor> that i'm not aware of </connor>
<joey> i don't know what it is i think my brain </joey>
<joey> is like </joey>
<joey> capable of coming up with new locations </joey>
<connor> what i think it is i think it's like </connor>
<joey> stitching together things that i've seen </joey>
<joey> passing right yeah yeah yeah and and </joey>
<joey> what i </joey>
<joey> you know like i can i can't </joey>
<connor> visualize a lot of things but i i just </connor>
<connor> know what's happening and i have an idea </connor>
<joey> it's really strange a lot of my dreams </joey>
<joey> are in my house they take place in my </joey>
<connor> house that's strange i never have dreams </connor>
<connor> in my house </connor>
<connor> but it's like all sorts of [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] happens </joey>
<connor> in my house that shouldn't work which </connor>
<joey> house like the house that i'm currently </joey>
<connor> in the </connor>
<connor> when your house start right i'm sure </connor>
<connor> it's not credit sequence </connor>
<connor> shot to door joey opens up hey guys you </connor>
<connor> know like where do you just wake the </connor>
<connor> dream it's like game start you just wait </connor>
<connor> you just like it starts in a weird ass </connor>
<connor> location and you're like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> is going on no it's always it's always </joey>
<garnt> mid-conversation </garnt>
<joey> yeah i never remember the story i'm just </joey>
<joey> like oh wait what oh oh i guess we're </joey>
<garnt> here now </garnt>
<garnt> because i i guess i already remember my </garnt>
<joey> dreams when i realized i'm in a dream so </joey>
<garnt> i never remember how i get there yeah </garnt>
<joey> you know i did so i don't see like the </joey>
<garnt> playstation </garnt>
<joey> it's just like oh i'm in the game i'm </joey>
<garnt> just like oh dreamcast starts brilliant </garnt>
<connor> it's almost weird because i feel i feel </connor>
<connor> like when i'm dreaming i'm watching like </connor>
<joey> a video and at some point in the video </joey>
<joey> i'll know that's me does that make sense </joey>
<joey> like it's a series of events unfolding </joey>
<garnt> yeah and i'm not necessarily constantly </garnt>
<connor> in that brain of the person experiencing </connor>
<garnt> it this is so strange right this is </garnt>
<garnt> really weird even even stranger question </garnt>
<joey> have you ever dreamed in third person </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah okay okay that to me is like </joey>
<joey> the weirdest [ __ ] dream because like </joey>
<connor> like for some reason in my dream it </connor>
<connor> makes sense that i'm seeing myself in </connor>
<connor> third person yeah right </connor>
<garnt> like for example like even though i've </garnt>
<connor> never experienced that in my life yeah </connor>
<connor> that prison one yeah it was weird </connor>
<connor> because i remember </connor>
<connor> that's just gonna start to be strange i </connor>
<connor> had i remember shooting the guns right </connor>
<connor> right but then i also remember watching </connor>
<connor> me </connor>
<joey> after shooting the guns </joey>
<joey> so it flicks between first and third </joey>
<connor> place and i i and and the weird thing is </connor>
<connor> is that i then was able to feel the </connor>
<garnt> emotions of both yeah when doing the </garnt>
<joey> dream act and then when watching me do </joey>
<garnt> the dream act yeah this is so this is so </garnt>
<garnt> strange i've never spoken about it i've </garnt>
<garnt> never spoken about this before you're </garnt>
<garnt> talking now that you're making me think </garnt>
<connor> about this i'm realizing how weird this </connor>
<connor> sounds to say out loud like this must </connor>
<connor> sound so bizarre i don't know if anyone </connor>
<joey> else is i don't think a dream </joey>
<garnt> conversation is going to be normal i've </garnt>
<garnt> never had a conversation just about my </garnt>
<connor> dreams before with anyone but like so </connor>
<connor> the best way i can describe how it is </connor>
<connor> like is like you know when you're like </connor>
<joey> in playing halo right yeah and there's </joey>
<connor> that theater mode where just any point </connor>
<joey> you can just unclip from the keyboard </joey>
<connor> like just but i'm not choosing where the </connor>
<connor> camera goes but i'm seeing it from a </connor>
<connor> perspective and i don't understand who's </connor>
<garnt> or what it is sometimes yeah sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes i have like amazing </garnt>
<garnt> cinematography </garnt>
<connor> and i don't know i don't know how like </connor>
<garnt> if only the youtube videos could match </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah right like i don't know i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know how it happens but sometimes </garnt>
<connor> i sometimes i'm in first person and then </connor>
<connor> i like i go to like a new a new like an </connor>
<connor> area or something and i have this this </connor>
<connor> really </connor>
<connor> area </connor>
<connor> a new area on the map or something and </connor>
<joey> i'm like my dream switches to like this </joey>
<connor> establishing shot of this like new this </connor>
<joey> new landscape and i'm in i know </joey>
<connor> and i'm just like i don't know and i </connor>
<connor> remember thinking in the dream damn that </connor>
<garnt> looks cool as [ __ ] and then i load back </garnt>
<garnt> into my character or something </garnt>
<garnt> it's so i i don't know how to describe </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> your dream has cut scenes is that what </joey>
<joey> you're saying </joey>
<joey> this man's journey literally has </joey>
<joey> cutscenes and when it's over he goes </joey>
<garnt> back into first person </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<joey> holy [ __ ] it's it's so it's i don't know </joey>
<joey> why like i think sometimes i dream in </joey>
<joey> games you dream sound like a kojima game </joey>
<joey> yeah sometimes i dream in games and </joey>
<joey> sometimes i dream in movies which is why </joey>
<joey> like it never makes sense to me how i </joey>
<garnt> can possibly dream in third person and </garnt>
<garnt> like at the time it makes sense because </garnt>
<joey> like you never see yourself in third </joey>
<joey> person my third person do you mean like </joey>
<joey> like in a movie like from a movie camera </joey>
<joey> standpoint or are we talking like gta </joey>
<joey> like behind yourself sometimes both </joey>
<connor> really yeah yeah yeah so yeah i think </connor>
<joey> it's </joey>
<connor> it's weird really because again i know </connor>
<connor> that i'm in this situation and i fully </connor>
<connor> understand that it's a dream but i never </connor>
<joey> ever like think that like this is wrong </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah because i'm in the moment and </joey>
<garnt> it's what my mind is making up so it </garnt>
<connor> always feels natural </connor>
<garnt> when i'm in this dream like for some </garnt>
<connor> reason i'm just [ __ ] remember this </connor>
<connor> now like talk to you guys </connor>
<connor> every time i'm in an interrogation room </connor>
<joey> i'm never like po it's never pov </joey>
<joey> interrogation room it's always </joey>
<joey> interrogation </joey>
<joey> it's always side view like this is </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] jcs criminal investigations or </joey>
<joey> something it's so it's so weird i don't </joey>
<joey> know why i mean like i do every anytime </joey>
<joey> i have a conversation in an </joey>
<joey> interrogation room i'm always in third </joey>
<garnt> person i don't know why but </garnt>
<joey> it always feels like i'm in control </joey>
<joey> of what i'm saying i'm sure that's </joey>
<joey> purely because we've just like consumed </joey>
<joey> media that where they portray those </joey>
<connor> things like that right so yeah yeah i'd </connor>
<joey> be interested to see </joey>
<joey> if another person who has never seen </joey>
<joey> like an interrogation scene in a movie </joey>
<connor> how they would because i've never been </connor>
<garnt> in an interrogation in my life so that's </garnt>
<connor> i guess it </connor>
<connor> kind of makes sense i i've also found </connor>
<connor> that if i'm highly anxious about </connor>
<connor> something when going to bed there's like </connor>
<connor> a 90 chance my dream is going to be </connor>
<garnt> about that oh </garnt>
<connor> that's only ever happened a few times </connor>
<garnt> and that's only ever happened with </garnt>
<joey> homework and exams </joey>
<connor> i was playing that uh pogo stock game </connor>
<joey> recently yeah and um did it give you </joey>
<connor> nightmares and i yeah i had like </connor>
<connor> nightmares that i was stuck in this game </connor>
<connor> and that i couldn't stop playing this </connor>
<connor> game because i couldn't beat it because </connor>
<connor> i was making i played it for like eight </connor>
<connor> hours and i made no progress </connor>
<connor> and then i went to bed all i could feel </connor>
<connor> was me playing the game in the dream and </connor>
<connor> then i was playing it and i was like i </connor>
<connor> couldn't get out it's horrible </connor>
<connor> that was nice </connor>
<garnt> that was a horrible night </garnt>
<garnt> that that's a scarier nightmare than uh </garnt>
<connor> you dying yeah the worst part was i knew </connor>
<connor> i was in a nightmare and i was getting </connor>
<connor> more annoyed because like why am i </connor>
<connor> wasting time where i could be actually </connor>
<connor> doing this but instead i'm in the </connor>
<connor> nightmare </connor>
<connor> stuck in a cycle playing in my </connor>
<garnt> nightmares </garnt>
<garnt> do you ever have like moments where your </garnt>
<garnt> dream is so intense that you don't feel </garnt>
<garnt> like you've slept at all </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> like i wake up more tired yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> i've never had that yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes because you go on such an </garnt>
<garnt> emotional journey in this dream or at </garnt>
<garnt> least i do that i wake up just like </garnt>
<garnt> exhausted so what do you do then just </garnt>
<garnt> get another eight hours huh i i don't i </garnt>
<garnt> like i get up but like i get up but like </garnt>
<garnt> my sometimes i just like feel like i </garnt>
<garnt> haven't slept at all just because i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i was awake in my dreams so i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't really sleep at all i don't know </garnt>
<joey> it's it's it's really weird yeah like </joey>
<joey> the worst nightmares i've had is i go to </joey>
<garnt> sleep obviously tired and i'm probably </garnt>
<garnt> not in like a right state of mind yeah </garnt>
<garnt> before i go to bed hence the reason why </garnt>
<garnt> i have the nightmare and then i have </garnt>
<connor> that nightmare i wake up in that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> cold sweat like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you're so tired after that but i </connor>
<connor> don't want to go back to bed </connor>
<joey> because i know if i close my eyes right </joey>
<joey> now it's just going to be like to be </joey>
<joey> continued like it's just going to happen </joey>
<garnt> again </garnt>
<joey> where you have a fun dream you can never </joey>
<joey> get back into the dream yeah when you </joey>
<joey> have a nightmare nightmares </joey>
<garnt> when you have a nightmare you go back to </garnt>
<connor> sleep you re-enter the nightmare i think </connor>
<connor> it's like probably stress and stuff </connor>
<joey> right like it's probably </joey>
<joey> behind the tree like like freddie's like </joey>
<joey> hey guys </joey>
<joey> oh you're sleeping again nice yeah i </joey>

<joey> on the dream topic uh do you guys sleep </joey>
<joey> talk </joey>
<connor> yeah i should talk </connor>
<joey> really don't think i said generally just </joey>
<connor> this is going to sound terrible i just </connor>
<joey> screams </joey>
<garnt> are you serious i like shouting probably </garnt>
<garnt> it's probably every time you die right </garnt>
<connor> oh he died you've been around me right </connor>
<joey> while i've sleep talked right </joey>
<joey> um you don't i've never heard you sleep </joey>
<joey> talk i've heard you snore very heavily </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> like i don't know if you're screaming or </joey>
<garnt> it's just a little </garnt>
<connor> snoring or if it was crisp and snoring </connor>
<connor> like that </connor>
<garnt> like not that loud </garnt>
<garnt> really did was did you ever like sleep </garnt>
<garnt> talk during when you did your sabbath on </garnt>
<garnt> and you slept on stream is there like i </garnt>
<garnt> muted the mic </garnt>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> damn just in case i was fighting that </connor>
<connor> dragon that could only be defeated by </connor>
<joey> racism yeah </joey>
<garnt> i i only asked because aki has recently </garnt>
<garnt> started sleep talking like a lot yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like kind of concerned because </garnt>
<garnt> uh sh by sleep talk she randomly shouts </garnt>
<garnt> out phrases that just don't make sense </garnt>
<joey> when you think about it in a sequential </joey>
<joey> manner like i remember she's like cause </joey>
<joey> ugg is the kind of person who like </joey>
<joey> literally head touches the pillow three </joey>
<joey> seconds later she's snoring right like </joey>
<joey> instantly like that which i'm so [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> jealous of but then now it's gotten to </joey>
<joey> the point where like </joey>
<joey> three seconds after the head hits the </joey>
<connor> pillow start snoring five seconds later </connor>
<connor> she says a random thing </connor>
<connor> and like i thought the first time she </connor>
<connor> did it i thought she was joking right </connor>
<connor> because it happened in the span of like </connor>
<connor> 10 seconds so i just started laughing </connor>
<joey> like i think i remember her like like </joey>
<joey> she's like all right good night goes to </joey>
<joey> sleep starts snoring and then she just </joey>
<joey> goes </joey>
<joey> legs </joey>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> i was like maybe maybe she's like </connor>
<joey> and then and then and then i started </joey>
<joey> laughing and i was like come on sweetie </joey>
<joey> what are you doing but she continues to </joey>
<joey> snore and i was like wait are you are </joey>
<joey> you serious and then she goes </joey>
<joey> butt fries </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> and so i had to shake her awake i was </joey>
<joey> like are you are you [ __ ] with me </joey>
<joey> right now </joey>
<joey> and she wakes up and she's like </joey>
<joey> what time is it i was like it's been 20 </joey>
<joey> seconds what are you on </joey>
<joey> because in her head it's like an hour </joey>
<connor> has passed or something yeah yeah that's </connor>
<connor> weird again like whenever i sleep i </connor>
<connor> always know how much time has passed </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't understand how yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> sydney has a lot of nightmares um when </garnt>
<garnt> she sleeps and like i can i i know when </garnt>
<garnt> she's going through a nightmare because </garnt>
<garnt> she's she's just in panic mode like i </garnt>
<garnt> can tell when she's running away from a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] monster because she's like </garnt>
<connor> i don't know because like i know when </connor>
<connor> that happens i have to wake her up and </connor>
<garnt> be like you're in a nightmare honey </garnt>
<garnt> don't worry don't worry it's all so </garnt>
<garnt> you're in the safe zone i'm here i mean </garnt>
<joey> is she like is she like when a dog has </joey>
<joey> like a dream of running and they're just </joey>
<joey> like stuck in place yes </joey>
<garnt> she it's so it's so obvious it's so </garnt>
<joey> obvious not only like when sydney's </joey>
<joey> dreaming but like the type of dream </joey>
<joey> she's having yeah because she won't say </joey>
<joey> words but she'll make noises depending </joey>
<joey> on the type of mood that she's in right </joey>
<joey> so if she's like having a nightmare </joey>
<joey> which is like most the time she she'll </joey>
<joey> like she'll like start like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> panicking she'll have like a panic </joey>
<joey> attack in her dreams and all this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> kind of [ __ ] when she's like happy </joey>
<joey> she'll just like laugh and just smile </joey>
<joey> and all this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like it's it's so obvious to say like </joey>
<joey> sometimes i i see her and she's just </joey>
<garnt> like has like the biggest smile on her </garnt>
<garnt> face i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> i wish i was you right now sydney </garnt>
<garnt> because you're having a [ __ ] fun </garnt>
<joey> dream right now i don't know why i don't </joey>

<joey> really bad sleepwalker and sleep talker </joey>
<connor> like my dad would tell me stories of how </connor>
<connor> my uncle they because they they used to </connor>
<connor> sleep in like a bunch so bizarre isn't </connor>
<connor> it like it's such a crazy thing yeah and </connor>
<connor> he just like there was one time where </connor>
<connor> actually no i've i have a story of when </connor>
<connor> i sleep walked once uh yeah the only </connor>
<connor> time apparently that i ever sleepwalked </connor>
<connor> was when i was little like i was like </connor>
<connor> maybe four or five years old right and </connor>
<connor> apparently i walked into my parents room </connor>
<connor> and i was asleep and my mom saw her she </connor>
<connor> was like what the [ __ ] are you doing and </connor>
<connor> then she realized that i was my eyes </connor>
<connor> were closed and she was like oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> he's sleepwalking and i was saying </connor>
<connor> something to her but like it wasn't </connor>
<connor> really words i was kind of just like </connor>
<connor> woke up </connor>
<joey> and then the moment no the moment she </joey>
<joey> went wake up you dumb [ __ ] was when i </joey>
<joey> walked over to the corner of their room </joey>
<joey> and there was like a washing basket and </joey>
<connor> apparently i pulled my pants down into </connor>
<connor> it that's so weird okay okay </connor>
<connor> and then my mom was like </connor>

<connor> and uh our house the floorboards creak </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] loudly yeah right and </connor>
<connor> obviously i've been in this house for </connor>
<connor> years so i could tell based off what </connor>
<connor> creek where someone was in the house and </connor>
<connor> where they were coming from </connor>
<connor> like and and what point they were on the </connor>
<joey> stairs what point they were like some </joey>
<joey> kind of [ __ ] daredevil [ __ ] except </joey>

<joey> the stairs and then i was getting </joey>
<joey> worried because i'm like what if he just </joey>
<joey> like falls down yeah yeah that's </joey>
<joey> dangerous so he just starts walking down </joey>
<connor> the stairs really slowly right and this </connor>
<connor> is where i was like what do i do because </connor>
<connor> i didn't know what you're supposed to do </connor>
<connor> when someone sleep walking yeah i've </connor>
<connor> heard loads of you've heard like myths </connor>
<connor> if you wake them up they can die yeah </connor>
<joey> you know so i was like </joey>
<connor> it seems like he's doing it okay i </connor>

<joey> and he's going down the stairs really </joey>
<joey> slowly and he gets to the bottom of the </joey>
<joey> stairs and so i go but i go to the </joey>
<joey> bottom of the stairs </joey>
<joey> and then he opens the door to the living </joey>
<joey> room and goes in the living room this is </joey>

<connor> [ __ ] was going on and so he's he's </connor>
<connor> standing there in the middle of this </connor>
<connor> living room and then just slowly starts </connor>
<connor> like walking towards the tv and then </connor>
<garnt> walking back to where he was then he </garnt>
<garnt> walks to the tv </garnt>
<garnt> and there's my video games all there </garnt>
<garnt> like in those one of those old 2000s </garnt>
<garnt> metal yeah </garnt>

<connor> and then he just </connor>
<connor> starts pulling down his pants and then i </connor>
<connor> was like no no no </connor>
<connor> it's like not on my games </connor>
<connor> and that's where i woke him up and i was </connor>
<connor> like no no no no and then he woke up and </connor>
<connor> said well what what like that like it </connor>
<connor> was really weird how did he react to him </connor>
<garnt> just like stan he acted like i was the </garnt>
<connor> weirdo </connor>
<connor> i remember that i remember being like </connor>
<connor> what </connor>
<connor> he reacted like i was being weird like </connor>
<connor> because i was like stop stop like </connor>
<joey> shaking him you know i wasn't exactly </joey>
<joey> the same as well like my parents were </joey>
<joey> like what the [ __ ] are you doing and i'm </joey>
<connor> like what do you mean what the [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i look down on my pants </joey>
<connor> okay that makes sense </connor>
<connor> but he was undoing now and that's where </connor>
<joey> i was like you're not pissing on my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ps2 </joey>
<joey> my pants like fully down my hand was on </joey>
<joey> my dick and i was like i was like ready </joey>
<joey> so when you woke up did you momentarily </joey>
<connor> think like they were the weirdos yeah </connor>
<joey> okay see that's okay i was like i was </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> because i looked over and my mom was </joey>
<joey> like really worried </joey>
<connor> i didn't even really know this kid i </connor>
<connor> barely knew him so i was like we never </connor>
<connor> really like whenever i saw him it was </connor>
<connor> always awkward after that because he </connor>
<connor> just always remembered that time where </connor>
<garnt> he woke up and i was like what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> he always pissed on your games yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> based on my ps2 collection my my wii </connor>
<connor> probably i don't know what it is </connor>
<garnt> did you ever get the point where like </garnt>
<garnt> there's something happening </garnt>
<garnt> in like in like um in the real world </garnt>
<garnt> where like you hear a sound or something </garnt>
<garnt> or like you need to go through the </garnt>
<garnt> toilet and it gets like integrated into </garnt>
<joey> your dream for like a good while uh </joey>
<joey> i don't know if maybe but i probably </joey>
<garnt> don't remember it like like </garnt>
<garnt> the most annoying thing for me is is </garnt>
<garnt> when i need to go to the toilet in my </garnt>
<garnt> dream because i don't immediately wake </garnt>
<connor> up yeah when i go to the toilet i want </connor>
<connor> to need to go to the toilet but like </connor>
<connor> luckily they're luckily my brain has a </connor>
<joey> disconnect between my body and my brain </joey>
<connor> because there has been several times </connor>
<connor> right where i've really really needed </connor>
<connor> there's been several times where i've </connor>
<connor> really really needed to piss and like in </connor>
<connor> my dream i don't know i'm dreaming but i </connor>
<connor> acknowledge the fact that i really </connor>
<connor> really need to piss right so yeah i've </connor>
<connor> had several like five minute pisses in </connor>
<connor> my dreams and the and the feeling of the </connor>
<connor> piss just won't go away because </connor>
<connor> obviously i'm only pissing in my dream </connor>
<garnt> and not in real life so i'm like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm like urinating and i'm like i </garnt>
<garnt> get so frustrated in my dream because no </garnt>
<garnt> matter how much i urinate the feeling of </garnt>
<connor> needing needing to urinate never goes </connor>
<connor> away that's really weird yeah if i feel </connor>
<connor> something if i if i piss myself in my </connor>
<connor> dream i'm pissing myself from yeah i'm </connor>
<joey> just like that's that's how i'm </joey>
<joey> appreciating happening i almost [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> myself doing that one </connor>
<connor> how can you replicate the feeling of </connor>
<joey> pissing so accurately in the dream yeah </joey>
<joey> without without actually pissing yeah </joey>
<connor> that's i can't replicate </connor>
<connor> feelings </connor>
<connor> i know that it's not accurate in the </connor>
<connor> dream </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah when i get when i get punched </connor>
<garnt> in a dream it doesn't feel like a real </garnt>
<garnt> punch i can distinguish between that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah okay no i like </garnt>
<garnt> for me it's so short for me you must be </garnt>
<connor> able to </connor>
<connor> inception fifth level dream yeah i'm not </connor>
<connor> getting this [ __ ] what are you </connor>
<connor> experiencing </connor>
<connor> i'm like i i i i i'm like that i'm like </connor>
<connor> so what </connor>
<connor> i'm like five level deep holy five </connor>
<connor> levels </connor>
<connor> i'm like i'm like in front of this </connor>
<connor> urinal pissing and i'm just like why is </connor>
<garnt> the feeling of urinating not going away </garnt>
<joey> holy [ __ ] why why am i pissed is there </joey>
<joey> an establishment of the toilet as well </joey>
<joey> before you start you're like level 10 </joey>
<connor> dreaming i'm a level two this is insane </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't know and it's like i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> at some point in the dream i just give </connor>
<connor> up on trying to get rid of this </connor>
<connor> urination i go on with a dream and then </connor>
<connor> i wake up and being like </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> that's why i needed to piss because it </connor>
<connor> was a dream and i need to piss in real </connor>
<joey> life and you hadn't pissed your pants no </joey>
<connor> i hadn't pissed my pants and then okay </connor>
<garnt> and i have like the most satisfying piss </garnt>
<joey> in my life because like yeah because for </joey>
<joey> me like every time i've had a dream when </joey>
<joey> i was a kid of going to the toilet i </joey>
<connor> have 100 pissed my pants </connor>

<connor> and you know because of that one time i </connor>
<joey> was [ __ ] myself while i was asleep </joey>
<connor> here's the problem of uh growing up with </connor>
<connor> a bidet your whole life </connor>
<connor> and uh with this heated toilet seat is </connor>
<joey> the fact that it's just as a kid you're </joey>
<joey> just ingrained into your head of war oh </joey>
<joey> my butt is warm i'm sitting on a toilet </joey>
<joey> so in my dream i'm on the toilet and i </joey>
<joey> can feel that my butt is warm right </joey>
<joey> because it's a heated toilet seat yeah </joey>
