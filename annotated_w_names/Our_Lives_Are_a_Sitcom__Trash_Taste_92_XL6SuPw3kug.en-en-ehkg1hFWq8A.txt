<joey> - I look completely different. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Just wanted to </joey>
<joey> point that out. </joey>
<joey> I know we like brushed
over that, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> Friendship with Joey
the Anime Man has ended. </joey>
<joey> I'm Josh the Manga Lad now. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, you look
like the hacker character </connor>
<connor> in the movie that doesn't wanna explain </connor>
<connor> how the hacking works. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> (mellow music) </connor>
<connor> - Am I going crazy or has
the internet gotten the worst </connor>
<connor> in the past five years? </connor>
<connor> Am I crazy? </connor>
<connor> - I don't think you're crazy at all. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like it's gotten
significantly worse. </connor>
<connor> Not the whole internet, but the way, </connor>
<connor> as in the level of fucked up shit that's, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Maybe there was, there was
a lot of messed up stuff </joey>
<joey> five, six years ago or whatever. </joey>
<connor> But I feel like now, it's
all just out there now. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like its,
- It's just so normal. </connor>
<joey> - It's so interesting how
it's almost an opposite effect </joey>
<connor> that's happening. </connor>
<connor> Somehow, for some reason,
even though the internet, </connor>
<connor> or the internet culture
and people on the internet </connor>
<connor> in the past five, six years, </connor>
<connor> have gotten more PC than ever before, </connor>
<connor> and yet, almost counterintuitively, </connor>
<connor> there's more fucked up
shit that has like come out </connor>
<connor> onto the surface as well. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why,
- In like retaliation, maybe? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, the more you go PC,
the more that these people- </connor>
<joey> - Because like I see shit
now on regular Twitter </joey>
<connor> and Instagram that you'd only ever find </connor>
<connor> on the fuckin' /b/ board. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird, man,
'cause you're just like, </connor>
<connor> am I weird for being middle
ground on everything? </connor>
<joey> Like I feel like I have very
normal opinions on things </joey>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But the more I'm online, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> am I not normal? </joey>
<connor> Do I have not normal opinions? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, what is a normal opinion anymore? </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just being, I feel like being fair. </connor>
<connor> I don't really have heavy opinions on, </connor>
<connor> well, I see other people,
I'm like oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Common sense has definitely
become less common. </joey>
<connor> That's for sure. </connor>
<joey> - I know, it's weird. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what's
common sense anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it does feel
like is this the point </garnt>
<garnt> where the older generation
starts shit-talking </garnt>
<joey> the newer generation? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Like these damn kids! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause did you ever think like- </joey>
<connor> - No, I think it's the opposite. </connor>
<connor> I think it's because the
internet in general has become </connor>
<connor> more accessible to every age group </connor>
<connor> that we're seeing all of this.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause before it was just 20 year olds </connor>
<connor> who gave enough fucks to go on- </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Like social media or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I felt that it was
a very exciting time, </joey>
<joey> and everyone was really into it, </joey>
<joey> and new websites popped up. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] The new hip thing. </joey>
<joey> - Miniclip was still thriving, </joey>
<joey> you know.
- Ah, rest in peace. </joey>
<joey> - FarmVille was still going strong. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Mafia City. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna keep naming. </connor>
<garnt> - The good old days, man, </garnt>
<garnt> the good old days.
- But you know, </garnt>
<connor> I feel like now, because
it's become so normalized </connor>
<connor> and everyone uses it. </connor>
<garnt> Everyone, right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like do you remember a
point where it felt like </garnt>
<joey> there was a separation between
what you did on the internet </joey>
<joey> and what happened in real life? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like when that
barrier kind of got broken, </joey>
<joey> where you felt like what happened </joey>
<joey> in the internet was pertaining
to your active, your, </joey>
<connor> How can I say this? </connor>
<connor> Because internet is real life, </connor>
<connor> but it didn't feel so suffocating. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, it didn't feel
like it had a tangible effect </joey>
<joey> on your day to day life. </joey>
<joey> But now it feels like whatever's
going on in the internet, </joey>
<garnt> whatever's going on in the
world, has this tangible effect, </garnt>
<garnt> this tangible effect
on what's going on in, </garnt>
<garnt> what you're doing in your life. </garnt>
<joey> - You literally just explained the plot </joey>
<joey> to "Serial Experiments Lain." </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I kinda am, aren't I. </joey>
<joey> - That's literally what that is. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, so what's the
time you think it is? </joey>
<joey> I'm curious if you have
the same opinion on this. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - You said the time when
it felt like that became. </connor>
<garnt> - The time when it felt
it became like that? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know.
- I feel it depends </joey>
<joey> on how long you've been on the internet. </joey>
<joey> Right?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Did you ever do like MySpace? </joey>
<connor> - No, I came right after MySpace. </connor>
<joey> - Did you do MySpace?
- No. </joey>
<joey> - Did you have Bebo? </joey>
<joey> - I had Bebo.
- I did not. </joey>
<joey> - That was very popular in the UK. </joey>
<connor> - Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Would you say, so the
Bebo and MySpace era, right? </connor>
<connor> So, roughly the same time I would say. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> When you were on Bebo </connor>
<connor> and when people on
MySpace were on MySpace, </connor>
<joey> did you see that as this
is me, completely tangible </joey>
<connor> to real life?
- No, it was a game. </connor>
<joey> Social media's a game. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like how I go into Sims, </joey>
<joey> and I make myself look attractive in Sims. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause like that's
how I kind of treated MySpace </joey>
<connor> as well at the time.
- It's a game. </connor>
<garnt> Right? It's like a
- A way to up those </garnt>
<joey> social game.
serotonin points. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I think the
first time I really thought </joey>
<connor> of social media as a game was actually, </connor>
<connor> So Charlie Brooker, </connor>
<connor> do you know Charlie Brooker? </connor>
<connor> He wrote Black Mirror. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So a few years ago, or
maybe even a decade ago, </connor>
<connor> I can't even remember
how old this video is, </connor>
<connor> he did a Top 50 most
influential games of all time, </connor>
<connor> and number one was Twitter. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I was like what are you
talking about Charlie Brooker? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause before that he talked about, </joey>
<joey> you know, games like fucking
- That's not a game. </joey>
<joey> "Last of Us", </joey>
<joey> fucking "Tetris,"
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> you know, all these games. </connor>
<connor> And he was just like, </connor>
<connor> well, think about it. </connor>
<connor> You play as an avatar
on an online platform </connor>
<connor> where you gain points for
interacting with the game. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, yeah, </connor>
<joey> I mean, he's very right. </joey>
<joey> He's, social media at
this point is a game, </joey>
<joey> and we are all, the game now is our job. </joey>
<joey> You know, it is our job 'cause- </joey>
<joey> - We've fallen right into the system. </joey>
<joey> - We are part of the system guys. </joey>
<joey> - Dammit. </joey>
<joey> - We can't criticize the system
'cause we are the system. </joey>
<joey> - We are the system. </joey>
<joey> - We are part of the system. </joey>
<joey> But that is definitely how
social media has become. </joey>
<connor> And I mean in a way, I see,
especially YouTube and stuff, </connor>
<connor> as a kind of a game. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's been gamified to fuck. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, it is a game. </connor>
<connor> - You post a video, and it
even puts you on a leaderboard </connor>
<connor> on how well it's performed </connor>
<garnt> in the past 10 uploads you've done. </garnt>
<connor> - But the game, the stakes to
it are whatever you give it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Mm. </connor>
<connor> - You know, a game is, it's
the same with anything, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, fuckin'
"Jump King" whatever, </connor>
<connor> whatever it is. </connor>
<joey> - It's been zero days. </joey>
<joey> - The game only means
whatever you assign to it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> So with the videos, right? </connor>
<connor> If you are making these
videos for the purpose </connor>
<joey> of cracking that one out of 10, then yeah. </joey>
<joey> But, if you're just making the video </joey>
<joey> 'cause you want to make a video? </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't say it's game.
- I think when though, </joey>
<joey> yeah, when you get to that point, </joey>
<joey> it's like you're kind
of testing the limits </joey>
<joey> on what you can call a game, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, is the
stock market a game? </joey>
<connor> (Conner sputtering) </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah hmm. </joey>
<joey> A game that ruins your life.
- Some people say yes. </joey>
<connor> Some people say yes. Some people say no. </connor>
<connor> - It's roulette with extra steps. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's roulette with
massive repercussions. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's roulette where there's
a really, really boring option </connor>
<joey> that will probably pay you back, </joey>
<joey> or you can spin the wheel.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Spin the wheel.
- Spin the wheel. </connor>
<connor> - Ooh, Dogecoin. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You know, come on, I mean. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's like "Deal or No Deal"
but it's actually serious. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I felt like the, </joey>
<joey> I don't know when the
internet started to become </joey>
<joey> very, very real, if you will. </joey>
<joey> - Mm.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it definitely
jacked up to 100 at 2016. </joey>
<joey> I think that was when it definitely like- </joey>
<joey> - Why 2016? </joey>
<joey> - Presidential election. </joey>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<joey> - Trump's presidential election. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like that's
when it just went boom. </connor>
<connor> That's when the split went crazy. </connor>
<joey> I felt like the left leaning internet, </joey>
<joey> right leaning internet, </joey>
<joey> just went really full on. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like it was before that. </joey>
<joey> - I think it might be earlier, </joey>
<joey> and it's just that we
weren't really aware of it. </joey>
<joey> - You know what it was?
- That's what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> - I'm saying it might
not have started then, </joey>
<connor> but that's when the dial went fucking 500. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You know when it was? </joey>
<joey> It's when YouTube Rewind
started becoming shit. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, tell me your
theory, tell me your theory. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know because- </joey>
<joey> - What was that, like 2014?
- 2014 about. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay.
- I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just thinking back, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just thinking one YouTube Rewind- </garnt>
<connor> - As in when everything on the internet </connor>
<garnt> stopped being universally loved. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Basically when we start
like being segmented, </connor>
<garnt> I just tried to verbalize how
I felt, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<connor> kind of feels around the
same time that I stopped </connor>
<connor> giving a shit about YouTube Rewind. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So that kind of feels like
it was 2014, 2013 maybe. </joey>
<joey> - Something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Very early on, when the internet stopped </joey>
<joey> being one conglomeration, and
you'd see things happening, </joey>
<garnt> and you just didn't recognize
who this person was, </garnt>
<garnt> who that person was, </garnt>
<garnt> people stopped getting
along and, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> factions and groups started to form. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's why I took something </connor>
<connor> like the presidential election, </connor>
<joey> which is like the most televised
horse race in existence, </joey>
<joey> if you will.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like, it's so, </joey>
<joey> You know, other countries,
we don't, you know, the UK, </joey>
<joey> it's like, yeah, we have this whole thing </joey>
<joey> about who the new Prime
Minister is gonna be, </joey>
<joey> but we don't nearly make it
as exciting as America does. </joey>
<joey> America's so good at making hype. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like it was the perfect event </connor>
<connor> that was so polarizing
and so well telegraphed </connor>
<connor> with so much information
and so many parties </connor>
<connor> putting stuff into it,
- I think it- </connor>
<connor> regardless of your opinion on it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And who you voted for,
I don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> I'm just saying you can't ignore the fact </connor>
<joey> that this was a thing that
just really took the internet </joey>
<connor> and just fucking ran with it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think it's also
around the time, roughly, </joey>
<joey> when a lot of social media sites were, </joey>
<connor> where that kind of discussion
was just becoming more open. </connor>
<connor> Like that was roughly around the time </connor>
<connor> where Twitter increased
their character limit. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah that, right. </connor>
<connor> - So people could only
tweet about yay Obama won, </connor>
<joey> and that was it. </joey>
<joey> - Right?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And now it's like, let me
write a full fuckin' novel </joey>
<joey> about how I feel about
this presidential election. </joey>
<connor> - And then, you know, </connor>
<connor> after that is when the platform started </connor>
<joey> having to correct misinformation, </joey>
<joey> and that further caused more of a divide. </joey>
<joey> And then now there's
just different platforms </joey>
<connor> for different opposing views. </connor>
<connor> So now you don't even get
to hear the other side. </connor>
<connor> You're in a echo chamber. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like what
was so prevalent about </garnt>
<garnt> not just the presidential election, </garnt>
<garnt> but just that year in general, </garnt>
<garnt> was that it felt like that
was the real turning point </garnt>
<garnt> for where social media kind
of felt just like a TV show. </garnt>
<connor> It was like a part of
entertainment, right, where- </connor>
<connor> - Well, the presidential election </connor>
<garnt> is the best rated TV show of all time, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd probably say. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Everyone tunes in the
watch the next episode. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean like, it even
had like a buildup season, </connor>
<garnt> which was Brexit, right? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> We had like the mid-season- </joey>
<garnt> - Was that the pilot episode? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, that was the
mid-season twist, right? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> We had the mid-season twist </joey>
<garnt> and we're like, guys, this
show can't get any better. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no possible way
they can surprise me. </garnt>
<joey> Jokes on you. </joey>
<garnt> - You'll never expect what comes next. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Just fucking look, right? </connor>
<connor> Look at how they decide the nominee </connor>
<connor> for the presidential thing. </connor>
<connor> Look at that shit. </connor>
<joey> It's laid out like "Who
Wants to be a Millionaire." </joey>
<connor> Have you seen them all there?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> They're in this semicircle
with all this amazing </connor>
<connor> fucking TV show-esque "Britain's
Got Talent" background, </connor>
<connor> and they all take turns,
massive audience and shit. </connor>
<connor> What is this shit?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, what, who gives a shit? </connor>
<connor> Let the party pick, and then
we'll fucking decide who wins. </connor>
<connor> This whole thing is so
reality TV show-esque. </connor>
<garnt> It's so bizarre.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> When you sit down and you're
like, what am I watching? </garnt>
<connor> Like, this is fucked up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, okay, here's a question. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you think that people
cared about politics </garnt>
<garnt> as much before, and we
were just too ignorant, </garnt>
<garnt> because we were too young at the time? </garnt>
<garnt> Or do you think people care more now, </garnt>
<garnt> because of the prevalence of social media </garnt>
<garnt> and just so many people
verbalizing their opinions </garnt>
<garnt> and their political views? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think it has
to do with the amount </joey>
<joey> of people caring, I
think it just has to do </joey>
<joey> with how much we are
just exposed to it now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so I think one
of the main things here </connor>
<connor> is that you have to bear in mind as well </connor>
<connor> that I think like with the internet, </connor>
<connor> this has just given everyone the platform. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So like before, </connor>
<connor> if you wanted to get
support as a politician, </connor>
<connor> you had to go on a TV show
and say something, right? </connor>
<joey> You only had like what, one minute? </joey>
<connor> - Or if you're in Japan, </connor>
<connor> you blare out of a fucking
megaphone in the street. </connor>
<joey> Annoyingly.
- True, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - So now it's like, okay, </joey>
<joey> so you have the kind of perfect storm </joey>
<connor> of now there's more ways to discuss, </connor>
<connor> everyone's on the internet, </connor>
<connor> now even 40, 50 year
olds are on the internet. </connor>
<connor> So they're willing to listen to you. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Combine that with the fact
that it's become really easy </connor>
<connor> to give politics a kind of tribalism </connor>
<connor> with nothing to do with it, right? </connor>
<joey> So the whole vaccination
thing or whatever, </joey>
<joey> and all that nonsense, </joey>
<joey> not that vaccines are nonsense, </joey>
<joey> but the whole argument around it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It very quickly stopped
becoming about the science </joey>
<joey> and more just about which
horse are you backing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So I feel like now- </connor>
<joey> - It became a political thing. </joey>
<joey> - It's gotten really easy </joey>
<joey> to just assign identities
to certain political views. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And this has how
politicians have realized </joey>
<joey> that they can push their agenda. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's by just giving it like, </joey>
<joey> are you a real American? </joey>
<joey> Then you'll believe in this. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<connor> It used to be before I felt
like it was just about, more so, </connor>
<connor> it was this is the policy,
this is what we're gonna do. </connor>
<connor> And now it's like, all right, </connor>
<connor> we have to give everything a meaning. </connor>
<connor> You're either with us or you're not. </connor>
<connor> Here's the meaning between it, </connor>
<connor> and all that kind of shit. </connor>
<connor> I could explain this better </connor>
<connor> if I was more eloquent with my words, </connor>
<connor> but unfortunately that isn't the case. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, they did that subtly </joey>
<connor> with the whole Ebola crisis, right? </connor>
<connor> That was the exact same thing. </connor>
<joey> It suddenly became are you with
us, or are you not with us? </joey>
<joey> Do you care about these people? </joey>
<joey> Then you should be with me. </joey>
<joey> But it's got nothing to do with anything. </joey>
<connor> - In what case, sorry? </connor>
<connor> With the Ebola stuff,
like what do you mean? </connor>
<joey> - Well, it very quickly
became, especially in America, </joey>
<connor> became a political drive, right? </connor>
<connor> For the campaigns and whatnot. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, well- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, did it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I don't remember. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it absolutely did. </connor>
<connor> And then when the actual
election finished, </connor>
<connor> everyone stopped talking about it. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Because it's as if it had nothing to do </joey>
<joey> with the American elections. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I think it's much easier </garnt>
<joey> instead of proving yourself right, </joey>
<joey> to prove the other person wrong. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - By proving the other person wrong, </joey>
<joey> you are in a sense proving yourself right, </joey>
<joey> even though that's not
how it works at all, </joey>
<joey> you know?
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> Like when did Ben Shapiro
start owning people </connor>
<connor> with facts and logics? </connor>
<connor> Because I feel like that's
when it started, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Around same time I believe.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Probably around the same time. </connor>
<connor> - When it wasn't about
being involved in politics, </connor>
<connor> it was just you start
off watching someone else </connor>
<garnt> just owning other people
with their logistical, </garnt>
<garnt> logical arguments or whatever, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it became part of entertainment. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the, what's this
guy, the "Prove me Wrong" guy. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, um.
- Stephen Crowder. </connor>
<garnt> - Stephen Crowder, right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that as well, </garnt>
<joey> just like fuckin' exploded
out of nowhere too, </joey>
<garnt> for the same reasons. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's weird how seeing
these waves come up. </garnt>
<garnt> First, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you have the group that
proves the other group wrong. </garnt>
<connor> And then after a while
people get bored of that. </connor>
<connor> And then it's people
proving that group wrong. </connor>
<connor> And it's a constant, </connor>
<connor> it's a constant ping pong fuckin' match. </connor>
<garnt> - As well, you know, there's
information on a lot of things. </garnt>
<connor> There's always way more nuance
than people want to get into. </connor>
<connor> Right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So a lot of the time, </connor>
<connor> if you just take one correct argument, </connor>
<connor> or one correct fact, about
a flawed argument, right? </connor>
<connor> You can just run with that, and push that, </connor>
<garnt> and say look, this is right. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though in context,
it might be incorrect, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can just keep
running with something that </garnt>
<garnt> you know that you can
parrot and is safe to do so. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And even then, even if you're
wrong, it doesn't matter. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause as we've learned is
that if you're a narcissist </garnt>
<garnt> and you're willing to not give a fuck </garnt>
<garnt> if people are trying to cancel you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - People have learned that
canceling only does shit </garnt>
<garnt> if you give a fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And people are being
rewarded en mass, you know? </garnt>
<connor> And a lot of those people are like that, </connor>
<connor> who, even though they get shit wrong, </connor>
<connor> as long as they don't give a fuck, </connor>
<connor> and they just make something new </connor>
<connor> or don't mention it and just continue on, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter. </connor>
<connor> You get what you want, </connor>
<connor> you get your platform, you continue, </connor>
<connor> you can get new followers. </connor>
<connor> Oh, you lost a few hundred followers? </connor>
<connor> Oh, you'll get a new thousand. </connor>
<garnt> Who cares? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> There's never been more of a
time when I've realized that, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, bad, what
was it, like bad press? </garnt>
<garnt> Like there is no such thing as bad, </garnt>
<connor> - Bad press.
- Bad press. </connor>
<garnt> - There's no such thing as bad press. </garnt>
<connor> - It's as bad as you give a shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The thing is, as well, is a
lot of people have realized, </garnt>
<connor> and you see this on YouTube
as well in influencers, </connor>
<connor> it's as bad as you let
it seem it is, as well. </connor>
<connor> So if you are like, that's
why a lot of the scandals </connor>
<connor> around the presidential
election that happened in 2016, </connor>
<connor> a lot of them, </connor>
<connor> because if the guy who you
are supporting is like, </connor>
<connor> it's not a big deal, then
maybe you'll be like, </connor>
<connor> oh, it's not a big deal. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess not. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, you know. </connor>
<connor> There is a kind of, </connor>
<connor> it's as bad as they let it seem, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you address it and be
like, I don't give a fuck, </connor>
<connor> or you don't even bother to
address it then, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I think
you're right in a sense, </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel like even more so, </garnt>
<garnt> it was when Trump got elected, you know, </garnt>
<joey> regardless of your opinion
of him as a president, </joey>
<joey> for me as an outsider who is, you know, </joey>
<joey> not any part of American politics, </joey>
<joey> it was almost like watching a
character in a show, you know? </joey>
<joey> - It was, it was. </joey>
<joey> - Going on your Twitter timeline </joey>
<joey> and seeing some of the
stuff that he tweeted. </joey>
<garnt> - It was like a cartoon villain. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Remember like the whole covfefe shit? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I don't care where you lie
in the political spectrum, </joey>
<connor> I think we can all unanimously agree </connor>
<connor> that covfefe was fuckin' hilarious. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah, it kind of, I
dunno what the right word is, </joey>
<joey> but it kind of cartoonified shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It kind of like cartoonified
your real life and you know, </joey>
<joey> the world events, even though, </joey>
<joey> even though these were
real prevalent issues, </joey>
<joey> and these had a real, tangible- </joey>
<joey> - There's nothing cartoony about it. </joey>
<joey> - These had a real, tangible
effect on the world. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like, </joey>
<joey> especially a lot of the younger generation </joey>
<connor> who have grown up in
the age of the internet, </connor>
<connor> that's kind of the environment
they've grown into, </connor>
<connor> you know?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where everything, when
it's seen through a phone </connor>
<garnt> or through a tablet, they just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like suddenly not real. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause we were, what, 20 plus </connor>
<connor> when all this started happen, </connor>
<connor> Oh, no, 20? </connor>
<connor> Maybe I was like 19. </connor>
<connor> But like, I couldn't
imagine going from 12 to 18. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And this has been </garnt>
<garnt> your entire memory.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - This is weird.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, it's really bizarre.
- It's crazy. </connor>
<connor> - And you know, we don't
really talk about it </connor>
<connor> on the podcast, our political views </connor>
<connor> or our political opinions, </connor>
<garnt> because at the most part </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a fuck what you believe in. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have my own opinions,
but I'm also not, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I'm some kind of
benevolent man who knows all. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - I know that I have probably
come to conclusions on things </joey>
<joey> through flawed thinking, methodology, </joey>
<connor> whatever the fuck you say.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Just 'cause of how I've
been raised, right? </connor>
<connor> And you've been raised
whatever way you have. </connor>
<connor> And if you disagree with me on this, </connor>
<connor> I don't give a fuck how you
came to that conclusion. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna judge you. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like one of
the biggest problems </connor>
<connor> that's come out of all this, </connor>
<connor> is that everyone's
calling each other stupid </connor>
<connor> for believing in something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, I'm
sure you have a reason. </connor>
<connor> If we just spoke to each other normally </connor>
<connor> and didn't polarize each
other all the fucking time, </connor>
<joey> we might have a conversation. </joey>
<joey> - Just to, you know,
agree to disagree, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, we're not here to
fucking dangle a fucking carrot </joey>
<joey> in front of your face being like </joey>
<joey> believe us, because we hold the truth. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, no, no one does. </connor>
<joey> - Sucks as well, </joey>
<connor> 'cause obviously with the
whole coronavirus stuff, </connor>
<connor> and that all got politicized, </connor>
<connor> because of course it did.
- Of course it did. </connor>
<connor> - That, unfortunately, came
at the cost of people's lives. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you know, the people
who felt they were right, </connor>
<connor> felt so strongly they were right, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they thought that,
you know, they're like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, we have to protect people. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, that's fair enough. </connor>
<connor> But it's kind of difficult
to convince people </connor>
<garnt> when you're calling them stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's been shown that
it just doesn't work. </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No, no. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I think another big, massive thing </connor>
<connor> with the age of the internet is just </connor>
<connor> the fucking overload of information. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> Where it's like, I remember a point where, </connor>
<connor> you know, you'd read something in a book </connor>
<connor> or read a newspaper or something, </connor>
<connor> and you'd educate yourself. </connor>
<joey> But it feels like </joey>
<garnt> there is just so much
information right now </garnt>
<garnt> that I don't even know what information is </garnt>
<garnt> the right information to educate myself. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Right, right. </joey>
<garnt> - A lot of the time.
- So many times. </garnt>
<joey> So many times I look at something
online and I think like, </joey>
<connor> oh man, this is a kind of
interesting piece of information. </connor>
<connor> Couple of hours later, I
find out it's total bullshit. </connor>
<joey> It's like what the fuck?
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Welcome to real life. </connor>
<garnt> - Literally every time, </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, how?
- It's so true, </joey>
<garnt> where sometimes you hear
about a story or an event, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, fuck
man, that fuckin' sucks. </garnt>
<joey> - I get told by five or six
different people being like, </joey>
<joey> have you seen this thing? </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, well fuck, </joey>
<connor> if there's five or six
people around me that I know, </connor>
<connor> and I understand,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> who's telling me that this is happening, </connor>
<joey> then it must be true, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, turns out, nope. </joey>
<joey> All bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - When you were a kid, right, </connor>
<connor> did you think that people were stupid? </connor>
<connor> Like you think that you're too smart. </connor>
<connor> - In what context? </connor>
<connor> - Just in general, as a kid, </connor>
<connor> I was one of those little kids
that just thought in school, </connor>
<connor> I think half the reason why
I was angry half the time </connor>
<connor> was because I thought, this is so dumb. </connor>
<connor> I'm smarter than all this. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't even remember.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I just wanted to play video games. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't really give a shit. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Right, right. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't feel that
strongly about things. </connor>
<connor> - So I thought, as a kid, I
just thought I was smarter </connor>
<connor> than people around me. </connor>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right? </joey>
<joey> - I think everyone had that phase though. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> But I think people don't grow out of it, </connor>
<joey> some people don't </joey>
<joey> grow out of it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Some people grow don't grow
out of it obviously, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because, and it's really interesting, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I was just scrolling on Reddit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - God forbid. </connor>
<connor> - I saw this, and it was
a post where it was like, </connor>
<connor> I think everyone else is dumb, </connor>
<connor> and it's infuriating
having to talk to people. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then it was really
interesting seeing </connor>
<connor> how people were trying to reply to this, </connor>
<connor> and break it down.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - And ultimately, and I
think this is really good, </connor>
<connor> and I think that everyone
should keep this in mind. </connor>
<connor> Because I feel that we judge
people based on how they speak, </connor>
<connor> not how their level of intelligence is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like this definitely
happens on the podcast. </connor>
<connor> I've seen it in the comment section, </connor>
<connor> where we might have a bad take, </connor>
<connor> or we might badly explain something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And everyone's like, </connor>
<connor> well Connor's dumb, or
Joey's dumb, Garnt's dumb. </connor>
<connor> He couldn't explain this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's so hard to grasp. </connor>
<connor> We only can interact with people </connor>
<connor> based on the things they say, right? </connor>
<joey> Not how they think. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you are probably
thinking about things </joey>
<joey> way deeper than you could ever explain </joey>
<connor> about it, right?
- Oh yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> And it's so hard to get
that out of your head </connor>
<connor> when someone's talking to you, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you only have
that to work off, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's a skill, </garnt>
<garnt> and that's why I have trouble
properly expressing myself </garnt>
<connor> unless it's written down.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Which is why I script.
- Right, right. </connor>
<joey> - Which we can't do on the podcast. </joey>
<joey> - Which we can't do on the
podcast, unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> But we can't edit it either. </joey>
<garnt> So that's why I know for a
fact that I express myself best </garnt>
<garnt> in text form or written form, </garnt>
<connor> when it's written down. </connor>
<garnt> - But also on the podcast, I
think you're quite eloquent </garnt>
<garnt> with the way you word things. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think-
- Yeah, I think so. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I've had some pretty shit takes. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, me too, me too.
- We all have. </joey>
<joey> - Just because I was, </joey>
<joey> There has been several points </joey>
<joey> where I look at myself
arguing an argument, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, I'm a fucking clown. </joey>
<joey> I deserve to be fucking clowned on. </joey>
<garnt> - Some true "bruh" moments. </garnt>
<connor> - That has been a thing in
the Trash Takes comments. </connor>
<connor> It's been a normal thing
where they'll be like, </connor>
<garnt> I get what Connor's saying,
but he explained it badly. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> And I will admit, I'm
extremely guilty of that. </garnt>
<connor> I do that a lot.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And there are a lot of
things that I try to explain, </connor>
<joey> but in the moment, it's
just hard to get the words. </joey>
<connor> Because we don't come into
this, it's not a debate. </connor>
<joey> We don't script this shit. </joey>
<joey> We just turn up- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- We don't. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, I get what you mean, </connor>
<connor> but you probably should
have double-checked this. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Like the whole, the
fuckin' food illness thing. </joey>
<connor> If you gave me 20 minutes in a room alone </connor>
<connor> and I could write? </connor>
<connor> I could probably prepare
a decent argument. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - However I don't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - If you gave me time to
put it in an essay form, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure I could tell you. </joey>
<joey> - But also, this is how
real life is and it's weird, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I feel like when I
watch people as well speak, </joey>
<joey> and again, this is going back
to how just general life, </joey>
<joey> again, this ties into the previous topics </joey>
<joey> with the online, right? </joey>
<garnt> How we respond to people who
have bad opinions on things </garnt>
<garnt> or we observe to be bad opinions. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so hard in this
current climate online </garnt>
<garnt> to just give people the
benefit of the doubt. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And just be like I think you mean well, </connor>
<connor> and I don't think this opinion you have, </connor>
<connor> that could be hurting people, </connor>
<connor> I don't think you genuinely
want to hurt people. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It could be you've just been misinformed </connor>
<connor> and you believe it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You genuinely think
this is helping people. </connor>
<joey> - That's the problem
though, is that, I feel, </joey>
<joey> you know, a lot of social media, </joey>
<connor> like Twitter, Reddit, stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> is 99% emotionally driven. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- That's just humanity. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that too, but also, you know, </garnt>
<joey> a lot of people like to think that, </joey>
<joey> oh, I see this massive post
on, you know, massive comment </joey>
<connor> replying to a certain shit
take on Reddit, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they think like, </connor>
<connor> oh, judging from the
length of this whole thing, </connor>
<connor> this must be a very well-thought,
well-written argument. </connor>
<connor> 90% of the time, no. </connor>
<connor> It's emotional drivel. </connor>
<joey> But that's unfortunately
how the nature of a lot </joey>
<connor> of these internet arguments
- It's depressing. </connor>
<joey> work, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's so depressing. </joey>
<joey> That even when you go on
Reddit, and look at it </joey>
<garnt> and someone will say something
that's a bit incorrect, </garnt>
<garnt> and it will just immediately
turn into argument. </garnt>
<garnt> Instantly. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Why do you wanna do this? </connor>
<joey> Don't you wanna?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, no one's
fucking citing their sources </garnt>
<garnt> in these kinds of comment sections. </garnt>
<joey> It's all, it's all emotional. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean that's just
how humans are always. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I don't
normally try to get involved </garnt>
<garnt> on a platform like Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> because do you think anyone's ever </garnt>
<garnt> changed their fucking mind
from like a single tweet </garnt>
<garnt> or like a Twitter discussion?
- No. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't see it happening. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd love to meet someone who's like, </joey>
<joey> I thought about this thing, </joey>
<connor> but then I saw XXXn00bkillerXX
tweet that out, </connor>
<connor> and be like, yeah, you know what? </connor>
<connor> You're right, bro. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Opinion changed. </joey>
<joey> Just like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've seen threads
that maybe, you know, </garnt>
<connor> we'll just agree to disagree, you know, </connor>
<connor> with threads that you open
up that show all replies, </connor>
<garnt> and you just keep scrolling
down, and it just never ends. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - The only time I see people
civilized on the internet </garnt>
<connor> and always be really
respectful to each other </connor>
<connor> is when they're talking about porn. </connor>
<connor> (Joey cackling)
- Yes, yes. </connor>
<connor> - That's the only time. </connor>
<connor> People are so fucking polite to each other </connor>
<connor> when they're talking about porn, </connor>
<connor> and they're so helpful, </connor>
<connor> and everyone's so helpful about it, </connor>
<joey> but the moment it's
anything else, it's like, </joey>
<joey> they start going at the throat. </joey>
<joey> - It's the image of all the board members </joey>
<joey> at the Roundtable. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I think that's very
good example right now. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> It's literally very civilized. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just love as well the ones that are, </joey>
<joey> going back to the whole
agreeing to disagree thing. </joey>
<joey> I've seen so many Twitter replies </joey>
<joey> of how one side of the
argument tries to start </joey>
<joey> that whole conclusion up being like, </joey>
<joey> you know what, let's agree to disagree. </joey>
<joey> But 90% of the time
the other party's like, </joey>
<joey> no, no, no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We're not ending it here. </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna agree to disagree. </joey>
<joey> Fuck you. </joey>
<joey> How dare you? </joey>
<connor> - You know that people feel,
for some reason, feel safe, </connor>
<connor> discussing their opinions about
porn and hentai and whatever </connor>
<connor> 'cause on some of these </connor>
<connor> discord servers,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> where they talk about hentai, </connor>
<connor> people use their real fucking pictures </connor>
<connor> as their profile pictures.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's how safe they feel talking. </connor>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<connor> - That's the real safe space. </connor>
<joey> - Some people feel, some- </joey>
<joey> - That is the real space safe space, man. </joey>
<joey> - What?! </joey>
<connor> - To me, that is bold.
- It's like, I'm into NTR. </connor>
<connor> Let's agree to disagree. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughing) </connor>
<joey> Shake hands. </joey>
<connor> - It's like Steven with
his actual profile picture. </connor>
<connor> It's like what?
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by honey. </joey>
<joey> The easy way to save </joey>
<joey> when shopping on your iPhone or computer. </joey>
<garnt> Guys let's not pretend that we
don't all shop online, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course we do. </garnt>
<garnt> - But don't you wish you had a promo code, </garnt>
<garnt> ready for you always when
you're at the checkout. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, thanks to honey, </garnt>
<garnt> manually searching for coupon
codes is a thing of the past. </garnt>
<garnt> Honey is a free shopping tool </garnt>
<garnt> that scours the internet for promo codes </garnt>
<garnt> and applies the best one
it finds to your cart, </garnt>
<garnt> every time you shop online. </garnt>
<garnt> - How does it work, Connor? </garnt>
<connor> - Imagine it. </connor>
<connor> You're shopping on one
of your favorite sites. </connor>
<connor> - Um huh.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When you're at the checkout, </connor>
<connor> the honey button appears, </connor>
<connor> and all you have to do
is click "apply coupons." </connor>
<connor> - That's all? </connor>
<connor> - Wait a few seconds as
honey searches for coupons </connor>
<connor> it can find for that site. </connor>
<connor> If honey finds a working coupon, </connor>
<connor> you'll watch the prices drop. </connor>
<connor> - It's that easy? </connor>
<connor> - It's that easy. </connor>
<connor> And recently I just bought a
microphone to upgrade my setup, </connor>
<connor> and honey saved me 15 bucks
- Whoa. </connor>
<connor> on a brand new microphone. </connor>
<garnt> - If you don't already have honey, </garnt>
<garnt> you can be straight up
missing out on free savings. </garnt>
<garnt> - Woo. </garnt>
<garnt> - And by getting it you'll
be doing yourself a solid </garnt>
<garnt> and also supporting us as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>

something I don't use. </joey>
<joey> So get honey for free at
joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </joey>
<joey> That's joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </joey>
<joey> Links in the description below. </joey>
<joey> - Back to the episode. </joey>
<joey> - Why is it that the porn community </joey>
<joey> on Twitter is some of the chillest people? </joey>
<garnt> - The porn community in any community is </garnt>
<garnt> the chillest people. </garnt>
<joey> - Isn't it fucked up that a
Pornhub comment section is </joey>
<joey> more chill than a YouTube comment section? </joey>
<connor> - I feel 'cause you, to have
to interact in a community </connor>
<joey> you have to have a level
of self-awareness, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I think that's where it comes from. </joey>
<joey> You are just so self-aware </joey>
<connor> that you just don't give a fuck anymore. </connor>
<connor> And that's when you're most Zen, </connor>
<connor> after you've nutted. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well basically, it's a
massive barrier of entry </garnt>
<garnt> just to sign up an account </garnt>
<garnt> to a porn site, right?
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - That's a level that I just
haven't been able to take. </connor>
<garnt> I just don't wanna give my Gmail account. </garnt>
<joey> - I just wanna be at that morning where </joey>
<joey> I wake up in the morning, like, </joey>
<joey> I'm making a Pornhub account today. </joey>
<joey> - This is the most "Trash
Taste" segue ever, by the way. </joey>
<joey> Can I say that? </joey>
<joey> That we've gone from
like very serious topics </joey>
<connor> to signing up to a porn account? </connor>
<connor> I don't know what kind of person is like, </connor>
<connor> I need to just have my say in this. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey cackling) </garnt>
<connor> I gotta make it known what I think about- </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like there's steps, </garnt>
<connor> because I've never signed
up for a Pornhub account. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But I have for like hentai sites, right? </connor>
<joey> - Right.
- You have? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I have, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because sometimes you find a lit hentai, </joey>
<connor> and you're like, I want to remember this, </connor>
<connor> because I'm going to
forget the name afterwards. </connor>
<garnt> - I will say, as a free to
play user of the porn universe, </garnt>
<garnt> I will say the most annoying thing is </garnt>
<connor> trying to find a video that I did enjoy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause the problem is, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> after you do the deed, you're
not interested in it anymore. </garnt>
<connor> So you're like, I don't
fucking need this anymore. </connor>
<garnt> And then it just goes out the recesses </garnt>
<garnt> of your mind and fucking
a week later you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> yo, what was that fucking A class hentai </garnt>
<connor> that I found the other week? </connor>
<connor> - There is a sobering moment
when you're trying to type </connor>
<connor> in the keywords to find the thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And you are like, I'm disgusting. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughing) </connor>
<connor> And you're just scrolling
through these videos, </connor>
<joey> trying to find it. </joey>
<connor> You're like, no, no, there's
something wrong with me. </connor>
<joey> - I've gone to the point
where I've anonymously gone </joey>
<joey> onto forums and asked. </joey>
<joey> - Have you actually?
- No, no you haven't. </joey>
<connor> - I have.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - What's your profile pic? </joey>
<joey> - I'm not telling you. </joey>
<connor> Do you know what anonymous means? </connor>
<connor> - It's gotta be Joey. </connor>
<connor> I want it to be like, yeah, </connor>
<joey> 'cause no one would ever
expect the Joey to use </joey>
<connor> his actual profile picture on the forum. </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - But now everyone's gonna use Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Now everyone's gonna use Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I didn't know
anyone at the time, right? </connor>
<connor> And I was in the exact same
situation where I was like, </connor>
<connor> I just saw this thing,
but it was on incognito. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> So I don't remember what it was called. </joey>
<joey> All I remember is what
the girl looked like. </joey>
<connor> - If you could log in, do you
know the login information? </connor>
<connor> Do you still use this account? </connor>
<joey> - No, not anymore. </joey>
<joey> I don't even think the
website exists anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that is the one
problem with incognito mode. </garnt>
<connor> Is that it doesn't give
you a search history. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or a history. </garnt>
<joey> - Like the moment the
post nut clarity hits </joey>
<joey> and you close that window, </joey>
<joey> you're like, shit! </joey>
<joey> Why did I do that?
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I can't go back now. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - So yeah, one time, I remember it. </joey>
<joey> I remember what the girl looked like, </joey>
<joey> and I remember a certain scene. </joey>
<joey> So I was just like, hey, I'm
looking for this one series. </joey>
<joey> These are the details. </joey>
<garnt> Help appreciated. </garnt>
<joey> Immediately, five people
came back being like, </joey>
<garnt> I think it's this one. </garnt>
<garnt> You should look it up. </garnt>
<garnt> None of them were actually it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I got great recommendations. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you got some new
recommendations along the way. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, oh sick,
that's pretty close. </joey>
<joey> - What about signing up for, </joey>
<joey> Well, I guess it depends,
'cause in Hentai and stuff </joey>
<joey> it's different. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Normal one, I dunno what
would compel me to want pay. </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean?
- Like a pay site? </joey>
<joey> - I wouldn't wanna give
fucking my credit card </joey>
<joey> to one of these sites. </joey>
<joey> Dude, that feels like such a, </joey>
<connor> you know, when you hear about these, </connor>
<connor> which one was it? </connor>
<connor> Was it the New York guy who was running </connor>
<connor> for mayor of New York. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Anthony Wiener, was it? </connor>
<garnt> - Something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, there was somebody who got- </garnt>
<garnt> - Anthony Wiener was one with dick pics. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that was it. </garnt>
<garnt> No, there was someone else who was, </garnt>
<garnt> they were running for political position, </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was found
out they were spending </garnt>
<connor> five grand a month on
pornography or something. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, that's
impressive that you manage </connor>
<connor> to find ways to spend five grand. </connor>
<joey> - No, that is impressive. </joey>
<joey> - You're definitely not watching
all of it, that's for sure. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause how could you? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think one person is capable </garnt>
<joey> of watching that much porn. </joey>
<garnt> - How many, like, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> How many OnlyFans was he like sub to? </connor>
<connor> - Right, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - How many terabytes worth? </connor>
<joey> - We spoke about this, right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause remember we spoke
about that one YouTuber </connor>
<joey> who had a porn addiction and- </joey>
<joey> - Yes, yes. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't remember who it was. </connor>
<connor> I do remember, yeah, that sounds familiar. </connor>
<connor> - It was like the most
Chad YouTuber apology, </connor>
<connor> not apology, video.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> He was like, he was never
accused of anything. </connor>
<connor> He just came out, he's like,
guys, I have a porn addiction. </connor>
<joey> It's rough. </joey>
<joey> I was like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well it was like
literally ruining his life. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well it's one of those
things that I can always, </joey>
<joey> I always fucking say,
"it's one of those things." </joey>
<garnt> Goddamn, I gotta stop saying that. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor, this is a message you. </garnt>
<garnt> Stop saying it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's one of those things. </garnt>
<connor> - Question to you, Connor. </connor>
<connor> - It is literally my "a question to you." </connor>
<connor> I, it's one of those things, um, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> That people talk about, and oh, </connor>
<connor> people do not talk about enough- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's one of those things, </connor>
<joey> people don't wanna give
credit to it or talk about it </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's just really embarrassing and- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - Don't give credit to
how debilitating it can be </joey>
<connor> to have that. </connor>
<connor> If you have it, man, I
hope you can get help. </connor>
<connor> I hope you can get out of it. </connor>
<garnt> No shame to you, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so hard.
- It happens. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's 'cause it's
something that's just like, </garnt>
<joey> it doesn't seem on the forefront of things </joey>
<joey> you should be worried about, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Definitely right. </joey>
<joey> - Like, you know, you can easily, </joey>
<joey> it's easy to be able
to justify to yourself, </joey>
<connor> oh yeah, a gambling addiction,
of course that's bad. </connor>
<connor> You know or like- </connor>
<connor> - It ruins your life directly. </connor>
<connor> - Or like an alcohol addiction, </connor>
<joey> or I'm just kind of destroying my body. </joey>
<joey> I'm destroying all my
relationships around me. </joey>
<garnt> A porn addiction, because
porn is so secretive anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't really have
anyone to talk to it about. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not an immediate threat, </garnt>
<garnt> I think is the thing.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you hear about, yeah,
of course I watch porn. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm an adult. </garnt>
<connor> It's everyone does it. </connor>
<connor> It's fine. </connor>
<connor> You know, everyone, most
people are living normal lives, </connor>
<connor> you know, while watching it, </connor>
<joey> and then you go down the
rabbit hole deep enough </joey>
<joey> and you realize, oh it's actually fucked. </joey>
<joey> It's just as bad. </joey>
<garnt> - At which point do you accept
that it is an addiction, </garnt>
<garnt> and not just a recreational
activity that everyone does? </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - I think like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - It's tough. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause when are games
too addicting, right? </connor>
<joey> When are you addicted </joey>
<connor> to games?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Is it the hours spent
consuming that medium </joey>
<connor> or is it the money spent
consuming that medium? </connor>
<connor> Or is it both?
(Connor blowing through lips) </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Is it when you can't think
of anything other than porn? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause no one wants to
help people who are addicted </connor>
<garnt> to porn 'cause they
don't think it's a thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause they are
like just stop watching it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Just turn it off. </garnt>
<connor> - Just stop jacking off. </connor>
<connor> - Just close your eyes. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Just put your dick away, it's easy. </joey>
<joey> - To me, I guess I don't know
what the actual definition </joey>
<joey> of addiction is, </joey>
<joey> but I guess when you should
start being worried about it is </joey>
<joey> when it has a tangible
effect on maybe your life </joey>
<joey> in some way, shape or form. </joey>
<joey> But like what- </joey>
<joey> - Like affecting negatively. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's it. </joey>
<joey> Like a tangible, negative
effect on your life </joey>
<joey> or an aspect of your life. </joey>
<joey> But then again, when does
it become a negative effect </joey>
<joey> and when does it just
become like, oh yeah, </joey>
<garnt> I just had a week binge
drinking with the boys, </garnt>
<garnt> because we are like
partying all week, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, at which point does
it become a negative effect? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess that's the hard thing about it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it becomes- </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's when, in my
opinion, I think it's when </joey>
<connor> it's consistently, for
a long period of time, </connor>
<connor> and it's consistently just
adding onto a negative effect. </connor>
<connor> I think that's when it becomes
like a problematic addiction. </connor>
<connor> Because you can, as you said, </connor>
<connor> you could have like a week binge </connor>
<connor> of drinking from morning to
night with the boys, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you're most likely
not gonna be drinking </garnt>
<connor> for a while after that, right? </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't count that as an addiction. </connor>
<connor> That's like a short term binge. </connor>
<connor> - That's just destroying your body. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah that's just destroying your body </connor>
<connor> and having a good time with the boys. </connor>
<connor> But when it's a constant amount every day, </connor>
<connor> or for a long period of time consistently. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just getting worse
and worse and worse and worse, </connor>
<connor> I think that's when it's like, </connor>
<garnt> okay, you should probably seek help. </garnt>
<joey> In my opinion, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - It's when you sign up
to a Pornhub account. </garnt>
<joey> - It's when you're like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I need people to know how I
feel about that blowjob scene. </joey>
<garnt> It was so good.
(Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I need up votes on my Pornhub comment. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the one thing I don't understand. </garnt>
<garnt> I understand, the thing about
porn hub comments is that, </garnt>
<garnt> I understand people asking about </garnt>
<joey> fucking Call of Duty's tactics </joey>
<joey> or fucking how to get past this level, </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - Rather than people actually
commenting on the porn itself. </connor>
<connor> Like to me, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> I dunno why you would ever
comment on a porno, right? </connor>
<joey> Because you are either like watching it </joey>
<joey> and you're actively involved, </joey>
<joey> or I've never gotten to a
point where watching this, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I want to
verbalize what I think about- </joey>
<joey> - What do people think about this? </joey>
<joey> - What I think about this, you know. </joey>
<joey> - My favorites are the ones
that are just so simple, </joey>
<joey> so innocent being like, oh
man, 18:23, what a hot scene. </joey>
<joey> I was like, yeah? </joey>
<joey> I guess so.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Thank you for sharing that. </joey>
<connor> Didn't need to know.
- I wish I was that open. </connor>
<garnt> I wish I was that way. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe one day, maybe one day. </joey>
<joey> (Joey giggling) </joey>
<joey> - What, do you wanna get to that point? </joey>
<joey> - Who knows? </joey>
<joey> Who knows, Joey? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know.
- Have you seen some </joey>
<garnt> of the fucking shit that
Sydney's been tweeting? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I need to fucking
calm her down sometimes. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't be surprised if
she had a Pornhub account. </joey>
<garnt> - At this point, I
think it's just Twitter. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - She's gone beyond. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, she's gone beyond, man. </connor>
<joey> - So why be anonymous
when I could be known? </joey>
<joey> - Oh God. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<garnt> - Anyway, have you guys been
up to anything this past week </garnt>
<garnt> that's not been depressing or? </garnt>
<joey> - I look completely different. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just wanted to point that out. </joey>
<joey> I know we brushed over that, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> Friendship with Joey
the Anime Man has ended. </joey>
<joey> I'm Josh the Manga Lad now. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> Just the comments, </joey>
<connor> so I got my ears pierced. </connor>
<connor> That's one big thing.
- Yes. </connor>
<connor> And then just yesterday I got my haircut. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> So now I look completely different. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you look like the
hacker character in the movie </connor>
<connor> that doesn't wanna explain
how the hacking works. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> He just kinda like pisses everyone off. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But they always need him. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, the one that- </connor>
<connor> - You like like that guy now. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I look like </joey>
<joey> that guy now.
(Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> But I just loved so, you know, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I had the, every time, </joey>
<connor> I feel this is very much a YouTuber thing, </connor>
<connor> but even if you slightly change </connor>
<connor> how you look,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> or slightly do something different, right? </connor>
<connor> To some people it's like, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> It's the end of the world
type of thing, right? </joey>
<connor> - I think it's just YouTube
comments work on the first thing </connor>
<joey> they think they can comment
about, they comment. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So it's always the appearance
'cause you see that first. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's like,
every time I get my hair cut </joey>
<connor> or I shave or you know, I
guess in this case, you know, </connor>
<connor> drastically changed quite a bit. </connor>
<connor> Just my favorite things is
seeing the reception to it, </connor>
<connor> regardless of if it's
positive or negative. </connor>
<connor> To all the people who said
like, hey Joey, you look good. </connor>
<connor> I appreciate that. </connor>
<connor> That's fucking dope. </connor>
<connor> Thank you. </connor>
<connor> But my favorites are
the ones that of people </connor>
<connor> losing their minds in a negative sense. </connor>
<connor> Like a family member </connor>
<connor> just died.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What was the funniest response you got? </connor>
<connor> - The funniest one, </connor>
<garnt> So the one I saw on Insta,
it's always Instagram </garnt>
<garnt> that are the best ones.
- Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> When I got the, when I posted the pictures </garnt>
<joey> of getting my ears pierced,
the top comment for a while was </joey>
<joey> is he gay or European? </joey>
<joey> (crew member laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I was like, yes, I am a JoJo fan. </joey>
<joey> Thank you. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> But then, you know, with
the haircut, for instance, </joey>
<connor> you know, some people
were like, hey, you know, </connor>
<connor> I like your cut G you
know, you always get those. </connor>
<connor> And then other ones were like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I can't believe it. </connor>
<joey> L + ratio.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> He fell off. </joey>
<joey> - You fell off. </joey>
<joey> - I saw one, </joey>
<joey> I saw a quote retweet
that was dead ass saying </joey>
<garnt> you fucking fell off.
- You fell off. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, what because-
- Well, his hair definitely </garnt>
<garnt> did fall off.
- You did fall off. </garnt>
<garnt> - My hair fell off, that's for sure. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, what? </joey>
<joey> Because I got a haircut? </joey>
<connor> - It was the same when I moved to Japan. </connor>
<garnt> In the same video I also dyed my hair. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And even though I'd moved to Japan, </garnt>
<connor> half the comments were
like, oh my God, his hair. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> I was like, I just moved to Japan! </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like your hair is,
oh, I have different hairs. </joey>
<joey> You know, responsible for
different funnies now. </joey>
<joey> - Like what?
- It's just hair! </joey>
<garnt> - I just like the fact
that you've had longer hair </garnt>
<garnt> and the same length hair. </garnt>
<garnt> Now you have shorter hair. </garnt>
<joey> - To be fair, this is the
shortest I think I've ever had it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's weird. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Does it feel good? </connor>
<joey> - It feels good. </joey>
<garnt> The back of my hair feels good, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> But it's like, I don't know- </joey>
<joey> - Easy to how easy is it to wash now? </joey>
<joey> - Oh dude, it's like- </joey>
<joey> - That's the best part
about having short hair. </joey>
<garnt> - It's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> So many people are like, </joey>
<joey> why would you do that to yourself? </joey>
<joey> It's like- </joey>
<joey> - Why would you do that? </joey>
<joey> - It's like I fucking stabbed a kid. </joey>
<joey> It's like, why would you do that now? </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, why not? </garnt>
<connor> - So as some one who rarely
ever changes their hairstyle, </connor>
<connor> how'd you guys pick what
hairstyle that you do? </connor>
<garnt> Or like, how do you pick a new hairstyle? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not confident
enough in my own abilities </connor>
<connor> to ever change my own style. </connor>
<connor> Somebody else has to do it for me. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And then I'm like, oh, oh, </connor>
<garnt> and then I stick with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, to me, every time I have changed </garnt>
<connor> my hairstyle in my life, </connor>
<connor> it's been someone else
recommending me a hairstyle </connor>
<connor> to change it to, and I'm
just like, I don't know </connor>
<connor> if I'll like this. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I'll like this. </connor>
<connor> And it takes me like a
good year or something, </connor>
<joey> so I build up my courage to be like, okay, </joey>
<joey> maybe I'll go for this person's advice. </joey>
<joey> And I change it and I'm like, okay, </joey>
<joey> well this is my new hairstyle now. </joey>
<garnt> I'm never changing it again.
- How did you transition </garnt>
<garnt> from sasuke hair to now? </garnt>
<joey> - Um. </joey>
<joey> - Was that a suggestion? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was a suggestion </joey>
<joey> by my mates?
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> Because they were like, mate,
you need to stop putting </joey>
<joey> this much gel into your fucking hair. </joey>
<connor> Fucking just comb it down. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, no, no. </connor>
<connor> The sasuke hair makes
me, everyone loves it. </connor>
<joey> Everyone fucking loves it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's never gonna change. </connor>
<connor> It's like this for the rest of my life. </connor>
<joey> And I do it once. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, yeah, the sasuke
hair's fucking stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno what I was thinking.
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I've decided my hairstyle based on </connor>
<garnt> what requires no gel or wax. </garnt>
<connor> I just hate putting shit in my hair. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I always hated that. </connor>
<connor> So I just like, whatever I
can do when I roll outta bed </connor>
<garnt> is the one I'm going for. </garnt>
<garnt> - So envious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I need- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know, you've
gone to perfectionist. </garnt>
<joey> It's like hand sculpting the perfect- </joey>
<joey> - But I mean before today's episode, </joey>
<connor> like majority of episodes
is just my bedhead. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I don't do anything with it. </connor>
<connor> It's so funny though people asking </connor>
<connor> what shampoo and conditioner do you use? </connor>
<joey> I was like Head and Shoulders. </joey>
<joey> Fucking Dove. </joey>
<joey> Like it's nothing special. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> For me, it's like, I'm
given this job, right? </joey>
<connor> Like, YouTubing and being on social media </connor>
<connor> where it's like, this
isn't gonna fucking affect- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, you know, my videos, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't affect my job. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's just a matter of personal preference. </connor>
<connor> So in my head, if I'm
given this opportunity </connor>
<connor> where I can kind of
experiment with how I look </connor>
<connor> and it not really affect my job, </connor>
<connor> maybe it might even affect it
positively for some people, </connor>
<connor> why wouldn't I try it? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause with my hair, for instance, </connor>
<connor> if you hate this hair, just wait a month, </connor>
<joey> it'll grow back to normal. </joey>
<joey> It's gonna go back to the
length you're comfortable with. </joey>
<joey> It's fine. </joey>
<joey> But why would I not give it a go? </joey>
<garnt> - But also I feel like a
lot of that is just people </garnt>
<joey> not being used to a look or a new look. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course, of course. </joey>
<connor> - Because I remember when
I first started growing out </connor>
<connor> a stubble and everyone's like,
oh, you look weird as fuck. </connor>
<connor> And even I did, I thought,
man, I look fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> I look fucking weird as
fuck with just a stubble </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've never had a stubble </connor>
<connor> or I've never like grown
out a stubble in my life, </connor>
<connor> even though I've always known I could. </connor>
<connor> And I remember I was
working on my latest vlog </connor>
<connor> and I was looking at my Trash Taste video </connor>
<connor> where I talk about Trash Taste. </connor>
<garnt> And then I was looking at
the previous vlog I did </garnt>
<garnt> before I was recording this one, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was the BBC video
that I did without a stubble. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, man, I look fucking weird. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Now I think I look
weird without a stubble, </garnt>
<garnt> and I look back at all
Trash Taste episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, man, I look really weird. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, when you go back to
episode one of Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> and I'm in a fucking ponytail. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I completely </garnt>
<joey> forgot about that.
- I look at that </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, you look homeless. </joey>
<joey> I'm so glad I don't look
like this in anymore. </joey>
<joey> But back then everyone was like,
yeah, the Jesus hair, dude, </joey>
<joey> it looks fucking sick. </joey>
<joey> And back then I was like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, you know what? </joey>
<joey> It kinda looks sick, not gonna lie. </joey>
<joey> But now I'm just like, no. </joey>
<joey> It really got to the point
where I knew it was gross </joey>
<joey> when even Aki's mom who
is the most accepting, </joey>
<joey> kind, never says a bad
thing about anything, </joey>
<joey> just one day was like, I think
you should cut your hair. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was like, if you are
saying that, maybe I should. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I'd never wanna hear from- </connor>
<joey> - I think maybe I should. </joey>
<connor> - The mom. </connor>
<joey> Not my own mom, Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I needed
to hear that though. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's probably how dire I looked. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause now I know what she means. </connor>
<connor> I look back and then I'm
like, yeah, you know what, </connor>
<connor> if I saw a guy like
that who I cared about, </connor>
<connor> I'd probably tell him to cut his hair too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's kind of gross. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Even with the piercings
in the ear as well, </connor>
<connor> it was surprising how a
lot of people were like, </connor>
<connor> oh, I thought your ears
were already pierced. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I was like- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, now that you say it, I dunno why, </garnt>
<joey> I know it's never been that way, </joey>
<joey> but you have that energy where
you had your ears pierced. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you did. </joey>
<joey> You did have that energy.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like when you said
you want your ears pierced, </joey>
<joey> I was like didn't you already
have your ears pierced, </joey>
<connor> or am I just like dreaming that up? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, everyone said that. </connor>
<joey> I was like, really? </joey>
<joey> - It is weird how much
just changing a little bit </joey>
<connor> of your facial features
can change the perception. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When I was growing out
my beard a little bit, </connor>
<connor> I looked like fucking Willem
Dafoe from "The Lighthouse." </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, I kind
of digged it though. </garnt>
<garnt> But also at the same time, it
was really fucking annoying. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Having it long. </connor>
<garnt> - You actually reminded
me of Linus Tech Tips </garnt>
<joey> more than anything. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know why, </garnt>
<connor> just when you grow-
- I don't wanna, </connor>
<connor> He wears sandals and socks. </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna- </joey>
<joey> - Put a side by side of Linus.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I love Linus, but
he's not drip, you know? </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Like I don't wanna be compared
to Linus when it comes to- </connor>
<garnt> - No, he, I think he
looks good with a beard. </garnt>
<garnt> I just like, he wasn't Willem Dafoe, </garnt>
<connor> it was like Linus Tech
Tips with a beard energy </connor>
<joey> that I got for me. </joey>
<joey> I dunno. </joey>
<connor> I take that as a compliment.
- Now, now, </connor>
<connor> - I think it's a compliment.
- I wanna get rid of it all. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not a dis, it's not a dis. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not a dis, bruv. </joey>
<joey> - I'd rather be Willem Dafoe. </joey>
<connor> I hear he has like a 12 inch cock. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Is that the biggest
change you've ever done </connor>
<garnt> aside from like getting your hair dyed </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that,
you've ever done to your- </garnt>
<joey> - I think you turning silver
was the biggest change, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that was weird. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When I look at that, that was weird. </connor>
<connor> I liked it when it was
half blond, half brown, </connor>
<joey> kind of like dirty blonde
I think it's called. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Like when the
silver was fading, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I liked that. </connor>
<connor> I liked it towards the end. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I liked segment as well. </connor>
<connor> - But then it's like, I don't
wanna have to do it again. </connor>
<connor> Also I probably shouldn't
be dyeing my hair </connor>
<joey> when I haven't got much left of it, so. </joey>
<joey> - Apparently that's a myth. </joey>
<joey> - Is it really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Is it really? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know then. </connor>
<connor> - My hairdresser was saying yesterday. </connor>
<connor> - But she got stakes in it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's her job to dye people hair. </connor>
<connor> - Well, no, yeah, but, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </connor>
<joey> That's true, but also she was saying </joey>
<joey> that unless you're directly
applying the bleach </joey>
<connor> onto the scalp, which a
hairdresser shouldn't be doing </connor>
<connor> to begin with, it doesn't affect. </connor>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I don't know either way, I'm- </connor>
<joey> - I know why you're cautious about it. </joey>
<connor> - I've got outta that phase as well </connor>
<connor> where I feel like I need to dye my hair. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm in the boomer stage now </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, it'll do what it does. </connor>
<joey> - You're in the veteran stage. </joey>
<connor> - It'll do whatever it wants,
and I will just deal with it. </connor>
<garnt> - It does feel like regardless of age, </garnt>
<joey> it does feel like a stage that
every YouTuber goes through. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, oh, it's the dyed, </joey>
<joey> it's either they go through a bald stage </joey>
<joey> or they dye their hair. </joey>
<joey> - But it's the, it's the I'm a YouTuber </joey>
<joey> with a little bit of clout stage. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's like, oh, people- </joey>
<garnt> - That is kinda like the
YouTuber midlife crisis, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, oh, people
are starting to look at me. </garnt>
<joey> Maybe I should spice things up. </joey>
<connor> - I remember I never really
wanted to dye my hair. </connor>
<joey> It was like, I think I was kinda- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] What made you want to? </joey>
<joey> - I think I was kind interested in it. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I've never tried it. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Thought could be interesting. </connor>
<connor> And then when I met Charlie,
who dyes your hair, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - She was just kinda like,
yeah, let's just do it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, just give it a go. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, I mean, I
think I was in that phase </connor>
<garnt> where I was like, yeah, fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> Everything in my life
was changing, why not? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - So I tried it, and I remember
I didn't like it initially. </connor>
<connor> I thought, okay. </connor>
<connor> And then it got to blonde, I thought, huh? </connor>
<connor> Weirdly, looks okay. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't mind blonde.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> But then also it did
make me look a bit weird. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think the silver
looked weird on you, </joey>
<connor> to be honest. </connor>
<connor> I think out of all the, </connor>
<garnt> I think that compared to a red or a blue, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, or a,
- Yeah, red is- </garnt>
<garnt> you know, a standard, </garnt>
<joey> like I am a YouTuber, YouTube gamer color. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Compared to that, I think- </connor>
<connor> - YouTube gamer color. </connor>
<connor> - Ah, Ninja. </connor>
<connor> Ninja. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, Ninja. </connor>
<connor> - That was a strong blue.
- Of you had like, </connor>
<connor> if you had ninja hair, I
would've been like, uh. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Strong blue. </connor>
<connor> - Are you a Twitch streamer? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I've done, what? </connor>
<garnt> Five or six different colors now. </garnt>
<garnt> I've done red, blue, green, pink, purple. </garnt>
<connor> And now I have this like grayish- </connor>
<garnt> - Complete the rainbow. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I have, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I have. </joey>
<joey> - You just wake up one
day and you're just like, </joey>
<garnt> I wanna try something different today. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which Starburst color am I doing today? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> But again, that's an easy
way to date my videos, right? </garnt>
<connor> I know exactly what
era this video is from, </connor>
<connor> just based on what color my hair is. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So it's kind of cool, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> If you don't like this,
that's totally fine. </joey>
<garnt> - You'll get used to
it within like a month. </garnt>
<joey> - You'll get used to it. </joey>
<garnt> - As with everyone does. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm not even used to it right now. </connor>
<joey> I woke up this morning, I was like, ah. </joey>
<connor> Wait, who the fucks' that? </connor>
<connor> - I'm just praying, I'm like, God, please, </connor>
<joey> I hope I don't have a weird
shaped head when I go bald. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- Please, please, please. </joey>
<connor> - That was the one thing
- Please, please, please, </connor>
<connor> I was worried about. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause it really shapes out my face. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how, how do you know </connor>
<joey> what the shape of your head is? </joey>
<joey> - You won't know. </joey>
<connor> - You don't know do you?
- You won't know. </connor>
<connor> - Until you get to like this
length and you're like, oh, </connor>
<joey> my head is fucking weird. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like we should
have found out a way </connor>
<connor> to figure out the shape of your head </connor>
<connor> without having to shave it all off. </connor>
<joey> Science, come on. </joey>
<connor> We must have figured something out, right? </connor>
<joey> - It scans the contour of your head. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure there's a
fucking filter or something </joey>
<connor> that figures out.
- The filters always </connor>
<garnt> look shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Filters always look shit.
(Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> They always look so cartoonishly bald. </connor>
<connor> Like Lex Luther bald. </connor>
<joey> - No bald person looks like this. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like they just take </garnt>
<garnt> this fucking Jeff Bezos bald.
- Yeah, everyone's just like </garnt>
<garnt> Johnny Sins. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean?
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> They all look like that. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, no. </connor>
<joey> - Johnny Sins doesn't even
look like a real bald person. </joey>
<connor> - He doesn't, right? </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] What a man, what a man. </joey>
<garnt> The king of bald man jobs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, aside from aside from
Joey getting his haircut, </garnt>
<joey> I watched another anime this past week. </joey>
<joey> - What did you watch? </joey>
<joey> - I watched "Jujutsu Kaisen 0." </joey>
<joey> - Oh you watched the movie. </joey>
<joey> - In cinemas, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How was it? </joey>
<joey> It was. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Say it. </joey>
<garnt> Say it, Garnt! </garnt>
<joey> - It was okay. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not mid? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Not mid, not mid. </connor>
<joey> - I liked it. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was good. </joey>
<joey> - It was good, it was good. </joey>
<joey> It was, it was- </joey>
<garnt> - Did you watch it in 4XD? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] What's 4XD? </garnt>
<connor> - Where they like spit on you
and shake the chair and stuff? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I didn't know that was an option. </garnt>
<connor> - Did they gave that for "Jujutsu Kaisen?" </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, they did.
- Wow. </connor>
<connor> - They did spit on you. </connor>
<connor> - They blow air. </connor>
<connor> - There's just one person like- </connor>
<garnt> - Like they blow air. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I dunno, I liked the animation. </garnt>
<connor> It was pretty. </connor>
<garnt> - I dunno if watching "Demon
Slayer" has just spoiled me </garnt>
<joey> in terms of like shonen anime films. </joey>
<connor> - Could be.
(Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> But I went in, not with
like the expectations </connor>
<connor> that it was going to be "Demon
Slayer: Mugen Train" level, </connor>
<connor> but I did come in knowing </connor>
<connor> that that was the last shonen
anime film that I had watched </connor>
<joey> in theaters. </joey>
<garnt> And I came out being just mildly amused </garnt>
<garnt> and just impressed by
some animation points. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the end of the day it
was the most seven out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was gonna say
it's a seven out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was the story good? </garnt>
<joey> - It's okay.
- Uh. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It was okay. </joey>
<joey> Like, okay- </joey>
<joey> - The people in the cinema </joey>
<joey> next to me were fucking
bawling their eyes out. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, you good? </connor>
<connor> - Literally everyone in the cinemas </connor>
<connor> when I watched "Mugen Train"
was just light sobbing </connor>
<garnt> from every corner of the room. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, oh now?
- I've, I've- </garnt>
<connor> - This woman next to me
was like full on bawling. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, are you okay? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause to me, "Mugen Train", </garnt>
<connor> the thing that made
"Mugen Train" special was </connor>
<connor> that it actually felt cannon. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, it actually
felt like it had a real, </connor>
<connor> tangible effect on the story. </connor>
<connor> Whereas I know that "Jujutsu
Kaisen 0" is technically cannon </connor>
<connor> because it's technically
supposed to be a prequel, </connor>
<connor> but also it's starring a main character </connor>
<connor> that we hadn't seen before. </connor>
<connor> Um, and- </connor>
<connor> - No, it is cannon. </connor>
<connor> It's pretty cool. </connor>
<connor> - No, it is.
- It is cannon, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It is cannon, but it didn't
feel like anything I watched </joey>
<garnt> in the movie had any effect
to like anything I watched </garnt>
<garnt> in the TV series at all.
- Little bit, little bit. </garnt>
<garnt> Very minimal though. </garnt>
<connor> Like mainly to do with the bad guy. </connor>
<garnt> - Mainly to do with the bad guy. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I found out
spoilers from the people </garnt>
<connor> I was watching it with
and I was like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna spoil.
- Don't tell me, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna spoil, but it had like, </connor>
<connor> it didn't really have
that much of an effect. </connor>
<connor> It kind of felt like a
side story, if anything, </connor>
<garnt> rather than actually
having a proper, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I should care about all
the things going on. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that's my problem </garnt>
<garnt> with a lot shonen anime movies is </garnt>
<garnt> that there's zero reason for me to care </garnt>
<garnt> about anything going on. </garnt>
<connor> - We spoke about this last
time we spoke about movies. </connor>
<joey> - Literally every "One Piece" movie. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's a good experience,
but it is a bit odd, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think it's been number one </connor>
<connor> at the box office in
Japan for 10 weeks now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not even surprised.
- These things are just </joey>
<connor> money printers. </connor>
<connor> They're just money printers. </connor>
<connor> - After "Mugen Train," every
industry is eagle vision </connor>
<joey> on cinemas now. </joey>
<joey> That's where the money is. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it feels like the
industry is definitely gearing up </garnt>
<garnt> more towards movies
'cause like, yeah, we're- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, "Heaven's Feel"
was like fucking insane </joey>
<joey> as well for that three month
process of all those movies. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like when I got invited </garnt>
<garnt> to see "Jujutsu Kaisen," I thought, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, it's a bit late, isn't it? </garnt>
<joey> Is it still gonna be in cinemas? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I missed out on seeing "Dune," </joey>
<joey> because that was only in cinemas
for like a month and a half </joey>
<joey> or like maybe even less
in Japanese cinemas. </joey>
<joey> But with anime movies, </joey>
<garnt> it just seems like it just never goes out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, "Mugen Train" was
in cinemas for a year. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, like what? </joey>
<garnt> - A year. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like how is it, a year later,
people are still seeing it </garnt>
<connor> in cinemas, and they're still
making money off this shit. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I guess that's why it's
the top grossing anime movie </connor>
<connor> of all time. </connor>
<connor> But my time scale for how
long movies are in cinemas </connor>
<connor> are like completely fucking
destroyed by anime movies </connor>
<garnt> because they just never seem to go out. </garnt>
<garnt> They always seem to be in there. </garnt>
<joey> - How long has "Jujutsu Kaisen"
been in cinemas for now? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] A couple months. </joey>
<joey> - Didn't it come out in, </joey>
<connor> it came out Christmas Eve? </connor>
<joey> - Oh shit, so it's almost three months. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, almost three months.
- Yep. </garnt>
<joey> - And it doesn't seem like </joey>
<joey> it's even close,
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't seem like it's even close. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause they have
showings in 4XD, MXD or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> and have 3D, and they
have all the Dolby Atmos, </garnt>
<connor> and there's a fuck ton going still. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<garnt> - Like when I was stuck in Hokkaido, </garnt>
<garnt> because the airport has a cinema there, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh, maybe
I'll see what's playing. </garnt>
<garnt> Literally it was "Jujutsu Kaisen
0" for every single place. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] They didn't
have any other stuff? </connor>
<garnt> - No, they didn't have. </garnt>
<connor> - Was it just one screen
or was it multiple screens? </connor>
<garnt> - I believe it was two screens. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, that makes sense.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's a ton of
cinemas all around Tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> that have like 20 plus screens
or something ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And you can watch, there's
tons of foreign films, </connor>
<connor> so many of them. </connor>
<joey> - And you can watch "Jujutsu
Kaisen" on seven of them. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I watched, ah,
"Operation Mincement?" </connor>
<connor> That's what it's called? </connor>
<connor> The one with Colin Firth? </connor>
<connor> - That doesn't sound like a real movie. </connor>
<garnt> - Never heard of that, at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's about a World War II operation </garnt>
<garnt> where they made a fake person, </garnt>
<connor> but they got a real dead body
and gave it fake documents </connor>
<connor> and then washed it up in Spain. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, is that like
based off a true story? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it really happened. </joey>
<joey> - Oh wow. </joey>
<joey> - Really cool. </joey>
<joey> Really, really cool story. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] That's pretty dope. </connor>
<connor> - Basically, they wanted
to make Germany think </connor>
<connor> that the UK was gonna attack
somewhere they weren't. </connor>
<connor> And so the way they did it was
by floating a body to Spain, </connor>
<joey> with fake documents on it. </joey>
<joey> And then Spain leaked it to Germany, </joey>
<joey> and then Germany thought it was </joey>
<joey> real stuff.
- Dang. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they made this
person look so convincing </joey>
<joey> that they were a real person.
- Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty dope.
- Well that's- </joey>
<connor> - It's a really cool story,
but the movie was shit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay, is it a comedy?
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's a drama, but the problem, </connor>
<joey> I guess it wasn't shit. </joey>
<connor> It was a very- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] How could you
think that a comedy? </connor>
<joey> - Five or six out of 10. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Lol. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It focuses on the personal
drama amongst the people </connor>
<connor> who are doing the operation. </connor>
<connor> - Ah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] And so it's
kind of like a love- </connor>
<connor> - Like human drama biopic. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] It's like a
love triangle and shit. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, </connor>
<connor> this is a fucking war, what's going on? </connor>
<connor> - What do we, I didn't, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I was very disinterested. </connor>
<connor> - "The Notebook" of World War II. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was just kinda like, all right. </connor>
<connor> The thing is so interesting
itself that the whole story, </connor>
<joey> but obviously there's
not much known about it, </joey>
<joey> so they obviously had to make a drama </joey>
<joey> inside of it.
- Build it up. </joey>
<joey> - And so it's kind of like,
I mean, Colin Firth's great. </joey>
<garnt> He's always great. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it was just kinda like, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Just meh. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well like, like going
back to what you said </connor>
<connor> about, yeah, it was shit. </connor>
<garnt> I was having this thought the other day, </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm getting so bored
of the word mid, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because it just seems like, </garnt>
<garnt> I tweeted out a tweet about
fucking "Demon Slayer" </garnt>
<garnt> and the animation. </garnt>
<garnt> And somehow that was one of
the most toxic Twitter tweets. </garnt>
<connor> - You tweeted about
"Demon Slayer" animation? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Why would you do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - After what happened to me, Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Why would you do that? </connor>
<connor> - I just said "Demon
Slayer" had good animation. </connor>
<connor> That was it.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was just like, oh yeah, "Demon Slayer," </connor>
<connor> I watched season two, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, okay, maybe it
did deserve best animation. </joey>
<joey> My fucking God. </joey>
<joey> I literally had to mute
that thread, that thread, </joey>
<joey> compared to everything
else going on in the world, </joey>
<garnt> that was the thread that I
had to mute in the past week. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm gagging, just thinking
about that comment section. </joey>
<connor> - People are clowns, right? </connor>
<joey> It does have the best animation. </joey>
<joey> It's not even a contest, </joey>
<connor> but people say there's other
things that are better. </connor>
<connor> It's not. </connor>
<connor> Is the story the best? </connor>
<connor> No. </connor>
<connor> But people are equating the fact </connor>
<connor> that they don't like the show, </connor>
<connor> or they don't like how much
attention it's getting. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Being like, it doesn't
deserve the best animation. </connor>
<connor> Listen, it does. </connor>
<connor> Like it just flat out does. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Does that mean that it's a good show? </connor>
<connor> No, no it doesn't.
- No, no. </connor>
<connor> Is it a mid shonen
series, like story wise? </connor>
<connor> Yes, yes it is. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt gasping) </connor>
<connor> But the animation is fucking God tier. </connor>
<connor> - Whoa, whoa. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not associating
myself with that opinion. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Listen, I fucking love
"Demon Slayer," right? </joey>
<connor> But it's the same reason why I watch porn. </connor>
<connor> I like what's going on on the screen. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> I don't like the plot. </joey>
<connor> - That "I love Demon Slayer, but" </connor>
<connor> is the most paper thin,
- "I love Demon Slayer, but" </connor>
<connor> it's the most paper thin-
it's mid. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You heard it here first. </joey>
<connor> - I fucking, I was so
hype watching it, bro. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But to sit here and be like, </connor>
<joey> it's a complex storytelling.
- No, no. </joey>
<joey> - It's not. </joey>
<connor> - It's super simple shonen. </connor>
<connor> I think like- </connor>
<joey> - It's straightforward. </joey>
<connor> - What does mid mean to you? </connor>
<garnt> What does mid mean to you? </garnt>
<garnt> - Mid means to me that you can watch it </garnt>
<garnt> and there are many aspects
of it that you enjoy, </garnt>
<joey> but there's also a lot of aspects about it </joey>
<joey> that just don't grip you. </joey>
<joey> Like there's a lot about it that like- </joey>
<joey> - Like "Jujutsu Kaisen." </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - To me. </connor>
<garnt> - No, 'cause, I was having
this thinking, it seemed like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the story is mid, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - As an overall show, it's good. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the story is, you
know, slightly above mid. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's a solid story. </garnt>
<garnt> It does everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Slightly above mid. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It is such a fucking meme. </connor>
<joey> - That's like saying like
that's slightly above shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Listen, I-
- Is mid shit? </garnt>
<garnt> - The train movie? </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna say it, it was boring as fuck. </joey>
<joey> I was bored outta my mind watching that. </joey>
<joey> - The whole way? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> Okay, there was bits where it was good, </joey>
<joey> but like the first- </joey>
<joey> - First 60%.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The first like 70% of that movie, </joey>
<joey> I was actually like ResidentSleeper, bro. </joey>
<garnt> I was sleeping. </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree with you.
- Yeah, I agree. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, Goddamn! </connor>
<connor> - I think people forget that, </connor>
<connor> because everyone already
thinks about the last fight </connor>
<connor> and like the last 30
minutes of that movie. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause the last 30 minutes
were fucking great. </garnt>
<joey> They were fucking amazing.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> The actual part when they
were on the train was to me </garnt>
<joey> pretty, pretty boring.
- It was boring as fuck! </joey>
<garnt> It was pretty boring. </garnt>
<garnt> - The part where they
like go into the dreams, </garnt>
<joey> I was just like, snooze. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Literally snooze,
literally snooze, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] It's, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like, to me, </garnt>
<garnt> I had this realization
that to me, something shit, </garnt>
<garnt> when I say, oh yeah, it was pretty shit, </garnt>
<garnt> it was a five out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> To me that shit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas I dunno, why- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is a five out of 10 shit to you? </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno why. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me, that borders on average. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, but that the thing, </garnt>
<joey> you can-
- But when was the last </joey>
<connor> five out of 10 thing you've watched? </connor>
<connor> - You can tell yourself
that five out of 10 </connor>
<joey> in your head means that, but it doesn't. </joey>
<joey> Five out of 10 means that,
- Right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you're never gonna
give anything a one, </joey>
<joey> unless you really hate it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - You never hear anyone
giving a three or a four. </connor>
<connor> - See, 'cause in my
head like I'm operating </connor>
<joey> on the MyAnimeList rating score, right? </joey>
<garnt> - So when's the last
time you, in your mind, </garnt>
<garnt> gave something a five out of 10? </garnt>
<garnt> You could be watched, read, whatever. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, because seven out of 10 means </connor>
<garnt> that you didn't hate it, </garnt>
<garnt> but you were happy. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you had an experience
that you were happy with. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did it blow you away? </garnt>
<garnt> No. </garnt>
<connor> Five out of 10 means that you are not sure </connor>
<connor> if you wasted your time, </connor>
<connor> and that's why it feels
weird giving things </connor>
<connor> that you're like, it's mid, a five out 10. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I think a one out of 10 </garnt>
<garnt> isn't even wasting your time. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause at that point- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] That's an insult. </connor>
<joey> - At that point you watch a one out of 10, </joey>
<joey> you're like, this is just entertaining. </joey>
<joey> This is so shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this so bad that it's good. </joey>
<joey> - Like you watch "Ex-Arm,"
you watch "Berserk 2016," </joey>
<connor> you're like, okay, this is
obviously fucking terrible, </connor>
<garnt> but I'm having a good time watching this </garnt>
<connor> just to shit on it. </connor>
<connor> - But to me, it's like
five is at the middle </connor>
<connor> where it's like, all right, </connor>
<connor> if you do nothing good and nothing bad, </connor>
<connor> you get a five, right? </connor>
<joey> It's the most basic.
- No. </joey>
<joey> - No, to me a five out of
10, when it comes to anime, </joey>
<joey> to me a five out of 10 is
like I finish watching it, </joey>
<joey> I feel nothing about it, </joey>
<joey> and I forget about it in a couple weeks. </joey>
<connor> - Five out of 10 for me is
like, have I wasted my time? </connor>
<connor> I'm not sure. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, five out 10 to
me is have I wasted my time? </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> This was a waste of time. </garnt>
<garnt> It was- </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't get- </joey>
<garnt> - But it wasn't horrible, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - So what would you define as four? </connor>
<garnt> - It's because, huh? </garnt>
<connor> - What would you say four is then? </connor>
<garnt> - Four is, okay, here's four.
(Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Four to me is like, I'm
going to forget about this, </joey>
<joey> but all I'm going to
remember about this show </joey>
<joey> is that it was a waste of my time. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, because here's how- </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Here's how I think why, when
we say what the average, </garnt>
<garnt> when we say what the middle of the ground, </garnt>
<joey> what the average score is,
most people will say seven, </joey>
<joey> even though logically you think it's five. </joey>
<joey> - It's five, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Okay so if it's a five, </joey>
<joey> it's probably like the lowest </joey>
<joey> that you will ever finish a show. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause to me, if it's a three or four, </joey>
<joey> I watch one or two episodes,
and I didn't even finish it, </joey>
<connor> because there's nothing in
that to grab my attention. </connor>
<connor> Five is just like, there was
enough for me to finish it </connor>
<connor> and then I regret finishing
it because it was- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay, I understand that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because there was nothing in there </connor>
<garnt> that made me want to remember
it or left an impact on me. </garnt>
<joey> - But the five out of tens
are like, in my opinion, </joey>
<joey> they're the worst shows
because they're just thrown </joey>
<joey> into this pile of like,
oh yeah, that existed. </joey>
<joey> - What would you give
"Jujutsu Kaisen" out of 10? </joey>
<joey> - I'd give it like a seven. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, that's fair then. </joey>
<connor> - It's because it's like,
- And that's mid, seven? </connor>
<connor> No, no, I wouldn't consider that mid. </connor>
<joey> It's okay.
- It's slightly above mid. </joey>
<joey> - It's okay. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - See to me, right, when you say seven, </connor>
<connor> seven to me is like, you were
happy and had fun watching it, </connor>
<connor> but the moment it's over, </connor>
<connor> you don't feel compelled
by the show at all. </connor>
<connor> There's nothing that makes it
really stick in your memory. </connor>
<connor> It's a good experience
and you don't regret it, </connor>
<connor> but nothing after the fact
makes you want to actively </connor>
<connor> think about it.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing, it's
like with "Jujutsu Kaisen," </connor>
<connor> I finished it. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I had a pretty
good time watching it. </joey>
<connor> I was like, okay, yeah, this is good. </connor>
<joey> But when it was finished, I was like, </joey>
<joey> am I compelled to go read the manga </joey>
<joey> or like continue it on? </joey>
<joey> Not exactly. </joey>
<joey> To me, "My Hero Academia"
is the exact same thing </joey>
<joey> where season one, yeah, it was great. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was cool. </joey>
<joey> You know, I can see why people enjoyed it. </joey>
<joey> I had a pretty good time with it. </joey>
<joey> Am I compelled to continue on with it? </joey>
<joey> Personally, no. </joey>
<connor> - What would you give the, </connor>
<connor> did you watch the new
"Demon Slayer" season yet? </connor>
<joey> Have you watched it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What would you give it? </connor>
<connor> I, personally, even though I
said the story is not the best, </connor>
<joey> I still think it's like
an eight or a nine. </joey>
<joey> - I'd give like solid eight. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] It went hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would give it an 8.5 to nine. </garnt>
<garnt> And the reason I say that is- </garnt>
<connor> - We're all in agreement. </connor>
<garnt> The Demon Slayer Councilors Society. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Strong eight, strong eight. </garnt>
<connor> - It was amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I don't agree
that the story is mid, </garnt>
<connor> because a lot of people say the story </connor>
<connor> of "Demon Slayer" is mid, </connor>
<joey> and to me "Demon Slayer's" story, </joey>
<joey> it's as simple as it needs to be, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like it's as
simple as it needs to be </joey>
<joey> to make the rest of the good parts shine. </joey>
<joey> - Mm. </joey>
<joey> - The problem with "Demon
Slayer" is when you have an arc, </joey>
<joey> like "Mugen Train", and there are fights </joey>
<joey> that don't stand out as much, </joey>
<joey> it's really, really
apparent, that the story </joey>
<connor> and the characters don't
carry the show as much. </connor>
<connor> - Mm. </connor>
<connor> - But with season two, </connor>
<connor> because half the season was a
fucking full on action fest, </connor>
<connor> You're like,
- So good. </connor>
<connor> you're like, fucking hell, </connor>
<connor> this is like an eight or nine out of 10. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's the point where, okay, </connor>
<connor> I don't really care
about the story that much </connor>
<connor> if the action just
fucking slaps this hard. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How dare you say-
- You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> How dare you say the animation is good. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think we ever talked about that </garnt>
<joey> on the podcast, have we?
- You should be ashamed. </joey>
<joey> You should be fucking ashamed. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm too afraid to. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I've been on the
other side quite recently. </garnt>
<garnt> - Getting canceled about
talking about the animation? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just trying to
think of a five out of 10. </joey>
<joey> This is the problem
with trying to remember </joey>
<joey> a five out of 10 anime show,
is that I don't remember. </joey>
<garnt> That's why they're five
out of 10, you know? </garnt>
<joey> The moment I finish-
- What about manga? </joey>
<joey> What about manga? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause you read more manga. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I can remember
- He is Joey the Manga Lad. </connor>
<connor> most five out of 10 shows. </connor>
<connor> It's literally, I go to the
list of isekai I've finished, </connor>
<garnt> and a lot of these are
literally five out of 10. </garnt>
<joey> - Even five out of 10 manga,
I just don't remember them. </joey>
<joey> And that's the problem,
it's so hard to talk </joey>
<joey> about these kinds of like mediocre, </joey>
<joey> middle of the ground shows, </joey>
<joey> it's because unless I
recently re-watch it again, </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna remember it. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh yeah, it's probably something </joey>
<joey> along those lines, but
I wouldn't be able to </joey>
<joey> concretely tell you this is the reason </joey>
<joey> why it's a five out of 10. </joey>
<joey> It's just so impactless
that it's like, oh, </joey>
<joey> I didn't even know that existed. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you feel bad if you
feel like you've wasted time </garnt>
<garnt> watching a show? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Um. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Just no. </garnt>
<connor> - You don't? </connor>
<connor> - No? </connor>
<connor> - No, I feel like when you start caring </connor>
<joey> that much about the media, you're, </joey>
<joey> the media why, sounds like the media, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] The media, the system. </joey>
<connor> - About the stuff you're consuming, </connor>
<connor> I feel like you almost ruin
a lot of it for yourself. </connor>
<connor> Like stuff that you might have enjoyed, </connor>
<connor> you're worried too much
about if you're enjoying it </connor>
<connor> the whole time. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that's kind of where I got to, </joey>
<joey> unfortunately, with that. </joey>
<joey> It got to the point
where I was so selective </joey>
<joey> on what I was watching to
make sure that everything </joey>
<joey> I was watching was worth my time. </joey>
<joey> That if I ran into something
that I was like, well, </joey>
<joey> I just wasted an hour </joey>
<joey> because of watching these
first three episodes. </joey>
<connor> Great. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno if this is like a, </connor>
<connor> I haven't consciously chosen to do this, </connor>
<connor> but I've stopped scrolling
or looking for shows. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just kind of whatever
appears in front of you? </joey>
<connor> - Whatever is recommended, </connor>
<connor> whatever is put in my head or- </connor>
<joey> - I think that's the
best way to consume media </joey>
<joey> to be honest.
- And honestly, </joey>
<garnt> I've been having a great time. </garnt>
<connor> I feel no pressure.
- I honestly wish, </connor>
<connor> I honestly wish I could do that because- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] You have to watch anime. </connor>
<connor> - Well, no, it's not even anime. </connor>
<connor> It's like pretty much every form of media, </connor>
<connor> and it's not even about me
being like a fucking snob, </connor>
<connor> wanting to like consume the best shit. </connor>
<connor> It's literally, I started
really caring about it </connor>
<connor> when I just didn't have
the time to do everything </connor>
<connor> I wanted to do, right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So like now nowadays, even if
it's just like picking a game, </connor>
<garnt> I want it to be a game I
could properly get into. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I don't want- </garnt>
<connor> - But you'll be stuck in this cycle </connor>
<connor> of constantly worrying if
the game is good enough </connor>
<joey> for your time and then you never play it. </joey>
<joey> - You'll never start, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You never fucking play anything. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's why- </connor>
<connor> - I feel games are way more of a time sink </connor>
<joey> than an anime on average. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, it depends. </garnt>
<garnt> But to me getting into a game, </garnt>
<garnt> getting properly absorbed into a game, </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of the most magical experiences, </garnt>
<garnt> and I love fucking it
- Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> when I just get absorbed
into a video game world, </garnt>
<garnt> the same way that I get
absorbed into an anime </garnt>
<garnt> or absorbed into a manga
or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like, to me, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> because my time is so
precious to me right now, </garnt>
<garnt> it sucks that I constantly
have to have this little part </garnt>
<garnt> of my head that's just like,
oh, could you be watching </garnt>
<garnt> something better that you'd
enjoy maybe a little bit more? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Are you really in the mood for this? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> You optimize your schedule
in every way, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So I feel like the
stuff that you consume </connor>
<connor> should be the one where
you're like, no pressure, </connor>
<connor> like whatever you watch,
whatever you play, </connor>
<connor> doesn't matter if it wasn't
the game of the year. </connor>
<connor> Doesn't matter if it wasn't
the movie of the year. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just watch whatever comes
up, have an opinion on it. </connor>
<connor> I watched that "Don't Look Up." </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What a shit movie. </connor>
<connor> - The DiCaprio one, right?
- What an awful movie. </connor>
<connor> - That was a five out of 10. </connor>
<connor> - I hated that movie. </connor>
<garnt> - You hated that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I hated it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I heard a lot of people hated it. </garnt>
<joey> - I was so fucking bored. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it went on for an an
hour longer than it needed to. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - And, yeah, there was
some funny moments of it. </joey>
<joey> There was some bits that I chuckled, </joey>
<joey> but overall I just felt like </joey>
<joey> I wasted my time.
- A waste of time? </joey>
<joey> But I was like, I'm glad I watched this </joey>
<joey> because it gave me, even though I came out </joey>
<joey> disliking the movie, for some
reason that made me happy. </joey>
<joey> I was like, yeah, that was shit. </joey>
<connor> And it was fun getting
to talk to other people </connor>
<joey> who also thought it was shit. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I just liked it. </joey>
<joey> I liked that I had </joey>
<connor> that experience.
- I think as well </connor>
<joey> because, even if you do
consume something that is shit </joey>
<connor> within that specific medium, </connor>
<connor> it just broadens your
horizon more on the medium. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it adds to the
knowledge pool of like, oh, </connor>
<connor> now that I've consumed
something on the other side </connor>
<connor> of the spectrum, now I'm a
little bit more knowledgeable </connor>
<connor> about what makes the
good shit good, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm definitely like that
with music where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> if it's on fucking Spotify,
I'm just listening to it. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> I watched as well, I watched
Spiderman movie, the new one. </connor>
<connor> - Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And like, yeah, it was great, </garnt>
<garnt> because it was just great,
and I had a good time, </garnt>
<joey> my emotions are way stronger
about "Don't Look Up." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Really? </joey>
<joey> - I hated it. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - You have more to talk about, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I have more, </joey>
<joey> I watched "No Way Home"
and I had a great time, </joey>
<garnt> but at the end of the day, I've
already forgotten about it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't care. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was, yeah, it was
good, but it was just- </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a movie I fucking loved. </garnt>
<garnt> - I liked it a lot, but
after I'm done with it, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, that was everything
I expected it to be. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And I had fun, but I don't
feel strongly about it. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's the thing
though, the problem is </joey>
<joey> I think the sweet spot of you
being able to really gush out </joey>
<connor> about something is like
when it's on two ends </connor>
<connor> of the spectrum, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas it's either
so fucking incredible, </connor>
<connor> 10 out of 10 masterpiece </connor>
<connor> where you can just gush about
your love for it forever. </connor>
<joey> And then there's the other
side where it's like, </joey>
<joey> let me tell you about
how absolutely atrocious </joey>
<joey> this shit was. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, dude, I watched, </connor>
<connor> could you Google this for me, Ashley? </connor>
<connor> It's Robert Pattinson's movie. </connor>
<connor> I forgot the name. </connor>
<joey> Fuck, I watched it like three weeks ago. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] The new one. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, it's an old one. </joey>
<joey> - Must've been a five out of 10. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right?
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> Must have been a five out of ten. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It was amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<joey> - Oh okay, that's just him. </joey>
<joey> - Was it "Good time?" "Good Time?" </joey>
<garnt> I can't remember what it's called. </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor remembers the shit things </garnt>
<garnt> and forgets good things apparently. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] "Good Time." </garnt>
<garnt> - "Good Time." </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, dude, "Good Time?" </garnt>
<connor> Please fucking watch "Good Time." </connor>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<connor> This movie was amazing.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Was it a good time? </connor>
<joey> - I want you to watch it so
badly so we can talk about it. </joey>
<joey> - What's it about? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't wanna say anything, but- </garnt>
<joey> - Just go into it blind? </joey>
<joey> - Have you watched "Uncut Gems?" </joey>
<joey> - No.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> You know how it's just anxiety simulator? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's that. </connor>
<connor> And like- </connor>
<connor> - Great. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It is literally
like anxiety simulation. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<connor> It's amazing. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like a movie
that when you watch it, </connor>
<connor> I just felt like this was just, </connor>
<connor> I'm so glad I watched this movie. </connor>
<connor> I just felt like I had
experienced something special </connor>
<connor> that a lot of love and care went into, </connor>
<garnt> and that everyone really
just brought their A-game. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Please watch it.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of Robert Pattinson's movies- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it still in cinemas? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, it came out years ago. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Came out 2017. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So, again, go and watch it. </connor>
<connor> It's really good. </connor>
<connor> I absolutely adore all of his stuff. </connor>
<garnt> I think he's really
good in a lot of things. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm really hype for him as Batman. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm hype for him.
- I'm hype as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every movie I've watched
with him after "Twilight," </garnt>
<connor> he chose weird ass roles
that were just so good, </connor>
<joey> and he just nailed it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But that's what I love about
- So hype for him as Batman. </connor>
<connor> actors like that though, </connor>
<connor> because Daniel Radcliffe did
the exact same thing, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, usually
those like super popular </connor>
<connor> typecasted actors who are like, </connor>
<connor> now people are just gonna
know me as this shit forever. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm just gonna go </connor>
<joey> and do all the weird.
- All the weird shit. </joey>
<garnt> - All the weird, artsy,
Daniel Radcliffe movies, </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen so many of them
and they're just like, </garnt>
<connor> man, fucking respects, dude. </connor>
<connor> You can do shit like this. </connor>
<connor> And now he's doing Broadway shit? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - He was doing that that
right after, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fucking great. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, good on you, dude. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like actors going
weird and doing weird films </connor>
<connor> is like the actor equivalent </connor>
<connor> of the YouTuber getting their hair dyed. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like, guys, I want an image change. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna
do a bunch of weird shit now. </connor>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<joey> - Sure, they've all gone on,
like Shia LaBeouf as well, </joey>
<joey> doing all the weird
shit afterwards as well. </joey>
<joey> - Which one did he do? </joey>
<joey> Nymphoma-? </joey>
<joey> - "Nymphomaniac." </joey>
<joey> - That was a weird watch.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Have you watched that, Garnt? </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I want Garnt to watch this. </connor>
<connor> - "Nymphomaniac?"
- What's that about? </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What's the fucking director's name? </connor>
<connor> It's the really weird- </connor>
<connor> - You know what a nymphomaniac is, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's about nymphomania. </connor>
<joey> - You know that's a three parter, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's three part, it's a trilogy? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, it's two parts, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Lars von Trier. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lars von Trier. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, it's a Lars von Trier film. </connor>
<connor> - It's two parts, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] Two.
- Yeah, two. </connor>
<connor> - Is it two parts?
- It's two, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was like what are you about three parts? </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] Uh, yeah, two. </connor>
<connor> Volume one and two. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Not of "Nymphomaniac," of that universe. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<connor> No, the one with Shia
LaBeouf movies are two. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I watched them and- </connor>
<connor> - It's a universe? </connor>
<connor> - It's a trilogy of Lars von Trier movies, </connor>
<connor> and "Nymphomaniac" I
think is the third one. </connor>
<connor> Something like that.
- You, you should see it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, right?
It is weird. </connor>
<joey> - It is a fucking weird movie. </joey>
<connor> It's uncomfortable, and it-
- It's weird, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's like Lars von Trier
- He's fucking weird. </joey>
<connor> is known to make some
really disturbing movies. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Very disturbing,
very disturbing. </connor>
<connor> - And "Nymphomaniac" is probably, </connor>
<connor> I've seen all of the Lar von Trier movies, </connor>
<connor> and "Nymphomaniac" is easily
the fucking weirdest one. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, oh, Shia LaBeouf's in it. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<connor> - You just go from "Even
Stevens," "Shut up, sis," </connor>
<joey> and it's like, oh gosh. </joey>
<joey> Oh God! </joey>
<joey> Jesus.
- Oh good. </joey>
<joey> I didn't wish to see
Shia LaBeouf's butt hole </joey>
<connor> in three different scenes. </connor>
<joey> But there it is, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't mean to watch this movie. </joey>
<joey> It came on the TV. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, where did you, how did you see it? </joey>
<joey> It was on TV? </joey>
<joey> - It was on TV. </joey>
<connor> I was in a hotel, and like- </connor>
<joey> - Isn't it an X-rated movie? </joey>
<joey> - I think it was in Bulgaria, </joey>
<garnt> and it was on TV or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - You watched it in Bulgaria.
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I know I watched it
in a European country, </connor>
<garnt> and it was on TV at like
2:00am, and I couldn't sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> And I watched it just,
I remember just thinking </garnt>
<connor> what the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> - Must have felt like
a fucking fever dream. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It was weird. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, anything Lars von Trier makes </connor>
<joey> is a fucking fever dream. </joey>
<joey> - It's weird, man. </joey>
<garnt> - How do you guys think like
trash TV fits into everything? </garnt>
<garnt> Would you call trash T, </garnt>
<joey> what rating would you
give "Kitchen Nightmares" </joey>
<joey> or something like that? </joey>
<garnt> Or "90 Day Fiance?" </garnt>
<joey> - I think it just depends 'cause people, </joey>
<connor> it depends if you grew
up on it or not, right? </connor>
<connor> Were you surrounded- </connor>
<joey> - I like the character of Gordon Ramsay? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm invested in that character. </connor>
<joey> I like it. </joey>
<connor> I know that most of it, especially
in "Kitchen Nightmares," </connor>
<joey> are all faked. </joey>
<joey> I don't a shit.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But also that's the thing. </connor>
<joey> It depends on if you were
raised in a family where </joey>
<connor> it was a family event to be like, </connor>
<connor> oh it's Wednesday night, let's
watch "Kitchen Nightmares." </connor>
<connor> You know, that kind of thing, right? </connor>
<connor> I didn't grow up in a family </connor>
<connor> like that.
- No. </connor>
<connor> So to me, I didn't grow
up with trash TV at all. </connor>
<connor> So, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We never watched it together. </connor>
<joey> I watched it on YouTube.
- Yeah, so when I watched, </joey>
<joey> Oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> So the first time I knew
about "Kitchen Nightmares" </connor>
<connor> was through YouTube clips, right? </connor>
<garnt> Or any TLC show, right? </garnt>
<joey> I was like, what the
fuck is this, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, just 'cause I
knew "Kitchen Nightmares" </garnt>
<garnt> because that was literally </garnt>
<connor> when I first saw Gordon Ramsay as well. </connor>
<connor> It was the British "Kitchen
Nightmares" as well, </connor>
<connor> which was, you compare
British "Kitchen Nightmares" </connor>
<connor> to American "Kitchen Nightmares" </connor>
<joey> and it's like fucking night and day. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> Not only the editing, </joey>
<joey> but just how toned down
Gordon Ramsay is as well. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> Toned down in the British one? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he's toned down.
- He's chill, he's chill. </joey>
<joey> It's different, right,
'cause it feels like </joey>
<joey> in the American one, it
feels like they actually get- </joey>
<joey> - There's a formula. </joey>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> It is a formula, but
it feels like they get </connor>
<connor> the worst of the worst
fucking chefs and restaurants, </connor>
<connor> actual clowns. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - To present their dish to Gordon Ramsay. </connor>
<joey> And it's almost cartoonish in a way. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you look at the British one </joey>
<joey> and it feels like it's just chefs </joey>
<joey> who actually give shit a about their food. </joey>
<joey> Who actually just- </joey>
<joey> - Who need some advice. </joey>
<joey> - Who need some advice. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of the times Gordon
Ramsey is giving them </joey>
<joey> genuine advice and maybe
they're too it headstrong </joey>
<joey> or maybe they're too, you
know, prideful to really listen </joey>
<joey> to his advice. </joey>
<joey> Whereas, you know, in America
it actually feels more like </joey>
<joey> this is not even a reality TV anymore. </joey>
<joey> This looks so cartoony,
and feels so over the top </joey>
<garnt> that you just don't
even take it seriously. </garnt>
<joey> - I just feel that way about
99% of American trash TV. </joey>
<connor> - No, you know which one I hate the most? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What? </connor>
<connor> - I hate it 'cause I used
to also watch it a lot. </connor>
<connor> The fucking "Pawn Stars." </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What's that one?
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You know it, it's the,
you know, "Pawn Stars." </connor>
<connor> - It's the one, it's set in Vegas. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - It's the one with the bald
guy and someone comes in, </connor>
<connor> he is like, I've got this
thing worth 20 million dollars, </connor>
<connor> and he's like, I'll give
you 10 bucks for it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh! </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I thought you said porn stars. </joey>
<connor> - Like pawn. </connor>
<connor> - We're British.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> We pronounce it the same way, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - "Pawn Stars." </joey>
<garnt> - Unfortunately, we're not American </garnt>
<connor> where they're like "Pawn Stars." </connor>
<connor> - "Pawn Stars." </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was- </connor>
<connor> - We say porn. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was a fucking
show about little porn stars. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I was like, what is this reality TV show? </garnt>
<joey> - There's "Pawn Stars," </joey>
<joey> and there's also "Hardcore Pawn" as well, </joey>
<joey> which is the other one that
was a spin off to that. </joey>
<connor> - There was a British
version of it as well </connor>
<connor> which is just like- </connor>
<garnt> - What was it called? </garnt>
<garnt> Pawn, innit? </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably. </garnt>
<garnt> - Car Boot Salers
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> or something like that, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that show is just,
'cause it's obviously fake, </connor>
<joey> but also at the same time,
you're like, it is just cool </joey>
<connor> just seeing weird brought shit in. </connor>
<joey> - I've driven past the "Pawn Stars" place </joey>
<connor> in Vegas.
- But, it's fake. </connor>
<joey> They don't even film it in there, right? </joey>
<joey> It's filmed somewhere else.
- They don't actually film it </joey>
<joey> in there. </joey>
<joey> They just film B-roll outside of it. </joey>
<joey> - And it's just like- </joey>
<joey> - Because it's in the
most ghetto part of Vegas. </joey>
<joey> It's so scary. </joey>
<connor> - And then, you know, there'll
be, this guy comes in. </connor>
<connor> He'll be like, I have
this mummified corpse </connor>
<connor> that's been sitting in my
grandma's attic in Nevada. </connor>
<joey> You're like, great. </joey>
<connor> He's like, oh, you know, I know an expert. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna bring him down.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And 10 seconds later, the
experts then he's like, </connor>
<connor> well it is a mummified corpse. </connor>
<connor> It's worth about $50,000. </connor>
<connor> And then he goes, I'll
give you 20 bucks for it. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> What am I gonna do with
the mummified corpse? </connor>
<joey> What are we gonna do with that? </joey>
<joey> That's just so dumb. </joey>
<connor> The whole formula is shit. </connor>
<joey> - And then they just walk out angrily. </joey>
<joey> It's like, you're missing
out on a great deal, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, what I didn't
understand about "Pawn Stars" </garnt>
<joey> is when they started
introducing story lines, like- </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - B Plots, they're B Plots. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they're would be
B-Line plots with their family </connor>
<connor> that would get resolved in an episode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like it's an episode of "Happy Days" </connor>
<garnt> or something like that.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Same as "Storage Wars" as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I remember "Storage Wars." </garnt>
<connor> - That was so big in the UK. </connor>
<joey> The American one played on UK television </joey>
<joey> so fucking much.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It was so popular, it was ridiculous. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I just, yeah, thinking
back on it I used, yeah, </joey>
<connor> that was the one actually trash TV </connor>
<connor> that came on Australian TV all the time. </connor>
<joey> And my dad was obsessed with it. </joey>
<connor> - I just loved it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause there would literally
be a pile of shit in this room, </connor>
<connor> and these guys be like
sell that for 50 bucks, </connor>
<connor> sell that for 20 bucks. </connor>
<joey> Like where are you gonna sell this to? </joey>
<connor> There's like a used bed sheet, he's like, </connor>
<joey> that's five bucks right there. </joey>
<joey> It's like, no, it's not. </joey>
<joey> You're not selling this for five bucks. </joey>
<connor> - What if, though, it's all connected? </connor>
<joey> The trash TV universe where they- </joey>
<joey> - The trash TV universe. </joey>
<joey> - In "Storage Wars" they take all the shit </joey>
<connor> and then they go to the "Pawn Stars" place </connor>
<connor> to sell it off.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I just don't get, I don't get it. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause half the time, you know, </joey>
<joey> of course there'll be these fake ones </joey>
<connor> that'll be like, this guy has a lot full </connor>
<connor> of perfect rarity Charizards </connor>
<connor> in perfect grade.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's like, well obviously
we can sell those. </connor>
<connor> But other times there's
just lots or something </connor>
<connor> where it's just all shit. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, even if
you could make a profit </connor>
<connor> selling this, surely the amount of time </connor>
<connor> to get rid of all of this shit and sell it </connor>
<connor> is just not worth it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] No. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you could sell the pack
of AA batteries for 10 bucks </connor>
<connor> if you really wanted
to, but why would you? </connor>
<connor> Where are you gonna sell this to? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Are you shipping it? </connor>
<connor> Surely that has to be taken </connor>
<connor> into account.
- Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - This is the only country
where I see that working, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, where you can
actually sell the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and people will buy it and reuse it. </garnt>
<connor> - They do have storage lots in Japan. </connor>
<connor> I don't think they sell them, do they? </connor>
<garnt> When they, when they- </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't, I'm pretty
sure they don't sell them. </connor>
<garnt> - They actually use storage
for storage purposes. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but the storage lots, </joey>
<joey> I think if somebody doesn't collect it, </joey>
<joey> I think they just get
rid of all the stuff. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, they just throw it all out. </joey>
<connor> - Don't think they sell
them to the public, </connor>
<connor> which would be shame. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause we need a Japan
"Storage Wars" version. </garnt>
<garnt> That would be- </garnt>
<garnt> - "Storage Wars!" </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Dude, that would be epic. </connor>
<connor> Tanaka-san thinks </connor>
<garnt> he can get a great deal.
- Directed by Hosoda Mamoru. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I can't, what? </connor>
<connor> I think I know more
American reality TV shows </connor>
<joey> than I know British reality TV shows. </joey>
<joey> I can't think of many- </joey>
<joey> - We have- </joey>
<joey> - You guys have </joey>
<joey> "Naked Attraction."
- You know the one- </joey>
<joey> - We do have </joey>
<joey> "Naked Attraction."
- No, no, no, no- </joey>
<joey> - I love that show. </joey>
<joey> - When I went back to the
UK, that was still on TV. </joey>
<connor> It was still airing </connor>
<connor> on Channel 4.
- I love that show. </connor>
<connor> - You know, the ones that actually I, </connor>
<connor> there's a reality TV show
where you feel bad watching it. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - But even if it's, I dunno
how much of it's fake, </joey>
<joey> but you know the debt collectors one? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's the one where I'm
always, even if this is fake, </joey>
<garnt> should we really be </garnt>
<garnt> making storylines?
- Which one is that one? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a bunch in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> We fucking love debt collecting shows </connor>
<joey> in the UK for some reason. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - We love watching debt collectors </joey>
<connor> as long as we're not
on the butt end of it. </connor>
<connor> - So what's the premise? </connor>
<connor> - Just-
- They go and collect debts. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like Jim
owes the bank $50,000. </connor>
<joey> So Jeremy over here is
gonna go over to his house </joey>
<joey> and collect it. </joey>
<connor> Let's see what happens. </connor>
<connor> - But in the British one, it's just </connor>
<connor> some guy goes to the house, </connor>
<connor> hey, we've come here to get the stuff, </connor>
<connor> and they're like, fuck off, mate. </connor>
<connor> No, you're not fucking getting my thing. </connor>
<connor> Fuck right off. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, they've
got a high magistrates </connor>
<joey> court notice to collect this stuff. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> If they don't, they'll
start collecting things </joey>
<joey> off the property. </joey>
<joey> And then the police turn up
and then it's just fucked. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like, oh these poor people </joey>
<joey> who've had some horrible circumstance, </joey>
<joey> and then we're just shoving
cameras in their face </joey>
<connor> while their apartments being ransacked </connor>
<connor> and they're selling the stuff off. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, they should have
- It's like how do you feel? </connor>
<connor> paid their debts.
Tell me how you feel. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they probably
should pay their debts. </connor>
<connor> But wouldn't everyone pay
their debts if they could? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Wait, is it called </joey>
<joey> "Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away?" </joey>
<connor> - That's it? </connor>
<joey> What a stupid name. </joey>
<joey> - "Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away?" </joey>
<garnt> - I have never heard of that name before. </garnt>
<connor> - You've watched it. </connor>
<joey> It's on Channel 5. </joey>
<garnt> - Day in the life </garnt>
<connor> of a repo man.
- I don't watch Channel 5. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna send you links. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think I've ever
watched a single program. </garnt>
<connor> on Channel 5. </connor>
<connor> - I guarantee if you watch
one, you'll get hooked. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Is Channel 5
the trash TV channel? </joey>
<joey> - It's just the trash channel. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's so addictive watching this stuff. </joey>
<connor> I dunno why,
- Like to me Channel 4- </connor>
<connor> you just can't help yourself. </connor>
<connor> - But to me like Channel 4 is </connor>
<connor> where a lot of the trash TV goes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Even though I can't think of any. </connor>
<connor> - No, Channel 4 has good stuff too though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but Channel 4 is, </connor>
<connor> I think Channel 4 is actually
one of the best channels. </connor>
<connor> It has the widest range. </connor>
<connor> It seems to be the most
experimental as well. </connor>
<connor> BBC is just very standard. </connor>
<connor> Here's your fucking "Doctor Who." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] "The Voice." </connor>
<connor> - Here's "The Voice" . </connor>
<connor> ITV is just like here's
"X Factor" once again. </connor>
<joey> That's a reality TV show actually. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] "Britain's Got Talent" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's a reality TV show. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I completely forgot. </joey>
<garnt> That's reality TV show times
a hundred though, right? </garnt>
<connor> - But no one cares about singing reality. </connor>
<connor> Does is "X Factor" still going? </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Huh? </joey>
<joey> - Does anyone, is "X
Factor" still happening? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I'm sure. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure it's still happening. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] But does anyone give a fuck? </connor>
<joey> - "Love Island" as well? </joey>
<joey> "Love island," is that ITV? </joey>
<connor> I feel like that's ITV. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It is ITV. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so you got like, I feel- </garnt>
<connor> - But that's really
popular America as well, </connor>
<garnt> the British one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Is it? </garnt>
<connor> - It's really popular in America. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, it is. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, "The Great British
Bake Off" as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I completely forgot about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which can't be called
Bake Off in the US. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - One of the US brands has the trademark. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, like Easy Bake? </joey>
<joey> - One of them has the
trademark to "Bake Off." </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Bake Off. </connor>
<connor> - So it's called
something else in America, </connor>
<garnt> and they've had to- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Cook off? </garnt>
<garnt> - Something. </garnt>
<garnt> They've had to actually, on Netflix, </garnt>
<connor> they've had to animate over
certain parts of the show where, </connor>
<connor> the trophy.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> They did CGI where they
changed what the trophy said. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Oh, its called "The
Great American Baking Show." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - "The Great American </joey>
<joey> Baking Show!"
- What? </joey>
<connor> Yeah, because they didn't have the rights </connor>
<joey> for the word bake off.
- Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause for some reason a
company owns the rights </joey>
<joey> for the word bake off, which is weird. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, they changed it. </joey>
<connor> So that is popular in the US, </connor>
<connor> but it's called technically
something different. </connor>
<connor> - The baking show. </connor>
<garnt> - The Great British Baking Show. </garnt>
<joey> Just doesn't roll off in tongues as well. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds so stiff. </joey>
<joey> - I know, right? </joey>
<joey> I know. </joey>
<garnt> Does Australia have any reality TV shows? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, we've got "Australian Idol" </joey>
<joey> and "The Voice Australia"
and all that shit. </joey>
<joey> - How did "The Voice" get popular? </joey>
<garnt> At which point in time did we decide </garnt>
<garnt> we need more than one
singing reality TV show. </garnt>
<garnt> When was "X Factor" just not enough. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's because
shows like "X Factor" </joey>
<joey> and "American Idol"
where a lot of the times </joey>
<connor> there was contention of
are they judging them </connor>
<connor> on their actual singing
or are they judging them </connor>
<connor> on their performance?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> So people are like, we want to know </joey>
<connor> if they can actually sing
and looks don't matter. </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<joey> Like that whole fucking,
you know, inclusive thing. </joey>
<connor> - I just hate how they treat
you, the audience as idiots </connor>
<connor> and feed you these garbage storylines. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I also get confused about the judges </joey>
<garnt> on a lot of these shows. </garnt>
<garnt> - "X Factor" has, or
"Britain's Got Talent," </garnt>
<garnt> has fucking ruined so
many fucking songs for me. </garnt>
<joey> Just because they use
at the emotional point. </joey>
<joey> If I hear "You Raise Me
Up" one more fucking time. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's always "You Raise Me Up" right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, like Golden Buzzer </joey>
<garnt> "You Raise Me Up."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the "X Factor," </connor>
<connor> wait, they didn't win, Susan Boyle, right? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Did Susan Boyle win? </joey>
<connor> No, she came second, right? </connor>
<joey> - I can't remember.
- Did Susan Boyle win? </joey>
<connor> - So that is the peak
of how TV manipulates- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Us to just wanna, you know, </connor>
<connor> they'll give you an underdog,
and they've got a sad story. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, I've never had a boyfriend. </connor>
<connor> Oh, oh no.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> You know, and the show doesn't give a shit </connor>
<connor> they haven't had a boyfriend, </connor>
<connor> but they're like, look audience care. </connor>
<garnt> Care about this, care about this. </garnt>
<garnt> They do it all the time as
well with military stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, they'll be
someone who wants to compete </connor>
<connor> who maybe like served in
Afghanistan or something. </connor>
<connor> And instead of just being
like, hey, this is the talent. </connor>
<connor> It's like, no, you are the
guy who went to Afghanistan. </connor>
<connor> Your whole identity is
about going to Afghanistan, </connor>
<connor> and you're doing this for your
troops back in Afghanistan, </connor>
<connor> 'cause their one last wish
is to see you perform. </connor>
<connor> That's what they do, that's what they do. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was watching a thing
with Chris in the hotel room, </connor>
<connor> and it was a "Britain's Got Talent" person </connor>
<connor> who was performing magic, and
they served in the military. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was just insulting
how they almost shoved it </garnt>
<garnt> down your throat. </garnt>
<connor> This is the guy's only
reality as a human being, </connor>
<connor> that he served in a war. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Can we not just be people? </connor>
<joey> Do we have to just shove down
these suggestible stories? </joey>
<connor> - How about you follow
the name of your show </connor>
<joey> and just be like, do you have a talent? </joey>
<connor> Yes or no? </connor>
<connor> - But this is not about that. </connor>
<connor> It's about how's your story compelling. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So in this magic show, </connor>
<connor> this guy's doing these tricks and stuff, </connor>
<connor> and not to minimize it, </connor>
<connor> but it was almost beat
for beat predictable. </connor>
<connor> and there's this one
trick where he was doing, </connor>
<connor> and he was like, oh, look the
clock and tell me the time. </connor>
<connor> And so right before the
point of this trick goes, </connor>
<connor> I was like Chris, 'cause
Chris is watching it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, I bet
it's the time where one </connor>
<connor> of his friends died or
something in the war. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I shit you not, two
seconds later he's like, </connor>
<joey> that's the time when my friend passed. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, don't get me wrong. </connor>
<garnt> I wanna say that that is
obviously horrific and stuff. </garnt>
<connor> But the fact that they're
using this as like bait for us. </connor>
<joey> - It's almost even trivializes it, </joey>
<joey> because it doesn't feel real. </joey>
<garnt> The impact is gone, because
it feels so manufactured. </garnt>
<joey> - They might as well have
just put up a cue card </joey>
<connor> to be like now cry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Again, I wanna make sure
I'm not diminishing it. </garnt>
<garnt> Or trying to minimize
it or make it seem like- </garnt>
<joey> - It's not on the guy, it's
on the editors of the show. </joey>
<joey> - It's on the producers. </joey>
<joey> - The shows probably heard
this story or something, </joey>
<garnt> and they were like, yo, play that up, </garnt>
<garnt> play that up.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Dude, people wanna fucking cry, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because it's been
proven plenty of times </garnt>
<garnt> that the auditions that we see televised </garnt>
<connor> in front of a live audience, </connor>
<connor> isn't actually the first audition. </connor>
<connor> They go through several
stages with the producers. </connor>
<connor> I guarantee he was doing that magic trick, </connor>
<connor> and one of the producers
heavily suggested, </connor>
<connor> yo, you should, you should- </connor>
<connor> - We don't know this. </connor>
<connor> Speculation, by the way. </connor>
<connor> - Speculation, speculation. </connor>
<connor> In my mind, </connor>
<connor> I feel like one of the
producers just went, </connor>
<garnt> you know, I feel like
you should kind of try </garnt>
<garnt> to integrate that story line
into your magic trick somehow. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Could be. </connor>
<garnt> - You know. </garnt>
<connor> - There's definitely kinda
stuff that producers would do. </connor>
<connor> We've seen, you know,
if you ever look at the, </connor>
<joey> people have released
the contracts and stuff, </joey>
<joey> they're pretty predatory contracts. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of the time, I can't
remember which one it was, </joey>
<joey> either one of these shows,
one of the British ones, </joey>
<connor> by signing the contract,
they owned everything </connor>
<connor> that you would make that you
would self-publish online </connor>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<joey> - I think it was "American Idol." </joey>
<connor> - One of them.
- One of those, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So if you went to even audition </joey>
<connor> and you posted content
online, if they wanted to, </connor>
<garnt> they could turn around and
be like, hey, that's ours. </garnt>
<garnt> That's ours, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - [Ashley] Could be
"Britain's Got Talent." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I think it might have been </connor>
<connor> "Britain's Got Talent." </connor>
<joey> - I think it was 'cause I saw
the YouTube video about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Also, Susan Boyle didn't win. </joey>
<joey> She lost out to Diversity. </joey>
<connor> - That's right, the people who did the, </connor>
<joey> I remember this. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - It was like a big, </connor>
<connor> because I think everyone at the time, </connor>
<connor> I remember when this was
happening when I was younger, </connor>
<connor> and everyone was like, oh
Susan Boyle's gonna win. </connor>
<connor> So there was a big effort to
make it so that she didn't win, </connor>
<connor> or that was public opinion.
- Right, right, right. </connor>
<garnt> This is when people gave
a shit about reality TV. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now life is the reality TV. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't need this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> We, our life- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just log onto our fucking Twitter, </garnt>
<joey> and you get to see reality TV.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Where's where's Susan Boyle now? </garnt>
<joey> Hopefully doing well for herself, </joey>
<garnt> but no one's talking about her. </garnt>
<joey> That's for sure. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I would like
to go back to the times </garnt>
<joey> when we could just shit on reality TV, </joey>
<joey> and that just have like
zero effect on our lives. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the good old days for me. </garnt>

<joey> - Have you ever thought about
going on a show like that, or? </joey>
<connor> - That's a great question, Joey. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, no. </joey>
<joey> Part of me is like, okay, </joey>
<joey> I saw a guy on YouTube, I
think I showed you guys. </joey>
<connor> He went on a show, playing a character </connor>
<connor> and then like just making
fun of the whole process </connor>
<connor> and like with secret camera
and stuff, showing it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but then I think the
show took everything down. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it was very- </joey>
<joey> - Because he signed the contract. </joey>
<connor> - You had to sign the contract
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> to get on. </connor>
<connor> But a part of me has thought, </connor>
<connor> I wonder if I made up a storyline </connor>
<connor> and I really committed to it, </connor>
<connor> how easy would it be to get on TV? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it would be pretty easy. </connor>
<connor> Which comedian did it? </connor>
<connor> A British one did it, didn't he? </connor>
<garnt> - Did he? </garnt>
<connor> - I wouldn't put a past British comedian. </connor>
<connor> - Which one was it? </connor>
<connor> Fuck. </connor>
<connor> He made up like a storyline
about, I think it was, oh, </connor>
<connor> which comedian was it? </connor>
<connor> Was it? </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, British comedian who
went on "Britain's got Talent" </connor>
<connor> and there was like, </connor>
<connor> I don't want say the
storyline in case I'm wrong. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Daliso Chaponda? </joey>
<connor> Oh hold on, let me Google. </connor>
<connor> Let me do a bit more. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Not sure. </connor>
<connor> - Give us a second. </connor>
<joey> Give us sec. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] What British comedian? </joey>
<connor> - He made it so that his, </connor>
<joey> I think his backstory was a
Holocaust survivor or something. </joey>
<connor> - Really?
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, something like that </connor>
<connor> or something like Jewish or something. </connor>
<connor> I remember it was like that. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, while he's searching, </garnt>
<garnt> guess I'll add onto the conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I don't know why
people would want to go </garnt>
<garnt> on reality TV shows now </garnt>
<garnt> when you can just post
yourself up on YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> I feel like that need to have
your five seconds of fame is, </connor>
<connor> that need is disappearing, </connor>
<connor> because at any moment in
time you post a TikTok, </connor>
<connor> you can get like a few million views, </connor>
<garnt> at a complete chance, right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, reality TV has figured this out. </connor>
<joey> That's why they often recruit
people on social media. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - They go on social media
and like DM them, like, </joey>
<connor> hey, we're from "Britain's Got Talent." </connor>
<connor> Would you be interested in auditioning? </connor>
<connor> We can guarantee you to
get to the second judges </connor>
<joey> or something.
- Ah. </joey>
<joey> - Sneaky motherfuckers. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Have you not watched clips
of the talent shows recently? </garnt>
<garnt> It feels- </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - It feels less like a talent
show and more like, hey! </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's people who
are from all over the world, </garnt>
<connor> like American and Canadian, </connor>
<connor> it just seems like they're
just getting anyone </connor>
<connor> who does anything interesting </connor>
<connor> to come on.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - And who has a compelling
story supposedly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's more like they're less
so a talent show of the people </connor>
<joey> and more a talent show
to just amuse the people </joey>
<joey> where they just get acts
from across the world. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then just loosely
tie together a story. </connor>
<garnt> - It's the real YouTube Rewind now </garnt>
<connor> since YouTube Rewind
isn't a thing anymore. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - The talented people Rewind. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] I'll have to find it after. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - But what was the story then was, </joey>
<garnt> so he made up that he
was a Holocaust victim, </garnt>
<garnt> and- </garnt>
<connor> - Can I have your phone? </connor>
<garnt> I can try and Google it.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I might remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, here we go. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, Lee Nelson. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, it was by Channel 4. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - It was this one. </connor>
<connor> Look at the thumbnail. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, wow.
- Oh! </connor>
<connor> - And I think he made up a fake storyline </connor>
<connor> about being a rabbi and something, </connor>
<connor> and then whatnot and Channel 4 posted it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It was part of "Balls of Steel" I think. </connor>
<garnt> - "Balls of Steel," yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I remember "Balls of Steel." </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't even know that
was still going on, geez. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not, this is from a while back. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember he made up some story </garnt>
<connor> about being a Hebrew rabbi </connor>
<connor> and playing a bunch of
generic sympathy cards </connor>
<connor> and yeah.
- Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> And, it was really easy for him to get on. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And then I think he
got to the live show. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember what happened, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> I think he then came out or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> But it was just showing how
easy it is to fake stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, 'cause I haven't watched </garnt>
<garnt> much reality TV show, not much
like of these talent shows, </garnt>
<joey> I should say, as much as I used to </joey>
<joey> because before it felt like
everyone was talking about it, </joey>
<joey> especially when you lived in England. </joey>
<joey> - It was inescapable. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, everyone was talking
about who's gonna win </joey>
<joey> "Britain's Got Talent" or "X Factor?" </joey>
<joey> Now it just feels like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if its just my
social circle has changed </joey>
<garnt> or if the viewership has genuinely </garnt>
<garnt> just had a sharp drop off. </garnt>
<garnt> But like I rarely hear anyone talking </garnt>
<garnt> about these big talent shows anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - No one cares. </garnt>
<joey> - Because no one really, </joey>
<joey> the demographic of watching TV now </joey>
<connor> is just completely shifted, I feel. </connor>
<joey> - TV's just background noise now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's it. </joey>
<connor> No one actually gives a shit
about what's going on on TV. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel, you know- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, at least people under 40. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like people
nowadays would rather, </connor>
<connor> well obviously, would rather get </connor>
<connor> on a fucking MrBeast video
or something, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Totally, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<connor> - You know, it is weird, actually. </connor>
<garnt> I had this thought the other day where- </garnt>
<joey> - That's the new "America's Got Talent." </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I did have this thought the other day, </garnt>
<garnt> and correct me if I've
already talked about this </garnt>
<garnt> on the podcast 'cause I can't
remember if I have or not, </garnt>
<garnt> but it feels like YouTube in a sense has, </garnt>
<garnt> because the internet moves so fast, </garnt>
<connor> YouTube has become the new TV. </connor>
<connor> And it's almost like TikTok
that has become the new YouTube </connor>
<connor> in a sense, where TikTok is
this big, rising piece of media. </connor>
<connor> And remember back in the
day where every YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> you know you have made it as a YouTuber </connor>
<connor> if you could appear on TV, </connor>
<connor> if you could appear on old media. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Nowadays it feels like
every TikTok is trying </connor>
<connor> to make a name for themselves </connor>
<connor> on YouTube.
- On YouTube. </connor>
<connor> And it's like YouTube that
is the established media </connor>
<garnt> and the established platform. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I definitely think so, yeah.
- I agree. </garnt>
<connor> Just like another transition
of, just weird, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time as well, it's almost, </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of YouTubers
now doing the opposite </connor>
<connor> where they're trying to
jump onto TikTok now, </connor>
<connor> and making a name for themselves there </connor>
<connor> because they think, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's the whole grass is greener </connor>
<garnt> on the other side concept, right? </garnt>
<joey> Where it's like, which
is the real main source </joey>
<garnt> of income now? </garnt>
<joey> - How many YouTubers do you know? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't know many aside from, </joey>
<garnt> I think Hank Green's
the only one I've seen </garnt>
<garnt> a lot on TikTok and like YouTube shorts. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's really fun to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Hank Green is moving
away from TikTok to like- </garnt>
<joey> - He's going to Instagram shorts </joey>
<garnt> or whatever the thing now, isn't it? </garnt>
<joey> - I've seen fucking Ray William
Johnson on TikTok a lot. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> Seeing Ray William Johnson just have </garnt>
<garnt> his revival.
- Dude, seeing Ray William, </garnt>
<joey> Dude, seeing Ray William
Johnson do =3 content </joey>
<joey> on TikTok is like insane to me. </joey>
<garnt> - It's so weird because it
is literally just =3 content, </garnt>
<joey> right?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> This is the shit he was making
15 years ago on YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] It is weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - And all these new gen
kids are just like, hey, </garnt>
<joey> have you heard of this
hilarious, new wacky guy </joey>
<connor> called Ray William Johnson. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think anyone's
calling it hilarious. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean it's making numbers though. </joey>
<connor> - I know, I know. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, surprisingly. </joey>
<connor> - A lot of things made numbers
on TikTok that are shit. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - Not saying his are shit, but I mean. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Are you saying it's just okay? </joey>
<connor> - It's mid, it's mid.
- It's mid? </connor>
<connor> - Ray William Johnson is- </connor>
<connor> - Seven out of 10? </connor>
<garnt> Is it actual mid or you
know, or is it five out 10? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's mid. </joey>
<joey> - What's mid content on TikTok? </joey>
<joey> Ray William Johnson. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- I hate my life. </connor>
