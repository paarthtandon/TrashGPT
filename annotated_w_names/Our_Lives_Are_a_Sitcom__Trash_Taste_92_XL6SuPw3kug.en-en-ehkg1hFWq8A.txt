<SPEAKER_03> - I look completely different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah.
- Just wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point that out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I know we like brushed
over that, but yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Friendship with Joey
the Anime Man has ended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm Josh the Manga Lad now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, you look
like the hacker character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the movie that doesn't wanna explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how the hacking works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (mellow music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Am I going crazy or has
the internet gotten the worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the past five years? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I crazy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think you're crazy at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like it's gotten
significantly worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Not the whole internet, but the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as in the level of fucked up shit that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe there was, there was
a lot of messed up stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five, six years ago or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel like now, it's
all just out there now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like its,
- It's just so normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so interesting how
it's almost an opposite effect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Somehow, for some reason,
even though the internet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the internet culture
and people on the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the past five, six years, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have gotten more PC than ever before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yet, almost counterintuitively, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's more fucked up
shit that has like come out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> onto the surface as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's why,
- In like retaliation, maybe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, the more you go PC,
the more that these people- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like I see shit
now on regular Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and Instagram that you'd only ever find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the fuckin' /b/ board. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's weird, man,
'cause you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> am I weird for being middle
ground on everything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I feel like I have very
normal opinions on things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the more I'm online, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am I not normal? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Do I have not normal opinions? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, what is a normal opinion anymore? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just being, I feel like being fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really have heavy opinions on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I see other people,
I'm like oh my god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Common sense has definitely
become less common. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what's
common sense anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it does feel
like is this the point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where the older generation
starts shit-talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the newer generation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like these damn kids! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause did you ever think like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I think it's the opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's because the
internet in general has become </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more accessible to every age group </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we're seeing all of this.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause before it was just 20 year olds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who gave enough fucks to go on- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Like social media or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I felt that it was
a very exciting time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone was really into it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and new websites popped up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] The new hip thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Miniclip was still thriving, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know.
- Ah, rest in peace. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - FarmVille was still going strong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mafia City. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna keep naming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The good old days, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the good old days.
- But you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like now, because
it's become so normalized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone uses it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like do you remember a
point where it felt like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a separation between
what you did on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what happened in real life? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I feel like when that
barrier kind of got broken, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you felt like what happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the internet was pertaining
to your active, your, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> How can I say this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because internet is real life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it didn't feel so suffocating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, it didn't feel
like it had a tangible effect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on your day to day life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But now it feels like whatever's
going on in the internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever's going on in the
world, has this tangible effect, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this tangible effect
on what's going on in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what you're doing in your life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally just explained the plot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to "Serial Experiments Lain." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I kinda am, aren't I. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's literally what that is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, so what's the
time you think it is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm curious if you have
the same opinion on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You said the time when
it felt like that became. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The time when it felt
it became like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know.
- I feel it depends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on how long you've been on the internet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you ever do like MySpace? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I came right after MySpace. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you do MySpace?
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you have Bebo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had Bebo.
- I did not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was very popular in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you say, so the
Bebo and MySpace era, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, roughly the same time I would say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you were on Bebo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and when people on
MySpace were on MySpace, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> did you see that as this
is me, completely tangible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to real life?
- No, it was a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Social media's a game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like how I go into Sims, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I make myself look attractive in Sims. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause like that's
how I kind of treated MySpace </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as well at the time.
- It's a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? It's like a
- A way to up those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> social game.
serotonin points. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I think the
first time I really thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of social media as a game was actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So Charlie Brooker, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you know Charlie Brooker? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He wrote Black Mirror. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So a few years ago, or
maybe even a decade ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't even remember
how old this video is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he did a Top 50 most
influential games of all time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and number one was Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like what are you
talking about Charlie Brooker? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause before that he talked about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, games like fucking
- That's not a game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Last of Us", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking "Tetris,"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, all these games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, think about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You play as an avatar
on an online platform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you gain points for
interacting with the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, he's very right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's, social media at
this point is a game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we are all, the game now is our job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, it is our job 'cause- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've fallen right into the system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We are part of the system guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dammit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We can't criticize the system
'cause we are the system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We are the system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We are part of the system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that is definitely how
social media has become. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I mean in a way, I see,
especially YouTube and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a kind of a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it's been gamified to fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, it is a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You post a video, and it
even puts you on a leaderboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on how well it's performed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the past 10 uploads you've done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the game, the stakes to
it are whatever you give it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Mm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, a game is, it's
the same with anything, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know, fuckin'
"Jump King" whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been zero days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The game only means
whatever you assign to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So with the videos, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you are making these
videos for the purpose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of cracking that one out of 10, then yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, if you're just making the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you want to make a video? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't say it's game.
- I think when though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, when you get to that point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like you're kind
of testing the limits </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on what you can call a game, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, is the
stock market a game? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Conner sputtering) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah hmm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A game that ruins your life.
- Some people say yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Some people say yes. Some people say no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's roulette with extra steps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's roulette with
massive repercussions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's roulette where there's
a really, really boring option </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that will probably pay you back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you can spin the wheel.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Spin the wheel.
- Spin the wheel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh, Dogecoin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, come on, I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like "Deal or No Deal"
but it's actually serious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I felt like the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know when the
internet started to become </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very, very real, if you will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it definitely
jacked up to 100 at 2016. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that was when it definitely like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why 2016? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Presidential election. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trump's presidential election. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like that's
when it just went boom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's when the split went crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt like the left leaning internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right leaning internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just went really full on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like it was before that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it might be earlier, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just that we
weren't really aware of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what it was?
- That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm saying it might
not have started then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's when the dial went fucking 500. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know when it was? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's when YouTube Rewind
started becoming shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, tell me your
theory, tell me your theory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know because- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was that, like 2014?
- 2014 about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just thinking back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just thinking one YouTube Rewind- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - As in when everything on the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stopped being universally loved. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically when we start
like being segmented, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I just tried to verbalize how
I felt, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of feels around the
same time that I stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> giving a shit about YouTube Rewind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that kind of feels like
it was 2014, 2013 maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very early on, when the internet stopped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being one conglomeration, and
you'd see things happening, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just didn't recognize
who this person was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who that person was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people stopped getting
along and, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> factions and groups started to form. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but that's why I took something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the presidential election, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like the most televised
horse race in existence, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you will.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, other countries,
we don't, you know, the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, yeah, we have this whole thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about who the new Prime
Minister is gonna be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we don't nearly make it
as exciting as America does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America's so good at making hype. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I feel like,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it was the perfect event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was so polarizing
and so well telegraphed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with so much information
and so many parties </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> putting stuff into it,
- I think it- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> regardless of your opinion on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And who you voted for,
I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just saying you can't ignore the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that this was a thing that
just really took the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and just fucking ran with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think it's also
around the time, roughly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when a lot of social media sites were, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where that kind of discussion
was just becoming more open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that was roughly around the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where Twitter increased
their character limit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah that, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So people could only
tweet about yay Obama won, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And now it's like, let me
write a full fuckin' novel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about how I feel about
this presidential election. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after that is when the platform started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> having to correct misinformation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that further caused more of a divide. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then now there's
just different platforms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for different opposing views. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So now you don't even get
to hear the other side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're in a echo chamber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I feel like what
was so prevalent about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not just the presidential election, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but just that year in general, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was that it felt like that
was the real turning point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for where social media kind
of felt just like a TV show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like a part of
entertainment, right, where- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, the presidential election </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is the best rated TV show of all time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd probably say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone tunes in the
watch the next episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean like, it even
had like a buildup season, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which was Brexit, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had like the mid-season- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was that the pilot episode? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, that was the
mid-season twist, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had the mid-season twist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and we're like, guys, this
show can't get any better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's no possible way
they can surprise me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Jokes on you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'll never expect what comes next. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just fucking look, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at how they decide the nominee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the presidential thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's laid out like "Who
Wants to be a Millionaire." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you seen them all there?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're in this semicircle
with all this amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking TV show-esque "Britain's
Got Talent" background, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they all take turns,
massive audience and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is this shit?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, what, who gives a shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let the party pick, and then
we'll fucking decide who wins. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This whole thing is so
reality TV show-esque. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so bizarre.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When you sit down and you're
like, what am I watching? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, this is fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, okay, here's a question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you think that people
cared about politics </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as much before, and we
were just too ignorant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we were too young at the time? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or do you think people care more now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because of the prevalence of social media </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just so many people
verbalizing their opinions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and their political views? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think it has
to do with the amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of people caring, I
think it just has to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with how much we are
just exposed to it now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I think one
of the main things here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you have to bear in mind as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think like with the internet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this has just given everyone the platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you wanted to get
support as a politician, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you had to go on a TV show
and say something, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You only had like what, one minute? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or if you're in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you blare out of a fucking
megaphone in the street. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Annoyingly.
- True, true, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So now it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you have the kind of perfect storm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of now there's more ways to discuss, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's on the internet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now even 40, 50 year
olds are on the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they're willing to listen to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Combine that with the fact
that it's become really easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to give politics a kind of tribalism </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with nothing to do with it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So the whole vaccination
thing or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all that nonsense, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not that vaccines are nonsense, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the whole argument around it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It very quickly stopped
becoming about the science </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and more just about which
horse are you backing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I feel like now- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It became a political thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's gotten really easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to just assign identities
to certain political views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And this has how
politicians have realized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they can push their agenda. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's by just giving it like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you a real American? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then you'll believe in this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It used to be before I felt
like it was just about, more so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was this is the policy,
this is what we're gonna do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now it's like, all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have to give everything a meaning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're either with us or you're not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Here's the meaning between it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that kind of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could explain this better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I was more eloquent with my words, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but unfortunately that isn't the case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, they did that subtly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with the whole Ebola crisis, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It suddenly became are you with
us, or are you not with us? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you care about these people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then you should be with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's got nothing to do with anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In what case, sorry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> With the Ebola stuff,
like what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, it very quickly
became, especially in America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> became a political drive, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For the campaigns and whatnot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like, well- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, did it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I don't remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it absolutely did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when the actual
election finished, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone stopped talking about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's as if it had nothing to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the American elections. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because I think it's much easier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of proving yourself right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to prove the other person wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - By proving the other person wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are in a sense proving yourself right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though that's not
how it works at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when did Ben Shapiro
start owning people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with facts and logics? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I feel like that's
when it started, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Around same time I believe.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably around the same time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When it wasn't about
being involved in politics, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just you start
off watching someone else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just owning other people
with their logistical, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> logical arguments or whatever, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it became part of entertainment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the, what's this
guy, the "Prove me Wrong" guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, um.
- Stephen Crowder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stephen Crowder, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like that as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just like fuckin' exploded
out of nowhere too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for the same reasons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird how seeing
these waves come up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> First, it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have the group that
proves the other group wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then after a while
people get bored of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it's people
proving that group wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's a constant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a constant ping pong fuckin' match. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - As well, you know, there's
information on a lot of things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> There's always way more nuance
than people want to get into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So a lot of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you just take one correct argument, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or one correct fact, about
a flawed argument, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can just run with that, and push that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and say look, this is right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even though in context,
it might be incorrect, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you can just keep
running with something that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know that you can
parrot and is safe to do so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And even then, even if you're
wrong, it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause as we've learned is
that if you're a narcissist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're willing to not give a fuck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if people are trying to cancel you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - People have learned that
canceling only does shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you give a fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And people are being
rewarded en mass, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And a lot of those people are like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who, even though they get shit wrong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as long as they don't give a fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just make something new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or don't mention it and just continue on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get what you want, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get your platform, you continue, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can get new followers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, you lost a few hundred followers? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, you'll get a new thousand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Who cares? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There's never been more of a
time when I've realized that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, bad, what
was it, like bad press? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like there is no such thing as bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bad press.
- Bad press. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's no such thing as bad press. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's as bad as you give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing is, as well, is a
lot of people have realized, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and you see this on YouTube
as well in influencers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's as bad as you let
it seem it is, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you are like, that's
why a lot of the scandals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the presidential
election that happened in 2016, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if the guy who you
are supporting is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not a big deal, then
maybe you'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I guess not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There is a kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's as bad as they let it seem, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you address it and be
like, I don't give a fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or you don't even bother to
address it then, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I think
you're right in a sense, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I feel like even more so, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was when Trump got elected, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> regardless of your opinion
of him as a president, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me as an outsider who is, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not any part of American politics, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was almost like watching a
character in a show, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was, it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going on your Twitter timeline </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and seeing some of the
stuff that he tweeted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like a cartoon villain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Remember like the whole covfefe shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care where you lie
in the political spectrum, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we can all unanimously agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that covfefe was fuckin' hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yeah, it kind of, I
dunno what the right word is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it kind of cartoonified shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It kind of like cartoonified
your real life and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the world events, even though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though these were
real prevalent issues, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and these had a real, tangible- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's nothing cartoony about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - These had a real, tangible
effect on the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially a lot of the younger generation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who have grown up in
the age of the internet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kind of the environment
they've grown into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where everything, when
it's seen through a phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or through a tablet, they just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like suddenly not real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause we were, what, 20 plus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when all this started happen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, no, 20? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe I was like 19. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I couldn't
imagine going from 12 to 18. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And this has been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your entire memory.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is weird.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, it's really bizarre.
- It's crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you know, we don't
really talk about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the podcast, our political views </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or our political opinions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because at the most part </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't give a fuck what you believe in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have my own opinions,
but I'm also not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I'm some kind of
benevolent man who knows all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know that I have probably
come to conclusions on things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through flawed thinking, methodology, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever the fuck you say.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just 'cause of how I've
been raised, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you've been raised
whatever way you have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you disagree with me on this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a fuck how you
came to that conclusion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna judge you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like one of
the biggest problems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's come out of all this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that everyone's
calling each other stupid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for believing in something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like, I'm
sure you have a reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If we just spoke to each other normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and didn't polarize each
other all the fucking time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we might have a conversation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just to, you know,
agree to disagree, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, we're not here to
fucking dangle a fucking carrot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of your face being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believe us, because we hold the truth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, no, no one does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sucks as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause obviously with the
whole coronavirus stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that all got politicized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of course it did.
- Of course it did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That, unfortunately, came
at the cost of people's lives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you know, the people
who felt they were right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt so strongly they were right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they thought that,
you know, they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, we have to protect people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, that's fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's kind of difficult
to convince people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're calling them stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's been shown that
it just doesn't work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I think another big, massive thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with the age of the internet is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking overload of information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it's like, I remember a point where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, you'd read something in a book </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or read a newspaper or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you'd educate yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But it feels like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there is just so much
information right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I don't even know what information is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the right information to educate myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of the time.
- So many times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So many times I look at something
online and I think like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh man, this is a kind of
interesting piece of information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Couple of hours later, I
find out it's total bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like what the fuck?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally every time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, how?
- It's so true, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where sometimes you hear
about a story or an event, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like, fuck
man, that fuckin' sucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get told by five or six
different people being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you seen this thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, well fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if there's five or six
people around me that I know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I understand,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's telling me that this is happening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> then it must be true, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, turns out, nope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you were a kid, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did you think that people were stupid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you think that you're too smart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In what context? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just in general, as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was one of those little kids
that just thought in school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think half the reason why
I was angry half the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was because I thought, this is so dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm smarter than all this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't even remember.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanted to play video games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't really give a shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't feel that
strongly about things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I thought, as a kid, I
just thought I was smarter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than people around me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think everyone had that phase though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think people don't grow out of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> some people don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grow out of it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some people grow don't grow
out of it obviously, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, and it's really interesting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was just scrolling on Reddit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - God forbid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw this, and it was
a post where it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think everyone else is dumb, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's infuriating
having to talk to people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it was really
interesting seeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how people were trying to reply to this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and break it down.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And ultimately, and I
think this is really good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think that everyone
should keep this in mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I feel that we judge
people based on how they speak, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not how their level of intelligence is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel like this definitely
happens on the podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen it in the comment section, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we might have a bad take, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or we might badly explain something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And everyone's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well Connor's dumb, or
Joey's dumb, Garnt's dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He couldn't explain this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so hard to grasp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We only can interact with people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> based on the things they say, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Not how they think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you are probably
thinking about things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way deeper than you could ever explain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about it, right?
- Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's so hard to get
that out of your head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when someone's talking to you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you only have
that to work off, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's a skill, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's why I have trouble
properly expressing myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> unless it's written down.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is why I script.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which we can't do on the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which we can't do on the
podcast, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But we can't edit it either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So that's why I know for a
fact that I express myself best </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in text form or written form, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when it's written down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But also on the podcast, I
think you're quite eloquent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the way you word things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think-
- Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've had some pretty shit takes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, me too, me too.
- We all have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just because I was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There has been several points </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I look at myself
arguing an argument, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, I'm a fucking clown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I deserve to be fucking clowned on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some true "bruh" moments. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That has been a thing in
the Trash Takes comments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's been a normal thing
where they'll be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I get what Connor's saying,
but he explained it badly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I will admit, I'm
extremely guilty of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I do that a lot.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there are a lot of
things that I try to explain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but in the moment, it's
just hard to get the words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because we don't come into
this, it's not a debate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We don't script this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We just turn up- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- We don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, I get what you mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you probably should
have double-checked this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the whole, the
fuckin' food illness thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If you gave me 20 minutes in a room alone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I could write? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could probably prepare
a decent argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - However I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you gave me time to
put it in an essay form, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure I could tell you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But also, this is how
real life is and it's weird, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I feel like when I
watch people as well speak, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and again, this is going back
to how just general life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again, this ties into the previous topics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the online, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> How we respond to people who
have bad opinions on things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or we observe to be bad opinions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so hard in this
current climate online </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to just give people the
benefit of the doubt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And just be like I think you mean well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't think this opinion you have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could be hurting people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think you genuinely
want to hurt people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It could be you've just been misinformed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you believe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You genuinely think
this is helping people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the problem
though, is that, I feel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, a lot of social media, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like Twitter, Reddit, stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is 99% emotionally driven. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- That's just humanity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that too, but also, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people like to think that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I see this massive post
on, you know, massive comment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> replying to a certain shit
take on Reddit, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they think like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, judging from the
length of this whole thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this must be a very well-thought,
well-written argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90% of the time, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's emotional drivel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's unfortunately
how the nature of a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of these internet arguments
- It's depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> work, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so depressing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That even when you go on
Reddit, and look at it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and someone will say something
that's a bit incorrect, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it will just immediately
turn into argument. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Instantly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do you wanna do this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't you wanna?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, no one's
fucking citing their sources </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in these kinds of comment sections. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's all, it's all emotional. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean that's just
how humans are always. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I don't
normally try to get involved </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on a platform like Twitter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because do you think anyone's ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> changed their fucking mind
from like a single tweet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like a Twitter discussion?
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't see it happening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd love to meet someone who's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought about this thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but then I saw XXXn00bkillerXX
tweet that out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, yeah, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're right, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Opinion changed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I've seen threads
that maybe, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll just agree to disagree, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with threads that you open
up that show all replies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just keep scrolling
down, and it just never ends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only time I see people
civilized on the internet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and always be really
respectful to each other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when they're talking about porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey cackling)
- Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the only time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People are so fucking polite to each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they're talking about porn, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're so helpful, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone's so helpful about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but the moment it's
anything else, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they start going at the throat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the image of all the board members </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the Roundtable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's very
good example right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally very civilized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just love as well the ones that are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going back to the whole
agreeing to disagree thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen so many Twitter replies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of how one side of the
argument tries to start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that whole conclusion up being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what, let's agree to disagree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But 90% of the time
the other party's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no, no, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're not ending it here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna agree to disagree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How dare you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know that people feel,
for some reason, feel safe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discussing their opinions about
porn and hentai and whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause on some of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discord servers,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they talk about hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people use their real fucking pictures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as their profile pictures.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how safe they feel talking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the real safe space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some people feel, some- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is the real space safe space, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, that is bold.
- It's like, I'm into NTR. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's agree to disagree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Shake hands. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like Steven with
his actual profile picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like what?
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This episode is sponsored by honey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The easy way to save </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when shopping on your iPhone or computer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Guys let's not pretend that we
don't all shop online, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course we do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But don't you wish you had a promo code, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ready for you always when
you're at the checkout. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, thanks to honey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> manually searching for coupon
codes is a thing of the past. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Honey is a free shopping tool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that scours the internet for promo codes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and applies the best one
it finds to your cart, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time you shop online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How does it work, Connor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're shopping on one
of your favorite sites. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Um huh.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you're at the checkout, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the honey button appears, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all you have to do
is click "apply coupons." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait a few seconds as
honey searches for coupons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it can find for that site. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If honey finds a working coupon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll watch the prices drop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that easy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And recently I just bought a
microphone to upgrade my setup, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and honey saved me 15 bucks
- Whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a brand new microphone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you don't already have honey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can be straight up
missing out on free savings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Woo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And by getting it you'll
be doing yourself a solid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and also supporting us as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd never recommend
something I don't use. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So get honey for free at
joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Links in the description below. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is it that the porn community </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on Twitter is some of the chillest people? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The porn community in any community is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the chillest people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't it fucked up that a
Pornhub comment section is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more chill than a YouTube comment section? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel 'cause you, to have
to interact in a community </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to have a level
of self-awareness, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I think that's where it comes from. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You are just so self-aware </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that you just don't give a fuck anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's when you're most Zen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after you've nutted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well basically, it's a
massive barrier of entry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just to sign up an account </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a porn site, right?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a level that I just
haven't been able to take. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I just don't wanna give my Gmail account. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna be at that morning where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I wake up in the morning, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm making a Pornhub account today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the most "Trash
Taste" segue ever, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can I say that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That we've gone from
like very serious topics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to signing up to a porn account? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what kind of person is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to just have my say in this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey cackling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta make it known what I think about- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like there's steps, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've never signed
up for a Pornhub account. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I have for like hentai sites, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- You have? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because sometimes you find a lit hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, I want to remember this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm going to
forget the name afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will say, as a free to
play user of the porn universe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I will say the most annoying thing is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to find a video that I did enjoy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause the problem is, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after you do the deed, you're
not interested in it anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So you're like, I don't
fucking need this anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And then it just goes out the recesses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of your mind and fucking
a week later you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yo, what was that fucking A class hentai </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that I found the other week? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is a sobering moment
when you're trying to type </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the keywords to find the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you are like, I'm disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're just scrolling
through these videos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to find it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, no, no, there's
something wrong with me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've gone to the point
where I've anonymously gone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> onto forums and asked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you actually?
- No, no you haven't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's your profile pic? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not telling you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know what anonymous means? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's gotta be Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want it to be like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause no one would ever
expect the Joey to use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> his actual profile picture on the forum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But now everyone's gonna use Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now everyone's gonna use Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause I didn't know
anyone at the time, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was in the exact same
situation where I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just saw this thing,
but it was on incognito. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I don't remember what it was called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All I remember is what
the girl looked like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you could log in, do you
know the login information? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you still use this account? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, not anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even think the
website exists anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that is the one
problem with incognito mode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that it doesn't give
you a search history. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or a history. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the moment the
post nut clarity hits </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you close that window, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, shit! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why did I do that?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't go back now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yeah, one time, I remember it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember what the girl looked like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I remember a certain scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was just like, hey, I'm
looking for this one series. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> These are the details. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Help appreciated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Immediately, five people
came back being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You should look it up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> None of them were actually it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I got great recommendations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you got some new
recommendations along the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, oh sick,
that's pretty close. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about signing up for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, I guess it depends,
'cause in Hentai and stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Normal one, I dunno what
would compel me to want pay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean?
- Like a pay site? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wouldn't wanna give
fucking my credit card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to one of these sites. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dude, that feels like such a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, when you hear about these, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which one was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was it the New York guy who was running </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for mayor of New York. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anthony Wiener, was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, there was somebody who got- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Anthony Wiener was one with dick pics. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that was it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, there was someone else who was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were running for political position, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it was found
out they were spending </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> five grand a month on
pornography or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, that's
impressive that you manage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to find ways to spend five grand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that is impressive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're definitely not watching
all of it, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause how could you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think one person is capable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of watching that much porn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many, like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> How many OnlyFans was he like sub to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many terabytes worth? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We spoke about this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause remember we spoke
about that one YouTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who had a porn addiction and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't remember who it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do remember, yeah, that sounds familiar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like the most
Chad YouTuber apology, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> not apology, video.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, he was never
accused of anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He just came out, he's like,
guys, I have a porn addiction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's rough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well it was like
literally ruining his life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well it's one of those
things that I can always, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I always fucking say,
"it's one of those things." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Goddamn, I gotta stop saying that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor, this is a message you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Stop saying it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's one of those things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Question to you, Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is literally my "a question to you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I, it's one of those things, um, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That people talk about, and oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people do not talk about enough- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's one of those things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people don't wanna give
credit to it or talk about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's just really embarrassing and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't give credit to
how debilitating it can be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to have that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you have it, man, I
hope you can get help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hope you can get out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> No shame to you, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so hard.
- It happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's 'cause it's
something that's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't seem on the forefront of things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should be worried about, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Definitely right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, you know, you can easily, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's easy to be able
to justify to yourself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah, a gambling addiction,
of course that's bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know or like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It ruins your life directly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or like an alcohol addiction, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or I'm just kind of destroying my body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm destroying all my
relationships around me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> A porn addiction, because
porn is so secretive anyway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't really have
anyone to talk to it about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not an immediate threat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think is the thing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause you hear about, yeah,
of course I watch porn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm an adult. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's everyone does it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, everyone, most
people are living normal lives, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, while watching it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you go down the
rabbit hole deep enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you realize, oh it's actually fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just as bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - At which point do you accept
that it is an addiction, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and not just a recreational
activity that everyone does? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's tough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause when are games
too addicting, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> When are you addicted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to games?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it the hours spent
consuming that medium </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it the money spent
consuming that medium? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or is it both?
(Connor blowing through lips) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it when you can't think
of anything other than porn? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause no one wants to
help people who are addicted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to porn 'cause they
don't think it's a thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause they are
like just stop watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Just turn it off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just stop jacking off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just close your eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just put your dick away, it's easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, I guess I don't know
what the actual definition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of addiction is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I guess when you should
start being worried about it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when it has a tangible
effect on maybe your life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in some way, shape or form. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like what- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like affecting negatively. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like a tangible, negative
effect on your life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or an aspect of your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then again, when does
it become a negative effect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and when does it just
become like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I just had a week binge
drinking with the boys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we are like
partying all week, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, at which point does
it become a negative effect? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess that's the hard thing about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it becomes- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's when, in my
opinion, I think it's when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's consistently, for
a long period of time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's consistently just
adding onto a negative effect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's when it becomes
like a problematic addiction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you can, as you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could have like a week binge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of drinking from morning to
night with the boys, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you're most likely
not gonna be drinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for a while after that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't count that as an addiction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like a short term binge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just destroying your body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah that's just destroying your body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and having a good time with the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But when it's a constant amount every day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or for a long period of time consistently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just getting worse
and worse and worse and worse, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's when it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, you should probably seek help. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> In my opinion, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's when you sign up
to a Pornhub account. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's when you're like, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need people to know how I
feel about that blowjob scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It was so good.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need up votes on my Pornhub comment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the one thing I don't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand, the thing about
porn hub comments is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand people asking about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking Call of Duty's tactics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or fucking how to get past this level, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rather than people actually
commenting on the porn itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like to me, for some reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno why you would ever
comment on a porno, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you are either like watching it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're actively involved, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or I've never gotten to a
point where watching this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, I want to
verbalize what I think about- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do people think about this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I think about this, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My favorites are the ones
that are just so simple, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so innocent being like, oh
man, 18:23, what a hot scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess so.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Thank you for sharing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Didn't need to know.
- I wish I was that open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I was that way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe one day, maybe one day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey giggling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, do you wanna get to that point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who knows? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who knows, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know.
- Have you seen some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of the fucking shit that
Sydney's been tweeting? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, I need to fucking
calm her down sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't be surprised if
she had a Pornhub account. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - At this point, I
think it's just Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She's gone beyond. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, she's gone beyond, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So why be anonymous
when I could be known? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Anyway, have you guys been
up to anything this past week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not been depressing or? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I look completely different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just wanted to point that out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know we brushed over that, but yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Friendship with Joey
the Anime Man has ended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm Josh the Manga Lad now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Just the comments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so I got my ears pierced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's one big thing.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then just yesterday I got my haircut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So now I look completely different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you look like the
hacker character in the movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't wanna explain
how the hacking works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He just kinda like pisses everyone off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they always need him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, the one that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You like like that guy now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I look like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that guy now.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I just loved so, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I had the, every time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel this is very much a YouTuber thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but even if you slightly change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how you look,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or slightly do something different, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To some people it's like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the end of the world
type of thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's just YouTube
comments work on the first thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they think they can comment
about, they comment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's always the appearance
'cause you see that first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and it's like,
every time I get my hair cut </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or I shave or you know, I
guess in this case, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drastically changed quite a bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just my favorite things is
seeing the reception to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> regardless of if it's
positive or negative. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To all the people who said
like, hey Joey, you look good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I appreciate that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's fucking dope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But my favorites are
the ones that of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> losing their minds in a negative sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a family member </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just died.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was the funniest response you got? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The funniest one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So the one I saw on Insta,
it's always Instagram </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are the best ones.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When I got the, when I posted the pictures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of getting my ears pierced,
the top comment for a while was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is he gay or European? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (crew member laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, yes, I am a JoJo fan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then, you know, with
the haircut, for instance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, some people
were like, hey, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like your cut G you
know, you always get those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then other ones were like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> L + ratio.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He fell off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You fell off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw a quote retweet
that was dead ass saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you fucking fell off.
- You fell off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, what because-
- Well, his hair definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> did fall off.
- You did fall off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My hair fell off, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I got a haircut? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the same when I moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> In the same video I also dyed my hair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And even though I'd moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> half the comments were
like, oh my God, his hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I just moved to Japan! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like your hair is,
oh, I have different hairs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, responsible for
different funnies now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like what?
- It's just hair! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just like the fact
that you've had longer hair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the same length hair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now you have shorter hair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, this is the
shortest I think I've ever had it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Does it feel good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The back of my hair feels good, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's like, I don't know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Easy to how easy is it to wash now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dude, it's like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the best part
about having short hair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So many people are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why would you do that to yourself? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like I fucking stabbed a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, why would you do that now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, why not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So as some one who rarely
ever changes their hairstyle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how'd you guys pick what
hairstyle that you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Or like, how do you pick a new hairstyle? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not confident
enough in my own abilities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to ever change my own style. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Somebody else has to do it for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I'm like, oh, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I stick with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, to me, every time I have changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> my hairstyle in my life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's been someone else
recommending me a hairstyle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to change it to, and I'm
just like, I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'll like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I'll like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it takes me like a
good year or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so I build up my courage to be like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I'll go for this person's advice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I change it and I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well this is my new hairstyle now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm never changing it again.
- How did you transition </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from sasuke hair to now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Um. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was that a suggestion? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was a suggestion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by my mates?
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because they were like, mate,
you need to stop putting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this much gel into your fucking hair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking just comb it down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The sasuke hair makes
me, everyone loves it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone fucking loves it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's never gonna change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like this for the rest of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I do it once. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, yeah, the sasuke
hair's fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno what I was thinking.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've decided my hairstyle based on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what requires no gel or wax. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I just hate putting shit in my hair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always hated that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I just like, whatever I
can do when I roll outta bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is the one I'm going for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So envious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I need- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know, you've
gone to perfectionist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like hand sculpting the perfect- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I mean before today's episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like majority of episodes
is just my bedhead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I don't do anything with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so funny though people asking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what shampoo and conditioner do you use? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like Head and Shoulders. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking Dove. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's nothing special. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For me, it's like, I'm
given this job, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, YouTubing and being on social media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like, this
isn't gonna fucking affect- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, you know, my videos, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It doesn't affect my job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just a matter of personal preference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So in my head, if I'm
given this opportunity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I can kind of
experiment with how I look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it not really affect my job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it might even affect it
positively for some people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why wouldn't I try it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause with my hair, for instance, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you hate this hair, just wait a month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll grow back to normal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's gonna go back to the
length you're comfortable with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But why would I not give it a go? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But also I feel like a
lot of that is just people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> not being used to a look or a new look. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I remember when
I first started growing out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a stubble and everyone's like,
oh, you look weird as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And even I did, I thought,
man, I look fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look fucking weird as
fuck with just a stubble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've never had a stubble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or I've never like grown
out a stubble in my life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I've always known I could. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember I was
working on my latest vlog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was looking at my Trash Taste video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I talk about Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I was looking at
the previous vlog I did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before I was recording this one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was the BBC video
that I did without a stubble. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, man, I look fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now I think I look
weird without a stubble, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I look back at all
Trash Taste episodes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, man, I look really weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, when you go back to
episode one of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm in a fucking ponytail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, I completely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> forgot about that.
- I look at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, you look homeless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so glad I don't look
like this in anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But back then everyone was like,
yeah, the Jesus hair, dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks fucking sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And back then I was like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It kinda looks sick, not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now I'm just like, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It really got to the point
where I knew it was gross </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when even Aki's mom who
is the most accepting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind, never says a bad
thing about anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just one day was like, I think
you should cut your hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, if you are
saying that, maybe I should. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'd never wanna hear from- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think maybe I should. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The mom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Not my own mom, Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like I needed
to hear that though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause that's probably how dire I looked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause now I know what she means. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look back and then I'm
like, yeah, you know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I saw a guy like
that who I cared about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd probably tell him to cut his hair too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's kind of gross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even with the piercings
in the ear as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was surprising how a
lot of people were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, I thought your ears
were already pierced. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, now that you say it, I dunno why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I know it's never been that way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but you have that energy where
you had your ears pierced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You did have that energy.
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like when you said
you want your ears pierced, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like didn't you already
have your ears pierced, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or am I just like dreaming that up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, everyone said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is weird how much
just changing a little bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of your facial features
can change the perception. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I was growing out
my beard a little bit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I looked like fucking Willem
Dafoe from "The Lighthouse." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, I kind
of digged it though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But also at the same time, it
was really fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Having it long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You actually reminded
me of Linus Tech Tips </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> more than anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't say that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just when you grow-
- I don't wanna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He wears sandals and socks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Put a side by side of Linus.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love Linus, but
he's not drip, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I don't wanna be compared
to Linus when it comes to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, he, I think he
looks good with a beard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just like, he wasn't Willem Dafoe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like Linus Tech
Tips with a beard energy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I got for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I take that as a compliment.
- Now, now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's a compliment.
- I wanna get rid of it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not a dis, it's not a dis. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not a dis, bruv. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd rather be Willem Dafoe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I hear he has like a 12 inch cock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that the biggest
change you've ever done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> aside from like getting your hair dyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything like that,
you've ever done to your- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you turning silver
was the biggest change, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that was weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I look at that, that was weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I liked it when it was
half blond, half brown, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like dirty blonde
I think it's called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Like when the
silver was fading, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I liked that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I liked it towards the end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I liked segment as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then it's like, I don't
wanna have to do it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Also I probably shouldn't
be dyeing my hair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when I haven't got much left of it, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Apparently that's a myth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My hairdresser was saying yesterday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But she got stakes in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's her job to dye people hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no, yeah, but, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's true, but also she was saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that unless you're directly
applying the bleach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> onto the scalp, which a
hairdresser shouldn't be doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to begin with, it doesn't affect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - True. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't know either way, I'm- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know why you're cautious about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've got outta that phase as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where I feel like I need to dye my hair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like I'm in the boomer stage now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm like, it'll do what it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're in the veteran stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It'll do whatever it wants,
and I will just deal with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It does feel like regardless of age, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it does feel like a stage that
every YouTuber goes through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, oh, it's the dyed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's either they go through a bald stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or they dye their hair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's the, it's the I'm a YouTuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a little bit of clout stage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, oh, people- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is kinda like the
YouTuber midlife crisis, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, oh, people
are starting to look at me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe I should spice things up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember I never really
wanted to dye my hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, I think I was kinda- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What made you want to? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I was kind interested in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I've never tried it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thought could be interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then when I met Charlie,
who dyes your hair, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - She was just kinda like,
yeah, let's just do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, just give it a go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, I mean, I
think I was in that phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> where I was like, yeah, fuck it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everything in my life
was changing, why not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I tried it, and I remember
I didn't like it initially. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it got to blonde, I thought, huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Weirdly, looks okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't mind blonde.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But then also it did
make me look a bit weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think the silver
looked weird on you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think out of all the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that compared to a red or a blue, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, or a,
- Yeah, red is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, a standard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like I am a YouTuber, YouTube gamer color. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Compared to that, I think- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - YouTube gamer color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, Ninja. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Ninja. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, Ninja. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was a strong blue.
- Of you had like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if you had ninja hair, I
would've been like, uh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Strong blue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you a Twitch streamer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I've done, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Five or six different colors now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've done red, blue, green, pink, purple. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I have this like grayish- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Complete the rainbow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I have, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just wake up one
day and you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna try something different today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which Starburst color am I doing today? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But again, that's an easy
way to date my videos, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I know exactly what
era this video is from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just based on what color my hair is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's kind of cool, but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> If you don't like this,
that's totally fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'll get used to
it within like a month. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll get used to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - As with everyone does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm not even used to it right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I woke up this morning, I was like, ah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, who the fucks' that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just praying, I'm like, God, please, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope I don't have a weird
shaped head when I go bald. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly.
- Please, please, please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the one thing
- Please, please, please, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was worried about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it really shapes out my face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know how, how do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what the shape of your head is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You won't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't know do you?
- You won't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Until you get to like this
length and you're like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my head is fucking weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like we should
have found out a way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to figure out the shape of your head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without having to shave it all off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Science, come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> We must have figured something out, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It scans the contour of your head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure there's a
fucking filter or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that figures out.
- The filters always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> look shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Filters always look shit.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> They always look so cartoonishly bald. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Lex Luther bald. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No bald person looks like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like they just take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this fucking Jeff Bezos bald.
- Yeah, everyone's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Johnny Sins. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They all look like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Johnny Sins doesn't even
look like a real bald person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He doesn't, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] What a man, what a man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The king of bald man jobs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, aside from aside from
Joey getting his haircut, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched another anime this past week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you watch? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I watched "Jujutsu Kaisen 0." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh you watched the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In cinemas, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Say it, Garnt! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not mid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Not mid, not mid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I liked it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was good, it was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was, it was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you watch it in 4XD? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] What's 4XD? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where they like spit on you
and shake the chair and stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I didn't know that was an option. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did they gave that for "Jujutsu Kaisen?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, they did.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They did spit on you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They blow air. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's just one person like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like they blow air. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno, I liked the animation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was pretty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dunno if watching "Demon
Slayer" has just spoiled me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of like shonen anime films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Could be.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I went in, not with
like the expectations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was going to be "Demon
Slayer: Mugen Train" level, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I did come in knowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that was the last shonen
anime film that I had watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in theaters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I came out being just mildly amused </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just impressed by
some animation points. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But at the end of the day it
was the most seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I was gonna say
it's a seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was the story good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's okay.
- Uh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, okay- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The people in the cinema </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> next to me were fucking
bawling their eyes out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, you good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally everyone in the cinemas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I watched "Mugen Train"
was just light sobbing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> from every corner of the room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, oh now?
- I've, I've- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This woman next to me
was like full on bawling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, are you okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause to me, "Mugen Train", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing that made
"Mugen Train" special was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it actually felt cannon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, it actually
felt like it had a real, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tangible effect on the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas I know that "Jujutsu
Kaisen 0" is technically cannon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's technically
supposed to be a prequel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but also it's starring a main character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we hadn't seen before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Um, and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it is cannon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it is.
- It is cannon, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is cannon, but it didn't
feel like anything I watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in the movie had any effect
to like anything I watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the TV series at all.
- Little bit, little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Very minimal though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like mainly to do with the bad guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mainly to do with the bad guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I found out
spoilers from the people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was watching it with
and I was like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna spoil.
- Don't tell me, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna spoil, but it had like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it didn't really have
that much of an effect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It kind of felt like a
side story, if anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> rather than actually
having a proper, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I should care about all
the things going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think that's my problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a lot shonen anime movies is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's zero reason for me to care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about anything going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We spoke about this last
time we spoke about movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally every "One Piece" movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a good experience,
but it is a bit odd, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I think it's been number one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the box office in
Japan for 10 weeks now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not even surprised.
- These things are just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> money printers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're just money printers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - After "Mugen Train," every
industry is eagle vision </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on cinemas now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's where the money is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it feels like the
industry is definitely gearing up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more towards movies
'cause like, yeah, we're- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, "Heaven's Feel"
was like fucking insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well for that three month
process of all those movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause like when I got invited </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to see "Jujutsu Kaisen," I thought, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, it's a bit late, isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it still gonna be in cinemas? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I missed out on seeing "Dune," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that was only in cinemas
for like a month and a half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like maybe even less
in Japanese cinemas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But with anime movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it just seems like it just never goes out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, "Mugen Train" was
in cinemas for a year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - A year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like how is it, a year later,
people are still seeing it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in cinemas, and they're still
making money off this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I guess that's why it's
the top grossing anime movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of all time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my time scale for how
long movies are in cinemas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like completely fucking
destroyed by anime movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because they just never seem to go out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They always seem to be in there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How long has "Jujutsu Kaisen"
been in cinemas for now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] A couple months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Didn't it come out in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it came out Christmas Eve? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh shit, so it's almost three months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, almost three months.
- Yep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it doesn't seem like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's even close,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't seem like it's even close. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause they have
showings in 4XD, MXD or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and have 3D, and they
have all the Dolby Atmos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's a fuck ton going still. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like when I was stuck in Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the airport has a cinema there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, oh, maybe
I'll see what's playing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Literally it was "Jujutsu Kaisen
0" for every single place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] They didn't
have any other stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, they didn't have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it just one screen
or was it multiple screens? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I believe it was two screens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, that makes sense.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause there's a ton of
cinemas all around Tokyo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that have like 20 plus screens
or something ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you can watch, there's
tons of foreign films, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so many of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you can watch "Jujutsu
Kaisen" on seven of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I watched, ah,
"Operation Mincement?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it's called? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The one with Colin Firth? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That doesn't sound like a real movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Never heard of that, at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's about a World War II operation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they made a fake person, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but they got a real dead body
and gave it fake documents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then washed it up in Spain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, is that like
based off a true story? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it really happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Really, really cool story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] That's pretty dope. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically, they wanted
to make Germany think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the UK was gonna attack
somewhere they weren't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so the way they did it was
by floating a body to Spain, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with fake documents on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then Spain leaked it to Germany, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then Germany thought it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real stuff.
- Dang. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they made this
person look so convincing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they were a real person.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's pretty dope.
- Well that's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a really cool story,
but the movie was shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay, is it a comedy?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a drama, but the problem, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess it wasn't shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a very- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] How could you
think that a comedy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Five or six out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Lol. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It focuses on the personal
drama amongst the people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are doing the operation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] And so it's
kind of like a love- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like human drama biopic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It's like a
love triangle and shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a fucking war, what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do we, I didn't, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was very disinterested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "The Notebook" of World War II. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just kinda like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The thing is so interesting
itself that the whole story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but obviously there's
not much known about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so they obviously had to make a drama </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> inside of it.
- Build it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so it's kind of like,
I mean, Colin Firth's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> He's always great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it was just kinda like, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Just meh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well like, like going
back to what you said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about, yeah, it was shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was having this thought the other day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm getting so bored
of the word mid, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it just seems like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I tweeted out a tweet about
fucking "Demon Slayer" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the animation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And somehow that was one of
the most toxic Twitter tweets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You tweeted about
"Demon Slayer" animation? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - After what happened to me, Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just said "Demon
Slayer" had good animation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was it.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just like, oh yeah, "Demon Slayer," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched season two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, okay, maybe it
did deserve best animation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My fucking God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally had to mute
that thread, that thread, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to everything
else going on in the world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that was the thread that I
had to mute in the past week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gagging, just thinking
about that comment section. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - People are clowns, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It does have the best animation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not even a contest, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but people say there's other
things that are better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is the story the best? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But people are equating the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they don't like the show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or they don't like how much
attention it's getting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Being like, it doesn't
deserve the best animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it just flat out does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does that mean that it's a good show? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no it doesn't.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it a mid shonen
series, like story wise? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes, yes it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt gasping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the animation is fucking God tier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whoa, whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not associating
myself with that opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, I fucking love
"Demon Slayer," right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's the same reason why I watch porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like what's going on on the screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like the plot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That "I love Demon Slayer, but" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is the most paper thin,
- "I love Demon Slayer, but" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the most paper thin-
it's mid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You heard it here first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking, I was so
hype watching it, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But to sit here and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a complex storytelling.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's super simple shonen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's straightforward. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What does mid mean to you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What does mid mean to you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mid means to me that you can watch it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there are many aspects
of it that you enjoy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's also a lot of aspects about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just don't grip you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there's a lot about it that like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like "Jujutsu Kaisen." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, 'cause, I was having
this thinking, it seemed like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the story is mid, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - As an overall show, it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the story is, you
know, slightly above mid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's a solid story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It does everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Slightly above mid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is such a fucking meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like saying like
that's slightly above shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen, I-
- Is mid shit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The train movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna say it, it was boring as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was bored outta my mind watching that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The whole way? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, there was bits where it was good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the first- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - First 60%.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first like 70% of that movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was actually like ResidentSleeper, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I was sleeping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I agree with you.
- Yeah, I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, Goddamn! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think people forget that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because everyone already
thinks about the last fight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like the last 30
minutes of that movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause the last 30 minutes
were fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They were fucking amazing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The actual part when they
were on the train was to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty, pretty boring.
- It was boring as fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It was pretty boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The part where they
like go into the dreams, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, snooze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally snooze,
literally snooze, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It's, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but like, to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had this realization
that to me, something shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I say, oh yeah, it was pretty shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a five out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> To me that shit, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whereas I dunno, why- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is a five out of 10 shit to you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dunno why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To me, that borders on average. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, but that the thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you can-
- But when was the last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> five out of 10 thing you've watched? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can tell yourself
that five out of 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in your head means that, but it doesn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Five out of 10 means that,
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you're never gonna
give anything a one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you really hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never hear anyone
giving a three or a four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - See, 'cause in my
head like I'm operating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on the MyAnimeList rating score, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So when's the last
time you, in your mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gave something a five out of 10? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You could be watched, read, whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, because seven out of 10 means </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that you didn't hate it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you were happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you had an experience
that you were happy with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did it blow you away? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Five out of 10 means that you are not sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you wasted your time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why it feels
weird giving things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're like, it's mid, a five out 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause like I think a one out of 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't even wasting your time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause at that point- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] That's an insult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At that point you watch a one out of 10, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, this is just entertaining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is so shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, this so bad that it's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you watch "Ex-Arm,"
you watch "Berserk 2016," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, okay, this is
obviously fucking terrible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm having a good time watching this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just to shit on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But to me, it's like
five is at the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like, all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you do nothing good and nothing bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get a five, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the most basic.
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, to me a five out of
10, when it comes to anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me a five out of 10 is
like I finish watching it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel nothing about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I forget about it in a couple weeks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Five out of 10 for me is
like, have I wasted my time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, five out 10 to
me is have I wasted my time? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This was a waste of time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't get- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it wasn't horrible, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what would you define as four? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's because, huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What would you say four is then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Four is, okay, here's four.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Four to me is like, I'm
going to forget about this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but all I'm going to
remember about this show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it was a waste of my time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, because here's how- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Here's how I think why, when
we say what the average, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we say what the middle of the ground, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what the average score is,
most people will say seven, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though logically you think it's five. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's five, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay so if it's a five, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's probably like the lowest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you will ever finish a show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause to me, if it's a three or four, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watch one or two episodes,
and I didn't even finish it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's nothing in
that to grab my attention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Five is just like, there was
enough for me to finish it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I regret finishing
it because it was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Okay, I understand that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because there was nothing in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that made me want to remember
it or left an impact on me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the five out of tens
are like, in my opinion, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're the worst shows
because they're just thrown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> into this pile of like,
oh yeah, that existed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What would you give
"Jujutsu Kaisen" out of 10? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd give it like a seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, that's fair then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because it's like,
- And that's mid, seven? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, I wouldn't consider that mid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's okay.
- It's slightly above mid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - See to me, right, when you say seven, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> seven to me is like, you were
happy and had fun watching it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the moment it's over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't feel compelled
by the show at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There's nothing that makes it
really stick in your memory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a good experience
and you don't regret it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but nothing after the fact
makes you want to actively </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think about it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the thing, it's
like with "Jujutsu Kaisen," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I finished it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I had a pretty
good time watching it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, okay, yeah, this is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But when it was finished, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> am I compelled to go read the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like continue it on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, "My Hero Academia"
is the exact same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where season one, yeah, it was great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I can see why people enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a pretty good time with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I compelled to continue on with it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Personally, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What would you give the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> did you watch the new
"Demon Slayer" season yet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you watched it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What would you give it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I, personally, even though I
said the story is not the best, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I still think it's like
an eight or a nine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd give like solid eight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It went hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would give it an 8.5 to nine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the reason I say that is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're all in agreement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The Demon Slayer Councilors Society. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Strong eight, strong eight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I don't agree
that the story is mid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because a lot of people say the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of "Demon Slayer" is mid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and to me "Demon Slayer's" story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's as simple as it needs to be, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like it's as
simple as it needs to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to make the rest of the good parts shine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The problem with "Demon
Slayer" is when you have an arc, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like "Mugen Train", and there are fights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that don't stand out as much, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really, really
apparent, that the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and the characters don't
carry the show as much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But with season two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because half the season was a
fucking full on action fest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like,
- So good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, fucking hell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like an eight or nine out of 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the point where, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really care
about the story that much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if the action just
fucking slaps this hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How dare you say-
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How dare you say the animation is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think we ever talked about that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on the podcast, have we?
- You should be ashamed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should be fucking ashamed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm too afraid to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause I've been on the
other side quite recently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Getting canceled about
talking about the animation? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just trying to
think of a five out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the problem
with trying to remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a five out of 10 anime show,
is that I don't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why they're five
out of 10, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The moment I finish-
- What about manga? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What about manga? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you read more manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I can remember
- He is Joey the Manga Lad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most five out of 10 shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally, I go to the
list of isekai I've finished, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and a lot of these are
literally five out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even five out of 10 manga,
I just don't remember them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's the problem,
it's so hard to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about these kinds of like mediocre, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> middle of the ground shows, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's because unless I
recently re-watch it again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna remember it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh yeah, it's probably something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> along those lines, but
I wouldn't be able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concretely tell you this is the reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why it's a five out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just so impactless
that it's like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't even know that existed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you feel bad if you
feel like you've wasted time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching a show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Um. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Just no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I feel like when you start caring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that much about the media, you're, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the media why, sounds like the media, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] The media, the system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - About the stuff you're consuming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like you almost ruin
a lot of it for yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like stuff that you might have enjoyed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're worried too much
about if you're enjoying it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's kind of where I got to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately, with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It got to the point
where I was so selective </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on what I was watching to
make sure that everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was watching was worth my time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That if I ran into something
that I was like, well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wasted an hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of watching these
first three episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno if this is like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't consciously chosen to do this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I've stopped scrolling
or looking for shows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just kind of whatever
appears in front of you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whatever is recommended, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever is put in my head or- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's the
best way to consume media </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be honest.
- And honestly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been having a great time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel no pressure.
- I honestly wish, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I honestly wish I could do that because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] You have to watch anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no, it's not even anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like pretty much every form of media, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's not even about me
being like a fucking snob, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanting to like consume the best shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally, I started
really caring about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I just didn't have
the time to do everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to do, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like now nowadays, even if
it's just like picking a game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I want it to be a game I
could properly get into. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I don't want- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you'll be stuck in this cycle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of constantly worrying if
the game is good enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for your time and then you never play it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll never start, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never fucking play anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's why- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel games are way more of a time sink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> than an anime on average. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, it depends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But to me getting into a game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting properly absorbed into a game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's one of the most magical experiences, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I love fucking it
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I just get absorbed
into a video game world, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the same way that I get
absorbed into an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or absorbed into a manga
or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like, to me, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because my time is so
precious to me right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it sucks that I constantly
have to have this little part </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of my head that's just like,
oh, could you be watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something better that you'd
enjoy maybe a little bit more? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you really in the mood for this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You optimize your schedule
in every way, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I feel like the
stuff that you consume </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should be the one where
you're like, no pressure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like whatever you watch,
whatever you play, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't matter if it wasn't
the game of the year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doesn't matter if it wasn't
the movie of the year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just watch whatever comes
up, have an opinion on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched that "Don't Look Up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a shit movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The DiCaprio one, right?
- What an awful movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a five out of 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hated that movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You hated that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hated it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I heard a lot of people hated it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was so fucking bored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it went on for an an
hour longer than it needed to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And, yeah, there was
some funny moments of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was some bits that I chuckled, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but overall I just felt like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wasted my time.
- A waste of time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I was like, I'm glad I watched this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it gave me, even though I came out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disliking the movie, for some
reason that made me happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, yeah, that was shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was fun getting
to talk to other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who also thought it was shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I just liked it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I liked that I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that experience.
- I think as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because, even if you do
consume something that is shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> within that specific medium, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just broadens your
horizon more on the medium. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it adds to the
knowledge pool of like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now that I've consumed
something on the other side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the spectrum, now I'm a
little bit more knowledgeable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about what makes the
good shit good, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm definitely like that
with music where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's on fucking Spotify,
I'm just listening to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched as well, I watched
Spiderman movie, the new one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like, yeah, it was great, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it was just great,
and I had a good time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> my emotions are way stronger
about "Don't Look Up." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hated it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have more to talk about, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I have more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched "No Way Home"
and I had a great time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but at the end of the day, I've
already forgotten about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was, yeah, it was
good, but it was just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was a movie I fucking loved. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I liked it a lot, but
after I'm done with it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, that was everything
I expected it to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I had fun, but I don't
feel strongly about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's the thing
though, the problem is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the sweet spot of you
being able to really gush out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about something is like
when it's on two ends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the spectrum, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas it's either
so fucking incredible, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 out of 10 masterpiece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can just gush about
your love for it forever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there's the other
side where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let me tell you about
how absolutely atrocious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this shit was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, dude, I watched, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could you Google this for me, Ashley? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's Robert Pattinson's movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot the name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck, I watched it like three weeks ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] The new one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, it's an old one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Must've been a five out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Must have been a five out of ten. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] It was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh okay, that's just him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it "Good time?" "Good Time?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember what it's called. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Connor remembers the shit things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and forgets good things apparently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] "Good Time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Good Time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, dude, "Good Time?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Please fucking watch "Good Time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This movie was amazing.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it a good time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want you to watch it so
badly so we can talk about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's it about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't wanna say anything, but- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just go into it blind? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you watched "Uncut Gems?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how it's just anxiety simulator? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It is literally
like anxiety simulation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like a movie
that when you watch it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just felt like this was just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so glad I watched this movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just felt like I had
experienced something special </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that a lot of love and care went into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and that everyone really
just brought their A-game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Please watch it.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of Robert Pattinson's movies- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it still in cinemas? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, it came out years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] Came out 2017. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, again, go and watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I absolutely adore all of his stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he's really
good in a lot of things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm really hype for him as Batman. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm hype for him.
- I'm hype as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every movie I've watched
with him after "Twilight," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> he chose weird ass roles
that were just so good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and he just nailed it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's what I love about
- So hype for him as Batman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actors like that though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because Daniel Radcliffe did
the exact same thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, usually
those like super popular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> typecasted actors who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now people are just gonna
know me as this shit forever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm just gonna go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and do all the weird.
- All the weird shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - All the weird, artsy,
Daniel Radcliffe movies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen so many of them
and they're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> man, fucking respects, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can do shit like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And now he's doing Broadway shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He was doing that that
right after, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, good on you, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like actors going
weird and doing weird films </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like the actor equivalent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the YouTuber getting their hair dyed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, guys, I want an image change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna
do a bunch of weird shit now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure, they've all gone on,
like Shia LaBeouf as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> doing all the weird
shit afterwards as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which one did he do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nymphoma-? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Nymphomaniac." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a weird watch.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you watched that, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want Garnt to watch this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Nymphomaniac?"
- What's that about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the fucking director's name? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the really weird- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what a nymphomaniac is, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's about nymphomania. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know that's a three parter, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's three part, it's a trilogy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, it's two parts, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] Lars von Trier. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lars von Trier. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it's a Lars von Trier film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's two parts, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Two.
- Yeah, two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it two parts?
- It's two, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like what are you about three parts? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Uh, yeah, two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Volume one and two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not of "Nymphomaniac," of that universe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No, the one with Shia
LaBeouf movies are two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched them and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a universe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a trilogy of Lars von Trier movies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and "Nymphomaniac" I
think is the third one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Something like that.
- You, you should see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, right?
It is weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a fucking weird movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's uncomfortable, and it-
- It's weird, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like Lars von Trier
- He's fucking weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is known to make some
really disturbing movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Very disturbing,
very disturbing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And "Nymphomaniac" is probably, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen all of the Lar von Trier movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and "Nymphomaniac" is easily
the fucking weirdest one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, oh, Shia LaBeouf's in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just go from "Even
Stevens," "Shut up, sis," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, oh gosh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jesus.
- Oh good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't wish to see
Shia LaBeouf's butt hole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in three different scenes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But there it is, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't mean to watch this movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It came on the TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, where did you, how did you see it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was on TV? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was on TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was in a hotel, and like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't it an X-rated movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was in Bulgaria, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was on TV or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You watched it in Bulgaria.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know I watched it
in a European country, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was on TV at like
2:00am, and I couldn't sleep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I watched it just,
I remember just thinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Must have felt like
a fucking fever dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It was weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, anything Lars von Trier makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is a fucking fever dream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's weird, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do you guys think like
trash TV fits into everything? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Would you call trash T, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what rating would you
give "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Or "90 Day Fiance?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it just depends 'cause people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it depends if you grew
up on it or not, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Were you surrounded- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like the character of Gordon Ramsay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm invested in that character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that most of it, especially
in "Kitchen Nightmares," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> are all faked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't a shit.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But also that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It depends on if you were
raised in a family where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it was a family event to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh it's Wednesday night, let's
watch "Kitchen Nightmares." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that kind of thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't grow up in a family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like that.
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So to me, I didn't grow
up with trash TV at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We never watched it together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched it on YouTube.
- Yeah, so when I watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So the first time I knew
about "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was through YouTube clips, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Or any TLC show, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, what the
fuck is this, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, just 'cause I
knew "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that was literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when I first saw Gordon Ramsay as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was the British "Kitchen
Nightmares" as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was, you compare
British "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to American "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like fucking night and day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not only the editing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but just how toned down
Gordon Ramsay is as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Toned down in the British one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he's toned down.
- He's chill, he's chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's different, right,
'cause it feels like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the American one, it
feels like they actually get- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a formula. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is a formula, but
it feels like they get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the worst of the worst
fucking chefs and restaurants, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual clowns. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To present their dish to Gordon Ramsay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's almost cartoonish in a way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you look at the British one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it feels like it's just chefs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who actually give shit a about their food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who actually just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who need some advice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who need some advice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of the times Gordon
Ramsey is giving them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> genuine advice and maybe
they're too it headstrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or maybe they're too, you
know, prideful to really listen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to his advice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas, you know, in America
it actually feels more like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is not even a reality TV anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This looks so cartoony,
and feels so over the top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that you just don't
even take it seriously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just feel that way about
99% of American trash TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you know which one I hate the most? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate it 'cause I used
to also watch it a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The fucking "Pawn Stars." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's that one?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know it, it's the,
you know, "Pawn Stars." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the one, it's set in Vegas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the one with the bald
guy and someone comes in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he is like, I've got this
thing worth 20 million dollars, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like, I'll give
you 10 bucks for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Oh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I thought you said porn stars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like pawn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're British.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We pronounce it the same way, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Pawn Stars." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Unfortunately, we're not American </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where they're like "Pawn Stars." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Pawn Stars." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought it was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We say porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it was a fucking
show about little porn stars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, what is this reality TV show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's "Pawn Stars," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's also "Hardcore Pawn" as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the other one that
was a spin off to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was a British
version of it as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was it called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Pawn, innit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Car Boot Salers
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that show is just,
'cause it's obviously fake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but also at the same time,
you're like, it is just cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just seeing weird brought shit in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've driven past the "Pawn Stars" place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in Vegas.
- But, it's fake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't even film it in there, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's filmed somewhere else.
- They don't actually film it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They just film B-roll outside of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's in the
most ghetto part of Vegas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so scary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, you know, there'll
be, this guy comes in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He'll be like, I have
this mummified corpse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's been sitting in my
grandma's attic in Nevada. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, oh, you know, I know an expert. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna bring him down.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And 10 seconds later, the
experts then he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well it is a mummified corpse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's worth about $50,000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he goes, I'll
give you 20 bucks for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What am I gonna do with
the mummified corpse? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What are we gonna do with that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just so dumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The whole formula is shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then they just walk out angrily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, you're missing
out on a great deal, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, what I didn't
understand about "Pawn Stars" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is when they started
introducing story lines, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - B Plots, they're B Plots. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they're would be
B-Line plots with their family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that would get resolved in an episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's an episode of "Happy Days" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Same as "Storage Wars" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, I remember "Storage Wars." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was so big in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The American one played on UK television </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so fucking much.
- Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so popular, it was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I just, yeah, thinking
back on it I used, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that was the one actually trash TV </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that came on Australian TV all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And my dad was obsessed with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just loved it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause there would literally
be a pile of shit in this room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and these guys be like
sell that for 50 bucks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sell that for 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like where are you gonna sell this to? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like a used bed sheet, he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's five bucks right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no, it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're not selling this for five bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if, though, it's all connected? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The trash TV universe where they- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The trash TV universe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In "Storage Wars" they take all the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they go to the "Pawn Stars" place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to sell it off.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just don't get, I don't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause half the time, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course there'll be these fake ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that'll be like, this guy has a lot full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of perfect rarity Charizards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in perfect grade.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, well obviously
we can sell those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But other times there's
just lots or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's just all shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, even if
you could make a profit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> selling this, surely the amount of time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get rid of all of this shit and sell it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just not worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you could sell the pack
of AA batteries for 10 bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you really wanted
to, but why would you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where are you gonna sell this to? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you shipping it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Surely that has to be taken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into account.
- Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the only country
where I see that working, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, where you can
actually sell the stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people will buy it and reuse it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They do have storage lots in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think they sell them, do they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> When they, when they- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't, I'm pretty
sure they don't sell them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They actually use storage
for storage purposes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but the storage lots, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think if somebody doesn't collect it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think they just get
rid of all the stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, they just throw it all out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't think they sell
them to the public, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which would be shame. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause we need a Japan
"Storage Wars" version. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That would be- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Storage Wars!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Dude, that would be epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tanaka-san thinks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> he can get a great deal.
- Directed by Hosoda Mamoru. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I can't, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I know more
American reality TV shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> than I know British reality TV shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't think of many- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We have- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You guys have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Naked Attraction."
- You know the one- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We do have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Naked Attraction."
- No, no, no, no- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love that show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I went back to the
UK, that was still on TV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was still airing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Channel 4.
- I love that show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, the ones that actually I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a reality TV show
where you feel bad watching it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But even if it's, I dunno
how much of it's fake, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know the debt collectors one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the one where I'm
always, even if this is fake, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> should we really be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> making storylines?
- Which one is that one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a bunch in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> We fucking love debt collecting shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the UK for some reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We love watching debt collectors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as long as we're not
on the butt end of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what's the premise? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just-
- They go and collect debts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like Jim
owes the bank $50,000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So Jeremy over here is
gonna go over to his house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and collect it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's see what happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in the British one, it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some guy goes to the house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey, we've come here to get the stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, fuck off, mate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, you're not fucking getting my thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck right off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, they've
got a high magistrates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> court notice to collect this stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If they don't, they'll
start collecting things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off the property. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the police turn up
and then it's just fucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's like, oh these poor people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who've had some horrible circumstance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we're just shoving
cameras in their face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> while their apartments being ransacked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're selling the stuff off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, they should have
- It's like how do you feel? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> paid their debts.
Tell me how you feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they probably
should pay their debts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But wouldn't everyone pay
their debts if they could? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Wait, is it called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What a stupid name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have never heard of that name before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've watched it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's on Channel 5. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Day in the life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of a repo man.
- I don't watch Channel 5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna send you links. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I've ever
watched a single program. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on Channel 5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guarantee if you watch
one, you'll get hooked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Is Channel 5
the trash TV channel? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just the trash channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so addictive watching this stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno why,
- Like to me Channel 4- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just can't help yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But to me like Channel 4 is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where a lot of the trash TV goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even though I can't think of any. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, Channel 4 has good stuff too though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but Channel 4 is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Channel 4 is actually
one of the best channels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It has the widest range. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It seems to be the most
experimental as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> BBC is just very standard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Here's your fucking "Doctor Who." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] "The Voice." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's "The Voice" . </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ITV is just like here's
"X Factor" once again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a reality TV show actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] "Britain's Got Talent" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's a reality TV show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I completely forgot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's reality TV show times
a hundred though, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no one cares about singing reality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Does is "X Factor" still going? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Does anyone, is "X
Factor" still happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm pretty sure it's still happening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] But does anyone give a fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Love Island" as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Love island," is that ITV? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like that's ITV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It is ITV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so you got like, I feel- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's really
popular America as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the British one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really popular in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, "The Great British
Bake Off" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I completely forgot about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which can't be called
Bake Off in the US. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - One of the US brands has the trademark. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, like Easy Bake? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One of them has the
trademark to "Bake Off." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Bake Off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's called
something else in America, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and they've had to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Cook off? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They've had to actually, on Netflix, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they've had to animate over
certain parts of the show where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the trophy.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They did CGI where they
changed what the trophy said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] Oh, its called "The
Great American Baking Show." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "The Great American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Baking Show!"
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, because they didn't have the rights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for the word bake off.
- Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause for some reason a
company owns the rights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the word bake off, which is weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah, they changed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So that is popular in the US, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's called technically
something different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The baking show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Great British Baking Show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Just doesn't roll off in tongues as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds so stiff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Does Australia have any reality TV shows? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, we've got "Australian Idol" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and "The Voice Australia"
and all that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How did "The Voice" get popular? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> At which point in time did we decide </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we need more than one
singing reality TV show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When was "X Factor" just not enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's because
shows like "X Factor" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and "American Idol"
where a lot of the times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there was contention of
are they judging them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on their actual singing
or are they judging them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on their performance?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So people are like, we want to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if they can actually sing
and looks don't matter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that whole fucking,
you know, inclusive thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just hate how they treat
you, the audience as idiots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and feed you these garbage storylines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also get confused about the judges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on a lot of these shows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "X Factor" has, or
"Britain's Got Talent," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has fucking ruined so
many fucking songs for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because they use
at the emotional point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I hear "You Raise Me
Up" one more fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always "You Raise Me Up" right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, like Golden Buzzer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "You Raise Me Up."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the "X Factor," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait, they didn't win, Susan Boyle, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did Susan Boyle win? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No, she came second, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't remember.
- Did Susan Boyle win? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that is the peak
of how TV manipulates- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Us to just wanna, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll give you an underdog,
and they've got a sad story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, I've never had a boyfriend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, oh no.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, and the show doesn't give a shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they haven't had a boyfriend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they're like, look audience care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Care about this, care about this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They do it all the time as
well with military stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, they'll be
someone who wants to compete </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who maybe like served in
Afghanistan or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And instead of just being
like, hey, this is the talent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, no, you are the
guy who went to Afghanistan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Your whole identity is
about going to Afghanistan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're doing this for your
troops back in Afghanistan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause their one last wish
is to see you perform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what they do, that's what they do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was watching a thing
with Chris in the hotel room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was a "Britain's Got Talent" person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was performing magic, and
they served in the military. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it was just insulting
how they almost shoved it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> down your throat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the guy's only
reality as a human being, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that he served in a war. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can we not just be people? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Do we have to just shove down
these suggestible stories? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How about you follow
the name of your show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just be like, do you have a talent? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes or no? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But this is not about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's about how's your story compelling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So in this magic show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy's doing these tricks and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and not to minimize it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was almost beat
for beat predictable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's this one
trick where he was doing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was like, oh, look the
clock and tell me the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so right before the
point of this trick goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like Chris, 'cause
Chris is watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, I bet
it's the time where one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of his friends died or
something in the war. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I shit you not, two
seconds later he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the time when my friend passed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna say that that is
obviously horrific and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But the fact that they're
using this as like bait for us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's almost even trivializes it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it doesn't feel real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The impact is gone, because
it feels so manufactured. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They might as well have
just put up a cue card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like now cry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, I wanna make sure
I'm not diminishing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or trying to minimize
it or make it seem like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not on the guy, it's
on the editors of the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's on the producers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The shows probably heard
this story or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like, yo, play that up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> play that up.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude, people wanna fucking cry, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because it's been
proven plenty of times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the auditions that we see televised </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in front of a live audience, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't actually the first audition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They go through several
stages with the producers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guarantee he was doing that magic trick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and one of the producers
heavily suggested, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, you should, you should- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't know this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Speculation, by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speculation, speculation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In my mind, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like one of the
producers just went, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, I feel like
you should kind of try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to integrate that story line
into your magic trick somehow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Could be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's definitely kinda
stuff that producers would do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We've seen, you know,
if you ever look at the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> people have released
the contracts and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're pretty predatory contracts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of the time, I can't
remember which one it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> either one of these shows,
one of the British ones, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> by signing the contract,
they owned everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you would make that you
would self-publish online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was "American Idol." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - One of them.
- One of those, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So if you went to even audition </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you posted content
online, if they wanted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they could turn around and
be like, hey, that's ours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's ours, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's just fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Could be
"Britain's Got Talent." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I think it might have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Britain's Got Talent." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was 'cause I saw
the YouTube video about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Also, Susan Boyle didn't win. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She lost out to Diversity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's right, the people who did the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like a big, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think everyone at the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when this was
happening when I was younger, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone was like, oh
Susan Boyle's gonna win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there was a big effort to
make it so that she didn't win, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or that was public opinion.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> This is when people gave

<SPEAKER_02> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever thought about
going on a show like that, or? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a great question, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Part of me is like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw a guy on YouTube, I
think I showed you guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He went on a show, playing a character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like just making
fun of the whole process </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like with secret camera
and stuff, showing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but then I think the
show took everything down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it was very- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because he signed the contract. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You had to sign the contract
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to get on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But a part of me has thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wonder if I made up a storyline </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I really committed to it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how easy would it be to get on TV? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it would be pretty easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which comedian did it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A British one did it, didn't he? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did he? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't put a past British comedian. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which one was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He made up like a storyline
about, I think it was, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which comedian was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, British comedian who
went on "Britain's got Talent" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want say the
storyline in case I'm wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Daliso Chaponda? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh hold on, let me Google. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me do a bit more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Not sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Give us a second. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Give us sec. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] What British comedian? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - He made it so that his, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think his backstory was a
Holocaust survivor or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like Jewish or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember it was like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, while he's searching, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guess I'll add onto the conversation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, I don't know why
people would want to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on reality TV shows now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you can just post
yourself up on YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like that need to have
your five seconds of fame is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that need is disappearing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because at any moment in
time you post a TikTok, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can get like a few million views, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at a complete chance, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, reality TV has figured this out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why they often recruit
people on social media. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They go on social media
and like DM them, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> hey, we're from "Britain's Got Talent." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Would you be interested in auditioning? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We can guarantee you to
get to the second judges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or something.
- Ah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sneaky motherfuckers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you not watched clips
of the talent shows recently? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It feels- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It feels less like a talent
show and more like, hey! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause there's people who
are from all over the world, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like American and Canadian, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just seems like they're
just getting anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who does anything interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to come on.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And who has a compelling
story supposedly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's more like they're less
so a talent show of the people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and more a talent show
to just amuse the people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they just get acts
from across the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then just loosely
tie together a story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the real YouTube Rewind now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> since YouTube Rewind
isn't a thing anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The talented people Rewind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I'll have to find it after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But what was the story then was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so he made up that he
was a Holocaust victim, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can I have your phone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I can try and Google it.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I might remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, here we go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, Lee Nelson. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it was by Channel 4. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at the thumbnail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, wow.
- Oh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think he made up a fake storyline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about being a rabbi and something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then whatnot and Channel 4 posted it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was part of "Balls of Steel" I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Balls of Steel," yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I remember "Balls of Steel." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't even know that
was still going on, geez. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not, this is from a while back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember he made up some story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> about being a Hebrew rabbi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and playing a bunch of
generic sympathy cards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and yeah.
- Oh wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, it was really easy for him to get on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then I think he
got to the live show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember what happened, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he then came out or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was just showing how
easy it is to fake stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, 'cause I haven't watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much reality TV show, not much
like of these talent shows, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I should say, as much as I used to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because before it felt like
everyone was talking about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially when you lived in England. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was inescapable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, everyone was talking
about who's gonna win </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Britain's Got Talent" or "X Factor?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now it just feels like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if its just my
social circle has changed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or if the viewership has genuinely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just had a sharp drop off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like I rarely hear anyone talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about these big talent shows anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one cares. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because no one really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the demographic of watching TV now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is just completely shifted, I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - TV's just background noise now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No one actually gives a shit
about what's going on on TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I feel, you know- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, at least people under 40. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I feel like people
nowadays would rather, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well obviously, would rather get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a fucking MrBeast video
or something, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Totally, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, it is weird, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I had this thought the other day where- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the new "America's Got Talent." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did have this thought the other day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and correct me if I've
already talked about this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the podcast 'cause I can't
remember if I have or not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it feels like YouTube in a sense has, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the internet moves so fast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube has become the new TV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's almost like TikTok
that has become the new YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a sense, where TikTok is
this big, rising piece of media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And remember back in the
day where every YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you have made it as a YouTuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you could appear on TV, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you could appear on old media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nowadays it feels like
every TikTok is trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make a name for themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on YouTube.
- On YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like YouTube that
is the established media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and the established platform. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I definitely think so, yeah.
- I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like another transition
of, just weird, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the same time as well, it's almost, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of YouTubers
now doing the opposite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're trying to
jump onto TikTok now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and making a name for themselves there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they think, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the whole grass is greener </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on the other side concept, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Where it's like, which
is the real main source </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of income now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many YouTubers do you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I don't know many aside from, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think Hank Green's
the only one I've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot on TikTok and like YouTube shorts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's really fun to watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] Hank Green is moving
away from TikTok to like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's going to Instagram shorts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever the thing now, isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen fucking Ray William
Johnson on TikTok a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Seeing Ray William Johnson just have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> his revival.
- Dude, seeing Ray William, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Dude, seeing Ray William
Johnson do =3 content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on TikTok is like insane to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so weird because it
is literally just =3 content, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the shit he was making
15 years ago on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It is weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And all these new gen
kids are just like, hey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have you heard of this
hilarious, new wacky guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> called Ray William Johnson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think anyone's
calling it hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean it's making numbers though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, surprisingly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of things made numbers
on TikTok that are shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not saying his are shit, but I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you saying it's just okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's mid, it's mid.
- It's mid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ray William Johnson is- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Seven out of 10? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it actual mid or you
know, or is it five out 10? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's mid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's mid content on TikTok? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Ray William Johnson. </SPEAKER_04>
