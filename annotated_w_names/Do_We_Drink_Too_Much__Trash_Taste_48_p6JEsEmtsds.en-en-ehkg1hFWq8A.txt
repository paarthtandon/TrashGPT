<connor> - They would do this thing at my pool, </connor>
<connor> where they would have like </connor>
<connor> how to learn how to kayak in the pool. </connor>
<connor> - Like in the pool? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they would they would put six kayaks in the pool </connor>
<connor> and just let people kayak around it. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know how this happened, </connor>
<connor> but after the kayakers left, </connor>
<connor> there was a shit in the pool? </connor>
<connor> Now, they're in kayaks. </connor>
<connor> How do they get in the pool? </connor>
<connor> Kids are fucking weird, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Kids are weird. </garnt>
<joey> (gentle upbeat music) </joey>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to another episode of "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host for today, Garnt, Grant, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the fuck you wanna call me, </garnt>
<garnt> and with me, as usual, is the boys </garnt>
<garnt> - The boys. - The boys. </garnt>
<connor> - You know it's really selfish of you to have that name, </connor>
<connor> because it's really inconvenient for me </connor>
<joey> when I'm texting about you. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> It keeps auto correcting. </joey>
<joey> - It want's to keep correcting it. </joey>
<connor> You know how inconvenience that is to me, Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - Do you know how inconvenient it is </garnt>
<garnt> when it auto-corrects my own name </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm referring to myself? (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It's even more inconvenient, </connor>
<joey> 'cause when you look up Garnt on like Wikipedia it goes </joey>
<joey> to my fucking Wikipedia? - Yeah, what the fuck. </joey>
<garnt> Like fucking tin foil hat. </garnt>
<joey> - When you look up, I think it's like, </joey>
<garnt> I saw it on the subreddit, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, when you look up Gigguk, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the Anime Man. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What is Gigguk's real name? </joey>
<garnt> Joey Bazinga. </garnt>
<garnt> Bazinga, sorry. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Bazinga. - I fucking said it. </joey>
<joey> - You've known each other for how long? </joey>
<joey> Fucking hell. </joey>
<garnt> - So how are you doing boys? </garnt>
<garnt> It's been a while. </garnt>
<garnt> You guys don't know this, </garnt>
<joey> but it's been like a three-week break </joey>
<joey> since we last recorded through the magic of scheduling. </joey>
<joey> You wouldn't have had a break at all, </joey>
<garnt> but yeah, it's been three weeks, </garnt>
<garnt> since we last had a recording. - Yeah, I mean... </garnt>
<garnt> - We had a three week break, right? </garnt>
<connor> Because, well, you went on journey across Japan. </connor>
<joey> - I went on journey, </joey>
<joey> across Japan. - A broad and a man. </joey>
<joey> - A broad and a man. - A broad and a man. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] A broad and a man. </connor>
<joey> - I also hung out with Chris before that in Kyoto. </joey>
<joey> So it was like kind of like an awkward timing </joey>
<connor> where it was like three weeks where we couldn't record. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but I don't know, it's been a nice refresh, I'd say. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Came back and... </connor>
<connor> - Sick of fucking seeing you guys. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, God. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Every week, Jesus man. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it's 'cause I think normally, </connor>
<joey> especially when we did three episodes in one week, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause that's what we did to allow us to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> On the last episode I was like fine, </garnt>
<connor> what are we we're talking about? </connor>
<garnt> - There's only so much I can chat shit, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> if we're chatting shit every day, </garnt>
<garnt> for like three times a week or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's not like we're all going out </joey>
<joey> and doing like interesting things every day, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like five days out of a week, </joey>
<joey> we're just in our room like just working on videos. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean we talked about this earlier, </garnt>
<garnt> but like how do like streamers who stream every day, </garnt>
<garnt> and just like, what do they talk about? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause sometimes when we have </garnt>
<garnt> more than one recording a week, sometimes I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what the fuck to talk about sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> Like what's going on new with you guys. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, the barrel is very shallow. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> It's like the bottom is just there. </garnt>
<connor> - What's going on new? </connor>
<connor> Oh, playing games? </connor>
<connor> Oh, you're playing Apex. </connor>
<connor> Oh, just like last week? </connor>
<garnt> Oh, cool. - And what am I supposed to do </garnt>
<connor> if like the police don't stop me once a week, right? </connor>
<connor> Like what am I supposed to talk about? </connor>
<joey> - I need to commit a crime to make a story. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like running out of stories, man. </joey>
<joey> What am I supposed to do? </joey>
<connor> It's like if you're streamer, </connor>
<joey> you've got to be talking about the other streams, </joey>
<joey> that happened (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just gotta like watch YouTube videos, that's about it. </joey>
<joey> - Some had this, really funny name last stream </joey>
<connor> called, Peepee Poopoo. </connor>
<joey> That was a really fun moment. </joey>
<joey> - Let me drag that out for 15 minutes. </joey>
<connor> I mean, it's like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how much I'm allowed to talk about </connor>
<connor> journeying across Japan, </connor>
<connor> because I think at this point </connor>
<connor> it's probably- - It's free promo Chris. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's probably, not even out yet, </connor>
<connor> but I think the trailer will be out by then. </connor>
<joey> So if you wanna check that out, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Here's a teaser, Joey won't say everything that happened, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure. - Just go, </joey>
<connor> and watch the videos. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah just go watch the videos, whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I literally came back yesterday as of us recording this. </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah- - How was it? </garnt>
<garnt> Was it- - Oh it was fucking insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hype it up! </garnt>
<joey> - Hype it up for Chris. - I'll hype it up. </joey>
<joey> All right, I'll hype it up for Chris. </joey>
<joey> Journey across Japan two, </joey>
<joey> I should probably explain what Journey Across Japan is. </joey>
<garnt> So if you don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> Journey Across Japan is a series that Chris Broad, </garnt>
<garnt> who's been on the show a couple of times- </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me guess, you go across Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> - We go across Japan- </garnt>
<garnt> - I was gonna say, it kind of speaks for itself. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a show we do together on Chris' channel, </garnt>
<joey> where we go across Japan, do like challenges </joey>
<joey> and like go visit cool places in Japan </joey>
<joey> And Journey Across Japan Three, </joey>
<joey> is like the third one we just finished, </joey>
<connor> where we went through Kyushu, </connor>
<connor> which is like the most Southern island in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Awesome because I'd never been to Kyushu, like at all. </connor>
<connor> And just this past week, </connor>
<connor> I went through all the prefectures of Kyushu in one go. </connor>
<joey> So it was fucking great. </joey>
<connor> - Speed running tourism. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah we were speed running Kyushu, literally. </joey>
<connor> - I like how Chris took you around all the amazing places, </connor>
<joey> and he took me to like the shittiest place. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Did he? </joey>
<joey> - Didn't you go to like a gin factory or something? </joey>
<garnt> - No 'cause, we did go to a gin factory, </garnt>
<garnt> - Was that like the highlight? </garnt>
<garnt> - That was the highlight, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Just got to drink really nice gin, that was like free, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like- - Oh that's cool. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, then you can just be like, make me this cocktail, </joey>
<joey> and they made it, which is great. </joey>
<joey> Which is like just a power trip that I needed in my life. </joey>
<joey> - But you've already been to Kyoto, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I've been once before. </joey>
<joey> But he found this Welsh town, </joey>
<joey> like Welsh British town, </joey>
<joey> like an hour- - In Kyoto? </joey>
<joey> - In like an hour in the mountains in Kyoto, drive. </joey>
<connor> - Wow. And it was, </connor>
<connor> yeah, it was pretty shit. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It was good, but it was just kinda like </connor>
<connor> really underwhelming. </connor>
<joey> - Was it just like home or? </joey>
<garnt> - Weirdly, weirdly yeah. - Did you feel like </garnt>
<garnt> culturally appropriated in it? (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Is this how people feel </connor>
<connor> when they see white people wearing kimonos? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm like this kind of cool, but like what's going on? </connor>
<joey> Like why? - I also wanted you </joey>
<joey> to be like, "Oh God, this is so shit. </joey>
<joey> Just reminds me of home." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I mean, yeah basically. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I feel bad dogging on it. </connor>
<connor> It was just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> it was really bizarre and like underwhelming, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But also the fish and chips is $22, which is criminal. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I'm sure like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how it feels like for say like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> someone who lived in China going to like China town, </garnt>
<connor> or something like that? </connor>
<garnt> - Well I mean, it's kind of different, though, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it? - There's always like markets </garnt>
<garnt> and restaurants, right? - Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like Chinatown is never like, this actually China. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, describe to me this Welsh town then? </joey>
<joey> - So there was- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what about it made it Welsh? </joey>
<joey> - All the buildings looked like they were just pulled out </joey>
<connor> of like a small town in Wales. </connor>
<connor> It was really weird. </connor>
<connor> And it was just really old style, </connor>
<joey> like the places where you'd find in like West Wales, </joey>
<joey> and it was just really strange, </joey>
<connor> 'cause it's like, I didn't particularly- </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Was like everything written in Welsh or? </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Well, one of the pubs was called, </connor>
<joey> Pond Oak and pond means bridge in Welsh. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, okay </joey>
<joey> At least they were accurate about it, right? </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] That was pretty cool. </garnt>
<connor> - Are people fucking sheep around the corner? </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - No I was there, </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's a deer, bring your own sheep. </joey>
<joey> - It was, okay. </joey>
<connor> I'm just pretty sure I'm really sarcastic about everything. </connor>
<joey> And it was just like, </joey>
<garnt> I feel like this is the one time where I can be like, </garnt>
<garnt> time to actually become sarcastic about something, </garnt>
<garnt> and no one can correct to me 'cause I'm fucking British. </garnt>
<connor> - This is my culture now. </connor>
<joey> Welcome to my culture. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - It probably wasn't as offensive, </joey>
<joey> as the first time I went to a Outback Steakhouse, right? </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, is this what Australia is to everyone? </joey>
<joey> Fucking boomerangs on the wall everywhere? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, just like in an Australian home. </joey>
<joey> - I don't really know. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I'm pretty, I kinda bash on every culture, </connor>
<connor> but I by far bash on my own culture </connor>
<connor> more than anything. - Well, that's good, </connor>
<connor> because if it was anything else, </connor>
<garnt> if it was anything else, </garnt>
<joey> it'd be really bad to say right now. </joey>
<garnt> - Americans be like, "Oh really?" </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty harsh- - A fucking vein </connor>
<garnt> popping out their head. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm pretty harsh on Americans, </garnt>
<connor> I feel like I'm more harsh, </connor>
<connor> on the UK- - I feel like, </connor>
<garnt> that's just part of British culture, right? </garnt>
<joey> Because you rag on everyone equally, </joey>
<joey> but you especially rag on your own culture. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like for some reason </joey>
<joey> when someone else rags on your culture, you're like, </joey>
<garnt> no only I get to complain about my culture, </garnt>
<joey> thank you very much. </joey>
<joey> - It's the one-time everyone becomes patriotic. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like being British </joey>
<connor> you can't really complain anymore. </connor>
<connor> Everyone fucking mocks British people now. </connor>
<connor> So you kinda just get used to it. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, yes, honey. </connor>
<connor> Oh, you made another British meme, bottle of water? </connor>
<garnt> All right, yes, honey. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like self-deprecation </garnt>
<garnt> is just part of British culture, and British mentality. </garnt>
<joey> - It's such an amazing fall though, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, especially on YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause like remember like- </garnt>
<garnt> - The rise and fall of British culture. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because remember in like 2015, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone was fucking obsessed with British culture, </garnt>
<joey> and now everyone's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, innit is the English form of desu." </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's just 'cause, the internet has just realized, </garnt>
<garnt> what British people actually sound like. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - To be fair, I always wondered that When I was growing up. </connor>
<connor> I'm like no one sounds like this around me. </connor>
<joey> - Everyone in the UK doesn't sound like Harry Styles? </joey>
<joey> What? </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember growing up, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> when I the world gonna realize </joey>
<joey> that people don't sound like they do in Harry Potter, </joey>
<joey> or every other like British film, </joey>
<garnt> or like "Doctor Who" or whatever, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just waiting for the day that everyone realizes that </joey>
<joey> not everyone in Australia that looks like Chris Hemsworth. </joey>
<connor> - Debatable. </connor>
<joey> I know like two people and they look, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're one of them, you look close enough. </joey>
<joey> - To Chris Hemsworth? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You get ripped, you'll look like Chris Hemsworth. </connor>
<joey> - No, if I get ripped I'll look like Jason Mamoa. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh, yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - What are you waiting for, Joey? </joey>
<joey> Tell me what else did you get up to then in Fukuoka, </joey>
<joey> that you can tease for us. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I can tease, well, I mean, </joey>
<connor> Journey Across Japan, so there's always a theme. </connor>
<connor> So like the first Journey Across Japan was- </connor>
<joey> - Was cycling. - Yeah, was Chris cycling, </joey>
<joey> and I was just on one part of it. </joey>
<joey> But then the second Journey Across Japan, </joey>
<connor> I was there fully for it. </connor>
<connor> And it was called "Escape to Fuji." </connor>
<connor> So the theme of it was we went around Mount Fuji </connor>
<connor> and like all the cool places we can go to Mount Fuji, </connor>
<connor> because Chris had never seen a nice view of Mount Fuji, </connor>
<connor> in his life. </connor>
<joey> So he's never taken one of those like touristy photos. </joey>
<joey> And he kept like, </joey>
<joey> apparently his audience kept sending him pictures </joey>
<joey> of amazing views. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Hey look, Chris, I was here for two days, </joey>
<joey> and I got an amazing view of Mount Fuji" </joey>
<joey> Fuck you. </joey>
<garnt> - You can check it out now, by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you can check it out now, it's all there. </garnt>
<garnt> So the third Journey Across Japan is called, </garnt>
<garnt> "The Lost Islands," </garnt>
<garnt> because the Kyushu area has all these like tiny- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Jurassic park, here man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Even though like the fucking promotional artwork, </connor>
<joey> looks like a fucking shitty movie poster. </joey>
<joey> It's like a (indistinct), </joey>
<joey> I said shitty, it looks amazing. </joey>
<joey> But like, yeah so the Kyushu area, </joey>
<joey> it's almost like an archipelago of just these, </joey>
<joey> like insane amount of tiny- - Wait, what was that word, </joey>
<connor> sorry? - Archipelago. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> Someone needs to whip out a dictionary, </joey>
<joey> what is that? - An archipelago it's like- </joey>
<joey> - Is like a group of islands, right? </joey>
<joey> - Is like a group of islands. - I've never heard of this. </joey>
<joey> I'm not even gonna pretend to be smart. </joey>
<joey> I did not know that word, man. </joey>
<joey> - An archipelago is basically like a group, </joey>
<joey> of lots of small islands- - When did you learn </joey>
<joey> that word Joey? </joey>
<joey> Did you learn it before the trip? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - No, I learnt it... (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That is not a common word. </garnt>
<connor> - I learnt it in school. </connor>
<garnt> - It's in like films. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you guys know that word? </connor>
<connor> You guys knew that word? </connor>
<connor> Did you know that word Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> - An archipelago? - Meilyne didn't know </connor>
<connor> that word either. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Really, you're looking for Meilyne's </garnt>
<joey> to be on your side here. - Oh, fuck of. </joey>
<connor> - Well, it's something. </connor>
<connor> - So like the Philippines for example is an archipelago, </connor>
<joey> because it's just a bunch of tiny, </joey>
<garnt> tiny, tiny islands, right? - Stop flexing. </garnt>
<joey> So basically in layman's- </joey>
<garnt> - It's fucking cross-pollination all over again, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - In layman's terms, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lots of tiny, tiny islands, </garnt>
<joey> along the coast of Kyushu. </joey>
<joey> So we were like, oh, that's perfect. </joey>
<joey> We'll call it the lost islands, </joey>
<joey> because we'll try and go to as many of these, </joey>
<joey> like small islands. </joey>
<joey> And I think we ended up going to like three or four of them. </joey>
<joey> I mean, obviously, we couldn't go to all of them, </joey>
<connor> 'cause there's literally thousands of them out there. </connor>
<connor> But some of these islands were fucking insane looking. </connor>
<joey> Like completely off the- - Yeah, you showed me </joey>
<joey> some pictures. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I showed pictures. </joey>
<connor> - It's gonna be fun, you guys need to watch it. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, it was just incredible. </connor>
<joey> Like we literally did speed run Kyushu. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause like that week felt like a month. </garnt>
<joey> It was fucking insane. </joey>
<garnt> - It sounds like you did a fuck ton, </garnt>
<garnt> from how you were describing it to me. </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly the challenges that we like, </joey>
<joey> usually prepare with on Journey Across Japan, </joey>
<connor> this time around was like kind of a back-burner, </connor>
<connor> just because there's so much shit we were doing. </connor>
<connor> We were like, oh yeah, I forgot we had to do </connor>
<joey> a challenge for this video, fuck. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, hopefully the trailer will be out, </joey>
<joey> by the time this episode goes out? </joey>
<connor> - If Chris isn't lazy. </connor>
<connor> - If not, sorry, Chris, </connor>
<joey> I probably just sent a bunch of where's the trailer people, </joey>
<garnt> over to your channel. </garnt>
<garnt> - He had it coming. </garnt>
<joey> - He had it coming. </joey>
<garnt> - What I wanna know is that how many more places </garnt>
<joey> can he do Journey Across Japan? </joey>
<joey> How many more themes can he do? </joey>
<joey> Because like one thing I will say about Japan is that, </joey>
<joey> one of the things that impresses me the most, </joey>
<joey> is just how fucking varied Japan is </joey>
<joey> in terms of like how many places there are to travel, </joey>
<joey> and to explore. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, 'cause I'm used to the UK, right? </joey>
<joey> And I feel like if you've explored, </joey>
<joey> a decent amount of the UK, </joey>
<connor> then you've kind of, to me at least, </connor>
<connor> you've kind of seen it all. - There's like one town. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> If you go to one town, you go to one city, </connor>
<connor> and it's kind of all the same. </connor>
<connor> I mean, London to me, </connor>
<garnt> London kind of exists in its own bubble. </garnt>
<garnt> London's like unique, but like anywhere outside of London, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean fucking- - Shit. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> It's the same innit? </joey>
<joey> - Australia's the same thing, right? </joey>
<joey> I think geographically, it's just as large as like the US, </joey>
<joey> maybe close to it. </joey>
<joey> - It's just sand, so. </joey>
<joey> - It's like 80% of it is a fucking desert. </joey>
<connor> That's why like I barely gone exploring in Australia, </connor>
<joey> because I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> I just don't know what there is out there. </connor>
<connor> But then again, if Chris hadn't like gone and done </connor>
<connor> extensive research on places in Kyushu, </connor>
<connor> I probably would have had no fucking idea </connor>
<connor> what to do right? - I don't know how Chris </connor>
<joey> finds these fucking places? </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't know either. - He comes to me, </joey>
<joey> with this town in the Mountains of Kyoto. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? - How do you find this stuff? </joey>
<joey> - He literally just spends months </joey>
<joey> just researching interesting places. </joey>
<joey> I remember on Journey Across Japan Two, </joey>
<joey> there was this like in the middle of the mountains, </joey>
<joey> in Gifu prefecture or Toyama, </joey>
<joey> I think it was Toyama prefecture, </joey>
<joey> which usually people don't go for tourism. </joey>
<joey> He found this like in the middle of the fucking mountains, </joey>
<joey> there was this like field of like 1,000 statues of people, </joey>
<joey> that had just been built. </joey>
<joey> And you know how he found it? </joey>
<joey> He literally went on to like Google satellite, </joey>
<joey> and just like scanned through the mountains, </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. - What the fuck! </joey>
<joey> - Until he stopped and was like, what is this gray blob? </joey>
<connor> And like enhanced. </connor>
<connor> - Enhanced. </connor>
<connor> - And then saw that there were these statues. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause if you look it up, before that video went up, </garnt>
<garnt> there was no articles about it. </garnt>
<joey> Not even Japanese media talks about it. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude, this is like some next level. </garnt>
<garnt> This is like some NASA shit, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah and I was like, </joey>
<joey> I want your dedication to research. </joey>
<connor> - People do strange things with their land in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> In the UK, you just kinda ave a field, </garnt>
<garnt> and maybe you put a fence on it </garnt>
<garnt> kinda like let's call it a day but in Japan- </garnt>
<garnt> - There's only so much things you can do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, in Japan they seem to go crazy with it. </garnt>
<joey> They're like, what if we just made a field </joey>
<joey> that's just trampoline outside. </joey>
<joey> And they're like all right do it. </joey>
<joey> - If you look it up, there's probably someone out there </joey>
<joey> that has it, all right. </joey>
<garnt> - Trampoline wardo. </garnt>
<joey> - Trampoline wardo. </joey>
<joey> - That's what's so awesome about Japan, </joey>
<joey> is that you can just be driving in the middle of nowhere </joey>
<joey> and then you just see like this weird fucking place </joey>
<joey> that you don't know what mad man came up with this idea. </joey>
<garnt> Just put like a field of statues </garnt>
<joey> or something like that right? </joey>
<joey> - And it's not even like built for tourism either, </joey>
<joey> because it's not even known, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like if you're lucky enough to find it, </joey>
<joey> then there you go, there it is, enjoy it. </joey>
<connor> - I'm hoping the next Journey Across Japan </connor>
<connor> is just five star hotels </connor>
<connor> and Chris is like, come on Connor, let's go. </connor>
<connor> Let's go and review five-star hotels. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> I'm down for that. </connor>
<joey> - Journey Across Michelin Restaurants in Japan. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Not only is it a tax deductible, </connor>
<connor> it's also fantastic. </connor>
<connor> It's fun, I wanna do this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but please look forward to that whenever that, </joey>
<joey> I think he said it's coming out end of May, maybe? </joey>
<joey> So, hopefully soon. </joey>
<garnt> - So like how many more places in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> do you want to visit personally? </garnt>
<joey> - So I have this app actually on my phone, </joey>
<joey> where you can keep track of, </joey>
<garnt> it's what I use to keep track </garnt>
<garnt> of all the prefectures I've been to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Google? - It's called Google maps. </garnt>
<joey> - It's called Google maps. - Well there's that as well. </joey>
<joey> - It stalks you, right? </joey>
<connor> It knows exactly where you are? </connor>
<garnt> - So like have we told the story about the cycling, yet? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah okay, I mean so, I know because I like this, </connor>
<joey> that Google tells me exactly where I was for how long? </joey>
<joey> I like looking back where I was and like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause when people ask me, oh, where are you this day? </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh, let me check, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> oh, I know I've been- - When the police ask me </joey>
<joey> where were you this day? </joey>
<joey> - When the Japanese police officers, </joey>
<joey> are asking for my alibi, I've got one ready. </joey>
<connor> But like it tells you exactly where you were, for how long. </connor>
<joey> And when we did the cycling special, </joey>
<joey> we all had our phone tracking on, </joey>
<connor> it wasn't shown in the video, </connor>
<connor> but we actually saw where we all were throughout the video. </connor>
<joey> And when the video was done, I asked them, I was like, </joey>
<joey> hey guys, can you export your map data, </joey>
<connor> so that we can send it to our editor, </connor>
<connor> so that he can know where we, where we were. </connor>
<garnt> - So that's how you see all the cool map graphics </garnt>
<garnt> that Meilyne made. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not 100% accurate, but it's pretty close. </connor>
<garnt> - It's pretty close, yeah. - It's pretty close. </garnt>
<connor> - So where we are generally on that map is actually, </connor>
<garnt> where we were. - So we turn on </garnt>
<garnt> location services, which I didn't know, </garnt>
<joey> that you could track each other </joey>
<joey> in like in real time. - In real time, yeah. </joey>
<connor> So it wasn't a part of like the big, </connor>
<connor> we didn't make it a big part of the special, </connor>
<joey> but we could actually see where we were, </joey>
<connor> as we were cycling down. </connor>
<connor> I could see that Joey was fucking kicking my ass, </connor>
<connor> and Connor turned off his location sharing, </connor>
<joey> when he was taking the ferry. </joey>
<garnt> So he just like popped out of existence </garnt>
<joey> and then popped in existence again. </joey>
<connor> - I literally thought he was like lost out to sea. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I just said </connor>
<connor> it was broken- - I was like, he's dead. </connor>
<connor> He's dead, he's just straight up dead. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So there was no signal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - When I asked these guys to share it, </joey>
<joey> they were like, wait. </joey>
<joey> Garnt was like, "Wait, what? </joey>
<joey> They keep all this information on you?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, yeah, it's awesome right? </joey>
<garnt> - It's terrifying. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah so I didn't realize that </garnt>
<garnt> by turning on location services, </garnt>
<garnt> I could go through my entire history day by day. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you've turned on location services, </garnt>
<garnt> you can probably do that right now. </garnt>
<garnt> If you go to Google maps, </garnt>
<connor> and you can go through the history of your location services </connor>
<connor> and it will tell you the exact location you've been, </connor>
<connor> hour by hour, every single day, </connor>
<connor> for like the past 10 years of your life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's really good. </connor>
<connor> - It's scary. </connor>
<connor> - That's terrifying. </connor>
<joey> - Google's literally stalking you at all times. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know what's sad, </joey>
<joey> is like when I used to live in London, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I barely ever left my house, </joey>
<joey> It would be like, what do I do this day? </joey>
<joey> It's like a dot on the map of me not leaving my house. </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, oh, what did I do this day? </joey>
<joey> Oh okay, maybe the next. </joey>
<joey> Okay, well, maybe the next, oh okay. </joey>
<joey> Four days in a row I didn't leave the house. </joey>
<joey> All right, cool. </joey>
<joey> And then I would just be America. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know, this is like some fucking FBI shit, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, 'cause sometimes I go to a place </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, oh fuck where was that? </connor>
<connor> And I can just go on Google and find out where I was. </connor>
<joey> - I mean it's cool like to look back on it, right? </joey>
<garnt> - No, it is cool. - If you're the only one </garnt>
<garnt> looking at it. </garnt>
<joey> - Who wants to look? </joey>
<joey> - It's like two sides, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's cool to know that you could go </joey>
<joey> through your entire life history, </joey>
<joey> but it's also kind of like, I guess scary, </joey>
<joey> not scary, but like disturbing that your entire life </joey>
<joey> can be compressed down into a file, </joey>
<joey> and just like analyzed, right? </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty cool. - And exported, right? </joey>
<joey> - And exported, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> That's just like this the future </connor>
<joey> that "Black Mirror" warned us about, </joey>
<joey> - That is some (indistinct). </joey>
<garnt> - I for one, welcome our "Black Mirror" overlords. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> I welcome technology. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I like it. It's fun. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's interactive. </joey>
<joey> - Interactive. - What you mean interactive? </joey>
<joey> - It's not stalking, it's interactive. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - No, I can see the cool side of it. </joey>
<garnt> It's just a bit like- </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, why did this come up again? (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - Oh, because you were asking how many prefectures- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, so is there any place </garnt>
<garnt> that you would love to visit? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have an app, that shows me </garnt>
<garnt> all the prefectures I've been to, </garnt>
<connor> and I can kind of give points as well being like, </connor>
<connor> so it's like, I visited there, I walked there, </connor>
<connor> I stayed there overnight, I lived there, et cetera, </connor>
<connor> and it like adds on the points. </connor>
<connor> - I lived here, I did it, </connor>
<connor> I ate it. - I did it. </connor>
<connor> So I know exactly now which prefectures </connor>
<joey> I haven't been to yet. </joey>
<joey> And I think, I mean, I can bring it up, </joey>
<joey> but I think maybe I've done, </joey>
<connor> I wanna say like 3 1/5 maybe 3 1/4 of all the prefectures, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, these are the ones I've done. </connor>
<connor> - Red ones you've been to? </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit. - So the red ones </connor>
<connor> I've stayed overnight. </connor>
<connor> I'll send this image to you, Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> But the red ones I've stayed overnight. </connor>
<connor> The green ones I've like just stopped over. </connor>
<joey> The yellow ones I've passed through. </joey>
<joey> The blue ones I've like walked around. </joey>
<joey> And the white ones I haven't visited yet. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - There's a decent amount that I still haven't gone to, </joey>
<joey> but this is good, right? </joey>
<joey> Because now I can use that app basically to be like, </joey>
<joey> all right, well, you know, </joey>
<connor> I wanna take the weekend off somewhere. </connor>
<connor> I can plan my next vacation and be like, </connor>
<connor> well, I've never been to this prefecture, </connor>
<joey> so let's go check that out, kind of thing. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wish I wasn't so fucking stupid, man. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - I just don't like... </connor>
<connor> I like don't really care where I am, unless there's like, </connor>
<joey> I don't know, something fun to do there. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh- - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I wouldn't go to a fucking prefecture, </garnt>
<joey> if I didn't have anything to do there, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not the type of guy who's just like, </garnt>
<connor> okay, I haven't been to this map here, </connor>
<connor> I haven't been to this part of the map. </connor>
<garnt> I need to know that there's something cool to do there. </garnt>
<joey> - See, this is my JRPG, </joey>
<connor> like 100% completion-ist side, coming out. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm like I gotta finish all 47 prefectures, </garnt>
<joey> just to complete it. </joey>
<joey> - For me it's like a catch-22, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I wanna go to new places, </joey>
<joey> I wanna find new cool places, </joey>
<joey> but I also don't have the energy that Chris does </joey>
<joey> to just fucking scout out places </joey>
<joey> that look cool. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Not only scour, but like schedule it </joey>
<connor> day by day meticulously. - Yeah, yeah. Right? </connor>
<joey> - That's why I like going with someone who plans stuff. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, you plan it. </joey>
<joey> I'll come along. </joey>
<joey> I'll crack a few jokes, here and there. </joey>
<joey> - That's why I love Journey Across Japan, right? </joey>
<connor> It's a fucking vacation for me, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, so I have to be on camera </connor>
<joey> and talk for a few hours a day? </joey>
<connor> Cool. - That is definitely </connor>
<joey> the benefit of hanging out with Chris. </joey>
<joey> It's like he just takes care of everything. </joey>
<joey> He's like, I know where we're going, </joey>
<joey> I know a place, let's do it. </joey>
<joey> - He's the definition of I know a place. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - One time I did that for Chris, </joey>
<joey> I was like, let me take you to a place, right? </joey>
<joey> We're in Kyoto, right? </joey>
<connor> And I was like, no, no, I know a great coffee place. </connor>
<connor> Literally outside where we were staying, </connor>
<connor> there is a Blue Bottle Coffee, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like the least Kyoto thing ever. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Look at like an American chain, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, no, no it's good, it's good, </connor>
<joey> it's good. - It's good, it's good. </joey>
<joey> - To be fair, it's pretty fucking good. </joey>
<garnt> - It is the best coffee- - I know a place. </garnt>
<connor> It's called Starbucks. - Japanese coffee- </connor>
<joey> Yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Starbucksu. </connor>
<garnt> - I can do good coffee there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do we have a clip named Japan's coffee </garnt>
<garnt> is bottom tier, because- </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably not. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, we do now. - Yeah, we do now. </garnt>
<connor> - Japan's coffee is the fucking worst. </connor>
<joey> It's fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - It's awful. </joey>
<joey> - Japan truly is a tea society. </joey>
<connor> - Tea society. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We live in a tea society. </connor>
<connor> - We live in a tea society. </connor>
<connor> - It's awful, man. </connor>
<connor> It's like dirt. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't know that I cared about coffee, </connor>
<connor> until I moved to Japan. </connor>
<connor> And I've realized that the coffee here was shit. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I thought living in England, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, whatever I would fucking... </connor>
<joey> I thought like my coffee tolerance was, </joey>
<joey> I'll fucking take instant coffee if I need to. </joey>
<joey> - But like when I moved to Japan, </joey>
<joey> I've realized what shit coffee tastes like. </joey>
<joey> - But then I got a job. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And now I know. </joey>
<joey> No, because remember the fucking like, </joey>
<joey> just the brainwashing that happens, </joey>
<connor> the first time you come to Japan, you're like, </connor>
<joey> I can buy a hot coffee at a vending machine? </joey>
<joey> Oh my God, I'm gonna buy this </joey>
<joey> every fucking day. - Yeah. Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> - And then you realize it's just all sugar. </joey>
<joey> - And then you realize it's all crap. </joey>
<joey> And your like, oh Starbucks has never been </joey>
<garnt> so fucking attractive to me. </garnt>
<joey> - So yeah, so yeah, as you know. </joey>
<joey> As you know Japan has like a fuck ton of vending machines, </joey>
<joey> like everywhere. </joey>
<joey> And I remember whenever I used to go on holiday in Japan, </joey>
<joey> I'd always get the coffee, vending machine coffee </joey>
<joey> every single day without fail, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, I will never get bored of this, at all. </joey>
<joey> This is fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> I don't need to go to a fucking Starbucks, </joey>
<joey> or a coffee shop to get my coffee. </joey>
<joey> I can just go to a vending machine. </joey>
<joey> And then I moved here, </joey>
<joey> and then I don't know what it is about moving here, </joey>
<joey> like something switched in my brain, right? </joey>
<joey> And then I just instantly recognized it as like, </joey>
<garnt> oh this tastes like crap. </garnt>
<garnt> This is processed instant coffee shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know why, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what switched my brain. </garnt>
<garnt> Like why is it that when I was here as a tourist, </garnt>
<garnt> vending machine coffee and vending machine drinks, </garnt>
<garnt> were just like fucking five-star? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause we don't have it in the UK, </garnt>
<joey> so you're like, you do like amazed by it- </joey>
<joey> - It's just like a new, weird thing, right? </joey>
<connor> Like Connor, I remember, was talking about </connor>
<connor> how every time he came here to visit, </connor>
<connor> you would fucking eat FamilyMart or Nigiri every day, right? </connor>
<joey> And then you realized, </joey>
<joey> oh, this is not that great actually. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I've actually gone back on it now. </connor>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> You say that like a drunk. </joey>
<joey> - I've come like full circle. </joey>
<joey> - I've relapsed. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I was very diehard sandwiches for like a year and a half. </connor>
<joey> And now I'm like, man, I just crave rice now. </joey>
<connor> What the fuck's going on? </connor>
<connor> - I mean the onigiris are fucking great dude. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they are. - Onigiris are great. </joey>
<garnt> I've never been off them. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - (laughs) Never been off. </connor>
<connor> - I realize I just sound like a druggie right there. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Depending on- </connor>
<connor> - Onigiri would sober you Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - How many onigiris is too much? </connor>
<connor> - Going back to the coffee, right? </connor>
<connor> For me, coffee is as much of like a smell thing, </connor>
<garnt> as it is a drink thing. </garnt>
<joey> The reason why I like going into a coffee shop, </joey>
<joey> is 'cause I need that wall of coffee smell to hit me. </joey>
<connor> That's what makes me feel like </connor>
<connor> I'm ready to fucking drink caffeine. </connor>
<garnt> - I'd say coffee is a fucking morning thing for me, </garnt>
<connor> right now because- </connor>
<connor> - Not a morning thing, a fucking morning thing. </connor>
<connor> - It is a fucking morning. - Fucking morning. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like honestly is your morning really started, </connor>
<connor> if you don't have a coffee? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause to me, if I don't have a coffee, </connor>
<connor> that's like my indicator that my morning has begun. </connor>
<joey> I can begin the day. </joey>
<joey> If I don't have the coffee, </joey>
<joey> then I'm just like in permanent, like 50% brain mode. </joey>
<joey> - No coffee I sleep, coffee I wake. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly! </joey>
<joey> That's literally how I am. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know if it's a placebo thing. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I'm totally the same. </joey>
<joey> I remember there was one week where I was like, </joey>
<joey> I might be a little too dependent on coffee. </joey>
<joey> Let me back it up a bit, </joey>
<joey> because I was having like, two, three cups of coffee a day. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Well I have like </joey>
<joey> four or five. - Yeah, right? </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, that's probably not that good for me. </connor>
<connor> My heart's probably about to explode. </connor>
<joey> So let me like just go a week, </joey>
<joey> with no coffee and see how I do. </joey>
<joey> Dude, day two, I was like. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was getting just insane migraines in my head. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh, I'm really fucking dependent on this shit </joey>
<joey> to start the day. </joey>
<joey> - I just get sluggish if I stop. </joey>
<joey> I don't really get too bad. </joey>
<garnt> - You don't get like coffee headaches? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I've never gotten that. </garnt>
<garnt> I've had friends who got it. </garnt>
<garnt> - How it feels for me is that you know that scene </garnt>
<garnt> in the film where it's like </garnt>
<connor> they got the gray scale filter on it, </connor>
<connor> that's how I see the world before I have my coffee, man. </connor>
<joey> And then like I have the coffee, </joey>
<joey> and then they instantly turn up the saturation. </joey>
<garnt> That is how my mornings work. </garnt>
<joey> - I go from gray-scale to sepia. </joey>
<connor> - You are the fucking meme of, </connor>
<connor> don't talk to me until I've had my coffee. </connor>
<garnt> Like you're literally that guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, 'cause I remember when I first moved to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> and my mornings were just like so depressing. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I didn't have that first good, hot coffee </joey>
<joey> to look forward to, right? </joey>
<joey> Because even if I'd go to my FamilyMart to get a coffee, </joey>
<joey> it was like really watered down coffee. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I've noticed the more I like grow up, </connor>
<joey> it's the little things in life </joey>
<joey> that you need to look forward to. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. - It's the little things. </joey>
<joey> - It is the little things. </joey>
<joey> Like my mornings are 20% less happy </joey>
<garnt> if I don't have a coffee to look forward to. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I just feel like my day is depressing. </connor>
<garnt> That's kind of about it really. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. Exactly. - But that's most days, </garnt>
<connor> so it doesn't really (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> One time I went to an Italian restaurant here, </connor>
<joey> and you know, I feel like an Italian restaurant, </joey>
<joey> I feel like you can almost judge it </joey>
<joey> on how good their espresso is with the meal. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - It must end on an espresso. </connor>
<connor> I feel at least like, you know? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely. - And you know, </joey>
<connor> it was pretty good food and I was like, not bad. </connor>
<joey> - Have you found one that has a good espresso </joey>
<connor> 'cause I've yet to find one yet? </connor>
<connor> - There's one or two that if I see </connor>
<connor> the actual espresso machine in the back, I'm like, nice. </connor>
<connor> You know it's gonna be good. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause they've gone to the effort, </joey>
<joey> to get this ridiculous expensive machine, </joey>
<joey> just for this like one part of the meal. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - But I was eating there and the food was pretty good. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't disappointed and I thought, well fantastic. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna end my meal off with an espresso, </joey>
<connor> and it said on the menu, it said espresso. </connor>
<connor> And it was a double or a single. </connor>
<connor> And so I ordered the double espresso, </connor>
<connor> and they just brought out essentially an Americana. </connor>
<connor> - What? - And I said, like, </connor>
<connor> oh no, no, I ordered the espresso. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Oh no, no, that's the espresso." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what? </connor>
<joey> It's like this tall. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, that's not an espresso, </joey>
<joey> and if it is, I'm gonna be having a heart attack. </joey>
<connor> - It's like a triple, double espresso. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> Am I the asshole here? </connor>
<connor> Are you gonna make me pay for this? </connor>
<connor> I'm not paying for this. </connor>
<joey> I paid for it, but you know. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I didn't walk out. </joey>
<joey> - And naturally I didn't complain, </joey>
<joey> and I paid for it, but that's not the point. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I was very disappointed- </joey>
<joey> - Was it at least a good Americana? </joey>
<joey> - No, it was awful. </joey>
<joey> - No, fuck. - That day onwards, </joey>
<joey> I swore against ordering coffee in places </joey>
<connor> where I couldn't visibly see an espresso machine </connor>
<garnt> in their establishment. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like take me to the back, take me to the back. </garnt>
<connor> Let's see what's going on, come on. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause I'd say the best purchase I've made in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> by none is the Nespresso machine. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna get that soon. </garnt>
<connor> - I would trade my first born son for a Nespresso machine, </connor>
<joey> honestly, straight up. </joey>
<joey> Like that thing, I hug that thing every day, </joey>
<connor> I give it a morning kiss. </connor>
<connor> I could go homeless and the one thing I'd keep with me, </connor>
<connor> is the Nespresso machine. </connor>
<connor> I'd be going around on the street </connor>
<connor> holding the Nespresso machine, plugging it into outlets </connor>
<connor> when I can just to get a coffee. </connor>

<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, speaking of coffee machines, </joey>
<joey> I found this fucking. </joey>
<joey> So like, Aki is quite obsessed with TikTok, </joey>
<joey> as most people are these days. </joey>
<joey> And I don't have like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't have TikTok installed on my phone, right? </joey>
<joey> My only exposure to TikTok is watching with Aki. </joey>
<connor> And there's this fucking thing where, </connor>
<connor> you know those like TikTok stories like, </connor>
<connor> Amazon gadgets that changed my life, part 71. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know those, right? </connor>
<joey> They all sound the fucking same. </joey>
<joey> There was one where it was literally </joey>
<joey> this alarm clock, all right? </joey>
<joey> 400 bucks. </joey>
<joey> It was this alarm clock that makes you a cup of coffee. </joey>
<connor> - Oh we had that. - When it went off. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we had that in the '80s in the UK for tea. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah, it was called </joey>
<joey> a Kettle Mate. </joey>
<joey> And you could set the alarm, </joey>
<joey> and it would pour a cup of tea for you </joey>
<joey> when the alarm went off. </joey>
<connor> This is not a new invention TikTok, </connor>
<connor> fuck you. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> So there's like a fucking, </joey>
<joey> it looks like, maybe it's about that big. </joey>
<connor> - That's pretty massive! </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty fucking large, </connor>
<connor> but there's like the cup, the coffee mug there, </connor>
<joey> and then there's like a proper brewing thing on the side. </joey>
<joey> And you put in this like canister of milk in the morning, </joey>
<joey> and then like lock it in. </joey>
<joey> And when the alarm goes off, </joey>
<joey> it just straight up just makes you a fucking like- </joey>
<connor> - The Nespresso machine is literally one button. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> You could literally have that next to your bed. </joey>
<joey> You don't need like- - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> That's what I was thinking. </connor>
<connor> I was like, just get a fucking Nespresso machine, </connor>
<joey> and just put the fucking thing in and, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Nespresso, please just sponsor us already, please. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause the problem is I feel like Nespresso </garnt>
<garnt> is one of the best capsule machines, </garnt>
<connor> but I feel like in Japan, </connor>
<garnt> it's the only capsule machine that is actually good. </garnt>
<connor> - Because like you could get like the actual, you know, </connor>
<joey> the ones that actually have to put, </joey>
<joey> the coffee grinded beans. - The beans. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah. - But like I had one of those. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] I had one of those as well. </connor>
<connor> - Cleaning it is such a pain in the ass. </connor>
<connor> Like Nespresso is like the perfect brand. </connor>
<connor> I'm literally just fucking marketing for you right now. </connor>
<connor> It is literally the easiest and like easiest to clean. </connor>
<joey> It's just easy. - Fully sponsored. </joey>
<joey> - For the quality you get and for the convenience, </joey>
<garnt> it is the best capsule machine- </garnt>
<connor> - Please sponsor us. - That I have owned. </connor>
<connor> And I have owned a lot of capsule machines. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We bought one just for this office. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we were like we want- </connor>
<connor> - It was literally the first purchase that we made. </connor>
<connor> And we tried to get GeeXPlus to pay for it for us, </connor>
<joey> but they wouldn't allow it, so we paid for it. </joey>
<garnt> - Before we bought this table, </garnt>
<joey> we bought the Nespresso machine. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - We had our priorities right, that's for sure. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. - Yeah, I remember </joey>
<joey> when they gave us the spreadsheet of just like, okay, </joey>
<joey> so they get it's like GeexPlus gave us a spreadsheet </joey>
<joey> 'cause they said they would help us, </joey>
<joey> not decorate the office, but furbish the office. </joey>
<joey> And we were like, okay, tables, desk, television, </joey>
<garnt> not microphones. - Nespresso? </garnt>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Machines. </joey>
<joey> - No, no but it was split up in like </joey>
<joey> here's the list of the things we need </joey>
<joey> and here's the list of the things we want. </joey>
<joey> And we put Nespresso machine in the first thing on need. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> We're like no, no you don't understand Geex, </joey>
<joey> we need this. </joey>
<joey> It's not a want. </joey>
<joey> - And Meilyne was like, "Do you really need this? </joey>
<connor> Is this as necessary as the table?" </connor>
<connor> And we're like, yes, without coffee, </connor>
<connor> this podcast is not happening. </connor>
<connor> No, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna film. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I refuse to release episodes. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like another thing about Japanese </joey>
<joey> is like coffee shops as well, is that there are so many </joey>
<joey> independent coffee shops here in Japan. </joey>
<joey> So if you're ever coming to Japan, </joey>
<joey> you can walk down a random street and find like five to 10 </joey>
<joey> different indie coffee shops. </joey>
<joey> And the problem is they all look fucking great. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, they do. </joey>
<joey> - But it's such a coin flip, </joey>
<joey> on whether it's going to be good coffee or not. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like the fallacy is that </joey>
<garnt> some of the best and poshest looking coffee shops </garnt>
<garnt> I've been to in Japan, have had just the shittest coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like acid. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - It's like dirt water. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember like, </joey>
<joey> especially in like Central Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> like (indistinct) and like Kichijoji and stuff like that, </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of really like fancy, </joey>
<garnt> kind of like rustic looking coffee shops, </garnt>
<garnt> where there's like the beans are all lined up and- </garnt>
<garnt> - They've got the aesthetic down. </garnt>
<garnt> - They've got the aesthetic to a T. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - And then you order in, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like waiting for this cup of coffee </garnt>
<joey> for like 20 minutes. </joey>
<joey> And you're like what are they picking, </joey>
<joey> the fucking coffee beans off the plant? </joey>
<joey> It's taking so long. </joey>
<joey> And what comes out is like shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Essentially. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like dirt water, sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - It's like $12 please. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah and it's fucking $12 for like this one, </garnt>
<joey> I thought you like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause especially going to America or something, </joey>
<joey> you order like a cup of coffee, </joey>
<joey> and you just assume that it's refillable, right? </joey>
<joey> It's that kind of level of quality. </joey>
<joey> But in Japan you can have like the fucking instant coffee, </joey>
<joey> dirt water and they give it to you </joey>
<connor> in this like the poshest little cup, </connor>
<garnt> and it's fucking tiny, it's $12. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're just there being like, I'm even more depressed </garnt>
<connor> than I was before I ordered this coffee. </connor>
<connor> - That's why it's sad, right? </connor>
<joey> It's sad that like Blue Bottle Coffee and Starbucks, </joey>
<joey> are like the best coffee in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - It is. - It really is. </joey>
<connor> - It's like going to any foreign country, </connor>
<connor> but like, you know, McDonald's is the finest cuisine here, </connor>
<connor> it's literally the best. </connor>
<connor> Like don't eat anything else. </connor>
<connor> Like it's so sad having to be like, </connor>
<connor> the foreigners did it better than you, </connor>
<connor> and they're fucking chains. </connor>
<garnt> - Just like, oh, you want some good fried chicken? </garnt>
<connor> Well, I know a place. </connor>
<joey> It begins with a K. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's got my favorite Colonel in front of it. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It feel like you're admitting defeat, </joey>
<connor> where like the big corporations are the best at something. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Well, right. </joey>
<connor> But like that's what I mean, </connor>
<connor> when I say we truly do live in a tea society, </connor>
<connor> because like they'll do green tea. </connor>
<joey> - Tea here's amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Tea is fucking great. - The tea here </joey>
<joey> is fucking great. </joey>
<joey> The green tea is obviously, </joey>
<joey> but like the other types of tea here, fucking fantastic. </joey>
<joey> But it just take you a little bit longer </joey>
<joey> to perfect the coffee, I feel. </joey>
<connor> - Although, I will say there's some teas here </connor>
<connor> where they're like, yeah, it's just like cherry flavor </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I do not taste any tea in this. </connor>
<connor> This is just cherry. </connor>
<connor> They're like sweet teas where I can't taste the tea. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what's the point in this? </connor>
<joey> I'm just not a tea drinker, so. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I love tea. </joey>
<garnt> - I only drink tea when I have afternoon tea. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> I don't drink tea. </joey>
<joey> I guess Japanese tea is different, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when I think of tea, I think of hot tea. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I think of like an Earl Gray, </garnt>
<connor> or like a English breakfast, </connor>
<connor> and like that kind of stuff. </connor>
<connor> But like, yeah, I don't count green tea </connor>
<joey> like an afternoon tea, tea. </joey>
<connor> - I think afternoon tea </connor>
<connor> is probably the only good British export that we've done. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a British export that I'm proud of. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Is there really nothing else? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm like racking my brain. </joey>
<connor> I'm like there has to be something else, </connor>
<connor> right? - Well, what else is there? </connor>
<joey> - Stealing? I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Like we stole a lot of stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Pillaging. - Tuesday? </connor>
<connor> - Tuesday. (laughs) - Tuesday. </connor>
<garnt> - Tuesday, YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> - A part of me dies inside </connor>
<garnt> whenever I go to like a restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> that does like foreign, like European cuisine, </garnt>
<garnt> and I see fucking fish and chips there. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, why are you selling fish and chips? </garnt>
<joey> - The best fish and chips though I ever had, </joey>
<joey> was this British pub, </joey>
<connor> British Irish pub called Hobgoblin in Shibuya. </connor>
<connor> - You mean ever? </connor>
<connor> It's the best fish and chips- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, in Japan, in Japan, in Japan, obviously. </connor>
<connor> - No, yeah. - In Japan. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause every other fish and chips I've had is like, </connor>
<connor> they vinegar the fuck out of the fish, </connor>
<connor> where it's just like I'm not eating fish, </connor>
<connor> I'm eating solid vinegar- - No, they should let you </connor>
<connor> put the vinegar on yourself. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah but, right. </connor>
<connor> But there's places where they just like do it for you, </connor>
<connor> - That's fucked up, that's not right. </connor>
<connor> - So like the is like inside the fucking meat of the fish. </connor>
<joey> And I'm just like, this does not taste like fish, </joey>
<joey> It tastes like vinegar. </joey>
<connor> As much as I love vinegar, don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> - What's the maximum you'd pay for fish and chips? </connor>
<connor> - Abroad or in England? </connor>
<joey> - Let's just full stop. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, how big are we talking? </joey>
<joey> - Like a normal portion, </joey>
<connor> - Like a normal port, like that? </connor>
<connor> - That's why I was like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when I went to this place- - Like 15, no. </connor>
<connor> - The most? - That's what I mean, right? </connor>
<connor> They charge me $22. </connor>
<connor> I'm still angry about this, by the way. </connor>
<garnt> - $22 for a fish and chips. </garnt>
<connor> - $22 and it was mid chip, honestly. </connor>
<joey> It was not very good. - Wait, was that </joey>
<joey> at the Welsh place? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was at the Welsh town. </joey>
<joey> - Oh Yikes! - I'm sorry, </joey>
<garnt> I feel like I'm like completely ruining their like </garnt>
<garnt> any foreign tourism they get now, </garnt>
<connor> but that fish and chips was abhorrent. </connor>
<garnt> And they increased the price. </garnt>
<garnt> - Welsh town reviewed by a Welsh man. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm still annoyed about it, $22. </connor>
<connor> - 22 bucks is pretty ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> - My mom, she'd probably slap me </connor>
<connor> if she saw that I've handed money for that. </connor>
<connor> It was like a five pound fish and chips as well. </connor>
<garnt> It was not my chip- </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it like a frozen Iceland fish and chips, then? </garnt>
<connor> - It wasn't good. </connor>
<connor> It was like more batter than fish. </connor>
<garnt> - That's what I've noticed </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I've tried fish and chips </garnt>
<joey> that have not been from England. </joey>
<joey> Even in England, not every fish and chips you get </joey>
<joey> is fucking good, anyways. - A lot of them are shit. </joey>
<connor> A lot of them are really shit. </connor>
<joey> - I'd say 80% of fish and chips you get in England </joey>
<connor> is shit anyway. </connor>
<connor> So why would I trust it outside of England? </connor>
<connor> - That's why you gotta go to a nice pub, </connor>
<connor> a nice fancy kind of pub </connor>
<garnt> that just like focuses on food a lot, </garnt>
<garnt> and they'll have fish and chips on the menu. </garnt>
<garnt> It'll probably be fucking banging. </garnt>
<connor> They might have like triple deep fried fries, as well. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I wanna take you guys to the Hobgoblin, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it's like a proper barramundi fish and chips. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean the best fish and chips I've had, is in Brighton </garnt>
<joey> And it's like- </joey>
<garnt> - Is that the one you took us to? </garnt>
<connor> - Bankers? </connor>
<connor> - I believe so. - I can't remember. </connor>
<connor> Probably. </connor>
<garnt> - Probably, yeah. - Did you say you live </garnt>
<garnt> next to a fucking ocean. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's 'cause we live </garnt>
<connor> next to the fucking sea, right? </connor>
<garnt> So that's like, it's good fish and chips, </garnt>
<garnt> because the fish is just fresh, </garnt>
<garnt> and you can taste that it's fresh and it's like- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the one you took us to in Brighton </joey>
<joey> was easily the best fish and chips I've ever had, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But like even so like there's something, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel weird whenever like, </garnt>
<garnt> you go to Japan and people like, </garnt>
<garnt> yo, you can try the ramen, </garnt>
<connor> you can try the sushi, </connor>
<connor> you can try all these different cuisines. </connor>
<connor> And someone visits me in fucking England, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, yo you wanna get some fish and chips? </connor>
<connor> Go to a local chippy, go to a pub, and I'm just like. </connor>
<connor> - That's where you're going wrong. </connor>
<connor> You immediately have to get them drunk, </connor>
<joey> so that they can't like, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> so they don't focus on the food- </joey>
<joey> - They can't judge correctly. - Yeah that's what I do. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, let's go to the pub right away, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> We're four beers in, you won't care what we're eating. </connor>
<garnt> - But like the problem is when they stay, </garnt>
<joey> they're staying for like a week, right? </joey>
<joey> Like how many days in a row can they drink alcohol </joey>
<joey> before they've realized it. - Tesco meal deal. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna blow your mind with a Tesco meal deal. </joey>
<joey> - Before they realize that there's just not much </joey>
<garnt> to our culture that we can show off to like tourists </garnt>
<garnt> that visit us. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I think. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's the same problem in Australia as well. </joey>
<joey> Like, after you have a kangaroo steak, </joey>
<joey> there's literally nothing else. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we have fish and chips as well, but like not as good. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause I think the one thing I've realized, </garnt>
<garnt> after moving to Japan or after moving outside of England, </garnt>
<garnt> and living in places like Thailand and Japan, </garnt>
<connor> and stuff like that is that, </connor>
<garnt> to me in England there's not much to do </garnt>
<garnt> apart from drink, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If you don't drink- </garnt>
<connor> - Is that what happens when you live in a place, </connor>
<connor> or is that what happens when you like leave it, </connor>
<connor> and are aware? </connor>
<connor> Like I wonder, cause like do you know </connor>
<connor> what there's much to do in, </connor>
<connor> is there much to do in Australia that you know of? </connor>
<joey> - Other than going to the pub and going to the beach, </joey>
<garnt> not really. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's depressing, innit? </garnt>
<garnt> - At least we have really nice fucking beaches, </garnt>
<garnt> from where I'm from. </garnt>
<joey> - At least you got that, we don't even have nice beaches. </joey>
<connor> Like I am from- </connor>
<garnt> - My beach is very nice. </garnt>
<connor> There's plenty of free needles and trash and everything. </connor>
<connor> - I tell people I grew up in a beach town, a beach city. </connor>
<connor> It's Brighton. - Brighton's shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we have pebble, </connor>
<connor> like Brighton is the tourist beach in England, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's like the worst beach I've ever been to. </connor>
<connor> - It's just rocks. </connor>
<connor> - And I say that as someone who grew up in Brighton. </connor>
<connor> I'm born and bred in Brighton, </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, it's just a bunch of fucking rocks. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't even go there barefooted, right? </garnt>
<connor> - And to make matters worse, </connor>
<connor> Brighton is just as expensive as London. </connor>
<connor> So like what's the point of like (indistinct)? </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't always like that. </garnt>
<connor> - You're like they gentrified my area! </connor>
<garnt> - I remember a time when Brighton was cheap. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, the way you can tell, </connor>
<connor> and this is like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is scientifically proven, </connor>
<connor> but as far as I'm concerned it is, </connor>
<joey> you can tell the costs of a town in the UK, </joey>
<joey> 100% just go to the pub, see how much the beer is? </joey>
<connor> If you see, yeah, </connor>
<connor> go to any pub, - One pint. </connor>
<connor> One pint. </connor>
<garnt> - How much is like the middle of the like price, like pint? </garnt>
<garnt> How much is it? - Right, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause in Brighton, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like what, like four pound fifty, maybe five pounds? </garnt>
<garnt> - Four pound, five pound. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like London prices. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's on the expensive end. </garnt>
<connor> Where I'm from, it's like two pound 20. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - I talk to people though, that are from the north, </joey>
<joey> or from Wales or something, </joey>
<connor> and they tell me about these </connor>
<connor> magical (indistinct). - Magical prices? </connor>
<connor> - These magical two- - Mythical prices. </connor>
<joey> - These magical two-pound prices. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds like two pound 80. </joey>
<joey> - These magical two pound pints, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, what land are you from, sir? </joey>
<joey> - Are you sure that's beer that you're drinking there. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry, I didn't know- </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Also. </joey>
<connor> I'm sorry, I didn't know you grew up in fucking Narnia. </connor>
<connor> What is this magical land that does not exist in England? </connor>
<connor> - Bullshit, it doesn't exist, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> And then like also to Americans as well, </connor>
<joey> a pint is, not an American pint, </joey>
<joey> it's different to American pint, which is also, </joey>
<joey> American pint is the biggest scam ever, by the way. </joey>
<joey> You guys got ripped off. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why when Americans took the pint from us, </joey>
<connor> for some reason they made it smaller. </connor>
<joey> - We talked about this on the stream, </joey>
<connor> didn't we? - Did we? Oh okay. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm pretty sure we did. </joey>
<joey> It's like a hundred milliliters less. </joey>
<garnt> You're losing a lot of beer there for no point. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the one time when Americans took something </connor>
<connor> and made it smaller. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's like 430 milliliters, I think around that America, </connor>
<connor> and British pint is 568 milliliters. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And yeah, you get a lot of beer for like really cheap. </connor>
<connor> It's like the pint where I grew up, it's like $4. </connor>
<joey> - Fuck. </joey>
<joey> The pint where I grew up was $9. </joey>
<connor> - That's US? - Australian. </connor>
<connor> - Wait's that in like real money? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - In real money? </connor>
<joey> It's nine dollar-ee-dos, so what's that in USD? </joey>
<connor> It's like $7 in US? - That's not too bad. </connor>
<connor> That's about London prices then? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's probably about London prices, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like growing up in the south in England, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I travel, like further north, </garnt>
<garnt> and I see the prices, it's just like I feel great </garnt>
<garnt> because no matter where I go in England, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm paying either the same amount, or less than I'm used to. </garnt>
<connor> - This is why probably Swiss people </connor>
<connor> feel like the most superior people on earth, </connor>
<joey> 'cause everywhere they go it's just like on sale. </joey>
<joey> Like everything is cheap. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's why Australians love coming to Japan. </joey>
<joey> They feel so rich. </joey>
<connor> - What do you mean it's only $1 for water. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> Well, I mean, like remember, </joey>
<joey> I found that fucking Izakaya Shibuya, </joey>
<joey> where on I think Tuesdays it's not even a happy hour, </joey>
<joey> but like all night it's 50 yen beers. </joey>
<connor> - You put it like when you go to places like that, </connor>
<connor> the beer sometimes doesn't taste right. </connor>
<joey> - Really? - I don't know if it's like </joey>
<joey> the psychological effect of me thinking </joey>
<joey> this is too good to be true. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. - But I find when the beer </joey>
<joey> is mega cheap at these places in Japan, </joey>
<connor> it tastes like water. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but after 10 of them, you don't care. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, like for me, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember going back to when we came here as a tourist, </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, I'm gonna go to these fucking cheap izakayas </connor>
<connor> every fucking day. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna take advantage of this- </connor>
<connor> - All you can drink? </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. - Like Nomihoudai. </connor>
<garnt> Like all you can drink fucking every weekend. </garnt>
<garnt> Izakaya, let's go guys. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I'm just like, ah. </garnt>
<joey> - And then corona was like, "No, no, no." </joey>
<joey> - But also I just don't wanna be in pain every week. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - But now like, now that you're living here, </garnt>
<joey> you just feel like there's so many other cool bars, </joey>
<connor> and other cool places you can go to </connor>
<connor> that izakaya just feels like- </connor>
<connor> - I also rarely drink to get drunk anymore, right? </connor>
<joey> I feel like that's like, </joey>
<joey> I normally get to the tipsy point and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> all right, I'm done. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It's also like- - I wanna be able </joey>
<joey> to function the next day. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, I'm okay now. </joey>
<garnt> - We're too busy. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, basically. </connor>
<connor> - No, 'cause now I see Nomihoudai, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, ah, </connor>
<garnt> well I could drink as much as I want, </garnt>
<garnt> but do I need to anymore? </garnt>
<connor> - And then there's always the thing of like, </connor>
<connor> all right, I've been drinking beer all night. </connor>
<connor> Do I really wanna swap to like spirits, </connor>
<joey> and am I really, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I don't wanna chug beer either. </connor>
<connor> I wanna like, like myself. </connor>
<connor> - I remember the first time I went to an izakaya, </connor>
<joey> and they were like would you like just Tampin, </joey>
<joey> like just one by one or do you want Nomihoudai? </joey>
<joey> And the part where I was like, </joey>
<joey> I think I'll just go Tampin tonight. </joey>
<joey> Somewhere inside my head, I was like, you've changed. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> How dare you? </joey>
<joey> What happened to you, man? </joey>
<joey> You used to be cool. </joey>
<joey> Like if you were asked Nomihoudai, </joey>
<joey> not even a moment of hesitation, </joey>
<joey> you'd be like, of course, Nomihoudai. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah like I had the exact same moment as well, </garnt>
<joey> when I'm just like, I remember thinking to myself, </joey>
<joey> whenever I move to Japan, I'm never not going to say no. </joey>
<garnt> Me say no to all you can drink beers, really? </garnt>
<garnt> And now I'm just like, ah really, all you can drink? </garnt>
<connor> - I forget you're 30 Garnt, fuck man. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm gonna be so much worse than you at 30. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be like fucking awful to hang out with- </connor>
<joey> - Is it true that like your entire view on everything </joey>
<connor> just changes the moment you hit 30, </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's all I've been hearing about. </connor>
<connor> - Is it true you become a fucking boomer when you get 30? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I mean, no. - You just start hating </connor>
<connor> every young person. - No because like, </connor>
<joey> I've heard from so many people who are now in their 30s, </joey>
<garnt> where like, it's literally, I don't know if it's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I identify as a 30-year-old. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - When does the dust start forming? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if it's like placebo or whatever, </connor>
<connor> or the way you just like overthink it, </connor>
<joey> but so many people are like, yeah, the moment I hit 30, </joey>
<joey> it's just like everything, </joey>
<joey> like I just stopped giving a about so much. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I feel 30. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm the opposite, I don't feel 30 at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Honestly, I don't feel like I've changed much at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - You haven't. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I wonder how you can do like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm struggling to keep up sometimes, </connor>
<joey> when people wanna party and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> fine, I'll go to the party. - No I'm right there as well. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, I'll force myself to drink, </joey>
<joey> but half the time my heart's not in it, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> My heart's not there. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm still up there like fucking 5:00 AM or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like always in bed by like three now </garnt>
<joey> and Garnt will be like, "Yeah, I stayed up until 9:00 AM </joey>
<joey> and I started just doing work at 10." </joey>
<joey> - You're up till three, dude. </joey>
<joey> It's like 11:30 and I'm like all right, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna go to bed, man. </joey>
<joey> - Joey's napping in the karaoke place. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm like a 60-year-old. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> It's just a sad life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't feel like I've changed at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm almost 31 now and I feel like I just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I'm still fucking 25, 23. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean you still look 25. </joey>
<connor> - You're gonna be like that fucking old anime character </connor>
<connor> that's like the most fun to hang out with. </connor>
<connor> And he teaches you some cool shit, </connor>
<joey> and then he sacrifices himself casually later on. </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna be the old man who like looks really small, </joey>
<garnt> but the moment it takes the shirt off he's just jacked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Netero. Basically Netero. </garnt>
<joey> - From what I've heard from just other people </joey>
<joey> that are just older than me, </joey>
<joey> they just told me that your 30s is just basically your 20s, </joey>
<joey> with one de-buff to your body. </joey>
<connor> And I guess my hang-overs- </connor>
<connor> - What's the de-buff for you? </connor>
<connor> - I guess my hangovers are slightly worse now, </connor>
<connor> that's the only reason. </connor>
<joey> The only reason, like I drink a fuck ton more wine now. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't know what it is. </joey>
<joey> It's funny, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when when I was like 18 </joey>
<connor> to like 20, 30- - Anytime you turn 30 you go, </connor>
<connor> you're like beer, vodka, nah. </connor>
<connor> Me moment you turn 30, have a wine cooler </connor>
<garnt> and it's fully stocked. </garnt>
<connor> - That was exactly me when I was 30. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, yes, I only drink wine now, </joey>
<joey> thank you very much. </joey>
<joey> Beer? Ugh! </joey>
<garnt> Get that teenage shit out of here. </garnt>
<joey> - The next step is gonna be like wine Cognac </joey>
<joey> for me please. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I drink wine because, one, I like the taste, </garnt>
<garnt> and two, because for some reason the hangovers for wine, </garnt>
<garnt> are just like way more bearable. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember 'cause like, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> When I was in my teens and like early 20s, I was like, wine? </garnt>
<joey> Fuck you. </joey>
<garnt> - I would get the worst hangovers on wine, </garnt>
<joey> especially red wine. </joey>
<connor> I swear I had like fucking Vietnam flashbacks, </connor>
<connor> from drinking red wine at university, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Thai man (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the hangovers there were like fucking unbearable. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I hit like 27, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> ooh, this kind of feels warm and fuzzy. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even have those like Nam flashbacks </joey>
<garnt> 'cause like I didn't even like, I didn't even drink wine. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're just making that a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I wasn't even interested in drinking wine </garnt>
<connor> in my early 20s 'cause my dad is like </connor>
<connor> a fucking heavy wine drinker. </connor>
<connor> So he's always like </connor>
<connor> try this nice red wine. - He was Australian? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course, all Australian's love their wine, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, they all love their wine, so like- </connor>
<connor> - There's loads of wine grown in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah absolutely. </connor>
<connor> There's great wine, now, you know, </connor>
<connor> now that I can drink wine, </connor>
<connor> it's like, oh yeah, this is fucking fantastic. </connor>
<connor> But when you're like 21, 22 and you drink a glass of red, </connor>
<joey> you're like, oh God, like I can not get used to this at all. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe we drink more wine if we grew it in the UK. </connor>
<connor> But unfortunately the only place they make wine in UK, </connor>
<joey> are prisons, I don't really think we have too much choice, </joey>
<joey> of good wine selection. </joey>
<joey> - I think UK does make some wines. </joey>
<garnt> - Is that wine? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that considered wine, or is that just like grape juice </garnt>
<joey> with attitude? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - As well, you just get it from France, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So once you make your own wine, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's gonna be like, we literally have France, </garnt>
<connor> like an hour, why would you. - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't realize how lucky I had it, </connor>
<garnt> until I moved to a country that is not well, </garnt>
<connor> I mean, they produce Sake here, they do produce wine, </connor>
<joey> but it's not as well known. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know how good we had it, </joey>
<joey> where you can just go to a fucking local Co-op, </joey>
<joey> or Tescos and buy great wine </joey>
<joey> that is like triple the price here in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And it tastes- - Yeah, wine kinda sucks here. </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem, right? </connor>
<connor> You have to go to like a specialist wine place, </connor>
<joey> 'cause like, if you go to fucking FamilyMart or Seven, </joey>
<joey> it's like, you're just basically picking poison </joey>
<connor> if you drink the cheap wine here. </connor>
<joey> It's basically just bottled rat poison. </joey>
<joey> That's how I see it. </joey>
<joey> - It's grape flavored hand sanitizer. </joey>
<joey> - We have such first-world problems. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> We just like concerned about the quality of the wine </connor>
<connor> that we (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> Listen, what happened to us, man? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I would say I started drinking way more wine, </garnt>
<garnt> because of corona, </garnt>
<joey> and because when you're stuck inside, </joey>
<joey> you gotta find an interest </joey>
<joey> in something right? - You gotta make your own fun. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like a narrator. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Garnt decided to take up a new hobby, </connor>
<connor> alcoholism" </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - No, but like it's incredible, </joey>
<joey> because it's the first time ever where I drank something, </joey>
<joey> like a heavy, heavy amount, </joey>
<joey> and I wake up the next morning, I'm like, I'm alive. </joey>
<connor> - That's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that I feel like that's a one-off, right? </connor>
<connor> I feel like that's being shot, </connor>
<garnt> and it misses a vital organ. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what, when you drink and- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> It's happened multiple times. </connor>
<connor> - For me, if I just stay on wine, </connor>
<joey> and I don't mix drinks, </joey>
<joey> wine hangovers are the most bearable. </joey>
<joey> - For me it's like beer is like always worst stomach ache- </joey>
<joey> - It's gin for me. - Sake, </joey>
<joey> - Gin I don't get bad hangovers. </joey>
<joey> - Always the worst headaches. </joey>
<joey> - Sake, so like, hangover tier list, okay. </joey>
<connor> - Hangover tier list. </connor>
<joey> - Hangover tier list, let's go, okay. </joey>
<joey> So right at the top, I don't fuck with this at all. </joey>
<joey> Sake. - Sake, yeah hands down, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like so- - Wait is S tier here </joey>
<joey> the strongest? - S tier is like the shit, </joey>
<connor> like the worst hang over. </connor>
<garnt> - Or should we do the opposite, like? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it should be the opposite. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, well, Sake is like fucking Z tier. </joey>
<garnt> Like I remember like when Chris was last on this podcast, </garnt>
<garnt> we went to the izakaya afterwards. </garnt>
<connor> - Just like one shot of Sake's enough to give me a hangover. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - If I'm drinking something else, </garnt>
<connor> but Sake has even entered my body once, </connor>
<connor> it completely contaminates my body. </connor>
<connor> It's like fuck you, Connor. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember when we went to the izakaya, </connor>
<garnt> like literally the hour afterwards. </garnt>
<connor> And I was on beer the entire night, </connor>
<connor> and then Chris was just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Let's get some Sake, right lads?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember having like one cup of Sake </garnt>
<garnt> and then I was just like gone the next day. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<joey> - I could see your brain powering down, as you drank it. </joey>
<joey> It's like. (mimics powering down) </joey>
<connor> - He had the audacity to be like, this is great Sake. </connor>
<connor> It wasn't great, it was fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> I've had good Sake that was just slightly bearable </connor>
<connor> and this shit was awful. </connor>
<connor> Tasted like, just something going off in your mouth. </connor>
<connor> Like it was something just going stale, </connor>
<connor> and would hit your body terribly. </connor>
<connor> Be ashamed of yourself, Connor. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I've never had worse headaches in my life </joey>
<joey> after a night of just drinking Sake. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Sake is by far the worst. </garnt>
<connor> - Tequila's up there. </connor>
<connor> Tequila's there as well for me. </connor>
<joey> - Just above that is like, </joey>
<joey> all the fucking spirits- - Spirits. </joey>
<joey> - The really shitty. </joey>
<joey> - Tequila's the worst one. </joey>
<joey> - I say tequila's the worst one, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I would say tequila and Sambuca, </joey>
<garnt> are like on that level, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I feel bad for like our Muslim fans </connor>
<connor> that can't watch this, now. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't know anything. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll take your word for it. </garnt>
<joey> - Just trust us. Just trust us. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like tequila and Sambuca for me are like, </joey>
<connor> they're the student shots. </connor>
<garnt> They're what you get as a student because- </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking Sambuca? </garnt>
<garnt> Who drinks that all night? </garnt>
<connor> Fuck that, psychopaths drink Sambuca. </connor>
<connor> - What even is Sambuca? </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, you don't know it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I don't even know it. </connor>
<connor> - It's a one drink that your mate is like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, let's get this drink." </connor>
<connor> And then you have it and you're like (gags). </connor>
<joey> Like that. - What is it? </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a licorice. - Yeah, it's fucking awful. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, is it like Jaeger? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I was about to okay, going on the- </garnt>
<connor> - It's just the same level. </connor>
<joey> - On the same level, </joey>
<joey> but like going above that I would say is Jaeger, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they're all like, </joey>
<joey> they're all the shots where you know you wake up </joey>
<joey> and you can pinpoint the exact moment the night went wrong. </joey>
<joey> It was the exact moment someone ordered </joey>
<joey> a round of Jaeger shots. or a round of Sambuca shots, </joey>
<joey> or tequila shots. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. - And for some reason, </joey>
<joey> Meilyne fucking loves tequila and- </joey>
<joey> - I will never understand that. </joey>
<joey> I will literally never understand that. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] I just like the taste. </joey>
<joey> - What about the taste? </joey>
<joey> - What about the taste? </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] No I don't like the taste. </joey>
<joey> - You don't like the taste? </joey>
<joey> - Well then why do you drink it? </joey>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I like how it makes me feel. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - There's other alcohol you can use that for. </connor>
<connor> - That's a concerning sentence. </connor>
<joey> - [Meilyne] It makes me very, </joey>
<garnt> you know. (laughs) - No we don't </garnt>
<joey> because we can't relate. - Drunk. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it tastes like ass, </joey>
<joey> and like the first, I mean, look, </joey>
<joey> the only time where I was like, okay, </joey>
<joey> tequila was kind of fun. </joey>
<joey> It's like the first time you do </joey>
<joey> with the whole salt thing, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's like- - Cannot the whole salt thing. </joey>
<joey> - That's so unlike me. </joey>
<joey> - It's like playing a mini game </joey>
<connor> while you're doing (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - It's like a little event, right? </joey>
<joey> - I've realized if you're like a student, </joey>
<joey> which is like when you start trying all these drinks, </joey>
<joey> if you had some kind of fucking quick time event to it, </joey>
<joey> drinking becomes like 10 times more fun </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're a fucking idiot. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like there was a, </joey>
<joey> fuck in Swansea when I went to university, </joey>
<joey> there's this one bar that would do these drinks of Sambuca, </joey>
<joey> where they would light it on fire, </joey>
<garnt> and then like put the like- - Oh, gas chamber. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what it's called, </garnt>
<garnt> which is not a very flattering name. </garnt>
<connor> It's called a gas chamber, which is a terrible name. </connor>
<connor> And so they would do it for like one pound 50, right? </connor>
<connor> Which is like $2.50? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know it was legal in the UK 'cause- </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know if it is, but they served it to me. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause the only time I've been able to do that, </connor>
<garnt> is not in the UK, but it's when we go on like fucking- </garnt>
<connor> - It might be illegal, </connor>
<connor> but you know how the bars are in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> Some of them are (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - You know how are the bars are. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know how some of the student bars are. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels like it's like World War III </garnt>
<connor> in some of these bars. </connor>
<connor> Like people throwing up everywhere. </connor>
<connor> They're serving drinks to people they shouldn't be. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, they would light the Sambuca on fire, </connor>
<connor> and put a wine glass over to extinguish the fire. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen those, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and then they would put the wine glass </joey>
<joey> on the table really quickly, </joey>
<joey> and then you would shot the thing, </joey>
<joey> and then you have to breathe in the fumes </joey>
<joey> from the wine glass. </joey>
<joey> And it would go straight to your head. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, like you know the- </connor>
<joey> - I've done those before, okay. </joey>
<joey> Okay, I've had Sambuca before then, yeah, </joey>
<joey> - Its fucking awful. - You know, these are like </joey>
<joey> students shots, right? - Don't do it, don't do it. </joey>
<joey> It's terrible. - Because even with tequila, </joey>
<joey> you lick the salt, do the tequila and do the lime, right? </joey>
<joey> Some are like fucking students, </joey>
<joey> have found a way to make this like even more messed up, </joey>
<connor> because- - Are you talking about, </connor>
<connor> the kamikaze shot? </connor>
<connor> - Did you call it the kamikaze shot or the suicide shot? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah suicide or kamikaze, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, what is this? </joey>
<joey> I don't know what this is. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so the normal- </joey>
<joey> - It sounds like "Jackass" stunt. </joey>
<joey> - It is, it fucking is. </joey>
<joey> So the normal order you go in is that, </joey>
<joey> you lick the salt, you do the tequila shot, </joey>
<joey> and then you suck on the lime, or the lemon, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] In that case, it makes it bearable. </connor>
<connor> - So, okay, how about this? </connor>
<connor> How about instead of licking the salt, </connor>
<joey> you snort the salt. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, that sounds stupid. </joey>
<joey> - And then you drink. - Take the shot. </joey>
<joey> - You take the shot, and instead of sucking on the lime, </joey>
<joey> you just put it in your eyes. </joey>
<garnt> Who the fuck thought of this? </garnt>
<connor> - So I'm thinking about a new challenge, </connor>
<connor> it's the shit yourself in public challenge. </connor>
<connor> Just shit yourself on the train, </connor>
<connor> and just see how long you can last. </connor>
<joey> - I had a friend on my 18th birthday, </joey>
<joey> who did that three times. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Because we were playing darts and he was like, </joey>
<joey> he was so fucking cocky about it. </joey>
<joey> He was like, I'll beat you. </joey>
<joey> I practice every fucking day. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, your like seven shots in, </joey>
<joey> you're not gonna fucking beat me. </joey>
<joey> He's like. "Well, watch this." </joey>
<connor> - I totally understand why people are like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't want drinks." </connor>
<joey> When I hear about this shit. </joey>
<joey> I'm like why would you? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, no absolutely, yeah. </connor>
<joey> We don't encourage viewers. </joey>
<garnt> - This is has always been a fucking step level beyond me. </garnt>
<connor> - This is like people who did like vodka shots </connor>
<connor> through their eyeball. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, what's wrong with people? </connor>
<joey> What the fuck is wrong with people? </joey>
<joey> - You have a perfectly functioning mouth. </joey>
<joey> Just use it. </joey>
<garnt> Like for me, I feel old whenever, </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe I've always been old </garnt>
<joey> 'cause anytime I've heard a story like that, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, who the fuck thinks this is cool? </joey>
<joey> Do you have brain damage? </joey>
<joey> It's like what went wrong in your life </joey>
<garnt> to think that doing a vodka shot in your eye was bad-ass? </garnt>
<connor> - Right, because this is the aspect I hated </connor>
<connor> about being in university. </connor>
<connor> Is that like, they would be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, so you do the vodka shot in your eye," </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, why? </joey>
<joey> Then they'd be like, "Oh, 'cause it gets you drunk quicker." </joey>
<joey> I'm like this literally takes five minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Just drink it. </joey>
<joey> And then I'm the fucking weirdo out of the group </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I'm the one who doesn't wanna shove </garnt>
<connor> a fucking vodka in my eye. </connor>
<connor> I'm the asshole? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, next thing you know, there'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I took some fucking ethanol, </connor>
<connor> and I fucking just injected into my veins. </connor>
<joey> It was fucking rock and roll man. </joey>
<joey> That was metal as fuck." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, what? </joey>
<joey> At what point do we acknowledge </joey>
<garnt> that this is just stupid shit, </garnt>
<joey> that no one should be doing? - As someone who's done </joey>
<joey> a shoey a couple of times in there life, </joey>
<joey> I can't really say anything, unfortunately. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> That's probably the most fucked up one I've done, yeah. </garnt>

<garnt> I'll tell you when you know </garnt>
<garnt> you've reached the generation gap, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's that point, because I remember when I thought, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I'll always be up for a tequila, </joey>
<joey> or Sambuca, or Jaeger bomb. </joey>
<joey> And then somewhere along in life, </joey>
<joey> I reached like mid 20s and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> maybe they're just better ways to get drunk </garnt>
<garnt> other than doing these shots, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, you just kinda be like, do I? </garnt>
<connor> Do I wanna be drunk? </connor>
<joey> (indistinct) (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I remember I used to think like, </joey>
<joey> I would look at like all the dads at a pub, right? </joey>
<connor> And I'm just like, they're just sitting there talking </connor>
<connor> with a beer in their hand? </connor>
<joey> That doesn't sound fun. </joey>
<joey> And now I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I wish for that more than anything right now. </joey>
<joey> That sounds amazing! - Exactly, right? </joey>
<joey> Exactly, right? </joey>
<joey> And I remember thinking like, when I was in university, </joey>
<garnt> I remember thinking, I'm never gonna be like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'ma still be doing shots when I'm 50, let's go. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like that when I was like 22, </connor>
<joey> I just gave up at like 21. </joey>
<joey> I was like fine, I finished with university. </joey>
<joey> Time to be a fucking- - Time to be an adult. </joey>
<joey> - Time to be a boring functioning adult. </joey>
<garnt> Terrible, isn't it? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, I remember recently I went to my, </garnt>
<joey> like some of my first wine events. </joey>
<joey> Went to a wine tasting event, </joey>
<joey> and that's how you know, that's- </joey>
<joey> - Privilege. </joey>
<joey> - That how you know you're making money. </joey>
<joey> - That I've reached that age when I'm just like, okay, </joey>
<connor> how about wine tasting? - It's like yay! </connor>
<joey> - And I remember taking Connor to one as well, one time. </joey>
<joey> And like, so this one time, </joey>
<joey> like the people at this wine event are exactly the people </joey>
<connor> you expect to be at this wine event. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's in like their fucking 40s or 50s. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's like a fucking investment banker or something. </connor>
<connor> Something little- </connor>
<connor> - With a monocle and top hat? </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's basically like, </connor>
<joey> the main guy running the event </joey>
<joey> is this really old French dude </joey>
<joey> who you could see in a monocle and top hat, right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> And I remember, so I was with Sydney. </joey>
<joey> And so he was, you know, it's like a very intimate event. </joey>
<joey> So he would go around asking people, what they do. </joey>
<joey> And of course, when they go to us, we mentioned YouTuber, </joey>
<joey> and like obviously people perk the fuck up, right? </joey>
<joey> And of course, he goes to Sydney and ask what she does. </joey>
<joey> And Sydney just very tastefully says </joey>
<joey> that she does videos about anime, and manga, </joey>
<joey> and Japanese culture. </joey>
<joey> And then he asked her for her YouTube channel, </joey>
<joey> and she gives it to him. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] No! </joey>
<connor> - And then he goes, oh, let me just search this up. </connor>
<connor> And I've never seen the life flash before someone's eyes </connor>
<connor> as fast as I've seen like Sydney go, "No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Don't do that, don't do that." (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> But the best part was, so, at this wine event, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's a room full of people. </connor>
<connor> They are very, very prim and proper, you know. </connor>
<connor> It's a very, </connor>
<connor> I would say it is a very posh room. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. Of course. </connor>
<garnt> - And so we go up to have like I think like our third </garnt>
<garnt> or fourth glass of wine that we're trying. </garnt>
<garnt> And so there's this word in French that means cheers. </garnt>
<connor> - We say it in English as well, though. </connor>
<connor> - Do you? - Yeah you say it in the UK </connor>
<garnt> as well. - Okay, so you know, </garnt>
<joey> it's that joke that the guy makes every single fucking time, </joey>
<joey> because it's like a very obvious joke, right? </joey>
<joey> So he goes, "Okay, everyone. </joey>
<joey> Everyone say, chin, chin." </joey>
<garnt> And then the entire room is just silent, </garnt>
<garnt> except I just hear next to me, Sydney go. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Like It is not quiet at all. </connor>
<connor> She just bursts out. (giggles) </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And everyone just starts laughing. </connor>
<joey> I remember just sitting there like, fuck, </joey>
<joey> I'm with those guys. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> To be fair, it is pretty funny. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, in the UK we go like chin, chin. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, chin, chin. - Yeah it's like drink. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you ever say that? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah in the UK people always say chin chin, </connor>
<connor> like before you down a pint or something like, </connor>
<connor> chin chin, and then you down it. </connor>
<connor> - I've never heard that before. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe it's like a northerner thing. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, people always said that. </connor>
<joey> - They say that in Italy too, don't they? </joey>
<connor> - Italy as well? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I believe so. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe that's where (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> Yeah anyway. - Cause I remember </connor>
<joey> the first time I heard it was when I went to Italy. </joey>
<connor> - Oh God, we didn't explain the joke. </connor>
<connor> If you don't know, chin, chin, sounds like, ochinchin, </connor>
<joey> which means penis in Japanese. </joey>
<connor> The more you know. - So basically </connor>
<garnt> you're just saying pee-pee. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, everyone say, "Pee-pee." </joey>
<connor> - Pee-pee. - Dick. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And Sydney of course. - Everybody. </joey>
<joey> Penis. - Being the mature woman, </joey>
<connor> that she is, just laughed. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, the first time I heard it, </joey>
<connor> I fucking burst out laughing too. </connor>
<joey> I was like, you gotta be taking the piss. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause we're like some like really fancy hotel </connor>
<joey> where like there's literally security every like 10 meters </joey>
<joey> to check whether you're in the right place </joey>
<joey> and then Sydney just fucking laughed. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, what? </joey>
<joey> - It was in like some fancy hotel. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I always feel really out of place, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm just like a child. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like- - Yeah right? </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, I don't belong here. </connor>
<joey> - Whenever I go to like any fancy restaurant, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter where it is, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I shouldn't be here. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. - I'm in a fucking T-shirt, </connor>
<garnt> and I'm like what's going on? </garnt>
<connor> Fuck it, I'm here to taste </connor>
<connor> some wine. - It's like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I just wanted wine. </connor>
<joey> I felt like every time I go to one of those events </joey>
<joey> or especially like a company party, </joey>
<joey> I never feel more self-conscious </joey>
<garnt> than whenever everyone around me is just wearing suits. </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like- </joey>
<joey> - Meanwhile I have to bust out this fucking wrinkly ass </joey>
<joey> collared shirt from like the bottom of my wardrobe. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh fuck! </joey>
<connor> - It's great, you can go to these events </connor>
<joey> and then people will tell you about </joey>
<joey> how rich their parents are. </joey>
<joey> It's really fun, it's really, really fun. </joey>
<joey> I love it. It's great. - Great. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's just so depressing. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna fucking hear about how your dad </joey>
<connor> owns ten companies, fuck off. </connor>
<joey> - You guys should have gone </joey>
<connor> in fucking the Giorgio suits, right? </connor>
<joey> You should've just like fully committed, </joey>
<connor> like proper like, wear a monocle </connor>
<joey> and like a top hat and everything. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think monocles have been in fashion </joey>
<connor> since the fucking plague. </connor>
<connor> - You can bring it back. </connor>
<garnt> - Bring it back. - Yeah, bring back. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll bring back the monocle. </connor>
<garnt> - Bring back the monocle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just cosplay the monopoly man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - That's what I'm gonna do. </connor>
<joey> - Fake mustache and everything. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna get gray hair so I can become the monopoly man </joey>
<connor> before it falls out. </connor>
<joey> - And drink wine. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, my God. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) - Oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> How the fuck did we get on this topic? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, we didn't address the wine tier, </connor>
<connor> the hangover tier list. </connor>
<connor> By the way I'll just do it for you right now. </connor>
<joey> Gin is number one, wine is second, beer is in the middle, </joey>
<joey> and then all the other weird spirits sit down below, </joey>
<joey> and then right at the bottom is Sake. </joey>
<joey> There you go. Boom! </joey>
<joey> So then you say we did not finish that tangent, fuck you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Onto the next one. </joey>
<joey> What's the next topic. </joey>
<connor> - What's the next tangent? </connor>
<connor> - We on (indistinct) boys, right? </connor>
<connor> - Evian water spray. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - So, let's explain that. - Are you talking about, </joey>
<connor> okay (indistinct). - Yeah, Let's explain that. </connor>
<joey> - So, what happened? - Meilyne is like. </joey>
<joey> - So yesterday I get this a very ominous message </joey>
<joey> from Meilyne, all right, okay. </joey>
<joey> - When does Meilyne's messages not ominous? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, let me- </joey>
<joey> - So I get this very ominous message from Meilyne </joey>
<connor> just saying, "Hey tomorrow, can I try something on you </connor>
<connor> at the office?" (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's never a good thing when Meilyne says this. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is going on here right now? </connor>
<connor> And she's like, "Yeah, I have this like ultrasound thing </connor>
<connor> that I wanna put on your face," </connor>
<connor> or something like that. - It's for the baby, right? </connor>
<connor> - Is that what that was? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess so, </connor>
<garnt> Meilyne, do you wanna explain what it was? </garnt>
<joey> - It's like an ultrasound thing, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Meilyne] No, it's like ultrasonic form vibration. </connor>
<garnt> - You're just putting buzzwords together. </garnt>
<joey> - The only time you hear ultrasonic is in the Sonic game. </joey>
<joey> That is the only time you hear it. </joey>
<joey> - That is literally just a sponsorship script. </joey>
<joey> It's got ultrasonic buzzword. </joey>
<joey> - I have it right here. </joey>
<joey> It is an Evian facial spray. </joey>
<joey> - This is like wet your face. - No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - This is to wet your face. </joey>
<garnt> - That's just to wet my face, where so she- </garnt>
<garnt> - How much does this cost? </garnt>
<connor> How much does this cost, Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - That looks like a vibrator. </joey>
<joey> - It does look like a vibrator. </joey>
<connor> - That does. </connor>
<connor> How much does this cost? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I don't know, I got it for free. </connor>
<connor> - From who? </connor>
<joey> - [Meilyne] I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - From a sponsor. - Who's giving out Evian- </joey>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Costco. </garnt>
<garnt> - Costco, wow. - Costco? </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't even know they had Evian water spray before. </garnt>
<garnt> So, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> So for some reason I just agreed to it and said, yes, </joey>
<joey> do whatever you need to do Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> And so she puts this gel on my face </joey>
<joey> and then starts rubbing that, wait, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> First she sprays the Evian facial spray, </joey>
<connor> which I think is just water. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's literally Evian in a can. </connor>
<connor> - She just sprayed Evian water on my face, </connor>
<joey> put a gel on it and just did a fucking ultrasound </joey>
<joey> on my face. - That's weird. </joey>
<joey> - And apparently we are never getting </joey>
<connor> a sponsorship from Evian ever again. </connor>
<joey> - It's really just going back and forward, </joey>
<joey> that's all it's doing. </joey>
<joey> It's literally, that's all it's doing. </joey>
<joey> How is that doing anything? </joey>
<connor> - [Meilyne] You need gel. </connor>
<connor> - Do you know if I- </connor>
<connor> - For real? do, I though? - You do. </connor>
<connor> - If I actually just got what, like a pregnancy. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] No. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - What do you do? </connor>
<joey> You're like seeing if its face- </joey>
<garnt> - That's what it felt like. </garnt>
<garnt> It felt like she was going to like, </garnt>
<garnt> she was like fucking doing an ultrasound on my face. </garnt>
<connor> I wanna start a business where I just put my mouth </connor>
<connor> against your cheek and just scream and call it a therapy. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> The vibrations will heal any kind of impurities you have. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so basically before we started </joey>
<joey> recording this episode, Meilyne was like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm just gonna do half of Garnt's face </joey>
<connor> so that the boys can see the magic and wonder </connor>
<connor> of the before and after. </connor>
<connor> - Could not tell the difference. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we're probably never gonna get a sponsorship </connor>
<joey> from Evian, but it looked the fucking same. </joey>
<garnt> Like the- </garnt>
<joey> - Can you tell the difference in my face </joey>
<garnt> from my usual camera? - The left side of his face </garnt>
<joey> was just a little bit more moist than the other side. </joey>
<joey> That's all it was like. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> I don't know what this is supposed to do, but. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] What? </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't. - Does it though, Meilyne, </connor>
<connor> or are you just led to believe it works? </connor>
<joey> It's for gullible people who wanna believe </joey>
<joey> there's a solution for everything. </joey>
<connor> And sometimes you just ugly. </connor>
<connor> That's how it is. </connor>
<connor> That happens. </connor>
<connor> I gotta deal with that. </connor>
<joey> No amount of Evian water spray will save you </joey>
<joey> from you ugliness. - No amount of Evian shit </joey>
<connor> is gonna fucking fix my problems, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's fucked. </connor>
<joey> That's the thing. </joey>
<joey> If this truly fixed your ugliness, no one will be ugly, </joey>
<joey> 'cause everyone would just buy these. </joey>
<connor> - I will now end world ugliness. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I tell you, It's been real quiet since that dropped, man. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Evian's like, "We're to save the day." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry, Meilyne. - We're about to put </joey>
<joey> the fashion industry out of business. </joey>
<joey> Everyone is gonna be a model </joey>
<joey> after we bring out water spray to the scene. </joey>
<connor> - There's so much stuff like that where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure it works like 0.1%, </connor>
<connor> but how much is it like a negligible amount </connor>
<connor> where you're like, is it worth my time? </connor>
<connor> How good does it have to be where I have to sit there </connor>
<connor> and rub my face and spray Evian on it? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> How good are the results have to be? </connor>
<joey> - There're just some things where it's like, </joey>
<joey> I get the intent as to why this was invented. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - But it's also like, </joey>
<connor> there are so many other alternatives </connor>
<connor> that work just as well and probably a lot cheaper. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like going back to the whole like fucking </connor>
<connor> Amazon things you didn't need, you needed, right? </connor>
<connor> That is a prime example. </connor>
<connor> That is just like a bunch of people with way too much money </connor>
<joey> who are just going on to Amazon </joey>
<joey> buying all these fucking things. </joey>
<joey> I remember those one- - It's just sad, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I mean, it's just like they feed off the insecurities </connor>
<connor> that people have. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - They have those weight loss bracelets. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen those? </connor>
<connor> - It's probably just a bracelet that has magnets in it </connor>
<joey> or something that apparently will make you lose weight. </joey>
<joey> And the before and after pictures are the fucking egregious. </joey>
<joey> There'll be like the most obese person, </joey>
<joey> and then apparently because of this one bracelet, </joey>
<joey> which they probably can't even get on their hand </joey>
<joey> how exaggerated obese he is. - It starts off as a ring. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like apparently </joey>
<connor> this magically makes you extremely hot. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't address the problem with, </connor>
<connor> if you go from like 500 pounds to 200 pounds, </connor>
<joey> where's the skin gone? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - Doesn't address that. </joey>
<garnt> It just magically sucks back in. </garnt>
<connor> Like, fuck off! </connor>
<garnt> - What I love is when you see the before and after pic </garnt>
<joey> and it's so obviously not the same. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I love those. </joey>
<connor> I love those. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like someone's so morbidly obese </connor>
<garnt> that they think that because they now have a six pack, </garnt>
<connor> you can't recognize that it's just not the same </connor>
<connor> fucking person. - Yeah, the lighting </connor>
<garnt> is totally off. </garnt>
<connor> - The belly button's totally different. </connor>
<garnt> Like there's no hair. </garnt>
<connor> - One thing I always find funny, </connor>
<garnt> is like why always in the before pic </garnt>
<joey> does like the camera man, just say, </joey>
<joey> "Look as depressed as you can." </joey>
<joey> - It's like a subconscious thing. </joey>
<joey> - Like you're smiling </joey>
<connor> Why are you smiling? </connor>
<garnt> This is the before pic. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean in the UK they're just depressed in birth, </connor>
<connor> but I mean it's like subconscious, right? </connor>
<connor> If you see someone smiling </connor>
<joey> you're fucking dumb monkey brains thing, oh good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's a good thing. - Good thing happened again. </connor>
<joey> - Good thing happened thing. - Happened thing here. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I get really sad when I know </joey>
<connor> that clearly someone's buying this stuff, </connor>
<connor> unlike the detox teas that just making yourself. </connor>
<connor> It's just like shitting yourself, </connor>
<connor> of course, you're gonna lose weight </connor>
<connor> 'cause you're shitting out all the stool </connor>
<connor> that you have in there. </connor>
<connor> Of course, you're gonna lose weight, </connor>
<connor> but it's just sad that people feel desperate enough </connor>
<connor> and they can't just like believe the fact that it's like, </connor>
<connor> just eat less. </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes it's not that simple though, I know. </joey>
<connor> But that's the core of it, though. </connor>
<connor> - Just eat less. - Just eat less. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Don't get cyber bullied. </connor>
<connor> Just turn off the PC. </connor>
<connor> But it suck 'cause- </connor>
<connor> - Just don't get hungry. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - But that's what it is. </connor>
<connor> The fundamental of it is just like eat less shit. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously, there are exceptions in there. </connor>
<connor> Some of you in the comments be like I have X... </connor>
<joey> Yeah. Okay, good. </joey>
<connor> But like the fundamental of it is, </connor>
<connor> don't buy this bullshit, you know. </connor>
<joey> - It's so stupid. - It's like the people </joey>
<joey> who are buying into that kinda stuff, </joey>
<joey> usually that's all it is. </joey>
<joey> And like all they need is just like a change of diet </joey>
<connor> or just something so fucking easy. </connor>
<garnt> And yeah, they're just like. </garnt>
<connor> - Just don't be fat. </connor>
<joey> - Just don't be fat. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Listen, listen. </connor>
<connor> I can vouch for the chicken and broccoli diet. </connor>
<connor> It works. It works wonders. </connor>
<connor> The chicken and broccoli diet is no joke. </connor>
<connor> It worked wonders for me. </connor>
<joey> - A simple payment of 6.99. </joey>
<joey> - Trade offer. - Trade offer. </joey>
<joey> - You get chicken and broccoli, you lose weight. </joey>
<joey> It's simple as that, literally (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - I get 79.99, you get chicken and broccoli. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Chicken and broccoli company team up with me. </connor>
<garnt> I will show up, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is there a chicken and broccoli company?. </garnt>
<garnt> - There actually is on Uber Eats around our area, </garnt>
<joey> There is a (indistinct). - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I actually ordered it. - No fucking way. </joey>
<joey> - It was pretty fucking good. </joey>
<joey> - There was literally a chicken and broccoli chain </joey>
<joey> that just delivers chicken broccoli. </joey>
<connor> This is how it works, guys. </connor>
<connor> It's not fun, but weight loss isn't fun. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't need to be. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> it's sad that sometimes in self-improvement, </garnt>
<joey> a big factor in whether it's gonna succeed or not, </joey>
<joey> is if you're fucking enjoying yourself doing it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's unfortunate, right? </joey>
<joey> But like for me, for example, going to the gym </joey>
<joey> versus going to do like a sports </joey>
<joey> or going to do like another activity, </joey>
<joey> doing that activity is way more fun than spending even like, </joey>
<joey> I could do three hours or something of a sport </joey>
<joey> versus 30 minutes on a treadmill, </joey>
<garnt> and I choose like a three hour sport anytime. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's the thing. </garnt>
<joey> That's why I think Nintendo is like giga brain </joey>
<joey> when they're released Ring Fit, </joey>
<joey> 'cause that is literally the answer to like, </joey>
<joey> you can lose weight and have fun. </joey>
<connor> - This is like- </connor>
<joey> - I say that having never played it. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It is intact. It is intact. </joey>
<connor> - But I plan to get it, I plan to get it. </connor>
<joey> This has been sold out for a while. </joey>
<connor> - The big problem that we have been like believing </connor>
<joey> for so long with weight loss, and this is mainly like, </joey>
<connor> I know this is like fucking chemistry, </connor>
<connor> literally it's like- </connor>
<connor> - Okay, disclaimer, none of us are weight loss expert. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, don't Take our advice. </joey>
<connor> - But it's like, the big companies, </connor>
<connor> like Coke, McDonald's and all them, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "Yeah, you can drink as much Coke. </connor>
<connor> You can eat as much McDonald's as you want. </connor>
<connor> All you gotta do is just exercise. </connor>
<joey> It's not the food, it's exercise." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, exercise doesn't really do that much </joey>
<joey> for weight loss. </joey>
<joey> But what I find personally what exercise does do </joey>
<joey> is the day when I exercise, </joey>
<joey> I am vigilant about what I'm eating. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no, no carbs here. </joey>
<garnt> No sugar. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me the day when I exercise for some reason, </garnt>
<connor> I just- - You take care of yourself. </connor>
<joey> - No, I actually crave healthy foods. </joey>
<connor> I don't know what it is about, </connor>
<connor> but if I go to the gym for an hour, that day, </connor>
<connor> that day afterwards, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> man, I'm kinda just craving a chicken breasts. </connor>
<connor> Like fuck this pizza, fuck the curry or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But like when I'm just like being a couch potato, </connor>
<connor> just like sitting here all day, you're just like, </connor>
<joey> ah, I feel like shit, so I kinda just feel like </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna eat shit. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like going to the gym or like just exercising </joey>
<joey> in any way you can, it's not so much the act of losing it. </joey>
<joey> It's just like the motivation. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, obviously it helps general fitness </connor>
<joey> and being healthy and it's good. </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying it's bad, but like I feel like </joey>
<joey> we have definitely been like believe- </joey>
<joey> - It's not the cream on the crop. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we've also just been like told </joey>
<joey> when we were growing up, well, if you eat 10 donuts, </joey>
<joey> just burn off the calories and then boom, no damage. </joey>
<joey> That's not how it works. - 10 donuts, 10 kilometers </joey>
<joey> on the treadmill, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's just not how it works, though, unfortunately. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Trade off. </connor>
<joey> - You lose 10 pounds. - You receive 10 donuts, </joey>
<joey> I receive 10 kilometers on the treadmill. </joey>
<connor> - It sucks 'cause it's like at the end of the day </connor>
<connor> you could go in the gym and distract yourself with it, </connor>
<connor> but it comes to that moment when you're sitting on the couch </connor>
<connor> or you're wondering what to eat </connor>
<connor> and you've gotta just have the willpower to be like, </connor>
<connor> (slurps) ah, chicken broccoli. </connor>
<connor> Fine, fine (indistinct). - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It sucks 'cause it's like not fun. </connor>
<garnt> - It is all diet. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I feel like whenever you do </garnt>
<connor> any kind of self-improvement activity, </connor>
<joey> it's not the days where you feel good </joey>
<joey> that's gonna define if you basically succeed, </joey>
<joey> is the days where you feel bad </joey>
<joey> and you're able to push yourself through. </joey>
<joey> And I say this being like I've had plenty of times </joey>
<joey> when I have failed because I felt bad </joey>
<joey> and I just didn't just, </joey>
<joey> not even the motivation to push yourself through, </joey>
<joey> I just didn't have the self-discipline, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I feel like self-discipline is way more important </joey>
<connor> than motivation because there are gonna be some days </connor>
<connor> where you are just not motivated </connor>
<connor> and it's those days where you can push through. </connor>
<connor> And I know plenty of people who have, </connor>
<connor> I'm not one of them, unfortunately. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's like as well, I found that when I was, </connor>
<joey> it's easy to eat really healthy for like two weeks, </joey>
<joey> not easy, but it's doable, right? </joey>
<joey> But then it's like, all right, what if you just go </joey>
<joey> right back to doing what you're doing? </joey>
<joey> It's like, well, nothing has changed. </joey>
<joey> - That's when the bounce back happens. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's why I was just like, what can I cut out </joey>
<joey> that I can keep out like forever? </joey>
<joey> So I don't drink like soft drinks ever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. - That one thing </joey>
<connor> that' like cut that shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the last, like, since probably </connor>
<connor> the beginning of quarantine, </connor>
<connor> I've just made a conscious effort to not drink </connor>
<connor> any fizzy drinks or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> - It's just shit like that </connor>
<connor> I don't drink either. - Tea and water. </connor>
<joey> Is tea, water, coffee is all fucking I'm drinking. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I was lucky enough that I just never craved soda </connor>
<connor> or anything in my life. </connor>
<connor> I've just always grown up on drinking water. </connor>
<connor> And it's kind of made me realize that, man, </connor>
<connor> the habits you had as a kid, really it's just like, </connor>
<connor> it's so much- - They stick with you, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they stick with you. </connor>
<connor> It's so much easier to learn a habit once than to unlearn it </connor>
<connor> and to learn something else. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like so much of my life, you're like, </connor>
<connor> if I had a time machine, if I could fucking (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> myself back into like a younger body, </connor>
<connor> there's so many things I would do to be like, okay, </connor>
<garnt> you learn this, you learn this habit, you learn that habit </garnt>
<garnt> so you don't have to fucking unlearn it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And like have like a fucking year of your life being like, </garnt>
<garnt> well, I have this habit that I just had as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> and it's kinda fucking me over and I wanna try and do </garnt>
<garnt> something else, but God damn, </garnt>
<garnt> this pizza feels so fucking good right now. </garnt>
<connor> (Joe laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's not even like I don't even eat that shit anymore. </joey>
<joey> I most certainly do. </joey>
<joey> I kinda like trying to bounce it out how much I do eat. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, it's not like </joey>
<joey> an everyday thing, right? </joey>
<joey> - I hate talking about this shit online, </joey>
<joey> 'cause everyone's just a expert about it. </joey>
<joey> Like in the comments, no doubt, they'll be like 10 people </joey>
<joey> would be like, "I'm a nutritionist expert. </joey>
<joey> I'm here to tell you that you're totally wrong." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause everyone's got their own opinion </connor>
<connor> 'cause most people have gone through it. </connor>
<connor> Experience of seeing what's worked for them and so- </connor>
<joey> - But that's the thing, it's what's worked for them, right? </joey>
<joey> And that doesn't mean it works for everybody. </joey>
<joey> - As long as you do it healthy, </joey>
<joey> You're not starving yourself. </joey>
<joey> Like you see some people are like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I lost 10 kilograms in a weekends. </joey>
<joey> It's like that sounds like a terrible idea. </joey>
<joey> What did you do? </joey>
<connor> That sounds awful. - That must have been </connor>
<connor> some painful shit. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Shitting that F. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, fucking hell. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like it's... </garnt>
<connor> I think one important thing is that, </connor>
<connor> but just because something worked for someone </connor>
<connor> doesn't necessarily mean </connor>
<joey> it's gonna (indistinct) something else. </joey>
<connor> And it's really like, </connor>
<joey> what I found is it's really a trial, what was it like? </joey>
<joey> - Trial by fire. </joey>
<joey> - And error. </joey>
<joey> - Trial and error. </joey>
<connor> - Trial and error. - Trial by fire. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Trial by fire. - Trial by fire. </connor>
<connor> - You either die or you diet. </connor>
<connor> You either eat this or you fucking die. </connor>
<garnt> - You try or try dying. </garnt>
<garnt> - How about just try starving yourself? </garnt>
<garnt> You either lose weight or you die. </garnt>
<connor> - I used to be like fucking paranoid about like, </connor>
<connor> well, what's in this thing? </connor>
<connor> But I just started thinking like if I just eat </connor>
<connor> a reasonable amount of things and exercise, </connor>
<connor> I think I'll be all right. </connor>
<connor> And that kinda worked. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I was like carbs? </connor>
<connor> I eat a lot of carbs, but I just eat them within reason. </connor>
<connor> My meals are never too big. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I eat a fair amount of food. </connor>
<connor> I feel like when I stopped giving shit about calories </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that and just thinking like, </connor>
<connor> is this portion stupid? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is this a whole large Domino's pizza? </connor>
<connor> Should I eat this? Probably not. </connor>
<connor> So probably not gonna do it. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel like another thing is that, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> Maybe it's just me, but I think I just enjoy food too much. </joey>
<joey> - That's the problem. </joey>
<joey> - That's the problem. </joey>
<joey> It's not like I enjoy eating a lot of food, right? </joey>
<connor> But we talked about (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - I do. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> We talked about enjoying the little things in life </connor>
<connor> every now and again. </connor>
<garnt> And for me, like my day is like 70% worse </garnt>
<garnt> if I know I don't have a good meal to look forward to. </garnt>
<connor> - This is why I've just become an Uber Eats slave </connor>
<joey> at this point. </joey>
<garnt> I every day order from it now. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the problem, right? - It's terrible. </connor>
<joey> - But especially because like Japan is just the land </joey>
<joey> of fucking great food everywhere, food's become a hobby </joey>
<connor> at this point. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it is. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just like if I don't have a good meal, </joey>
<joey> it's like I feel empty. </joey>
<joey> - I just feel sad. - I feel like my day </joey>
<joey> is just like, yeah, completely empty. </joey>
<joey> I feel unfulfilled. </joey>
<joey> I go to sleep and I'm just like, I'm sad. </joey>
<garnt> I have nightmares. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I had the worst Uber Eats order of my life the other day. </garnt>
<joey> Oh, it was fucking tragic. </joey>
<joey> It was like, the pictures looked amazing, </joey>
<joey> the ratings were good. </joey>
<joey> It was a pork bowl Butadon. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. And it looked very nice, </joey>
<joey> and this places only did pork bowls. </joey>
<connor> I thought, great, they specialize in this one thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's gonna be </connor>
<connor> fucking magical. </connor>
<connor> So I order it, you know, it takes a little while. </connor>
<connor> No, not like crazy amount. </connor>
<connor> And then, so it gets here. </connor>
<joey> And it's packaged amazingly. </joey>
<joey> It looks like they've really cared about the packaging. </joey>
<joey> Give you an oshibori. </joey>
<joey> - Oshibori, yeah. </joey>
<joey> A wet towel. </joey>
<joey> - Like an actual, like thick one. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like a proper one? - A thick one. </joey>
<joey> - Like the rolled up one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like really thick ones. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, damn (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> I was getting really excited for this. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, hell yeah. </connor>
<joey> Okay, they give their own chopsticks, </joey>
<joey> really nice chopsticks as well. </joey>
<connor> So I open this bad boy up. </connor>
<connor> Looks pretty good, looks pretty good. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, okay, fantastic. </connor>
<connor> So I dig in and I'm like, oh no. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, okay, this part of the rice is kinda hard. </connor>
<connor> I was like, all right, </connor>
<connor> well, maybe it's just this one section. </connor>
<connor> It happens that it clumps up, right? </connor>
<connor> And so I hit another part and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> oh no, this part's hard too. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And then I put it in another part and it's hard. </connor>
<joey> And I go, maybe it needs a little force. </joey>
<joey> Maybe it needs a little. </joey>
<joey> I pull it apart a little bit. </joey>
<joey> And I picked this up with like the whole bowl </joey>
<joey> and I go to just pick up what I think </joey>
<joey> is a small amount of rice, and the whole rice comes out. </joey>
<joey> I picked the bowl up, the whole bowl, like formed comes out. </joey>
<joey> And I, no joke, this is why </joey>
<joey> I was starting to get a little angry. </joey>
<joey> I had my chopsticks like this in my hand like a barbarian </joey>
<joey> stabbing it and like ripping it apart, </joey>
<joey> and I couldn't rip it apart. </joey>
<joey> So I shuffled the meat on top to one side </joey>
<joey> and this is where I was like barbarian. </joey>
<joey> I literally tried to grab it with my hands </joey>
<connor> to see if I could separate this rice. </connor>
<connor> I could not separate this rice with like my full grip. </connor>
<connor> - Was it like not even cooked or what? </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck they did to it, </connor>
<connor> and I gave them one stars and I was like, </connor>
<connor> literally, don't give me a brick next time. </connor>
<connor> And they said, sorry- </connor>
<connor> - It's a literal brick of carbs. </connor>
<connor> - They were like, sorry, you didn't like it, </connor>
<connor> we'll improve next time. </connor>
<connor> Like, give me a refund. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I couldn't eat it. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even get a fucking refund. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - They ruined my whole night, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was like 9:00 PM and everywhere had closed. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no. - And I was like, </connor>
<connor> I can't order anything now. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna fucking eat a sembe or some shit. </connor>
<joey> - You gotta resort to fucking convenience store food. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I ate a sandwich and it was depressing. </connor>
<joey> You know how depressing it is eating a- </joey>
<joey> - It's depressing. </joey>
<joey> That's so depressing - Eating a- </joey>
<joey> - A sandwich at 9 PM. </joey>
<joey> - A large sandwich as a dinner? </joey>
<joey> Something about it is so depressing. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know why. - Yeah, I know. I know. </garnt>
<joey> It is- - A ham sandwich for dinner. </joey>
<garnt> - It is depressing. - Bon appetit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I say, having a meal to look forward to, </garnt>
<joey> I don't even mean like a five-star gomy meal. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. - Just like a good </joey>
<garnt> filling meal, even like a nice home-cooked meal. </garnt>
<connor> - Just something on a plate. </connor>
<joey> A decent thing on a plate. </joey>
<connor> - I tear up when I order a meal here and it's just- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I remember, going back to Uber Eats, </connor>
<garnt> I remember there's this Thai place I order from </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I'm like missing home or whatever, but like- </garnt>
<joey> - It's on the weekend? </joey>
<garnt> - I have no idea. - It's the really fun. </garnt>
<joey> Oh, I like it. - It's really fucking good. </joey>
<joey> I order from them like four times a week. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, same. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<joey> - (indistinct) is funny. </joey>
<joey> - That's a lot of Thai food. </joey>
<joey> - I never get sick of pad thai. </joey>
<garnt> - But like I get the craving every now and again, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I'm very picky when it comes to Thai food. </connor>
<connor> And my problem with this place is that </connor>
<connor> they never fucking make it spicy enough, </connor>
<connor> of course. - That is true. </connor>
<connor> There's no spice. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - As a Thai person, and I like every time, every time, </connor>
<joey> I'm sure they fucking know me by name now, </joey>
<joey> 'cause every time I'm just like, spicy, please spicy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you put it in like the comments? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I put it in the comments. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, spicy please and it's just never spicy enough. </connor>
<connor> I open it and I could tell that they put a few </connor>
<connor> chili flakes on it and- </connor>
<connor> - Just opens it, doesn't even smell, it's like, no. </connor>
<connor> - No, you can- </connor>
<connor> - Take it back. </connor>
<connor> - You can tell when someone didn't try </connor>
<joey> with the spice, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like there's Thai chilies </joey>
<joey> and then there's like chili flakes, and okay. </joey>
<joey> So like last week, this one time. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, let me try something different. </joey>
<connor> So I asked for it spicy again, right? </connor>
<connor> But I don't type it in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> I type it in Thai. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. - Oh. </connor>
<joey> - Big brain. Big brain. - Big brain. </joey>
<joey> - So, I typed it in Thai, okay. </joey>
<joey> And I remember opening it. </joey>
<joey> I remember getting the same takeaway box, </joey>
<joey> opening up this package, </joey>
<joey> and this thing looked like it had been cooked </joey>
<garnt> in like the flames of hell, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Fucking Lucifer grilled this himself. </garnt>
<garnt> I open it and like the chili to rice ratio was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was more Chili than rice. </garnt>
<joey> - Would you like rice on your chili? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Can you copy paste what you sent to him? </connor>
<garnt> I wanna see this. </garnt>
<connor> I wanna try this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, sure. </connor>
<garnt> I'd never been more happy in my life when-. </garnt>
<connor> - Was it good? </connor>
<connor> - It was good. </connor>
<connor> - Damn. Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I ordered the pad krapow </connor>
<garnt> and pad krapow is normally really, really spicy in Thailand. </garnt>
<joey> And you know it's spicy when you have to like, </joey>
<joey> you have trouble finding the meat through the chili, right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Because it's like you got the normal meat, </joey>
<joey> and then you got like the red and green chili flakes, </joey>
<joey> and not just chili, just like raw chilies. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like (claps) you're my brother. </joey>
<garnt> Now I know you're a brother. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck, this is like when we went </connor>
<connor> to the Indian place near here. </connor>
<connor> They do like Indian food, you know. </connor>
<joey> I think we'd always asked for it really spicy, </joey>
<joey> like very spicy. </joey>
<joey> And it was quite spicy, but it wasn't that bad. </joey>
<joey> And I think- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, to you guys' level? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I mean, you know, </joey>
<joey> even though I am extremely white, I love spice </joey>
<joey> that pretty much cripples me. </joey>
<joey> And yeah- - 'Cause to a standard person </joey>
<joey> like myself, that shit's spicy enough. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - But to these like, </connor>
<joey> fucking spawns of Satan, it's like- </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause in Japan, when you do you tell them </connor>
<joey> to make it like 10 or max, they don't do it. </joey>
<joey> And the first time we went there, the first few times, </joey>
<connor> the person who was cooking, it's always the same guy, </connor>
<connor> he didn't actually make it that spicy. </connor>
<connor> It was kinda like, ooh, ooh. </connor>
<joey> - It was definitely Japan standards, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was like high end for Japan standards, I'd say. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then one time, for some reason, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why he decided this time, </joey>
<joey> he was like, "Fine, I'm not playing." </joey>
<joey> - He's like, bet. </joey>
<joey> - He's like, "Fine, I'm not playing anymore." </joey>
<joey> And holy fuck! </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> This shit is hot. </joey>
<connor> I got like halfway through this and I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm actually in like severe pain. </connor>
<connor> Like this is actually brutal. </connor>
<connor> Garnt couldn't finish it. </connor>
<garnt> - Wow. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think it was the one week where you had to go home early. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So we're in this </connor>
<connor> Indian place. - This man dd not play. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he was not playing around. </connor>
<connor> And I think I could see him like </connor>
<connor> in the corner of my eye just like- </connor>
<joey> - He was watching us. - He was like watching us. </joey>
<joey> - He was giggling. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause we've been there so many times. </joey>
<joey> We order the same meal every time. </joey>
<joey> We order like the most spicy option. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> we finish it. - It's spicy but its not like. </connor>
<joey> - It's spicy. </joey>
<garnt> It's a nice tingle on your tongue. </garnt>
<joey> - What if he was like, "All right, the pussy boy is gone. </joey>
<garnt> I'ma give you guys the real shit now. </garnt>
<connor> - But it was by far the spiciest meal I've had in Japan. </connor>
<connor> I could not finish it 'cause it got to the point </connor>
<joey> where it was just, yeah- </joey>
<joey> - My mouth got numb about knit (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<joey> What is enjoyable about that, though? </joey>
<connor> I don't get it. - I don't know what it is, </connor>
<connor> because the flavors get enhanced by just beating </connor>
<connor> the shit out of it. - No, I get that </connor>
<joey> to a certain extent. </joey>
<joey> But the level you guys have, it, </joey>
<joey> it's just like, I don't even know what flavor is anymore. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I feel like it depends on the dish, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean you can go to like CoCoICHI, man, </garnt>
<garnt> and so to explain, have we talked about that before? </garnt>
<joey> - CoCoICHI is like a Japanese curry. </joey>
<garnt> - We have it in America. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, they do. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, and so you can go </joey>
<joey> to this curry chain in Japan and they have </joey>
<joey> like a spice scale from one to 10, </joey>
<joey> and like 10 is the most spiciest. </joey>
<connor> And I've had the 10 before, and so as Connor. </connor>
<connor> And for me it was actually like really spicy, </connor>
<connor> but it felt like- - There's no flavor. </connor>
<connor> It just felt like you're adding spice </connor>
<joey> for the sake of adding spice, right? </joey>
<garnt> There are some dishes that I feel are designed to be spicy. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not like flavor enhanced spice, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> It's just spice for the sake of spice. </joey>
<joey> - To me a mild curry, a mild Japanese curry at least, </joey>
<joey> is as good, if not better, </joey>
<joey> than some of the spicier versions. </joey>
<connor> But there are some like Thai dishes and Indian dishes </connor>
<connor> and Southeast Asian dishes where I feel </connor>
<connor> if you don't have enough spice to it, </connor>
<connor> there's missing a certain kick, </connor>
<connor> a certain flavor to it. - Yeah, I get that. </connor>
<garnt> - It brings out a lot of flavors, </garnt>
<joey> and also just a lot of endorphins from the pain. </joey>
<joey> - No, I get- </joey>
<connor> - I'm constantly chasing the high. </connor>
<connor> - I get the fact of like, you know, </connor>
<connor> the spice enhances the flavor and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've had my fair share </connor>
<connor> of Southeast Asian food and stuff like that, </connor>
<joey> which is quite spicy. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, oh, this is hard to eat, </joey>
<joey> but, God damn, this probably tastes way better </joey>
<joey> than without the spice. </joey>
<joey> And then there's your guys' level of spice. </joey>
<connor> - See the reason why I got into spicy food, </connor>
<joey> cause again, you have to bear in mind, </joey>
<joey> my parents thought like paprika was spicy. </joey>
<joey> So when I was growing up, we didn't really eat spicy food, </joey>
<joey> but when I started doing YouTube, </joey>
<connor> I started doing the like fucking stupid pepper challenges. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've done it so many times where I was like, </connor>
<connor> I could handle the Carolina Reaper like semi comfortably. </connor>
<connor> And I was like shit, spicy food isn't spicy anymore, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've just been eating these peppers raw </connor>
<connor> constantly for fucking YouTube challenges </connor>
<connor> and Twitch live streams. </connor>
<joey> So I got to the point where I was like, oh God, </joey>
<joey> this is like really good now. </joey>
<joey> I really like it. </joey>
<joey> Like having cabaneros on stuff is like perfect. </joey>
<joey> - No. See, because like- - I love that. </joey>
<connor> - When we're talking about CoCoICHI levels of spice, right? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause that's the easiest gauge when you're in Japan, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, what level of CoCoICHI can you do? </garnt>
<joey> You immediately know. </joey>
<joey> I can now do level three. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - But before, </joey>
<joey> like a couple of years ago, I couldn't even do level one. </joey>
<joey> That was back when Joey was wearing a diaper. </joey>
<joey> That's when I was wearing a diaper. </joey>
<connor> That's when I was a true pussy boy.. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like, you need something </connor>
<connor> You need at least like a two. - Yeah, right. </connor>
<joey> But you guys can say that because you're used to this, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you've been eating it for a while. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like even some foods where there's an option </garnt>
<garnt> to pick a spicy version, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't always pick the spicy version. </garnt>
<garnt> It very much depends on the dish </garnt>
<garnt> and whether it compliments it or not. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. Right. </joey>
<joey> I mean now I can do a level three and now I understand like, </joey>
<joey> oh, this is actually so much better with spice </joey>
<joey> to a certain degree. </joey>
<joey> But like I had to kind of slowly trick my brain </joey>
<joey> into thinking that, right? </joey>
<joey> Because if you had given me a level three spicy CoCoICHI </joey>
<joey> like two years ago, I would have been like, </joey>
<joey> what is this shit? </joey>
<joey> This isn't enjoyable at all. </joey>
<garnt> I seek enjoyment out of my meal and this was not enjoyable. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in severe pain. </garnt>
<garnt> But now I've like slowly started to appreciate the pain. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Right? </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Joey says getting a level three. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I say that getting a level three. </joey>
<joey> But for me that's- - I'm feeling those endorphins </joey>
<joey> Love that. - Yeah, honestly like to me </joey>
<joey> that's fucking painful, but like it's good painful. </joey>
<joey> And like now I'm finally starting to understand. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh, okay </joey>
<joey> These like other friends I knew who could eat </joey>
<joey> like level seven and eight, who I just thought were like, </joey>
<joey> absolutely fucking maniacs. </joey>
<joey> - Just like the noob anime characters, </joey>
<joey> like the (indistinct). </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, I kinda get it now. </garnt>
<garnt> - After my training, I'm slowly starting to get it now. </garnt>

<joey> - 'Cause we're not gonna do it. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you, Crunchyroll for sponsoring this anime podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> Back to the episode. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, it's really weird, right? </joey>
<joey> Because obviously you grew up in a Thai household, </joey>
<joey> eating spiced food all your life, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you think I would be the same, </joey>
<connor> 'cause my dad loves spicy food? </connor>
<connor> You know like the death sauce that they sell here? </connor>
<joey> My dad would just put that in meals. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - It's god stuff. - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> But to me, I was like, </joey>
<connor> why are you putting cyanide in a perfectly nice meal? </connor>
<connor> - Why would you poison this meal like this? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause then he would fucking serve it up to the family. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! - And we would have to eat it. </joey>
<connor> - That reminds me. </connor>
<joey> My older brother, he was growing Carolina Reapers and- </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's a good question. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like wanted, he likes spicy food. </connor>
<joey> But one time, this was right before I moved to Japan, </joey>
<joey> he gave them to my parents and just told them </joey>
<joey> they were like normal peppers. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my, why would you do that? </joey>
<connor> That is truly evil. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's a true crime story (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so what happened was is that, </connor>
<connor> they were like, oh yeah, they were saying like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, Brett's been growing some peppers </connor>
<connor> and he's given us some. </connor>
<connor> So I'm gonna put them in the stir fry tonight." </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh, okay, sure. </connor>
<joey> I didn't know that they were- </joey>
<joey> - Carolina Reapers. - They were Carolina Reapers, </joey>
<joey> or ghost peppers, one or the other. </joey>
<joey> I mean, they're both fucking- </joey>
<joey> - They're both fucking hot. </joey>
<joey> - Bear in mind, my parents do believe </joey>
<joey> that paprika is spicy, I'm not joking. </joey>
<connor> My dad watches the podcast. </connor>
<connor> He'll be like, "You're lying, Connor." </connor>
<connor> And so they made me, it's the way they did the stir fries. </connor>
<joey> They make it and they give it to me first </joey>
<joey> and then like they make it for my dad </joey>
<joey> and my mom makes for herself last. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, this is like five minutes in between. </joey>
<joey> So I'm eating this stir fry and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> I'm getting kinda like. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, this hurts. </connor>
<connor> And I'm thinking like, oh, whoa, mum, </connor>
<connor> what peppers did you use? </connor>
<connor> - She's like, "Oh, this is your brother. </connor>
<connor> He grew them and gave them to us." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, did he say what kind of peppers they were? </connor>
<connor> So, "No, no, he just said he grew them." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, they got a little kick to them. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like, I think I got a bit of kick it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like (wheezing). </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they put all of them in, like seven or eight. </connor>
<connor> - All of them. - Oh my fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - Seven or eight ghost peppers, all of them. </connor>
<joey> - Your brother was trying to kill your parents. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - My parents didn't know. </joey>
<connor> They thought they were like the normal spicy- </connor>
<joey> - Wait, did your parents eat them? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so what happened next is that, </connor>
<connor> you know, I warned them. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I really think, bear in mind, I'm like, (coughs) </connor>
<connor> I really think that you should like go easy </connor>
<connor> on the peppers on yours. </connor>
<connor> If you can like kinda get them out a little bit, </connor>
<connor> I think you should do that. </connor>
<connor> Like, "No, no, it's fine, we've had it before. </connor>
<garnt> We've had these peppers before." </garnt>
<garnt> - Pictures taken before a disaster. </garnt>
<connor> - At that point I was like, you know what? </connor>
<joey> Fine, let's just see what happens. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Let's just see what happens. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Let's just see how this unfolds. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm there like literally like that meme of that kid </connor>
<joey> with the vein on his forehead </joey>
<joey> after just eating these peppers, </joey>
<joey> trying to keep a straight face like. </joey>
<joey> And my daddy he's about to eat it. </joey>
<joey> He takes one spoonful and he's like, yeah. (coughs) </joey>
<connor> "Wow that's pretty. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's really spicy, huh, why?" (laughs) </joey>
<connor> And he just started crying. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was so funny. </connor>
<connor> And my mom thought he was over-exaggerating. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. - So my mom is like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I'll try it too." </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And my mom starts doing the exact same thing. </connor>
<connor> She starts fucking go (coughs), after like one bite. </connor>
<connor> And they just couldn't finish it. </connor>
<connor> They just started drinking milk for like 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> - What do they expect? - They were just dying. </connor>
<connor> It was the funniest, I don't know. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if I was your parents, I'd take one look at you </joey>
<joey> and be like, oh, he's probably not making this shit up. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I thought they thought I was exaggerating </connor>
<joey> with how much spice I could deal. </joey>
<joey> And I was texting my brother after I ate a bite. </joey>
<joey> I was like, what the fuck are these peppers? </joey>
<joey> What peppers are these? </joey>
<connor> What are these, habaneros, ghost peppers? </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Oh, Carolina Reaper." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why would you give them to my parents? </connor>
<connor> You know they can't eat these. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Your parents, is just (indistinct) innit? </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Casually killed mum and dad. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Your parents trusted you too much. </joey>
<joey> - I think from that point I would say </joey>
<connor> I just never accepted any peppers from my parents, </connor>
<connor> 'cause- (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I wouldn't. </connor>
<joey> Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I saw them and I thought, oh God, </joey>
<joey> they look like ghost peppers. </joey>
<joey> - Some interesting shaped peppers you got there. </joey>
<joey> - They don't look like the store, the thin green ones. </joey>
<joey> They've got like the big plump, like the shrivel light ones. </joey>
<garnt> - Like Satan's toe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - What's the spiciest thing </garnt>
<garnt> you've had? </garnt>
<connor> - I'd probably say habanero. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, other than the fucking like death sauce </connor>
<connor> they're like, you know, the- </connor>
<joey> - Wait, have you ever eaten like a Carolina Reaper or like- </joey>
<joey> - Like a ghost pepper. - No, why would I do that. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, we need to do that. </connor>
<connor> - No. - YouTube challenge. </connor>
<connor> - Why would I do that? </connor>
<connor> - Because it'll be fun. </connor>
<connor> - No, no one would want... </connor>
<joey> For you. - Let's build up </joey>
<connor> your tolerance. </connor>
<joey> - For you guys it would be. </joey>
<connor> - It's not that bad. </connor>
<garnt> People on YouTube just- </garnt>
<garnt> - Trial by fire. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Trial by fire. </garnt>
<joey> Trial by fire. Trial by fire. </joey>
<connor> - Why did I teach them that phrase? </connor>
<joey> - People on YouTube when I watched it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I think I first saw Rhett and Link do it </joey>
<joey> back in like 2012, and they were like. (pants) </joey>
<connor> It's not that bad. </connor>
<connor> It is just discomfort. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Why would I willingly put myself into discomfort? </joey>
<joey> - Shit makes great content. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Fuck you want me there. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Who doesn't love killing themselves for content? </garnt>
<joey> - You've eaten like monster ramen, (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> That's way worse. - How did you know? </joey>
<connor> How did you know I'll do anything for content? (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause you're a YouTuber. </joey>
<joey> - That's how YouTubers' minds work, right? </joey>
<joey> - You got me there. </joey>
<connor> - I won't do it. - You got me there. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, we're gonna film it? </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna film it? </joey>
<garnt> Okay, okay. - All right, </garnt>
<joey> next "Trash Taste" special </joey>
<joey> The winner doesn't have to eat a Carolina Reaper. </joey>
<joey> The two losers do. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, that's gonna be the hardest run </joey>
<joey> to a W in my existence. (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.. </connor>
<connor> - And then if it's one of us, we have to eat three, </connor>
<connor> and you have to eat one. </connor>
<joey> - So I'm eating one either way? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> - Let's say you win, me and Garnt have to eat three. </connor>
<connor> - Yep. </connor>
<connor> - But that's not gonna do anything to you guys. </connor>
<garnt> - No, three will fuck me up. - Three will. Three will. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - All right. Fine. </connor>
<connor> - I'ma be high as fuck. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> On those endorphins - The endorphins like </connor>
<connor> mess with your head, man. - It does, it does. </connor>
<connor> - I remember like the first time, </connor>
<connor> like the first time I probably had a ghost pepper </connor>
<joey> or a Trinidad Tobago or a Carolina Reaper, the spice high. </joey>
<joey> I thought I'd heard about it before, </joey>
<joey> but I didn't realize it was literally like getting high. </joey>
<joey> And you feel the after effects for like hours afterwards, </joey>
<connor> because you feel this like warm, tingly glow, </connor>
<connor> and you just feel like you did something nice </connor>
<connor> and you're like, ooh, </connor>
<connor> what's going on. - Its when the initial </connor>
<joey> 20 minutes of pain is over, </joey>
<joey> it's pretty nice. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I kinda- </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne looks very unimpressed and unconvinced. </connor>
<joey> - I mean- - It's great. </joey>
<connor> - It is great. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I've had death sauce (indistinct) </joey>
<garnt> which is technically ghost pepper sauce. </garnt>
<joey> - But like it's- - It's (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, if we're talking like just raw peppers, </joey>
<joey> I've only done having habanero. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the spiciest thing, </garnt>
<garnt> like singler thing I've ever had was back in university </garnt>
<connor> where it wasn't even like a ghost pepper, </connor>
<connor> it was a ghost pepper extract. - Oh, yeah, the extract. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, the extract shit. - Which is like, even more. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't like a sauce. </joey>
<joey> - It's concentrated ghost pepper. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, it was just like the pure extract. </joey>
<connor> And I'd never like, at this point, </connor>
<connor> I'd obviously like still grown up on spicy food, </connor>
<connor> but I'd never had like a ghost pepper or like a natural, </connor>
<connor> one of the famous hot peppers </connor>
<connor> that people do YouTube challenges about. </connor>
<connor> So I remember we were drinking and my mate, </connor>
<joey> he had this ghost pepper extract </joey>
<joey> that he was like daring people to do. </joey>
<joey> - He's just carrying it around, was he? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, he's that asshole. </connor>
<connor> - He was like that guy. </connor>
<connor> He was the guy you. </connor>
<joey> You know the guy who would show people, </joey>
<joey> the two girls one cup kind of videos. </joey>
<joey> - We all had that one friend. </joey>
<joey> - Like the pain Olympics. </joey>
<joey> He was that friend. - Oh, God. </joey>
<garnt> - So of course, he had this </garnt>
<garnt> ghost pepper extract. - I was that friend. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - (indistinct) only fan I will go to see was recently, </joey>
<joey> which I found really funny. </joey>
<joey> - What was that? </joey>
<connor> - You (indistinct) go to was like two weeks ago. </connor>
<connor> I Didn't know what it was. </connor>
<garnt> And if you don't know what it is, </garnt>
<garnt> please don't look it up. - Don't look it up, please. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is someone's cheeks being spread. </garnt>
<connor> That's all you need to know. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah so he had this ghost pepper extract, </garnt>
<garnt> and of course we were drinking as you were at university. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - And it had gotten to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where we were like tipsy enough to start </garnt>
<garnt> contemplating doing stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. - And, of course, </garnt>
<garnt> you know he's- </garnt>
<connor> - Gonna commit credit card fraud. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you know he's an experienced friend </garnt>
<garnt> where he brings it out at the exactly the right time </garnt>
<garnt> of the night where everyone's intoxicated enough </garnt>
<connor> to think that it's a good idea to- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - What a horrible mate. </connor>
<garnt> What a fucking... (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> What a horrible friend. </garnt>
<connor> Just waiting till everyone is just semi-stupid </connor>
<connor> so that he starts feeding them poison. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> So he brings out this extract and he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, I dare anyone to fucking do this," right? </connor>
<joey> And I see people doing it. </joey>
<joey> And they're taking like the tiniest, </joey>
<joey> the tiniest little drop, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's not even a drop, </joey>
<joey> it's like less than a drop, right. </joey>
<joey> And I see people fucking dying. </joey>
<joey> And me being like, yo, yo- </joey>
<connor> - The giga Chad that I am. </connor>
<connor> - These weak ass white guys don't know their fucking spice. </connor>
<connor> Look at all these guys, right? </connor>
<connor> And so I say, it gets to my turn, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, I'll show you how man does it. </connor>
<connor> So like there's- </connor>
<connor> - Famous last words. - You've never ever </connor>
<connor> said that out loud. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> That is not a guy phrase. </connor>
<connor> - No, if there's one thing I was confident over </connor>
<connor> it's taking fucking splice level. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think you'd ever say, and I quote, </garnt>
<connor> "Let me show you how a man does it." </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So how the extract works is you have this </garnt>
<connor> tiny little spoon, right? </connor>
<connor> That you can like put like one little drip on. </connor>
<joey> So I fill up the spoon and I just fucking </joey>
<joey> shove it in my mouth. - Oh, no. </joey>
<joey> - What's wrong with you? </joey>
<joey> Why would you do that? - I did not know </joey>
<joey> how spicy it was, right? </joey>
<joey> And I never knew that I could literally feel </joey>
<connor> like I've been shot in the face until I like... </connor>
<connor> It was just the biggest instant regret moment on my life. </connor>
<connor> Normally you see people taking like, </connor>
<joey> they take the Caroline Reaper, they chew on it, </joey>
<joey> and there's like this delay, right? </joey>
<joey> No, there was not- </joey>
<joey> - It's like instant. </joey>
<joey> - There was not a single delay. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, my body went into like </connor>
<connor> fight or flight mode immediately. </connor>
<connor> Like I was fine. </connor>
<connor> I took it and then like five seconds later, </connor>
<connor> I swear I was in the fucking fetal position, just like, </connor>
<connor> ah, ah! </connor>
<connor> Oh God, it hurts so much. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna try this now, this sounds fun. </connor>
<joey> - It' okay. - What do you what? </joey>
<joey> What are you on? </joey>
<joey> - It's interesting, I'd like to try that. </joey>
<joey> - I will say, I do not recommend it. </joey>
<garnt> As someone who can handle my spice, I literally- </garnt>
<joey> - It was nice taking, don't worry. </joey>
<joey> - It was not a pleasant experience. </joey>
<connor> - I was always that kid who saw "Jackass" I was like, </connor>
<connor> I wanna do that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Because what happened is I was out of commission </garnt>
<connor> for the entire night. </connor>
<connor> - Of course you were. - Because it was so spicy </connor>
<connor> that it just induced my gag reflex. </connor>
<connor> So I was on the toilet, </connor>
<connor> I was like in the bathroom for like a good three hours </connor>
<connor> just like gagging on the toilet. </connor>
<connor> Couldn't throw up, it was just like my gag reflex just like, </connor>
<connor> my body trying to throw up this thing </connor>
<connor> that was like one little drop. </connor>
<connor> There was nothing to throw up, it was like a drop, right? </connor>
<garnt> But it had induced this gag reflex and I was on the toilet </garnt>
<connor> for about three hours. </connor>
<garnt> And my university mates being the good mates that they were, </garnt>
<garnt> they just kinda went clubbing. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - And just left you. </connor>
<connor> - They just left you while you were on the toilet. </connor>
<connor> - What fantastic mates you have there, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - What a fantastic group of mates. </connor>
<connor> I mean that's why I'm not friends with them anymore. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Long story short, I'm not in contact </connor>
<garnt> with any of my uni mates anymore, but- </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not in contact with many either, </connor>
<garnt> but they didn't poison me. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> They were nice to me. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Maybe what if it was all a ruse, Garnt, </joey>
<connor> where they all agreed to take small amounts of this </connor>
<connor> just so that Garnt would step up to the play </connor>
<joey> and be like, let me show you </joey>
<connor> how it's done. - They're all like, </connor>
<joey> "We wanna go clubbing but we dont wanna take Garnt. </joey>
<joey> How can we knock him out? </joey>
<joey> - Let's get him out of commission. </joey>
<joey> I know a way. </joey>
<connor> I know a way that Garnt would fall through. </connor>
<garnt> I think that's what they did Garnt, maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> - The spice challenge. </garnt>
<connor> I think I've read that no one has ever died </connor>
<connor> from spice before or like- </connor>
<connor> - You could go into shock though, Garnt, I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Meilyne, look it up. </connor>
<garnt> Has anyone ever died from spice? </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they can go into shock. </connor>
<garnt> You can't die from the chemical itself, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can die from shock. </garnt>
<joey> - You can die from the pain it induces. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Which is shock, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - you can get cardiac arrest. </connor>
<connor> But its always fun. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically just don't do something stupid like- </garnt>
<connor> - You could go into cardiac arrest. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Doctors hate it. </connor>
<connor> - Just get better arteries. </connor>
<garnt> - Ten ways to stop heart attack. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't go under cardiac arrest. - Just don't take </garnt>
<garnt> ghost pepper extract, or any kind of extracts. </garnt>
<connor> - I wasn't going to, and I think I'm still not going to. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I think that's, (indistinct). (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I'm good. (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - You can stop breathing. </connor>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] You can stop breathing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Just manually pump those bitches, just like. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Garnt, CPR me. </joey>
<garnt> I feel like my lungs stopped. </garnt>
<connor> - It was just like that scene from fucking "Pulp Fiction," </connor>
<connor> where I just passed out and they have to get </connor>
<garnt> the fucking needle and inject it straight into my heart. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bam! (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, that's so scary. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. - Oh, God. </joey>
<connor> - My God. </connor>
<joey> - So I'm just gonna take it one step at a time </joey>
<connor> when it comes to spice. </connor>
<connor> I'm doing a pretty good job going up the ladder, I feel. </connor>
<connor> - Just wondering about CPR, I just, sorry, </connor>
<joey> 'cause it just let's just talk about (indistinct) my chest, </joey>
<joey> I feel I'm too British to do CPR. </joey>
<connor> I feel I'd be like, are you okay? </connor>
<connor> Are you okay? </connor>
<connor> Is this too much? </connor>
<connor> Is this too much pressure? </connor>
<connor> While I'm trying to save their life. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, one, oh is that- </connor>
<garnt> - Do you know how to do CPR? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, so I was a lifeguard so we had to do it. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. - Oh, that's right. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Yeah. - Luckily, I always stop </joey>
<joey> those little before they stopped breathing. </joey>
<joey> - Did you ever have to like do it? </joey>
<joey> - No, God know. </joey>
<connor> - You'd know which kids were gonna drown </connor>
<connor> right before they walked in. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> 100%. </connor>
<joey> - Why? How do you know. - I wish I was joking. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I might as well just tell stories </joey>
<connor> about being a lifeguard </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just so fucking, so many. </connor>
<connor> So basically whilst I was working at McDonald's, </connor>
<joey> I wanted to be a lifeguard 'cause, well, I could swim and- </joey>
<connor> - It's a good start. </connor>
<connor> - I was a really strong swimmer </connor>
<connor> and there was a course that I did that took about a week. </connor>
<connor> And it was really weird to have to do, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I had to sacrifice a week of school vacation. </connor>
<joey> So I only had one week and I spent it </joey>
<joey> learning how to be a lifeguard. </joey>
<joey> I paid like 400 bucks and then I couldn't get a job </joey>
<joey> for like a year and a half 'cause they were all like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, you don't have experience," 'cause I was like 17. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that catch-22. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right, they didn't hire me. </joey>
<joey> But eventually, 'cause it paid really well. </joey>
<joey> At the time McDonald's paid me four pounds, 10 an hour, </joey>
<connor> which is this much in dollars, </connor>
<connor> and the lifeguarding paid nine pounds, 10 an hour. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow. - Which at the time- </connor>
<garnt> - That's a minted job. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the thing was you had to have a week of training. </connor>
<joey> You'd pay for it all- </joey>
<joey> - That's a double shift at McDonald's right there. </joey>
<joey> - On paper, it looks like an easy ass job, </joey>
<joey> because all you have to do is sit there for 30 minutes </joey>
<joey> and then you get a 20-minute break. </joey>
<joey> Then you sit there for 30 minutes, </joey>
<joey> you get a 20-minute break. </joey>
<joey> And that was it basically. </joey>
<joey> But when you're new, they put you on the, at least mine did, </joey>
<joey> they put me on the shifts </joey>
<connor> where it was a kid's birthday parties. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause my mom's swam at that pool, </connor>
<connor> and they never put me on the shift with the old people, </connor>
<connor> 'cause old people don't drown. </connor>
<connor> Old people know, </connor>
<connor> because they swim. - They know their limits. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause they all go to the swimming club </joey>
<joey> all the time and they're not going to, </joey>
<joey> apart from like freak accidents, which never happened. </joey>
<joey> And like people don't drown in pools in the UK. </joey>
<joey> The year that I became a lifeguard, </joey>
<joey> zero people died from pools in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's good. </joey>
<joey> - So, it doesn't happen. </joey>
<connor> Why are you laughing Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> Until I started the job. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But like, okay, so have you ever seen those floats </connor>
<connor> that take up all the pool? </connor>
<joey> - Like on the lanes and stuff, or? </joey>
<joey> - The whole pool. </joey>
<connor> It's like a big inflatable. </connor>
<connor> - I've never seen that. - Yeah, I've seen those. </connor>
<connor> - You've never seen these. </connor>
<connor> You have seen these, Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> You haven't seen these? </connor>
<connor> Google it. </connor>
<connor> It's like the picture on screen. </connor>
<connor> Literally they're these massive kind of like </connor>
<joey> total wipe out ass courses that you can inflate </joey>
<joey> and they take up the whole pool. </joey>
<joey> And if you fall off, you fall in the water. </joey>
<joey> It's great. Dude, it's bad. - That sounds fun as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - When I was a kid, I loved the kid who- </joey>
<joey> - That sounds like a "Trash Taste" special </joey>
<joey> waiting to happen, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Imagine like a bouncy house on water. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds fun as fuck. </joey>
<connor> What the fuck? - No dude, it is. </connor>
<connor> - A bouncy house? - Imagine a total wipe out </connor>
<connor> obstacle course on water. </connor>
<connor> Dude, it's bad. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, when I was 12, I loved this shit. </connor>
<joey> - Can we do that? </joey>
<joey> - Dude, we can go. - Yeah, I wanna. </joey>
<joey> - We can probably rent out a pool. </joey>
<connor> - Hell yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Go back to the UK, we're gonna rent one. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So like you could, basically for kids' birthday parties, </connor>
<joey> there'll be like a five or six-year-old who'd rent it out. </joey>
<joey> Now, problem is with kids' birthday parties, </joey>
<joey> is that not every parent thinks that kids </joey>
<joey> need to be taught how to swim. </joey>
<joey> - Right. Right. </joey>
<joey> - I think 'cause parents forget that kids </joey>
<joey> need to be taught how to swim. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you just take it for granted. </joey>
<joey> So what ends up happening is, obviously, </joey>
<joey> it's a birthday party. </joey>
<joey> Everyone invites the whole class. </joey>
<joey> Now, half the kids in the class don't know how to swim, </joey>
<joey> but they still are invited and go anyway. </joey>
<joey> So, you know, I'd be sitting that on my thing </joey>
<connor> and I can tell immediately, </connor>
<connor> which one of these kids can't swim. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, they looked like that Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that looks fun as fuck. </joey>
<connor> What the hell? - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So they'd be like- </joey>
<joey> - Next special. - They'd be like </joey>
<joey> a climbing thing and then you have to go through pylons </joey>
<joey> then there's a slide at the end. </joey>
<joey> Now, you could tell immediately when you look at these kids, </joey>
<joey> which couldn't swim. </joey>
<joey> They just had a look in their eyes </joey>
<joey> where they were like, fuck! </joey>
<joey> I've never been in this before. </joey>
<joey> What do I do? </joey>
<joey> - And that's a big like thing of water. </joey>
<joey> - Because they're also, you know, </joey>
<garnt> kids are like that thing where like most kids </garnt>
<garnt> have like a built in danger system where they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like heights, right? </garnt>
<joey> Kids know that they're scared of heights. </joey>
<joey> Kids know that water is like weird and scary. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then the kids that run in it right away, </joey>
<joey> normally like they can swim. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But so you'd be doing this thing and there'd be kids. </joey>
<joey> And then you'd see this kid, you can just tell, again. </joey>
<joey> You can tell he doesn't look confident, right? </joey>
<joey> He's techniques poor. </joey>
<joey> Looking at the water really scared. </joey>
<connor> - Like toe first into the water, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So they climb on this thing, and bear in mind, </connor>
<joey> it starts at the shallow end and it goes to the deep end </joey>
<joey> where you get off. </joey>
<joey> And then we're talking like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> like two meters deep. </joey>
<garnt> No, no more than that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like five meters deep. </garnt>
<garnt> - Five meters? - Five meters deep </garnt>
<garnt> at the pool I worked at. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's pretty fucking deep </garnt>
<garnt> for a kids pool. - That's like a diving pool. </garnt>
<garnt> - These kids would just walk, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And then they'd get to the end of this obstacle course </garnt>
<connor> and you could see it that they were like, what do I do? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Everyone else is going down the slide </connor>
<connor> and they're being egged on by their friends. </connor>
<connor> And they just go down the slide and they would just go down. </connor>
<joey> - They just sink. </joey>
<joey> - They just sunk. </joey>
<joey> They didn't come back up. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> They wouldn't come back up. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking hell. - And you would wait </joey>
<connor> like two seconds just to like make sure (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> Just to make sure they don't come back up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then you have two choices. </connor>
<connor> You can either jump in or you can get a really long pole </connor>
<connor> and like poke them with it and hope they. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) - Get up. </connor>
<joey> - Well, normally- - Let's just hope </joey>
<joey> they're still alive. </joey>
<connor> - Hello? Hello, again. </connor>
<connor> - So basically, if a kid is splashing around to be like, ah, </connor>
<joey> you just give him a pole and he'll grab it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like grab on to it. - Yes, they'll grab on. </joey>
<joey> They'll grab onto anything, right? </joey>
<joey> But if they don't swim and they just sink, </joey>
<connor> which is like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> Ah, I gotta fucking go in. </connor>
<connor> So then I have to go in. </connor>
<connor> And this should happen like three or four times </connor>
<connor> sometimes in like one session. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking hell. - Cause these kids </connor>
<connor> are just terrible. </connor>
<joey> Sometimes I would go and jump in, I would get a kid. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, what are you doing? </joey>
<joey> Stop, don't go near the deep end. </joey>
<joey> And then he would go and he would go near it again. </joey>
<joey> And I'd blow the whistle back, what are you doing? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then I look away for a second, I look back, </joey>
<joey> he's at the deep end again, jumps in, drowns again. </joey>
<joey> I have to go in and get him. </joey>
<joey> And tell his parents off, and his parents have a go at me </joey>
<joey> and complained to my manager saying that </joey>
<joey> it's not my place to tell her what to teach her kids. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, it's not my place. </joey>
<joey> I can just let your kid drown, huh? </joey>
<joey> See what happens. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck? - She went full Karen mode </joey>
<joey> on me, trying to get me fired. </joey>
<joey> 'cause I bollocked her in front of her- </joey>
<joey> - What, because you saved their kid? </joey>
<joey> - After I saved his kid twice, </joey>
<joey> I held his hand and I was like, come, where's your mom? </joey>
<joey> Show me where your mom is? </joey>
<joey> And then we went to his mom. </joey>
<joey> - Where's your mom. (claps) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, </joey>
<connor> what are you doing? - What are you doing? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was like why are you letting this kid into this pool </connor>
<joey> without any arm bands or anything? </joey>
<joey> - And she's like, oh- - Like didn't have </joey>
<joey> any floaties or anything. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> Why didn't they have armbands? </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what her reason was? </garnt>
<garnt> She was like, I don't want him to feel </garnt>
<joey> like he's the weird one, the one who can't swim. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like- </joey>
<joey> - But he's the one who can't swim. </joey>
<joey> - That's because he can't swim. </joey>
<joey> He will fucking drown. </joey>
<joey> Do you understand how this works? </joey>
<joey> I'm like, did you ever teach him how to swim? </joey>
<joey> "No." </joey>
<joey> Why are you letting him do this? </joey>
<joey> This is really irresponsible. </joey>
<joey> And then I just left. </joey>
<joey> And this was in front of all her friends, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they had like a (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> And then she complained saying, </connor>
<connor> I didn't need to do that in front of all her friends. </connor>
<connor> It was really inappropriate of me. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I'm sorry, but you saw your kid drown once </connor>
<connor> and thought, "Oh, I'll let him keep swimming. </connor>
<connor> I let him keep going." </connor>
<connor> That really me off. </connor>
<connor> I'm still really annoyed about that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's just fucking irresponsible. </connor>
<garnt> - That just sounds like bad parenting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's terrible parenting. </garnt>
<garnt> The people who do stuff like they would just let </garnt>
<joey> their kids do- </joey>
<joey> - Unless the parent was like, "Fuck, I've been trying </joey>
<connor> to get rid of him." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - The fuck! - Sabotaged again. </joey>
<connor> - That insurance plan. </connor>
<joey> Damn, its really expensive monthly. </joey>
<joey> - That's a really lay abortion plan. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] We have it in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Do they? Wow! </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God! Look at that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that looks amazing. </joey>
<garnt> Can you send that picture when you're done. </garnt>
<joey> - Get ready. Next special. </joey>
<connor> Were fucking doing it. </connor>
<garnt> - Doesn't this look amazing? </garnt>
<connor> - Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, it was a really good job other than that. </connor>
<joey> It's just like kids that just like don't know how to swim </joey>
<joey> and you can tell a moment they can't swim. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah, also if you ever tried to, </joey>
<joey> sometimes if you'd, they taught you </joey>
<joey> and I never thought I'd have to use this. </joey>
<joey> They teach you how to kick someone off you. </joey>
<connor> if they're like trying to drag you down. </connor>
<connor> - If you're trying to save someone, right? </connor>
<connor> - Don't drag me, you're coming with me. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause some people when they think their drowning </garnt>
<garnt> they panic, and what they do is that they push you down. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Cause they think, </connor>
<joey> I wanna get up. </joey>
<joey> And, you know, it's not like a selfish thing </joey>
<connor> where they're like, "Fuck you." </connor>
<connor> - I'm dying and you're dying with me. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah literally, it's like instincts kick in for them </garnt>
<connor> and they think I'm gonna push you down to get up </connor>
<connor> so I can breath. </connor>
<connor> - What was the technique? </connor>
<connor> - So what you do is- </connor>
<connor> - Just like aim for the head. </connor>
<garnt> - No. ( laughing) </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> So if they're trying to like grab on to you </connor>
<connor> and push you down, you grab them by the arms and like, </connor>
<connor> so let's say you're equal now in the water, </connor>
<joey> we're both on top of the (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> You grab them and like you go down under the water, </joey>
<joey> kick them up and kick them off you. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - You push them away. </joey>
<joey> And then you usually just grab them by the face when you- </joey>
<connor> - What are you doing? </connor>
<connor> - I'm not kidding. </connor>
<connor> When you save someone, </connor>
<connor> you're supposed to grab them by the chin like this </connor>
<connor> and like pull them. </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit! </connor>
<connor> - Or you can, there's some other ways, </connor>
<connor> but that's the easiest, </connor>
<connor> 'cause that way you can kinda just do it at your own pace. </connor>
<connor> There's other ways that you can grab them, </connor>
<joey> but that's really awkward. </joey>
<joey> It depends like how big they are. </joey>
<joey> And if it's like a child, </joey>
<connor> like sometimes grabbing them by the face </connor>
<connor> might be a bit much. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Fuck! Get over here. </connor>
<connor> - Get over here. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I just imagine you like you're wielding children, </joey>
<connor> grabbing in the face. (groans) </connor>
<connor> (roars) </connor>
<connor> - You know the worst thing, when you... </connor>
<connor> This is the thing that you don't really think about </connor>
<joey> is that you don't bring spare uniforms, </joey>
<joey> 'cause that's really your thing. </joey>
<connor> So if you go in and you save a kid </connor>
<joey> and it's still your shift, </joey>
<joey> you just go right back to the chair and you're soaking. </joey>
<joey> And you know, some people they take the time. </joey>
<joey> Like the first time I did it, </joey>
<joey> I thought I have to go in right away, </joey>
<joey> I have to save that life right away. </joey>
<joey> And I wouldn't take my shoes off or anything, </joey>
<joey> but then I realized all the people who are experienced, </joey>
<joey> they would just walk down slowly. </joey>
<joey> They would just take off their shoes and socks, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they knew they had time, </joey>
<joey> and they knew like it's a pool. </joey>
<joey> - They know they're gonna grab them right away. </joey>
<joey> So they're like, "I'm not getting my Nike Air Maxes wet. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck, bro. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) kid's drowning and they kinda like </joey>
<connor> start the timer. </connor>
<connor> - They sit down like this, right? </connor>
<connor> They see them like... </connor>
<joey> 'Cause if they're flailing, you got plenty of time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So they would just sit. </joey>
<joey> They'd like walk down really slowly like this </joey>
<joey> and they'd be like, "Okay." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Take the watch off like this, you know, like that. </joey>
<joey> Then they would go in to get them. </joey>
<joey> It was really funny. </joey>
<joey> I just thought it was really bizarre. </joey>
<joey> I was like, why did you do that? </joey>
<joey> Isn't that like bad? </joey>
<joey> They're like, "No, no, no. </joey>
<connor> They're not gonna drown. </connor>
<joey> - They're not gonna drown </joey>
<joey> - I know the average time it takes for a human to drown. </joey>
<joey> - Again, the moment I feel worried </joey>
<joey> is if they don't come back up. </joey>
<joey> That's when you have to like immediately go in. </joey>
<joey> So that was like, that was fine. </joey>
<joey> And again, this like never happened ever. </joey>
<joey> This was only with little kids, 'cause little kids are dumb. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I make out these stories </joey>
<joey> to be a lot more exciting than they are. </joey>
<joey> In general, the job was extremely boring. </joey>
<joey> Like it is one of the hardest jobs to do </joey>
<joey> just out of sheer insanity. </joey>
<joey> You sit there for 30 minutes at a time, </joey>
<joey> just watching people swim. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Then you take a 20-minute break </connor>
<connor> and then you'd go back to it, </connor>
<connor> and this is like for like six hours. </connor>
<connor> You're just watching people swim. </connor>
<connor> And at first it's such a weird thing to do, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I'm like, yo, what do people get a problem with me </joey>
<joey> like staring at them while they're swimming? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like, you don't stare at people (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> But you're gonna watch the pool, right? </connor>
<connor> But then you're like, fuck, </connor>
<connor> is it weird that I'm looking at people, </connor>
<connor> like there's Parents watching me. </connor>
<connor> What if they think I'm looking at their kid too much? </connor>
<connor> But I'm just making sure that they're not drowning, okay? </connor>
<joey> It's not weird, right? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Well, according to (indistinct)- </joey>
<connor> I wasn't even thinking about that until he said it. </connor>
<connor> - This is the thing, these are the thoughts you have </connor>
<connor> when you're going insane </connor>
<connor> sitting there for six hours thinking like, is it weird? </connor>
<connor> Is it weird that I'm looking at everyone for this long? </connor>
<connor> I'm going insane. - Sounds like </connor>
<joey> an existential crisis. </joey>
<joey> What is my job? </joey>
<joey> - I legitimately started like going insane working there. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was like, you have to just think </joey>
<joey> so much. - How long did you do that? </joey>
<joey> - God, about just under a year </joey>
<joey> and then I moved away. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I got that job from doing a different job, </joey>
<joey> which I talked about at different times. </joey>
<joey> Just completely different and it was really funny as well. </joey>
<joey> But like lifeguarding in general it was like super boring, </joey>
<connor> but the pay was really good </connor>
<joey> 'cause you have to get the qualification. </joey>
<connor> And you have to be taught a lot of stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah you're there to save lives. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah and the course is quite hard, </connor>
<joey> and you have to redo it every year. </joey>
<joey> And so I can't be a lifeguard now 'cause I didn't renew it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - But for the one year it was fine. </joey>
<joey> I mean the pay was insane </joey>
<garnt> for like being 18 and (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel like learning the basic first aid skills </garnt>
<connor> is really fucking important. - Yeah, it was really helpful. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I was never taught it at all. </connor>
<connor> - We don't get taught in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, we don't get taught, </connor>
<garnt> so I don't know how to do CPR. </garnt>
<connor> They come in once and they're like, push the chest and blow. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh we- </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't even get that. </joey>
<joey> I didn't even get that. - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - We taught it every year during high school. </joey>
<joey> - I do not know how to do </joey>
<connor> the fucking Heimlich maneuver only. </connor>
<connor> - I need to learn that as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - We just have to learn all the basics- </connor>
<connor> - I should probably learn it now </connor>
<garnt> because it's gonna be real awkward if I'm gonna be like, </garnt>
<connor> hold on, let me just bring up this YouTube tutorial </connor>
<connor> for a second. </connor>
<connor> All right, wait, wait, </connor>
<connor> I got an unskippable ad. </connor>
<joey> - It's sponsored. It's sponsored. </joey>
<joey> - I've got an unskippable ad. </joey>
<garnt> Hold on a second. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Wifi. Where's the Wifi? </joey>
<connor> - A lot of aspects of the job were fun, but not many. </connor>
<joey> I had to like clean as well, </joey>
<joey> like clean all the toilets and showers, </joey>
<connor> which was like, I mean, I didn't know I was gonna do that. </connor>
<joey> - Glad you spent 400 bucks to clean toilets. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - You know, you're there and when you're wrapping up </connor>
<connor> and there's no one left in the pool, </connor>
<joey> you just start cleaning </joey>
<joey> 'cause that's what you're supposed to do, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then sometimes I had to like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause even though I wasn't teaching the kids, </joey>
<joey> but for the kids who are like one year old, </joey>
<joey> they're learning how to swim, </joey>
<joey> there had to be someone in the water constantly with them. </joey>
<joey> - Right. Right. </joey>
<joey> - And those kids just fucking like don't let go of you. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, no, get off me you little shit </joey>
<joey> It's like WrestleMania with like babies. </joey>
<connor> It's like, get off me. </connor>
<connor> You're supposed to learn how to swim. </connor>
<connor> - But the moment they let go of the wall they're like. </connor>
<joey> And they suddenly gained the grip strength </joey>
<joey> of like a grown man. </joey>
<connor> It was just, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it was all right job, really? </connor>
<connor> It just paid well, but- </connor>
<joey> - The kids at the pool were scary. </joey>
<connor> - Just kids, man. </connor>
<connor> Kids fucking suck. </connor>
<connor> And if your kid can't swim, teach them how to swim. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like when did you guys learn how to swim? </garnt>
<connor> - My mom like swims competitively and still does. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I swear God and Andrea knows. </connor>
<connor> So she still does like triathlons and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit. - And she's one of the fastest </connor>
<connor> women in her area and she's like nearly 55 </connor>
<connor> or something like that. - Damn. </connor>
<connor> - She's a beast. </connor>
<joey> She's so much more healthy than me. </joey>
<joey> It's so sad. </joey>
<joey> When I go back home and she wants to like go on a bike ride, </joey>
<joey> I'm like dying and she's like just breezing it. </joey>
<joey> - A causal 50K bike ride? </joey>
<connor> Let's go. - No, that's what she does. </connor>
<garnt> She's like 50K bike ride? </garnt>
<garnt> Nothing. </garnt>
<connor> - Did she watch the cycling special. </connor>
<connor> I thought I raised you better? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, she's like, "Pathetic, Connor." </connor>
<connor> No, no, no. Really. </connor>
<connor> If you saw the raw footage, mom, you can't. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, so my mom taught me, I've always known how to swim. </connor>
<connor> I don't remember not being able to swim. </connor>
<joey> - I wen to like a swimming school. </joey>
<garnt> - I remember like swimming was part of my curriculum </garnt>
<joey> in like school. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So we had like a local like swimming pool next, </joey>
<joey> not next to our school, </joey>
<joey> but like really, really close to our school. </joey>
<joey> I remember like Monday mornings </joey>
<joey> were just dedicated to learning how to swim. </joey>
<joey> - That's good. - Wow! </joey>
<joey> - I'm not a strong swimmer by any means, </joey>
<joey> but I still know the basics, I still know how to swim. </joey>
<garnt> Like to me it's still scary whenever I go out and I swim </garnt>
<garnt> and I can't feel the bottom, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> the fear kicks- - There's something </garnt>
<joey> so wholesome about hearing that. </joey>
<joey> - Why? - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> It just sounds like a child problem. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> When toes can't touch the floor. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean in the swim pool it's fine, </garnt>
<garnt> but like out like out in the sea. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the first time- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, what's worst is when I can actually feel </garnt>
<garnt> like something underneath- - You kick something. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you kick something. </joey>
<joey> That's when I'm scared. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean like if, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> something like in a pool, completely fine. </joey>
<joey> I don't give a if I can't feel the bottom. </joey>
<joey> I remember the first time I realized it </joey>
<joey> when we were on the beach. </joey>
<joey> It was Brighton Beach's work. </joey>
<joey> So it wasn't exactly a fucking thrilling beach. </joey>
<joey> And I remember like my mates just, </joey>
<joey> though, we were kinda just like, oh yeah, let's go swim out </joey>
<joey> and swim out to where like the fucking boys are, </joey>
<joey> and I've never done it before, </joey>
<joey> but I knew how to swim. </joey>
<joey> And I remember we got there </joey>
<joey> and this is the first time in my life </joey>
<joey> that I had swam that far out. </joey>
<joey> And this is the first time in my life </joey>
<joey> where I got to this point and I started kicking down </joey>
<garnt> and my whole life experience had taught me </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how deep it is, you can still stand up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - And so it was this realization where we get there </garnt>
<connor> and we start floating on the water and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> where's the floor? </connor>
<connor> Where's the ocean floor? - This is what happens </connor>
<connor> when you're six foot. </connor>
<connor> You take floor for granted. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, right? </connor>
<joey> I never had a swimming pool </joey>
<joey> where I couldn't like stand up at least on like my tiptoes. </joey>
<connor> I sink down a little bit and then I can still see </connor>
<connor> the surface of the water, I'm still on my tip toes. </connor>
<connor> I can reach the surface quite easily. </connor>
<connor> So this was the first time where I'd gone this far out </connor>
<connor> and I had the realization of, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> There is no edges to this pool that I can quickly grab onto. </connor>
<garnt> I've gotta swim literally like all the way back </garnt>
<garnt> to the fucking beach. </garnt>
<garnt> And the beach, like, you know, that scene in the movies </garnt>
<garnt> where the character gets vertigo, </garnt>
<garnt> where they look down and the ground just suddenly </garnt>
<garnt> like zooms out, that's exactly how I look. </garnt>
<garnt> That's exactly what the beach looked like </garnt>
<garnt> when I turned around and it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> the beach just went, like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, oh shit. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why you shouldn't be swimming </connor>
<connor> if you're getting even like 1% tired, </connor>
<connor> like you should turn back. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was already pretty tired. </connor>
<connor> - You should turn the fuck around. </connor>
<connor> - That's how people drown. </connor>
<connor> - That's probably like the closest </connor>
<garnt> I've come to drowning as well. </garnt>
<connor> - People get tired and they swim out </connor>
<connor> and then they're like, </connor>
<connor> they're tired by the time they turn around </connor>
<garnt> and they're fucked. </garnt>
<connor> It's so sad. </connor>
<garnt> - And yeah, I remember turning around and being like, okay, </garnt>
<joey> I've gotta fucking do this because one of the scariest- </joey>
<joey> - My life literally depends on it. </joey>
<joey> - My life literally depends on it. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, guys, I think I gotta turn back. </connor>
<connor> And I don't think I kind of conveyed </connor>
<connor> how fucking terrified I was to my mates, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they were like, "We're just gonna keep going </connor>
<connor> if that's cool with you." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, (pants) okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna turn back now. </connor>
<connor> So yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What a great group of friends- </connor>
<connor> - Those are bad mates if they let you do that. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I didn't have a good group of mates </garnt>
<garnt> when I was growing up. </garnt>
<connor> - If I heard even like a breath from my friend </connor>
<garnt> that sounded a little too heavy and we're swimming, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, turn the fuck around and get the fuck back. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause when you get further out, the waves get stronger. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> And then the currents come in </garnt>
<joey> and that's when it gets really fucking scary. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I can't think of anything more depressing </joey>
<connor> than just dying on (indistinct) beach as well. </connor>
<garnt> At least if I'm gonna die on a beach, </garnt>
<garnt> let me done a good beach. </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughs) Like a nice beach. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Come to Wales, man. </connor>
<connor> We've got the finest beaches. </connor>
<connor> We've got the finest beaches, man. </connor>
<joey> - My fondest memory as a kid, 'cause Australia, </joey>
<connor> every fucking house has like a pool in it </connor>
<connor> 'cause otherwise you can't survive </connor>
<connor> the (indistinct) summer. - Full luxury. </connor>
<connor> - You can't survive the summer otherwise. </connor>
<connor> But my fondest memory, </connor>
<connor> and I don't know if this is like a collective memory </connor>
<joey> for everyone, like every kid who like swam in a pool, </joey>
<joey> but did you use to do this thing </joey>
<joey> where you would go under the water </joey>
<joey> and then you would pretend to like walk under </joey>
<connor> to feel like you were in like on the moon. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. - Of course. </connor>
<joey> - That's the only memory I have of being in a pool. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Even though I went to swimming school for like seven years </joey>
<joey> to learn how to like do all these different swimming things </joey>
<joey> and like all these fun activities and whatnot, </joey>
<joey> the only thing I remember was like, yeah, I'm on the moon. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What intelligent thoughts Joey (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> I'm on the moon? </connor>
<joey> - The whole time you're talking about like the pool </joey>
<joey> in my head that was just replaying over and over again. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I wanna go swim in a pool again. </joey>
<connor> It's sad because it's so hard to like find a place </connor>
<connor> to swim, yeah. - There's like no pools here. </connor>
<connor> Its like they hate swimming for some reason. </connor>
<joey> - Unless you fucking pay 150 bucks a month to go to a gym </joey>
<joey> that also just happens to have a pool. </joey>
<connor> - I'd paid to go to a gym with a pool on it, fuck. </connor>
<joey> I wanna swim. - I just wanna go in a pool </joey>
<joey> and swim. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't seen a pool anywhere. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, honestly. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird to think they just don't like pools. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I don't know how statistically correct </joey>
<garnt> this is, but there's a lot of even adults in Japan </garnt>
<joey> that would just never learned to swim. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean if it wasn't part of my curriculum, </garnt>
<garnt> I probably would not have learned how to swim. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know where I would've gotten the motivation </joey>
<garnt> to be like, okay, I'm going to go out and figure out </garnt>
<garnt> how I'm going to fucking play through water. </garnt>
<joey> - Pool's everywhere in the UK. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) in the public. - Yeah. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> You just pay like two pounds and you go swimming. </joey>
<joey> 'cause in Australia it's almost like second nature </joey>
<joey> to be like, oh, your kid is like three to five years old. </joey>
<joey> Well, then we're gonna take you to swimming school. </joey>
<garnt> No question. </garnt>
<garnt> - As someone who's a lifeguard, was it pretty common </garnt>
<garnt> for like you to find pieces of in your pool? </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it happened like </connor>
<connor> in a year. - It happens. </connor>
<joey> - It's like code brown. </joey>
<joey> So it was like- </joey>
<joey> - Code brown. - That's what it was. </joey>
<joey> You have to empty... </joey>
<joey> Everyone has to get out and you have to close the pool. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you have to re-sanitize it </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like it's contaminated </joey>
<joey> 'Cause obviously there's tons piss in there, </joey>
<joey> but you can't see it. </joey>
<joey> But the moment you see a giant mass bar floating in there, </joey>
<connor> you gotta fish it out and then you gotta kick everyone out. </connor>
<connor> Same if like someone throws out, </connor>
<joey> I think more people throw up than- </joey>
<joey> - Throwing up in a pool? </joey>
<joey> Ah, I guess, from drinking little pool water, right? </joey>
<joey> - Maybe some kids are stupid they would like, </joey>
<connor> some of them would drink the pool water. </connor>
<connor> Some of them would just eat a lot </connor>
<connor> and they'd like jump around and then swim a bunch, </connor>
<connor> get really exhausted and then they would throw up. </connor>
<garnt> - How long would it take to fucking sanitize the pool? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. We had like a Roomba that did it. </connor>
<joey> There's like a Roomba that went around the bottom </joey>
<joey> and there's bunch of- - Oh yeah, like the little? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, we used to have these (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - And it would go around and it would clean it, </joey>
<joey> but the water is like never like emptied. </joey>
<joey> It's just like recycled, right. </joey>
<joey> And you gotta do a chlorine test every like two hours, </joey>
<joey> make sure the chlorine levels are okay. </joey>
<joey> But I never did that, I wasn't allowed to. </joey>
<joey> They were like, "We don't trust you with chlorine." </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) We don't trust you with chemicals. </joey>
<joey> - "We don't trust yo with the chlorine, Connor. </joey>
<joey> Get outta here." </joey>
<connor> I was never like a manager there, so I was just like that. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember still having like fucking vivid memories </garnt>
<connor> when I was like learning how to swim, </connor>
<connor> just like finding a shit in like the swimming pool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it happened like twice, I think, to me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause like we would never float. </joey>
<joey> You would always be at the bottom. </joey>
<joey> And like as a kid, I was just like you, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was always been shortsighted. </joey>
<joey> I was always shortsighted my entire life. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't know this until I was like maybe 10 years old </joey>
<joey> that I was shortsighted. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Actually, I remember. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> I remember as a kid, I would be sitting really close </connor>
<connor> to the TV because like when I'm playing games all day. </connor>
<connor> My mom was just like, "Stop sitting so close to the TV." </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, but I can't see it. </garnt>
<garnt> And my mom's just like, "Look harder." </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You're not looking hard enough. </connor>
<connor> - Get better eyes. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my, Garnt. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And it was only when we realized that when I (indistinct). </garnt>
<joey> - The audience will fight. </joey>
<joey> - I was just born with bad eyesight unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> So as a kid, I didn't have glasses at the time, </joey>
<joey> so I would be swimming in the pool </joey>
<joey> and I would see this like little, </joey>
<joey> I remember seeing this like little black fucking thing, </joey>
<joey> like in the corner of this pool, right? </joey>
<joey> - What did you do? </joey>
<joey> - And it was fucking blurry as fuck, right? </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, what the is this black thing in the corner. </connor>
<connor> I've never seen in the corner pool. </connor>
<connor> And so like out of, you know, </connor>
<connor> they say curiosity killed the cat. </connor>
<garnt> So me being the curious little, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> `fucking six-year-old I was or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> I swim closer and closer to it, right? (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - And looking back, I can hear the fucking "Jaws" music </garnt>
<garnt> just playing in the background. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, ta-na, ta-na. </garnt>
<joey> I start swimming closer and closer it </joey>
<joey> and it starts like slowly, slowly- </joey>
<joey> - Enhancing. </joey>
<joey> - Slowly, slowly coming into focus, right? </joey>
<joey> And it starts like, okay, so it becomes this blurry mess </joey>
<joey> and it becomes this cylinder shaped thing. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, what the fuck is a cylinder shaped thing </joey>
<joey> doing in the swimming pool, right? </joey>
<joey> And so I get closer and I get closer, </joey>
<joey> and then I'm literally like, </joey>
<garnt> so the the shit's there, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so I literally was just like. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> (claps) </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause like when it felt like it fully came into focus, </joey>
<joey> obviously when I'm this close </joey>
<joey> I can see the entire fucking detail in everything. </joey>
<joey> - You're like two inches away from pieces of shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can see the fucking texture </joey>
<joey> of the shit right now. </joey>
<garnt> Like that's how detailed it was in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> I let out the biggest underwater scream </garnt>
<garnt> I had of my fucking life. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It was literally like a fucking horror movie </garnt>
<joey> when I'm just like, (screams). </joey>
<connor> - You know what the... (laughs) </connor>
<joey> That's such a good story. - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - That's a great story. </joey>
<joey> - The weirdest time there was a shit in the pool, </joey>
<joey> and this happened to me twice while I was there. </joey>
<joey> And I was just completely confused </joey>
<joey> at how there was a shit in the pool. </joey>
<joey> And I still to this day cannot figure out what happened. </joey>
<joey> So I'd love some scientists in the chat to explain </joey>
<joey> what the fuck happened. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So they would do this thing </joey>
<connor> at my pool where they would have like, </connor>
<connor> how to learn how to kayak. </connor>
<connor> So they would let like six people- </connor>
<joey> - Like in the pool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they would put six kayaks in the pool </joey>
<joey> and just let people kayak around it. </joey>
<connor> And I don't know how this happened, </connor>
<connor> but after the kayakas left, there was a shit in the pool. </connor>
<connor> Now, they're in kayaks. </connor>
<connor> How did it get in the pool? </connor>
<connor> - Did some of them just window, </connor>
<connor> like put that butt out just for a second, </connor>
<connor> just like squeeze it out. </connor>
<connor> How does that happen? </connor>
<connor> How is there shit in the pool after kayaks? </connor>
<joey> Does anyone have an idea of how this happened? </joey>
<connor> We were all completely confused </connor>
<connor> and luckily it was the end of the day, </connor>
<joey> but we were just like, how is there shit in the pool? </joey>
<joey> - You're looking back at like the security footage camera. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "We gotta find the exact moment </joey>
<connor> when the poop came out. - We wish. We wish. </connor>
<connor> - We wish we had security footage to fucking analyze </connor>
<joey> if someone had done a cheeky shit. </joey>
<connor> Did they bring it and drop it in? </connor>
<joey> Like, did they do it in the kayak </joey>
<joey> and then just fucking scooch it in? </joey>
<joey> Like what happened? </joey>
<connor> To this day, I wake up in a cold sweat </connor>
<connor> wondering how did that shit get in there </connor>
<connor> - Wait, were they like adults in the kayak? </connor>
<connor> - No, it was just like 15, 14, 13-year-olds. </connor>
<joey> - What 15, 14-year-old is like, </joey>
<connor> "I'ma in this pool." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Kids are fucking weird, man. </connor>
<connor> - Kids are weird. </connor>
<connor> - But you think like after like the age of 12, </connor>
<connor> you think like- </connor>
<connor> - Nah, nah, dude. </connor>
<connor> - There is like a mental stop in my brain </connor>
<joey> to be like, no, pooping in the pool is bad. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<garnt> - Some kids so dirty, though. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't give a shit. - (scoffs) Gross. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, even just pissing in the pool, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I've done it. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone's done it. </connor>
<connor> - It's something we don't- </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna pretend like I don't piss in the pool, okay? </connor>
<connor> - It's something that we don't like to admit, </connor>
<joey> but of course everyone's done it. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone does it. - Right, Meilyne? </joey>
<garnt> - Never. - Right, Meilyne? (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Sounds like smelling your own fart. </joey>
<connor> Everyone does it. - Sometimes, you just get in </connor>
<joey> the pool and you realize, fuck, I need to piss. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah - I just got in. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't wanna get out. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not getting out, I'm gonna piss. </connor>
<joey> Everyone else is doing it. </joey>
<connor> We're all just drinking each other's piss anyway. </connor>
<joey> This pool is massive, no one will know. </joey>
<garnt> - It's got chlorine in it for a reason. </garnt>
<joey> - Waving around a bit. - Stop (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> whatever it is. </joey>
<joey> - What? - What? </joey>
<connor> - It's a fucking pool, Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> - It's a public pool, Meilyne. </connor>
<joey> - Public pool is basically piss. </joey>
<connor> Why do you think they put fluoride in it? </connor>
<connor> - Michael Phelps says he pisses in the pool? </connor>
<joey> If Michael Phelps can piss in the pool, </joey>
<joey> I can piss in the pool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it propels him, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like an extra jet engine. </joey>
<joey> - He is the gold standard of swimmers. </joey>
<joey> If he can piss in the pool, as far as I'm concerned, </joey>
<joey> I can piss in the pool. - That's like a just propel, </joey>
<joey> It's just like through here. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not shitting in the pool. </connor>
<joey> - No. - I'm not doing it, come on. </joey>
<joey> - Big difference between pissing and shitting. </joey>
<connor> - One of them evacuates the pool, </connor>
<connor> the other one is everything everyone else is doing. </connor>
<connor> Its not a problem, whatever. - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I will not have to justify pissing in, okay. </connor>
<connor> I don't just get in every pool and I'm like, (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> It's pissing time. </connor>
<connor> - I'm about to pee. </connor>
<connor> - All I'm saying is if you're in a wet suit on or something, </connor>
<connor> it's like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna make myself warm. </connor>
<connor> - You know who else pisses in the pool, though? </connor>
<connor> Our Patreons. - Yeah, they do. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - All of these people definitely pee in the pool. </joey>
<joey> - They definitely piss in the pool. </joey>
<joey> Look at all these lovely people right here. </joey>
<garnt> - Who piss in the pool. - Look at all these lovely </garnt>
<joey> pool pissers, right? (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - We've gone from fucking from spicy food </garnt>
<garnt> to fucking pissing in the pool while we do an episode </garnt>
<joey> of "Trash Taste" - Sounds like a "Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> episode to me, </joey>
