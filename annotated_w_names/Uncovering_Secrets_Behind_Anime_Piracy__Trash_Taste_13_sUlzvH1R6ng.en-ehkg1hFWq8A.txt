<SPEAKER_04> - Is it starting? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's face reveal, this
is the intro. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Face reveal, let's go! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (ambient music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello and welcome to another episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of "Trash Taste Podcast". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm your host for today, Gigguk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and today, joining me are
my usual cohosts, the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello, we're the boys.
- Hello </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Boy one and boy two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and today we have another special guest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you want to introduce yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, bye. (laughing)
(Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We'll introduce you for you then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is our producer, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You probably heard her voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or seen her passing
the camera a few times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or seen us shouting at her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Seen us shouting at her, or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but today's her face revealed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what our producer looks like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - She's a familiar face
in my videos, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, you're in-
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the Yaoi cafe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you were like the heavy
breathing in the background. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Gigguk and Meilyne laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you've been on
like all our channels, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> At one point.
- I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, the rental mom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the rental mom one and yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but like on "Trash Taste" at least, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the first time, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, do you wanna
explain what your job is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and what you do and kinda why
you're on the podcast today? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's up with that,
why are you on here? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Free real estate, (laughing) but anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, I am Meilyne, I work at Book Walker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've probably seen that
on all of their videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they're free to use
all their coupon codes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't have one, but yeah (laughing). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyways, yeah, so GeeXPlus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a company under
Kadokawa and Book Walker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I started that within
Book Walker last year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah, now I work at... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't even explain
that right. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Meilyne is a nervous mess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughing) The long
and the short of it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> she's the reason we're all here now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's the reason why
this show even exists. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the reason we invited her today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is because I thought
today we could talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some spicy industry news guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, so if you didn't know this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a small indianime site called KissAnime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recently went out of business, "business"- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, "business". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's at the time of
recording this though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As at the time of recording this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah, I guess we just
wanted to talk about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Talk about piracy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you know, that always
goes well on the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Twitter has been a mess.
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When is Twitter not a mess? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God, I've seen so many
garbage takes about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Where do we even begin?
- Where do we even begin? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We wanna explain what
a KissAnime even is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is KissAnime?
- What is a KissAnime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll explain what KissAnime is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Monkey brain here, to
explain things for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Explain it like I'm five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - KissAnime was probably
the most notorious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and well-known anime piracy
website for streaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for a while.
- For a while, not anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not anymore, but I'd say
at least three years ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was definitely like the site. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you know, as somebody
who at one point you used it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it definitely became a thing
of, "Oh we're using .ru now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> instead of.com. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, that's a little confusing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then, suddenly it
acts like disposable bomb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you went to
like this, the pictures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The capture got so fucking complicated, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was like, I didn't
know how to navigate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it got to a point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anywhere you click on the
website, you got an ad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like trying to navigate minefield, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, where can I
click without getting an ad? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was waiting for the capture
to turn into like Sulfurex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was trigonometry question. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It would ask for like
cat, cat and blue scape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah (laughing)
(Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It had essentially become a
second page of Google website, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like a minefield, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was definitely the most notorious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say overall website
among the anime fandom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it recently closed its stores. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And people seemed very upset
about that for some reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as if there isn't like 500 other websites </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that immediately pop up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One thing that really
confused me is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why are people sad, I guess? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's still using KissAnime in 2020? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, c'mon guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate the fact that I just joke tweeted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about being like "rip
kissanime, rip brokeweebs", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it became my most popular tweet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got like 90,000 likes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, why? (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who is like "#canrelate"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's my most popular tweet, and I hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I jokingly said
that in the sense of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who the fuck uses KissAnime in 2020? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so many people were
like, "Relate queen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I relate, rip brokeweebs." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't understand Twitter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know. It's horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People were like, I don't
know if you guys got this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like atting me being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "You need to discuss this,
it's such big community news." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like why, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Pirate sites get shut down all the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then another one pops up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's the reason we had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single country
extension ever of KissAnime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is 'cause they move to
every fucking country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until they probably have
none left, I assumed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I saw KissAnime
having a dot whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in things that I've never even seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like "ru", I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's Russia.
- That's Russia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, I don't wanna offend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Russian fans of "Trash
Taste" and we have a Russian dem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, we have like a
large Russian demographic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is great, but I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel very uneasy when I
see that .ru in my browser. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know there's
something shady going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's on .ru. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Love Russia though, yeah, totally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - They have other things though, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not only KissAnime, it's
like KissManga, KissMovies- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - KissCartoon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a KissHentai as well, I think? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's actually a KissHentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember, somehow
I got on to KissCartoon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like "Family Guy"
was like the most popular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just sat there for a second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like people are pirating "Family Guy". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you know YouTube exists, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> All the episodes- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, this shit is available
everywhere. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you remember that phase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they were just like,
there was this streaming phase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where "Family Guy" episodes
would just be like streamed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on YouTube and it would just be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 24-hour "Family Guy" stream,
24-hour "Simpsons" stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was always the front page
of fucking YouTube as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not official, is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - (Joey and Gigguk) No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not official </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and yet like, every time I'd open YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there'd just be like 24 hours, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a 24/7 stream of "The Cleveland Show". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was like 700,000
people watching the stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, it's the same
thing that happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like Hentai Haven, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When Hentai Haven got shut down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Where are we going to
watch our Hentai now?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I don't know, Google that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's literally 700 websites for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fell short out of the loop, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I never used Hentai Haven, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and when everyone was losing their shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "But why don't
you just use the website </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm using?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why don't you just
use every other website- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And everyone was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - A question to you Meilyne, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you actually work in the industry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So what is your opinion on KissAnime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's shutting down as a whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> from like someone on the
other side of the wall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone who like, works
with the copyright holders. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't really work
in like the anime side, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I work more on like the manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and occasionally, we'll do
something with the anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I can't really speak
for the anime industry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've liked most of the discussion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Twitter and like most of
the discussion on our side, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of it is just speculation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We don't actually know how much
piracy affects the industry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it can be argued that no one- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think there's any like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> concrete stats right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There isn't like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I don't think any
of these piracy sites </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are making that shit public, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of like how much money
they're actually making. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they're making a disgusting
amount on all those ads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can definitely guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, at one point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> KissAnime was like one of
the top 100 visited websites </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on the internet, which is fucking insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like imagine how much
money they were making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just from ad revenue
of being like the top. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably worth it to
keep evading all the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - you know what I mean?
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, they made a
disgusting amount of money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they really shouldn't
have been making. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause don't a lot of the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because obviously when you
watch something pirated, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not using a standard YouTube player </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a normal... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's using one of those really
sketchy third-party websites </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that hosts anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure those websites as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the ones they were using </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would pay you to host files. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- Like video files, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because they wanted their
player to become more universal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So a lot of these were also... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> KissAnime at the time,
again, I'm not sure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but from what I understood,
they were getting ad revenue, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of it, I imagine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you've gone on that website </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've got like, what, 10 fucking ads? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hot asian dating- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) Hot singles in your area. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like always fucking
Lois from "Family Guy" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being rammed, and it's like,
I'm just trying to watch anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that'd be always like
these shitty hentai games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that would be advertised. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think one time I was watching something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and just this advert of like Cunt Wars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or a game called that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, is this for real? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this for real right now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's a real game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that just stook out of my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be fair, I want to play Cunt Wars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just from the fucking name of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love Rentokil, I'm joking. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't you accidentally
click on those ads sometimes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then once you click
it's like, boom, boom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these pop-up windows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like "Boom, boom, boom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sex free now in your area," like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So they were getting like
double-dipping ad revenue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were getting paid to host the files, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, I leaned back, I
always fucking do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, so, they were
getting like double ad rev </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, and then, you know, people on Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I disagree with, I think you can... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Say, okay, there is a need for piracy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in some extents, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then there's people who're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Boohoo KissAnime man", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like, they're
doing the real hard work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's probably like four
dudes racking in millions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I wouldn't like feel
sorry for them, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I didn't see the full story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like how they got shut down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I assume they just got
shut down by some DMCA claim. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, but at the same... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they've had their
thing shut down several times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they went from like kissanime.com </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to like .net to like
.ru eventually, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when that happened, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was also like, obviously not as big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't think there
were articles about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but people were definitely making a fuss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like, "Oh no, KissAnime is down." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then two weeks later,
they're back with a new url. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, that's what I just assumed
when I saw that article. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, they'll
be back in like two weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's the first
time they've put in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a message saying
like, yeah, it's over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - On their discord, right?
- I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even know
why they had a discord. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who the fuck is in
the KissAnime discord? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would you need a discord? (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like, I love KissAnime so much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to join the discord. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's always that
argument that people present </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, what
is it, Gabe Newell said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like piracy is a service
problem or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's gone way past that now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the piracy is a
service problem argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always gets brought up and it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a different situation
with the anime industry I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Games is a really different thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you ever tried to pirate a game? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that shit is annoying,
like straight up, just annoying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But one thing I find
unique to anime piracy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and even hentai to the
same extent as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is that in no other industry do I see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a pirate service get the branding power </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that it does in anime.
- It's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you want to pirate a movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or if you wanna pirate a game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where'd you go for that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You probably go to Google, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But there's no like, "Oh
yes, there's kiss gaming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I go to kiss gaming every day,
I would die if kiss gaming... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you part of the kiss gaming discord?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I downloaded Cunt Wars
on kiss gaming. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you don't see that
in any other industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, I don't know why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is specifically to
like the anime and manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like hentai circles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where piracy just has this branding power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where people will gather
behind this service </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just like any
other pirate service, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean?
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was right before
Hentai Haven got shut down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember they messaged me being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey do you wanna promote our merch line?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "I'm not
promoting a merch line </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a fucking pirating website." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like, if Pirate Bay was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Bro, we've got like these-"
- They actually? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can say that because they gone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah, they fully did that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, I remember I messaged a few people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just being like, does this seem right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'm missing something here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think this is right.
(Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're not the only person,
but it wasn't Hentai Haven, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh really?
- It was KissAnime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They messaged you?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So KissAnime were going
to open like a store, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they were going to open a store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And they messaged me being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, do you wanna promote our store?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was there sitting, are
these guys for real? (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What makes you think you're
gonna get away with this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they had like an entire store page </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they linked me to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and obviously it was
like official products </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that were being sold
unofficially, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Were they typing to you or
writing to you in clear English </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or is it broken English? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it was actually in clear English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it in Russian? (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it was like a proper
store and everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, man,
the balls on these guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Hentai Haven store as well was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he had already even made
like a landing page for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, this is
the lineup for the stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was like, t-shirts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously it wasn't anything
too amazingly well-designed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know it was just simple stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the Hentai Haven logo
on a t-shirt or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, ah, no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then two weeks later, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I think it was maybe
like two or three weeks later, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they got like, that whole thing happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they got shut down, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder if it comes from disdain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the major companies
more so than them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they don't actively brand anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't have like a hehe
funny Twitter account right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like KissAnime never did anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's just because-
- It's all community driven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think a lot of the community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just does not like the
big guys, which, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're easy to share too.
- Yeah, they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If your friend doesn't have an account </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're new to anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're trying to get them to anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll link them to like a pirate site. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also it works in
every country, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of the unofficial stuff.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I do think there is a space for piracy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I made an entire video on Fansubs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how that was really really
important for the community </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and how it helped it grow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I wanna make that argument, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I do think there is a space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where piracy did very much did play a part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in helping anime grow, especially abroad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think it has gotten to the point now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that anime, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't have that same effect anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because anime is now big enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where everyone knows anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think there's still
like a lot of countries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where that kinda need
piracy to help boost anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make this a truly global medium. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But places like the U.S and the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, you know places where you
have a lot more accessibility </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the fandom is a bit bigger, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like that argument
doesn't hold as much water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as it did fucking 10 years
ago or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean 10 years ago, I mean,
no, even further beyond that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole Western community
came from piracy, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you had to get
like a bootleg, like VH... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why, I say H like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - VHS.
- VHS tape, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You had to get a bootleg one,
it was all shared around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't all piracy, but
obviously like you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's growing out of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I guess some people
wanna hold onto that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and argue that's how it should be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's the biggest
problem though, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that a lot of the discussion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that revolves especially
around anime piracy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is like, both sides of the
argument is very very much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> situated on both sides
of the spectrum, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like you either hard agree
that piracy in anime is bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or you hard disagree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there's very rarely any people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who are kinda like, there's benefits, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's also demerits to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm definitely someone who's
in the middle. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's hard for me to get involved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in any discussion on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because if you say anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they either put you on
one side or the other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're either like hard into piracy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or you're like a fucking Crunchyroll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Funimation or Book Walker
shit, right? (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Filthy Book Walker shell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I work at Book Walker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I know I probably shouldn't say this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm in between. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The only reason, I'm
technically in this industry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or I got interested was because
there were pirate sites. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They got you into it, right?
- Yeah, and I got into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And now there's just so
many subtitles available, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many platforms,
there's really no excuse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if you wanna see something
fast and in low quality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and maybe the translations are out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's stuck in Netflix, sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - One question I always had about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the Japanese side of things is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how aware are the Japanese companies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of all these pirate sites? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very aware.
- Are they very aware? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've talked to...
- It feels very Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where like, "We don't care, I sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, you're pirating our anime? I'm woke." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They care, they're
very strict, especially, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> not talking about like websites,
but for example, YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Feyus is not a thing
in Japan, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When we've worked with sponsors, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if we want a show just to
get screenshot in anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if they're sponsoring it,
they'll bring that up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "Could you have brides
to show the screenshot?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If they have a problem... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I guess the YouTube mentality is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's a problem, they'll
let us know, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're all copywriters,
whatever, we'll fight it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or if it's really unfair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've just uploaded
the 10-minute "Family Guy" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or 24-hour "Family Guy" stream, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I probably shouldn't
be doing that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But most of the time it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if they have a problem they
can come and tell us, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like they're very
much a risk-averse mindset </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, just don't
ever allow that situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like on the Book
Walker side of things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much of an effect do
you guys see on piracy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your side of things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and how do you go about
justifying that as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a hard question.
- - That's a toughie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a loaded question,
that's a hella loaded question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, if you don't have
an answer, that's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't really
have like a huge answer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, Book Walker's technically very new, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and despite it being around
for almost five years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when a pirate site goes down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't see that much of effect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because our users, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the people who have been
coming to our store every month </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are the type of people who
want to support the industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if people have been stealing for years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they don't have money,
even if the site goes down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they're not gonna come to our store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like in the West, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in Japan, there's this site called, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or used to be a site, you
probably know it Joey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Manga Muda?
- Yeah, Manga Muda. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When it went down, there
was a huge increase in sales. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Manga Muda was basically
like the KissManga of Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was one of the biggest
manga pirating site, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that got like properly shut down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The founders were like straight up charged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and went to jail and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I assume the thing happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to a big Western app recently
which was manga rock, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that got shot down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They didn't really shut down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did they not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They like pivoted and shut it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They shut down the app in many ways, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then were like, "Hey,
we have other stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> check it out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They pulled a .ru basically. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But after they shut down,
did you see any change at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or increase in traffic or
sales or anything on your side? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not so much I would say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because they also, I don't
know if I should share this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Book Walkers more popular
for light novel readers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and usually pirate sites have manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So when they wanna read something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I don't know, longer or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and they wanna pirate it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're going to stick
to other pirate sites. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there any noticeable difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between the spending habits of Westerners </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and Japanese on manga? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Anything that you're allowed to tell us? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I think the general stereotype </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that the Western audience
is very fucking stingy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, extremely stingy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember it, 'cause I
think I had this mindset </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of I'm not paying for any media. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when I was like 13, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I grew up with just
like pirating everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I think once you take that step </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of paying for media, I
think you don't go back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you're like, whoa,
that was really easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the thing I always feel piracy- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I've always said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> piracy isn't exactly a bad thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel it's just a stepping stone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> towards getting into the actual fandom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then once you're mature enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you've made your own
money and what not... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I do think most of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not saying it all the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's normally the younger
ones who are diehard piracy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, yeah, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that normally comes from
having no income at all- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe your parents give
you like 10 bucks a month </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't spend that on- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not spending that online, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, no one's gonna do that. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It makes sense then that you
hopefully transition into it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and when you get older and
you get more monkey brained </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like myself, it becomes
really fucking annoying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you are looking for 10 plus minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to just find the link to
watch what you wanna watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, I will throw 10 bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make this problem go away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna watch it comfortably and just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, reliably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then there's people who argue like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh yeah, well there isn't
good services to watch anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or read manga," there is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just, most of the time
people don't wanna admit that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Even using Crunchyroll here
in Japan, it's a bit of a pain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I have to use a VPN. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's still less annoying
than going to KissAnime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opening up five fuckin' tabs,
pressing pause six times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before all the ads... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You all know this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, you used to the
websites when you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how many times do you have to press play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before it actually plays? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's three times, three
is the magic number, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's always three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You better fucking hope to God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't have to pause that bitch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause if you pause that bitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you wanna press play again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you got more problems. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always wanna skip the anime opening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I know to skip the anime opening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the cost you pay is three extra clicks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because you wanna
skip the anime opening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And sometimes, you
completely fuck the buffering, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you've got to reload the whole thing- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then it all starts again, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - and then before it plays, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you cannot allow this thing to play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You need to skip to 1 minute 30 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before it even allows to buffer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it might fuck up
and you cannot rebuffer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I just wanna avoid that dance- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's exactly why
I stopped using KissAnime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like four years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm just like,
I'm better than this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna go through this torture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And Chromecast exists now, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna cast that shit to my TV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wanna press one
button and it goes on my TV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't do that with pirate sites, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - For android you can, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some of them you can,
but it doesn't always work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, sometimes you'll be watching it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you'll be like, okay, cool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> episode one allows me to Chromecast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Episode two, none of these
web players on the mirrors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> allow you to Chromecast, then
you're like, fuck's sake! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the YouTube anime
like part seventies missing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> problems all over again, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, do I just cave in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and just watch this on my phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and just be really annoyed for 20 minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or do I, you know... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And that happens to me
and I have to do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because obviously sometimes
Crunchyroll doesn't have it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's no way for
me to get it, and it's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or Netflix, fuck Netflix Japan
not having English subtitles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I fucking hate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've not been able to watch so many shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that should be available to me because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you put the Netflix to UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boom, it has English subtitles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why can't you just put the subtitles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the Japanese Netflix? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have the subtitles, why
would you not offer them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't have that problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Motherfucker! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you wait a few months
though, it'll show up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If you wait a few months, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the subtitles do get on there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Great, I'll just wait a few months, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just wait a few months.
- For "Baki"- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, "Baki" they were
there straight away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Were they?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Baki" were there straight away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking rolling a dice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whether Netflix will put
English subtitles on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, Oh, maybe it will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I'll go watch this anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put it on, no subtitles, fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like one thing I never got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about some of the
reactions I see on Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is, if you're gonna
pirate anime, that's fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I know plenty of people pirate anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's been this movement recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've seen where people are just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking proud of this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you should pirate
anime, that helps everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That helps the industry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, bro, I get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You wanna pirate anime? Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do it, everyone fucking
does it, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's a difference between, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, yeah, I watched
some of my shows pirated," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to, "Yeah, I stand up for this shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna defend this shit." (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think what it's maybe come from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I'm speculating here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you get so many influences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and people in the industry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who actively shame people who
admit that they pirate, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And even us, probably talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying that we admit that we
pirate is a pretty risky move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Crunchyroll could easily turn around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, "We never worked
with you again," right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank you for the free
account, by the way, I love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do actually use my Crunchyroll account, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thank you Miles, I love you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But, just us mentioning that we pirate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe there's some other
YouTubers out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would be like, "How dare
you admit that you pirate? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You should be a role model to those." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but that's like
saying like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh no I didn't drink until I turned 18. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like bullshit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone drinks before they turn 18. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but, you're not
there as a 16 year old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, "Guys, I'm
getting fucking hammered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle of the fucking
city," you know. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am proud to defy the law. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I had alcohol before I was 18, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is the legal drinking age in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I wasn't there shouting it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for every fucking parent to see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't there in the fucking
off license being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, by the way, I'm 16,
sell me your fucking alcohol." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm doing something illegal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's so much more
approachable for viewers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people who watch us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and especially people in
industry to admit like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, at one point I did pirate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but even now I still
pirate when I have to." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's important is the word "did", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's that you did pirate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but you don't actively only
rely on pirating now, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, if I have a choice to
pay and get it done easily, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I will 'cause I'm lazy
and that's what I'll do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think having this mindset </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of you can never admit that you pirate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can never speak
doesn't have any merits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like it just
actively pushes people away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from having any form of
constructive argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I think
actually most people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would fit somewhere in the middle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so.
- But the only takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we see on Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is either people actively
like slut-shaming piracy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or simping on piracy.
- or just simping on piracy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, not neither
of these are correct, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't know why
these are the only takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I see on Twitter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I think it's wild, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one thing that drives
a lot of people away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially from the bigger figures, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of the voice actors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of people in
the industry is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just actively saying, "You are
wrong, I am in this industry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know better than you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, there is a sense of that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You are in the industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so maybe you have a bit more of a point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but as far as a voice actor goes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, you have no
fucking say in what happens, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're doing a job,
you're doing a service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like as far as you're concerned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just in the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's where your commitments end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've no bearing on the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're not in the industry.
- Oh no, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think that a lot
of these voice actors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are also forced then to like, you can't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the way the industry works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't be to your
friend, no, you're wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if you're seen as problematic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, it's serious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're seen as problematic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well maybe a director won't hire you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you're known for being
a bit of a dick on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- You don't support, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you said anime piracy was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We wanted to hire you,
but I guess, piracy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think a lot
of people don't realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just actively shaming people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will just push them
away to the other side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it doesn't work by saying,
"Hey, you shouldn't pirate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a bad thing," even
though technically, it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that doesn't mean that
people don't pirate for a reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - As weird as it is to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a really weird
form of gate-keeping, almost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's almost like a reverse gatekeeping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, if you pirate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you'll not a real anime fan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you really don't support the industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, no, you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can eventually get to that point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but you have to start somewhere, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if piracy is your only option, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then piracy is your only option. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw, like, it was like
a tweet, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was one of the takes that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's not available in your country? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tough, it wasn't made for you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, Whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, yeah, okay, no one
has right to anything, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But also if you can't get it legally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're a fan of the stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like, yeah, fuck it, who cares? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pirate that shit, there's no
way for you to pay for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand why this
is such a, "No, you can't." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was another
fucking' horrible take, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which was like, "Anime is a
luxury," you remember that one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We saw like this list
of horrible arguments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> towards piracy, and it was
like, "Anime is a luxury, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you should really be proven lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you even get the chance
to watch any of this stuff." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, it's just a fuckin'
cartoon bro, like chill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know some people
who work like two jobs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have no fucking money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they can't afford the like
three subscriptions they need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch all the shows they want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, dude, kick back and
relax, you deserve that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've been working hard,
man, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If someone is broke as fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would not shame them for
pirating, I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that we can all agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that probably the worst take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is the whole anime merch take, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the, "I buy anime merch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and therefore I have the right to pirate." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we all buy a
lot of anime merch, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Used to, right?
- I used to buy a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, tell us the reason why- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, why is it past tense? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The real reason is just, just kidding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't share that. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's too much tea in this episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the tea's being spilled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, but what are you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as someone who actually
works in the industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you feel about that argument, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the, "I buy anime merch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so therefore I have the right
to pirate," kinda thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, you can't use it as a reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think, I don't
know how to explain this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, for example, royalties for goods, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so I've heard from friends in the industry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they go to different departments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not always directly
to that specific creator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, what are you saying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> If they buy merch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the money still doesn't go
back to the original creator? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does, it depends, I think,
on the contract they had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so I've heard
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not in that department. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I imagine the bigger
of a brand the anime is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the easier it is to get a better deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of royalties
and costs, I imagine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah 'cause one thing
that always confuses me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that people think that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know there's lots of
arguments that have been made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that doing X worth is better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for supporting the industry than doing Y, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I dunno how much, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know where they're
getting this information from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause none of these people
are working in the industry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So every argument I see
on both sides of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the times just anecdotal- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just speculation.
- and speculation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no theory behind it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They're just like, Oh, I
feel good buying merch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It feels like if I buy official merch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's tied to that particular IP, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just feel like, Oh, I'm supporting it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm helping to spread the love, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm putting money into
something that's official. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So therefore in the back of their head, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just like, yeah, that's
gonna go back to the creator </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in some way, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they own it.
- I mean, it's better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than not doing anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but is it the best way to
support that particular creator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the IP? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> No.
- Not the best, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but better than nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the best wages, legally streaming? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Paying for the services? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the best way in your opinion? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've heard that the DVDs,
Blu-ray DVDs for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan, I'm not sure about the U.S, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but in Japan, buying the
Blu-ray DVDs is the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's when they know like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause they measure success </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from Blu-ray sales, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that and like the
original sources sale- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like the manga
and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've heard that.
- That's what I've heard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I always try to
make sure I buy my manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> firsthand now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, even if it's an older series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I can easily go to
a bulk offer or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and buy it for 100 Yen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always just try and go to the bookstore, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the first-hand book store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've heard that
is truly the best way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to support the creator, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess 'cause when it's pre-owned- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The royalties don't go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I mean like 2/3 of my JoJo merch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is pre-owned stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's because it's like-
- You can't get that stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> anymore, 'cause for some reason- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't made for you, it
wasn't available at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't deserve it. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I deserve all the JoJo merch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I spent thousands of dollars
on like Yahoo auction, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but none of that goes to... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because a lot of the time as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like this merch is like
what, like 100 bucks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then two years later on Yahoo auction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's 300 bucks and someone
made a nice profit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean good for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Araki's definitely not seen that profit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, anything that
I've bought that's brand new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is probably the Jump store
stuff that we both bought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause the JoJo exhibition
museum was canceled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and normally you have to
go to the JoJo exhibition </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get the stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they were like, "Hey, you
can just order it online." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I ordered like-
- You got the suits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The suits as well I got, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the thing is, with the suits, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's Bandai collaboration
with Perfect Suit Factory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So there's like two companies
that are making this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before it gets to the-
- They're taking most of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, like these $500 suits, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how many of that goes to Shonen Jump </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then, are like.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the animators aren't
seeing that shit, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The animators are still underpaid as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't think
there's anything we can do for- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, they're underpaid
because it's just Japan's salary, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the average salary in Japan- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mike! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man, Mike is taking a beating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The average salary in general is low. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - (Joey and Gigguk) Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like with animators, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a systematic problem
with how the industry works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a whole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a whole other can of worms. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a whole other can of worms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's also just like Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's a whole
different argument to be had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think one thing I see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a lot of like Western
Twitter and Western people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that I feel like they don't
want to support the industry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mostly because they're not happy with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of these bigger companies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the image of like say
Crunchyroll or Funimation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's less of, "I don't
wanna support the industry," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and more of, "I don't wanna
support these companies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in particular. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you don't wanna
support the companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are representing the
industry in our country, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can understand it at times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's a lot of
arguments that people make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like underpaying translators
that comes up a lot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know, like last year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was voice actor of Funimation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, there's a lot of reasons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why people might not want to, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's tough, 'cause it's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I don't think there's
a right or wrong argument </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but what I feel sometimes is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of people won't
support the industry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> unless there's like a perfect system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where all the money they go
to goes to this one creator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They wanna-
- Utopian system? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like a utopian system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where every creator has a
fucking Patreon or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and they can support any creator they want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how much they want, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's just not a business
model, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like a lot of
people use that justification </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to say, "Hey we're not
supporting the creator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how I want to support the creator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm just not gonna support anything." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like there must be
a better way to go about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than that because there's never
gonna be a perfect system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, Trigger kinda
did the right thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They have a Patreon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they have a Twitch stream
where they do like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How much does their
Patreon get at the moment? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not too sure, but-
- I think I checked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, that is
nowhere near enough to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, definitely not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically just like
a side revenue for them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But at least it's a way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that will actually go
directly to the studio, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and is a payment method or donation method </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that Westerners are very
familiar with, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's good to have just an option </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to do something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, Hey, do you wanna
directly support the studio? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, you know-
- I think Pixie has that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not a studio, but like
there are some illustrators. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, Pixie kinda has
that as well, definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, that's really the only thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and barely anybody's utilizing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never heard of a
manga artist using Patreon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it like a pride thing in Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like not wanting to ask people for money? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like begging is
really like not a thing here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, culturally
begging is not a thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not even for homeless people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, homeless people just
do their own thing like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's true, I've never seen
a homeless person begging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's really disrespectful, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's not a thing here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even the homeless here are respectful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're just like, "No,
no, no, keep your money." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, "I'm homeless,
I still have my pride." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's just a
different culture altogether. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of it that
comes down to that there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think in the industry and
how people want it to change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just not going to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I also think a really
big root of the problem, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to at
least the anime industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they truly, even
though in my experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having done stuff with a
lot of different studios </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and productions and whatnot in anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're aware of the Western industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just don't really
give a shit about them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would say they care a lot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they just don't know what to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not their first priority though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The first priority is always
the Japanese market, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's how they measure their success. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, of course I'm sure
all of these studios now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's 2020, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I think most of them are aware now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there are way more Western fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are into their anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than there will ever be
Japanese fans, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But-
- I mean, in China alone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or just Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All the mobile games
coming out of China. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if you just look at Southeast Asia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's more people just in general </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who will watch the anime
and enjoy the anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be willing to spend the money on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But because the Japanese
anime industry is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of it is so old fashioned, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and thinking just locally,
that they just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, we understand that
there are all these people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out here who are probably
willing to pay for our stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just don't know how to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We can't be bothered to
figure out how to do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japanese culture in
general though, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's just like, for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the DVD and Blu-ray business model </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just not going to work abroad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it can prop up the
anime industry here in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it has for the longest time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it took them like how
many years to figure out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that people just don't
wanna buy DVDs and Blu-ray? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like if Crunchyroll was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "We're gonna open up a
blockbuster tomorrow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come on in and rent your DVDs." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, no, it's not...(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's shocking how many people in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> do not know streaming services. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like even young people are just not aware. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, "Oh, you can
watch anime on Netflix?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They usually record it on
their TV when it's playing live. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - but it's like, I'm not
staying up until 3:00 AM </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch a fucking run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never seen a place
where they sell CRT TV so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Smash players were like, "Yes, yes," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but everyone else is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why the fuck would I need a CRT TV? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so many. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even know what a CRT TV is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Those big fucking chunky ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the static-
- The big TVs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I see so many of them for sale- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The TV that you grew
up with, like the giant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the brick of a TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ow, thick.
- The thick boys, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was in Akihabara, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was like a
brand new electronic store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like LCD, like thin TVs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's a whole section for CRT TVs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, who the fuck is buying this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Genuinely, who the fuck
is buying CRT TV set, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except for Smash players? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like the secondhand
store here in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is fuckin' on another level, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because you go into a secondhand store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they have like fucking laser discs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in pristine condition.
- Perfect condition. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bought a fuckin'
like full LaserDisc set </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all the episodes of
"Evangelion" for like 500 Yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even have a LaserDisc player, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why is this here, and why
is it such good quality? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you love retro games, my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have every single
retro game system perf... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can buy like an N64,
like used for like 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I bought my N64 brand
new, in box for like 90 bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you could get the SNES, in-box, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like 50 bucks in the store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's crazy, like Genesis games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which are normally really
expensive in the West, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super cheap everywhere here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, I'm going off tangent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's crazy how-
- It's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> If you like retro games, come to Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Meilyne is like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I space out like half
the time... (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We just talk mad shit,
Meilyne's like, "Yeah". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, what? (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So in your guys' opinion then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what can be improved in the industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and how they approach marketing
themselves to the West </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and obviously never getting rid of piracy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I don't think piracy's
ever gonna disappear, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but how could you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chill the fuck out,
that's what I'd like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like the one, that piece of advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wish they would take,
just calm the fuck down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it would take
a little bit more time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the next five or 10 years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll probably be much better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's sad, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I think what would
take one or two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in American companies, if you're that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like 10 years in Japanese companies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have to remember,
it's like an Island and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it is, I know, but it's so- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really telling though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when Japan is like still stuck in the '80s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with like how they run
their businesses sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, it just doesn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every single thing that's
like, why are they doing this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just a cultural thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It comes back to like, you know... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I definitely think one thing
that will really, really help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is just having an interest to listening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to what the foreign
market is doing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And a great start, for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is like working with foreign YouTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like us, for example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've convinced
some companies to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh yeah, actually, that's
a really dumb thing to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in our company," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they stopped doing it
and it's worked out for them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because we understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really telling, when we
understand the foreign market </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more than the actual industry here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're not even that
highly knowledgeable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like, that in-depth about
how the industry works, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We've just been around it
and kind of surrounded by it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You see it time and time again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where a Japanese company is like dead fast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and sticking to what they
wanna do and not changing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, if you even look at
like Konami, with Kojima. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They kicked Kojima out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they wanted to focus
on mobile games and Pachinko, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's all they fucking
do now, is Pachinko. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And sure, it's working great in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but as far as the Western
community is concerned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Konami is a dead fucking company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Konami died like five years ago, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think Capcom's kinda
doing the same road, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They made like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The moment Capcom axed
Mega Man, they was just dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then what was the other game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they brought out recently? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The top-down shooter
that was fucking awful? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't remember it.
- I don't even know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you keep up with them?
- Yeah, I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I keep up with all the game
news and it's just embarrassing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's like all Konami
does now is Pachinko. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - These companies that
were like Goliath companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that everybody knew who
Capcom and Konami was, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Capcom, Konami were giants in the NES. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They just couldn't adapt
to the generation, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But even with Konami
when they had Kojima, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Kojima, was steering
them on a good journey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know inside
politics, it looked like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean he was raking, like "PT" came out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was huge, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Silent Hills
- Silent hills, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they completely scrubbed
him from "Metal Gear Five". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's just one really
public occasion, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, just interacting with them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we see this kind of stuff
time and time again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like you have the perfect idea, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, "No",
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what we're
allowed to talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and what we're not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's also hard for them
to kind of try something new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they have no data to back it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If no one's willing to try
anything new, nothing happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no data for
something that's new, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are we allowed to talk
about the audio book, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for example? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Audio book? Sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, so when we did the audio book- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Yaoi one.
- the Yaoi one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go and buy it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were trynna pitch to
some of the companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying, "Hey, would you
mind, like, helping out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the funding of the audio book?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically, how the audio book got made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was I put all my money into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I hope that it sells
well I make my money back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's worth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one month of my life.
- Luckily did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Luckily you guys are
amazing, you guys bought it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was, I mean, not to be- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're so stressed out that
month, I remember. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, I was fucking losing it dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was stressing out my... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's like, when you
were in charge of it solely, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it just takes one person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to not do what they're supposed
to do to ruin everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so, shout out to Seigi man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing audio editor, he's came in clutch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he did an amazing job, and
it turned out really well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You did two, one was a test. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - One was a test, it worked out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we proved that it was successful, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we had the data that
this would sell well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we went around pitching to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Several different- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - basically saying, Hey you're
gonna get guaranteed sales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with this, would you like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And we have the data. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was like, hard evidence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that this would get you at
least X amount of sales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It would get you X amount of sales, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you would definitely get a
return on the investment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And none of them wanted to
like even remotely go close. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And what was the
reasoning behind the other? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, what was the reason? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember, it was something like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they just didn't think
it would work, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I think it was not that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just they didn't wanna
put their money into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They didn't wanna put that money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into something that they
had the hard evidence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that it would work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then we, I just decided that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause originally, we
were going to publishers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being like, "Hey, do you know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll choose one of your books." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Book Walker supported that one too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it was like Book Walker and
you supporting that project. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, both of us, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like we have a track
record that I've done it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but none of these companies were willing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to even give it a shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I didn't even need that much, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I produced the audio book for like $2,000, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a lot less than like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean that also helps- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For one month of time.
- For one month at a time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, doing it nonstop,
we made a video about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they were getting an insane deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And none of them wanted to do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we just chose one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just chose a book that I like, did it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's been like, what, like number one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every month? Top 10 I would say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its, yeah, top five, top three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a flex right there. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - For like every month since it came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like, it's so frustrating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wanting to do these bigger projects </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and none of these Japanese companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just wanting to even
give a chance when we- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's just called bad
fucking businesses. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We know that it works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we know that we can make this work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's so frustrating having
to work with these companies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've always been curious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you convince Book
Walker, a Japanese company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to start to start working
with Western YouTubers? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember like,
- I wanna know how that works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey was the first one.
- Joey was the first one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think Book Walker was
the first Japanese company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that ever contacted me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like, still now,
one of the only ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have like ever gone
out and contacted us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, without Book Walker- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and that was your idea, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, how did you
convince them to do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean before, I guess
using YouTubers, I was- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Using YouTubers, (laughing),
before we milk them dry! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughing) That's a bad way to say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry, before
collaborating with YouTubers- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get those buzzwords in Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was doing marketing for them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I guess I still was,
I'm not in Book Walker now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've tried so many things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've done like SNS ads, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or collaborations with the
cosplayers or fan art artists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I worked with anime clubs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, yeah, I worked with anime clubs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they had movie nights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or they wanna have, I
don't know, manga readings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, so you sponsor the movie nights? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- You paid them? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We gave them, like free books, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to say, "Oh, maybe you
guys should read it," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because the idea was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're going to be the
ambassador of their community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you give them like free
manga, they'll check it out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they'll give it to their friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - If only there was some way
to just reach a ton of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> really easily, like the
internet or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually did it-
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like giving them around thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, what's bigger than an anime club, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what's bigger than a cosplay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We gotta think bigger.
- Yes! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like, four
years ago, five years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's like,
four, five years ago now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I didn't even know that
anime YouTube was a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew like anime music videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very "illegal" stuff, in their eyes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've made anime music
videos, but anyways, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Gigguk and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fired from Book Walker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, so I just knew about that type </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like "anime YouTube". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I was a big follower </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of a lot of Japanese vloggers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not Japanese vloggers, Japan bloggers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, J-vloggers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then Joey appeared
in one of the videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the person that I was watching, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "This
person's called Anime Man?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, this is, oh this, this could, hmm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's some giga-brain
marketing right there. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, you didn't even know
he was an anime YouTuber? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If he wasn't called the anime man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you wouldn't have looked
into it. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Giga-brain marketing right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you weren't
even talking about anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I wasn't a J-vlogger- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was like Sharla's
video, Sharla in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, if I'm collabing with J-vloggers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna talk about... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I can talk about
other things. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I don't think I
was talking about anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think you were like mixing drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, something stupid.
- Maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I Googled you, not Googled you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just clicked your videos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I just started watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, what, there's
people that review anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would anyone wanna watch that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate reading people's comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like for example, Crunchyroll videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the bottom of the episodes-
- There's comments, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate reading those-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'cause, they might not
like the same character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't want people to say
they don't like what I like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's some garbage opinion.
- And I think I watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like dubs are better
than subs or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, I don't agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but let's see if he likes manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I emailed and I was like, "Oh..." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not gonna lie, the first
time I got your email, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it said like, from like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kadokawa.
- Yeah, Kadokawa, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, I think
this might be phish, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this might be a phishing email. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually thought the same, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I remember the
first time you emailed me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> immediate delete, 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way this is legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe I did email you,
and then I asked Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like, you know I think
this other anime YouTuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is not replying at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) 'Cause I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way Kadokawa's emailing me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was like, that Kadokawa? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I only know one Kadokawa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like the anime
company Kadokawa, nooo! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used Kadokawa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because Book Walker is actually
kinda like a subsidiary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like Kadokawa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It is 100% Kadokawa, but
no one knows at that time- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I'd never heard of Book Walker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I always knew Kadokawa, but I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is this shady company that's using- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I was just like, Kadokawa! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is this shady company
that's using Kadokawa's name? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, there's no way this is legit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got the email </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was living in
Australia still at the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh no, I was in Japan.
- You'd moved here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like four or six months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was
already in Japan, that's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember I sent that email, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I forwarded to my mom and dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to be like, does this look legit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I'm really scared to reply to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is it in English?
- Why is it in English, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and why is like, the name Meilyne? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, she doesn't sound Japanese, at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Southeast Asian girl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, well, you
know, I'll give it a go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it ends up being a phish, whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was the best email I ever sent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I asked you to come to the office too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's right, that's right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then when you gave me the address </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I looked it up on Google maps, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, okay, this is legit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in one of the Kadokawa's
office buildings or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I heard, was it true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that Kadokawa just didn't... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like, they wanted to meet
the YouTuber before they did- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not Kadokawa, it's
just Japanese businesses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like to know if they're a
real person or just, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to judge if they're good people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So if Joey wasn't in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> would there possibly have
been no collaboration? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause if Joey didn't come
to meet you guys in person- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Our first conversation
was actually on Skype. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would that have been good
enough to secure a deal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you reckon?
- Probably not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unless there's like a
foreigner in the group. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like at that time, I was the
only foreigner, probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I was the first foreigner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember like when I went
to the Book Walker office </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as well, that was like
probably the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I ever went to like a
physical meeting in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And since then, God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time a Japanese company is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we'd like to meet up with
you to discuss this thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, do you know
what email is? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think without like, I
mean, you guys starting it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like they wouldn't have
even considered YouTubers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I almost feel like the Japanese
companies talking to us- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it took me like
four months to get approved. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, not four months, maybe
two months to get approval. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is actually incredibly fast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to some of the other projects. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - After five years,
and my number changing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my email changing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had to like B-S a lot of like data, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my God, I'm gonna
get caught. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you cook the
books, Meilyne (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe, like inflow from YouTube- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I crunched the numbers. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I made graphs that was
like, the inflow from YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the best for reaching
the hearts of teenagers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So I still probably have that slide, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, YouTubers are this many. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's quantify how well YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can reach their viewer's hearts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're probably wondering
for the past hour, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what are these figures, we
don't know what this is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it's because this episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is sponsored by EJ ANiME STORE. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - EJ standing for
Entertainment Japan by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Carry on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - EJ ANiME STORE is Kadokawa's
official anime store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sells anime, gaming, manga- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Directly from Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you didn't know, Kadokawa's
published huge titles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> such as "Evangelion"! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's capitalized in the script. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The "Haruhi Suzumiya" series, "Re:Zero", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Konosuba" and more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And because Kadokawa is
producing these directly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what better way to support
the industry itself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is no better way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at all these beautiful things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we have on the table
that are from EJ ANiME STORE, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that you can get
your hands on right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at all this Asuna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's three Asunas in front, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh actually four Asunas
in front of me right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What does EJ stand for again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Entertainment Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To give you an idea of
the stuff that you can get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at EJ ANiME STORE, they've

<SPEAKER_01> - Speak of the devil,
this is one of the things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can get at EJ ANiME STORE. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is it Gigguk? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you have to aim for
my face Meilyne? (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is from "Fates", do
you know "Fates", Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's from one of the spin-offs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - From Fate/kaleid liner Prisma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we don't have it here,
but it should be on screen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the Fate/kaleid liner Prisma, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My God, the Illya Illyasviel von Einzbern </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wedding bikini version
one slash scale figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm fucking dying here. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did I just pronounce? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it does come with the
t-shirt that Gigguk is modeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you do buy that figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look at that, beautiful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the only Fate
franchise you should care about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's lesbian wallys in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I'm allowed to say that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's in the shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm also told the clothing
veil and other clear parts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are painted with pearl coloring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The veil perio and bouquet are detachable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's also this figure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the Date A Bullet Light Novel: </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> White queen 1/7 scale figure </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> - And this figure already looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just absolutely incredible,
so much detail in that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the best part about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is if you get this beautiful figure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then you can also get this
lovely B2 tapestry set </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, did they? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why are you guys here? (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think one thing that a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> might be interested in,
is that you're a foreigner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> working in like the anime
and manga industry in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're basically living the weeb dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So how did that happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How did you find a job
in Book Walker Kadokawa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as a foreigner? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know the story.
- I think I know the answer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Craigslist Tokyo. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you wanna tell the story
about how that happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, well I was working at a
marketing consulting company </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan, and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you've been living here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you had marriage
your Japanese person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, yeah, like my
first, second year in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah, I was working at
a digital marketing agency, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being a consultant for several
different Japanese companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who wanted to like get, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> global traffic to their site or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've said that weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That would still count as foreign, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> calm down Meilyne, it's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Am I sweating? (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't wipe it on the table. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just fine pine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where was I? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were talking about the global- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You threw me off and now I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is that even talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were talking about
how you got the job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at Book Walker.
- Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I needed a bicycle one day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I finished my work and
it was during lunchtime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, I can
just check Craigslist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for cheap bicycle, like
30 bucks, 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm checking on Craigslist
and then I found a bicycle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't buy it though,
and then I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I wonder if there's
like actually legit jobs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on Craigslist besides like foot
massage, or whatever it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 34 M looking for F. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the image that
Craigslist has in America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, or a fridge full of cockroaches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you're the one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You made me get that fucking
fridge full of cockroaches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you buy something on Craigslist, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you first look at it in
person and then you decide. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not going to some
fucking person's house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to check out a $10 fridge Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why didn't you Amazon it then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because-
- Now he knows better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - you were highly insistent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that Craigslist, may
as well be a cockroach, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Craigslist changed my life, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were so insistent that Craigslist, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Dude, you should really
go to Craigslist, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna get a mad deal." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, fine Meilyne, fine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll get a fridge from Craigslist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it got fucking
cockroaches in it Meilyne, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's on you.
- But now you have a story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do have a story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I love the story, but I hate you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, this job, what did it say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What jobs did you find on there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I think it was like-
- Looking for F. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It said like digital
manga marketing specialist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They're looking for something like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I click it and it doesn't
say the name of the company. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It says like, Oh, Chiyoda-ku, Iidabashi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, wait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's only two publishers
that I know of in this area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, it's
either this really big one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like this kind of the big-ish one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I Google all the, well,
I knew it was Kadokawa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I was like, oh, I'm gonna Google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single Kadokawa department </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and see what they're looking for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I found Book Walker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it matched exactly kind of
what the Craigslist thing was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which was, well, looking
for someone to go overseas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to different anime conventions
to market our service. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh, I love anime conventions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> No Japanese required, and
this was like five years ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my Japanese is nowhere fluent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And at that time it
was even more horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So getting into the anime
industry or manga industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you need to speak English, not English, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Japanese like fluently,
like beyond business. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh I'm never gonna work
in the manga industry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> unless it's like in America,
then I could like apply. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Glad you got it.
- Oh, yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like insane, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause if I saw that ad on Craigslist, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again I would think he was
a scammer or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like imagine Kadokawa
going on like advertising </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking job on Craigslist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They didn't say the company name though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just location. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's still on Craigslist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That makes it even more sketchy, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fully expected to
just be like Kodokawa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like one letter off, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, oh, it almost sounds
like Kadokawa. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a certain rent-a-girlfriend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like TamelyMart? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was fucking losing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> With all the letters, TamelyMart? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why it was so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The golden oldie, walkdonalds? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Never gets old, never gets old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gonna do a video on
Craigslist, I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are you laughing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I suck dick for video. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to see what was on there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so I found this ad that was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking for YouTubers below 10,000. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What is it all about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This was in London, so I called them up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was, no, no, not Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was gonna feel weird
about that in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I called them up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were like, "Yeah
we wanna pay YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> below 10,000 subscribers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> $5,000 to move to our
platform exclusively." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a woman on the phone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't tell her I had
like a million subs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she was just like, she was going on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she was like, yeah,
so we just need you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be in an exclusive deal
with our partners and all this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was so confused, I was like, what the? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never heard of this
platform since, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they were like, Oh yeah, but... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was a guy, obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like, yeah, but
we're only interested in women </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like red flags coming up, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wonder if I like stumbled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> onto the greatest prostitution
network or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'till this day, I still don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have the phone call recorded on my PC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I told them I had a million subs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they, they were like,
oh no, we're not interested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was also like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why 10,000? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was really confused about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it because if they
wanna like drop out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for example, it's just like trauma. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, Oh, this
guy's only got 10,000 subs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they won't go anywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They kept saying stuff that
was like too good to be true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, one, we'll
give you $5,000 to move, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were in the UK as well by the way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was already like, that's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then also they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can give you premium ad
rev rates of like $10 CPM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, get out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> $10 CPM? Fuck off, no
way, I was losing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> To this day, I still
don't know what that was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know why I told that story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you even check
their website thoroughly? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - They wouldn't me what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, it's down-low,
it's on the down-low. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, that's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds sketchy as fuck, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That sounds like a hiring
ring for like a prostitution, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a black market prostitution. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I never wanna use Craigslist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because every single story
I've heard from Craigslist, is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a part from yours-
- Apart from Meilyne's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Outside of Japan, I think
Craigslist is a sketch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you gone to like the
section where you can, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pay for favors? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can?
- Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, that's like the community
or something right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's one where it's
like for old people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all just like 40, 50 year old women </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> looking for like dudes
to just give them a good- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and UK, in the
U.S, I checked all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I wanted to see
if there's anything crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about Craigslist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't tell me you're
gonna make a video on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I will not.
- Okay, thank God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't tell me that's where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all the hot sexy singles
(laughing) in my area, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're all on Craigslist,
not KissAnime, God-damn it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why you're not
home sick. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if you just clicked
on the KissAnime ads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just takes you to the Craigslist? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It makes sense. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's wild, 'cause there
was like 40 year old women </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who were married showing their face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and giving them mobile phone number. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, whoa, you are
playing with fire, surely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That doesn't sound safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But also you're married, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw your face, Karen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every Karen is like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't know if it's their real photo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, true, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It could be very much a scam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It definitely has to be
their number though, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess we have to find out by calling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess there's only one
way to find out. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I would totally call her just
for a video, I'd do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I have like, no
qualms about doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But steering back to the conversation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I think we can all agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that Meilyne's story is very
much a rare case, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I-
- Is it a rare case? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never heard of anyone
getting into the anime industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> through Craigslist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's 'cause
people who you probably, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most people know or you
guys know are in the U.S, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> working for U.S. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was there ever a time you wanted to work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the U.S industry? (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What is that smile? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That smile paints just 1,000 words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the most nervous
smile I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there was two companies
that I applied to that were- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you get rejected Meilyne? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you get rejected? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that why you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they called back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, "You
are the second candidate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we were thinking about." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That hurts even more, I don't hear that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was like when I
was a fresh graduate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you wanna know if
you haven't got the job? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna know, I just wanna apply </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and move on.
- I wanna know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I also wanna know the reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're never gonna give it to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guarantee to every
person they dropped, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they said, "You were the second one." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Guarantee it.
- Honestly, we wanted to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I would do. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But what would be, cause
I'm fucking certain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that not just people
watching this episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I reckon like every
weeb living overseas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> probably has that dream somewhere
in the back of their head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're like, man
I wanna move to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna work in the anime industry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you get those emails as well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I get them.
- Everyone gets them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we all get them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So as someone who actually made it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what is the advice you would give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to people who want to chase that dream? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It took a year and a half, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's pretty fast though for Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no, you didn't get
the green card to move here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I was like what? No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's the
easiest way there, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, there's probably
guys that say like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can marry someone to get in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually, no, not really, I mean... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what advice would you give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for someone who's looking
to work in the industry- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - In Japan?
- Yeah, in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The most realistic way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would say learn some Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like the easiest way to get in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not flown, like, there's that JLPT </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's N1, N2 or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I've heard like, Oh, N2 is sufficient. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you can get to N2, you
can pretty much snag any job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not too language-focused. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or be extremely knowledgeable
about the industry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like the biggest thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause people ask us all the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like, "What's the best way?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, bro, I'm like
in the weirdest situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't take my career path, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a really weird career path. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just wanna stress, we're
not part of the industry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We work with the industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are not part of the industry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why are you asking a
YouTuber on immigration law? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know anything, you
think I know immigration law? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, dude.
- You should, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you immigrated here, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I barely know how to file
my taxes correctly, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But are a lot of Japanese
companies hiring foreigners? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yes they do actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Quite a lot are, especially
in the past year or two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they've expanded to the global market. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why are you-
- 'Cause people watching this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like, "Write that down,
write that down!" (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Open tab, Craigslist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japan knows how popular
anime is overseas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why, of course, there's
like the cool Japan thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - If Book Walker did a
job application today, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what would my CV, my
resume need to look like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What are we looking for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you can tell us this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're probably gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if a job opening ever opens up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd probably be the one
doing the interview, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So what would-
- What do you expect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from someone who wants to work in there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, I'm not
in like that team anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Give us your thoughts Meilyne, c'mon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like hypothetically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you almost have
to hire for GeeXPlus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which is also very similar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't be like an incel or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like don't be a nervous wreck- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So a bit of charisma. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And have like a social life, kind of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you got those really weird- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a real tall order for weebs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - When they come in, can
you sense it straight away? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, we did some like
interviews recently actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where we were like, we did it through zoom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like video call, and
the thing I was looking for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is like, they smile and like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I also, like, we ask them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's your favorite
anime series or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's not the anime series they choose, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the reason why they
like it or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - If they say Nomi, get
outta here. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "Oh my God,
he said that series," no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every application you're
gonna have from now on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every CV, it's
just like, not an incel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not and incel, smiles in a zoom call. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they have to have experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I would say experience
is like the biggest thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because-
- Experience in what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Working, like in a company actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anything?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I feel like
that's a lot of experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that a lot of people
are missing, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just working in a company environment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is actually really valuable in my opinion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Corporate experience, definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or if they're like fresh graduate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at least have a few
internships under your belt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause there's some people
in my previous companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've worked with in the past, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like they're new graduates,
they go into the job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they don't even know how to use Excel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if they're familiar with
all the Microsoft stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's something you
never like actively learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how to use, like Excel and Word, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's such a necessary skill to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working in a corporate job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is knowing how to use Excel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not in any job
application, but it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When I was working in the BBC, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to use Excel for fucking everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm convinced my engineering degree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was an Excel degree in disguise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm convinced, 'cause we
used Excel for everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had classes in high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that were specifically towards Excel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what's like the
main points on a resume. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if there's three most
things that you can have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a candidate for applying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What stands out the most for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're not talking about
like, don't be an incel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not like the final
judge with this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, but just like your opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just the way they write
their intro paragraph </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about themselves.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh shit, that's actually important. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - For me, I read it and I'm
just like, what do they say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did they sound passionate
or they're just copying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and pasting top 10 best
ways to write a cover letter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - In Japan, don't you
have to write every letter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and resume by hand? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- That's disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, that's too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what's that little job fair they do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they leave school,
what's that called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Where they spend a year trynna- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, shukatsu? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and they can write
up to 100 applications </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> by hand, the same shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I would lose my damn mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had to do that when I
was applying for internships </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan, I think I wrote 30. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And that wasn't nearly as much
as some of my friends did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Apparently they look out
for like, if you care enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, to me, that seems like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why is this the thing
that we're caring about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't care, I just want money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Give me the experience- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm here to make you money, shut up! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can we just be honest here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just say, why do you need this job? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I'm broke and I just graduated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I need the fucking money, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need a job! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just give me the job, fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you like it when they're
extremely passionate too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like not saying like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like a huge Love Liver, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've "Love Live" for everything." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's more like, you know,
I was in a different time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shout out to the Love Livers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would never hire
someone who's obsessed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with "Love Live", you know why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because that loyalty would
never lie with you, ever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> no matter what. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you can bribe them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, but for
how long can you bribe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How long can you bribe them, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you don't finish
this, I'm ripping it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your phone just slammed
on the floor, very dramatic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But okay, let's say, they're
addicted to "Gancha". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Who knows how long it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> before they do one too
many "Gancha" rules. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They coming at you with a raise,
they want a raise, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They wouldn't ask me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they would ask the CEO for the raise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, but hypothetically,
if you were the CEO, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then how would you respond to that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, first I would ask, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, what have you been doing
this past year differently? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And how much have you affected this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like how much has the sales
been affected by your work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And what do you wanna
try doing differently? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I gave you this much money,
what are you going to do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it really going to better your life? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's basically another job interview, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is what I'm hearing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I don't have any underlings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Underlings, my God! Overlord over here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because one thing I find fascinating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is how the story of like,
we all have you to thank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for this podcast and being here in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It takes an awful lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - An awful lot of what we've
done is thanks to Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like the brain child to a lot of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I find this-
- I just got lucky, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But how did the story of
GeeXPlus forming come to be? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you made GeeXPlus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - GeeXPlus is the agency
that we're all under, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the reason why we're here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the reason why we're here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So how did that come about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like Kadokawa has a new business contest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or competition every year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then within their departments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they also do business competitions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the first year I
decided to submit something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was the GeeXPlus thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And usually, well, I didn't
wanna submit it before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause there was like, the
prize money was like this much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then this particular year
the prize money was like this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, maybe I want that money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So wait, wait, I gotta ask, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I remember the exact
meeting where you asked me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> she asked me in the meeting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Have you ever considered
moving to Japan?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we were just casually talking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, just casually talking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But did you have that prize money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and that competition in
mind when you asked me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. (laughing)
(Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, man, I respect it.
- I respect the hustle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "I don't give a shit about
these YouTubers coming out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I want that cold-hard cash." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you allowed to
tell us how much you got? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, people will say,
"Oh, it's not that much." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was like, I think
they told me was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh the price is going to be like (beep). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like a decent bonus.
- Yeah, it's not bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But what I wanna know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is how you managed to convince them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because as we've all talked about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese companies are fucking difficult- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They never wanna try anything new. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - to try anything new. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And convincing a Japanese company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to send over like three or four AniTubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just sponsor their
visas and help get up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I had an advantage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You guys have been working
with Book Walker for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> at that point, like two,
three years already? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I had data, and they love data. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We know from the Yaoi audio book, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that that's not always the case, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's not guaranteed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That wasn't enough though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like three years worth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Never enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all about that data. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Excel sheets, the Excel sheets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, Excel sheets and PowerPoints. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I think in the back of their mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were already thinking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh if we had this business,
it would be interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And my superior, Ross, at
that time was giving me a tip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, maybe you should submit that idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause maybe they're thinking about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, okay, I
guess I have enough data, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so let's do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I won the thingy, and then- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you have like, was it
like an apprentice type pitch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where you had to go into
like a boardroom meeting and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I attended one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was the, like, first week I moved here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, do you
wanna come to this thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and then you
met Mr. Kadokawa, like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I just sat down
in the most sterile room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can imagine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imagine just like 100,
200 Japanese businessmen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the quietest room in
your life and I came in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I came in midway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I was making so much fucking noise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just trynna to sit down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course my seat was in the middle- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you're the only non-Asian in there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like the only, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like I was the only one not
on the suit of some sort </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I come in with like
my t-shirt and jeans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> making some noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, excuse me, excuse me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sat down, and then one
of the Japanese people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kept translating in my ear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, just stop translating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're making too much noise,
and people are looking at us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just pretend like
I know what's happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But they were all really
good sports about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they were nice to me afterwards. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like that, we had
like a new business plan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> format document, you fill it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then within that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was like over 200,
maybe around 200 applicants. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it narrowed down to like 50, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then when you're the
top 50, they narrow it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't do anything, you just
like make like a three year- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Business plan?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where did I go? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- Why did I go again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was free food and drink, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was really good sushi and free beer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so it was really good, sorry, go ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If there's free food and
drink, I'll go to anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, not gonna lie, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you were bored,
probably, you had no friends- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had no internet.
- They didn't arrive yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They weren't there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I felt bad
'cause I'd been crashing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on Joey's couch for like a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt really bad that
was bothering him so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's fine.
- I know, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, okay, this is the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Company parties, at least in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't spare any
expense with food and drink, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they like do such good food and drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, Meilyne's a food snob,
I don't count her opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought it was good,
it was good, it was okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they have like bomb food and drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's always so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll have restaurant quality
food just there for you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, yeah, okay,
yeah, I wanna try that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a restaurant though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, no, it's like a hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just bring in a platter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just like, dig in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, sweet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And all you can drink alcohol. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - People, awkward people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the Japanese women taking
photos 'cause you told them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they were like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were like, "This is
the guy who made the Yaoi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one that we're going to
check for the sex noises." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Book Walker support team, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they're mostly women, and then... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the man. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're like all fan girls
of you I think. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The 93%, back at it again.
- Let's go, let's go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was so confused </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like none of them
could speak English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, why are
you listening to my stuff? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some of them are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The reason why they knew about you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was because I think it was last year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we did the first audio book, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were playing it on speaker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they would get
like emails from customers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying, "Oh I don't know
how to play this MP3," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so they're like, "Oh, let's
check if there's a problem" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they play it and they just
end up playing it on speaker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did they play the new one on speaker? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The new one has like a
hardcore sex scene at the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because, what is it, Corona virus? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were working from home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they played it on
the speakers at home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was weird, 'cause
then I was just eating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they were like,
"Can we take a picture?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Who are you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are you-
- We're your fan girls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So did you expect to win
the competition at all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or was it like a fucking surprise for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kind of a surprise, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I knew I was the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, like my boss at the time was saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like, Oh you have like,
maybe a high probability </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he was the one reviewing
the other business things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So maybe he helped me a lot, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's a pretty
radical idea, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially in such a traditional
company like Kadokawa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know what other ideas
you were competing against? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there were kinda
like manga service, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like manga subscription
or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That would be good as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that would be good for japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - JP, ever heard of that? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I kinda want to talk
about the opening party </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of GeeXPlus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because that was probably
the most extra business party </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever been to.
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So sad I wasn't there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So Connor wasn't there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because he was at the
Crunchyroll anime awards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he was, there was about like 10 iPads </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scattered around this entire like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three.
- Three iPads, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, three iPads, whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scattered around this like
two-star Michelin restaurant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What was the restaurant
that it was held at? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Iniwa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's owned by Kadokawa, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I didn't know that
Kadokawa owned so many things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of just like anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and manga.
- Multimedia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and so we were at this
two-star Michelin restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and Connor had to join
us via Skype or zoom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever you were using. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was like a stupid
time for you, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like-
- Your face was like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like, yeah, like
10, 11:00 PM or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I had to do a speech </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like the most
fucking awful speech. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember you were in
the fucking hotel room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a downward angle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I was just like,
(speaking in Japanese). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He said it all in Japanese,
and I was like, wow! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor speaking Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To explain, so this is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are a lot of important
people at this party. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many people were there?
Maybe like 50 plus, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 50 plus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically they was like,
Mr Kadokawa was there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like pretty
much any anime company- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - MyAnimeList CEO </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The CEO of MyAnimeList was there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't even that he
was Japanese, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Danny Choo was there.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically any
company that is in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> any big company, there
was a representative </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for that company there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This was like the biggest dick energy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever been-
- And Connor on an iPad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember we had to do a speech </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of all these important people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember the CEO of GeeXPlus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he introduced us to make our speech. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like fucking shitting myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because man- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could see you were shitting yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was shitting myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I had to talk in front
of all these fucking people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I couldn't speak a lick of Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I had to speak in English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I remember that he introduced us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember hearing something like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, the heroes of anime." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I turned to Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, my Japanese
isn't the greatest, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but did he just call
us the heroes of anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for Western anime fans? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Joey was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was just thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> why would he lie like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The heroes of anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like doing the blinking meme, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair though, I
would say it's kinda true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there's a lot of people that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a lot of people
who would disagree with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of people call
us the villains of anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if anything, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some people would probably, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> who are in the middle of nowhere
that have no anime friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're getting bullied for it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like, "Oh
these people like anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're actually cool?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, punch 'em back.
- Anime is not a lame thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes, you're cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All I remember was, I was suited up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney was suited up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then Joey walks up in fuckin'... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember what you were wearing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was in a JoJo shirt, and like shorts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I looked at Gigguk,
like so properly dressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like collar, shirt and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney was in like this really nice dress, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just there with like
my jeans and fucking sneakers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, "Ss'up,
hero of anime right here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I took that to another party as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like, "Oh my God,
that's how YouTubers dress?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like, you know... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Celebrity wear.
- Celebrity wear? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Celebrities wear like jumpsuits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm so celebrity, I
wear Uniqlo everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't think
that anyone understood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what I actually said in my speech. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're the only one who
anyone could understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was told no one could hear me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of them did speak English though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you started speaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and the speakers just weren't on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All we could see was-
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's an amazing speech,
it such a good speech. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was more hilarious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just not only just
Connor's speakers not being on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just 50 Japanese business men, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like really seriously
just looking down at the iPad, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just being like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were paying attention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have to bear in mind as
well, I can't see anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm just talking to a
webcam, I don't see shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So as far as I know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm just talking in
the fucking void over here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with my shitty Japanese,
(speaking in Japanese). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God.
- That was really funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no, that was like a
really interesting experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me 'cause that was
like a holy shit moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Have I made it? Is this the point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We met some really
fuckin' cool people there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who was like, the person you
met that stood out the most? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or which company did
you like freak out over? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obviously like the Shonen
Jump guys were there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think the coolest one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because it just kinda
came out of nowhere was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I was talking to
the Shonen Jump people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were like,
what manga do you like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you interested in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously I laid out a
bunch of Shonen Jump stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then one of the guys was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, what about stuff
that's not Shonen Jump, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm just genuinely curious." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think I said "Berserk" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I fucking love "Berserk". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then literally the moment
after I said "Berserk", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some guy tapped me on the shoulder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> almost like, "Hi, I'm
the publisher 'Berserk'." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, (gasping)
- The editor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was things like dusty? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "I've never done that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been hired for five years
and I haven't done anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never even met Miura
in my life. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So, he said that and I read the card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, Oh shit, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like the publication of "Berserk". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just said, like, "Not to be rude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck is Miura doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is he doing?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's going on?
- What's going on with that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's jump right into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, "You're his publisher right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just give me the details,
what's he doing?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "Oh no, he's
working hard, don't worry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Yeah, that's what
they all say." (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Idol master in the
background, "I'm working hard." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you winning, son? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but that was really cool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Danny Choo was really cool-
- Danny Choo was really cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - because I think it's safe to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Danny Choo she is one of those people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who really put anime weeb
culture in the West on the map. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I think it's not
too much of a stretch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to say that without
Danny Choo's influence, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think any of us would
really even be interested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Japanese culture,
especially people on the West. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He did so much for,
not only like our culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but our industry as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause he was one of the first
foreigners who moved to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and really put a highlight
on a lot of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going on in the Japanese industry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He had to blog about it.
- Yeah, exactly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause before, I remember it was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan was just kind of a black hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Nobody knew shit that
was happening in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just got anime somehow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But he actually spotlighted
a lot of the things going on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if not for him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably wouldn't even
have even considered moving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to Japan or have any interest
in the industry itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He did some great motivational speeches </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at a lot of events like anime expo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And he's a really down
to earth guy as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's so humble, incredibly
incredibly humble. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything he's done,
he's like so humble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so down to earth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He just showed up with his doll. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he showed up with this smart doll, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, that was so cool,
shout out to Danny Choo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you should have been
there bro. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pissed off I missed out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How was the Crunchyroll
anime awards compared to that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, one day I
came back into my room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was a trash bag full
of stuff that wasn't mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you believe that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - In your hotel?
- In my hotel room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who went in there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I called them up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey, there's a, just a giant
bag of trash in my room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's up with that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, "Really?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They didn't believe me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, come, come. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The maids probably cleaned up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I think what they did
is the maids were cleaning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and they just forgot the
bag, so I didn't care much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They gave me a letter that was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Dear CDawg, sorry that we
left trash in your room." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, why is it CDawg? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably the name that
they put on the reservation? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was Connor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I checked in with
my real name and I know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy must have known or
something, it was weird as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause then he gave me
another bottle of wine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was like a terrible
hotel screw-cap wine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I wouldn't
even cook with this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No offense, it's like, it
was fuckin' garbage wine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I'm not picky,
but even I knew that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How was the actual awards? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, how was it for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we both went on different years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I imagine it was the same for you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the best aspect was just
chatting to the other creators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It felt like a holiday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you just got to meet other creators. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got to eat Chipotle, I've
been missing Chipotle a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, 'cause we would
all eat lunch together, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Chipotle,
I want Chipotle," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then one of the, I
forgot her name, from IGN. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think she was Hispanic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was like, "No,
Chipotle's garbage." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Listen, I come
from a place recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they don't have any Chipotle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know how hard
it is to find a burrito </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bigger than like your index
finger in this country? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Impossible."
- I think out of every cuisine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mexican is one of the
hardest to find in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want a burrito that
like fucking kills me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So anyway, it was nice
having lunch with them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry, I'm going on a rant there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, it was pretty
cool, the offices were cool, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they've made it into like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you got to see
the offices, didn't they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I felt like a little
extra, like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a lot of free LaCroix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't really care for LaCroix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's LaCroix?
- You know LaCroix, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like the meme drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the most
disgusting thing I ever had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that like White Claw? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, LaCroix is like, it's like salted? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Flavored, sparkling water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was weird, 'cause I think
you went two years in a row. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I didn't go to the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where they were streaming
out, the Twitch headquarters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where they streaming
at the Twitch quarters? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, they were streaming in their office. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay.
- So that was like a back room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with a small crowd of about
100 people, and it was fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really got bored of how many
times you had to practice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many times did you have to rehearse? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ' Cause we only-
- Four times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - we only had to rehearse once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Four fucking times.
- Jesus, four? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What were they rehearsing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was for the host, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause obviously, he had a lot of lines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> For me it was easy, I just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, during the rehearsals,
by the way, I mean gone... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, so I gotta tell the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they wanted us to have
a mixture of scripted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and do your own stuff as I
think it should be, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I want to be on track,
but I also wanna be myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So they would ask me a
question that was kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Who do you think is best skilled?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And during rehearsals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I never said like anything
even remotely Mimi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Oh yeah, like Rem." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I texted Gigguk like
an hour before the show start, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Yeah, give me the worst girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Give me the worst, best girl, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I will dead-ass say
this like straight face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of all these
people, like I'll do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll do it on the Twitch
stream, I don't mind." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I thought, I wanna make this funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In a good way, that wasn't
fucking with Crunchyroll, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's a way that we could
get a bit of laughter out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I said Nina from "Code Geass", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the first name that came to mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember I said that joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and the fucking crowd's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no one got it.
- I watched the stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was fucking pissing myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought to myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I knew no one was
gonna laugh at this joke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just thought to myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, the Twitch
chat, they're gonna love it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitch chat's gonna love this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't mind, I'll just put
up with the awkward silence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like one second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was watching the Twitch stream, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the moment you said that, I died, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitch chat was fucking loving it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the crowd in the audience
and everyone's there, dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember the moment I said it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason, Jacob
from Fakku was in the crowd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just made eye contact with Jacob </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he looked like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, and I think I
made like a joke or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I made something to
like try and segway it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it didn't work very well obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It made for a great clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was like so
perfectly timed of my stream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was like, yeah,
I told Connor to say Nina, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and as soon as I said that, you said it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just like the
most perfectly timed moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could ever hope for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Asked me, what he should say for this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in the chat, he was like,
"They're gonna ask me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who the all time best girl is." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What'd you tell him? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I told him, say Nina from
"Code Geass". (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Panelist] Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Umh, Nina from "Code Geass". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was, it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it was fun, we
hung out in the green room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever, it was
chill, just chatting with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember, I chat with
ProZD, really cool guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That man knows his anime,
he knows a lot of anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He knows so much anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I had a similar
conversation with him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, man you know,
more anime the most AniTubers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We were just in this
room and it was silent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you would just hear someone playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking "Love Live". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just ProZD sitting there like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's a Love Liver? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's a hardcore Love Liver. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love it when like, when he would talk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it would be like
whenever ProZD talked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone in the room was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yes, ProZD, I'll listen to you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He got such a commanding
voice, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who has the deeper voice in real life? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like just two mumbles
talking when they're talking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's like, "Get McDonald's," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I be, "Yeah, I'll get McDonald's." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The subwoofer on this
conversation is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Overall it was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that the parts I remember the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are like not the actual, like awards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Same, I don't remember anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all that happened was
that when I was on stage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember when I
was on the Crunchyroll, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was a big fucking crowd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How big was your crowd? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like no more than 100. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, 'cause we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they rented our whole
stage in LA or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They had like a red carpet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which like, an orange calm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was charming about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was still like
a small scale event, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they really tried to dress this up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to look like something official. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, there was a
lot of technical difficulties </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and mess up, but that's
probably like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you watch the streams- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The technical difficulties
in that year were glorious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They made for like great meme material. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like charming in its own way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it wasn't like The Game Awards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it wasn't the fucking Oscars, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know, they tried their best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think for what they had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they did like a pretty decent job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - B plus for effort, I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think they said that
they wanted to dial it back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this year to make it a little more like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have personality shine through a bit more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's still hard
because I think sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> some people aren't as
good on stage as others. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that your first
time kind of "hosting"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wasn't doing anything? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was literally just sitting
on a couch, cracking jokes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only thing I was nervous
about was cracking that joke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I knew that was gonna,
I knew no one would laugh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I didn't mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But other than that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really don't mind doing
stuff like that, that's fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember the only
weird thing that happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was on stage was, I
was standing next to Lily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was hosting with Lily Puchi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was presenting my award, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so I was staying at the bright lights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all I heard was, (muffling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I thought someone
said, "I love you guys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I shout out in the Crunchyroll awards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I love you too, man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I've watched the vods, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the guy shouts out, "I
love you, Lily." (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That would be even better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be like, no, I love you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You may not love me, but
I love you unconditionally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't think
anyone noticed there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah, I thought
you were just screaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for us both there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When they did the final award, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at Crunchyroll anime awards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they had like a giant,
like what is it called? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The fucking thing they open, what's it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sake? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I think it is, they all had Sake, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's part of the story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but they have like the
big boxes that we had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the names of the winners in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the anime of the year
had like a giant one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what they're called, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know what you're talking about though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So when they did the giant one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like, "Yeah, okay,
everyone's gonna go on stage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we have a fake Sake
for you, it's water." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, oh cool, cool, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I have it right, and I'm
smelling it like next to Lily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you can see me
and Lily in the VODs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like visual confusion, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we do it, I'm like,
"That's fucking Sake." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They told us it was fucking water! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Me and Lily are like,
"God that's fucking vile." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, "Yeah, that's gross." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They lied to us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Crunchyroll, what if I
was allergic to alcohol? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They gave you free alcohol
and you didn't even know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause there was alcohol
right after in the after-party. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, so we know that you're
now working for Book Walker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and GeeXPlus and all that,
that's really great Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why say it so condescending? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that's not what
I care about Meilyne, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna know what you were doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you were younger in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What jobs were you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We wanna know about your week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is your path to
getting to where you are now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We want the viewers to recognize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with your shonen protagonist art, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we need to build up Meilyne's character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've told all of our back stories, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's time for us to tell your back story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Backstory? Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I used to go to a lot
of anime conventions- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As you do.
- Yes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and, where am I going with this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how you met your husband right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot to tell the story
or not tell the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to say like the biggest tip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is to envision what position
you want in the anime industry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and make like steps to get there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the steps I made for myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is one, keep going to a
lot of anime conventions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and make friends that work in some, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the industry.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And one of the people
that I met at a convention </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> happened to bring Japanese rock bands, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, Japanese rock bands to
the U.S anime conventions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then that person introduced
me to a lot of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that were in Japan and the
hardest thing for a foreigner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for someone to get there... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, sorry, the hardest thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is to get into Japan with the visa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Finding a job that'll give you a visa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you don't speak good
Japanese is extremely difficult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the first thing I did was get a job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has no relation to
anime, to get the experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then try to do a consulting job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that consults for anime figure,
like, type of companies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, after that, meet
people from that industry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> get the know-how from them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then apply to the job that I have now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But, gosh, I'm like-
- Damn, that's calculated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I calculated everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At the end of the day,
you know, it's that age old, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like, it's not what you
know, it's who you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I've heard similar
stories with other friends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Nabi, who I had no idea
how he knew so many people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember asking
him and he was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, just go to enough events, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just talk to enough people." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a lot of events here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> For me I'm like a nervous wreck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we could tell. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do not be fooled by
Meilyne's nervousness, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> she is a killer.
(dramatic music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's only you guys in the room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that's why I'm comfortable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's like, if there's more than that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> holy, oh my god, this
would be soaked. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So like you have to meet people, network. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And a lot of people will
find that difficult in the U.S </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and abroad, 'cause the only
place I could possibly think of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like conventions and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in Japan, there are
so many official events </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can go to to meet people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What would you recommend then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what should people look out for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they wanted to just
be in the right place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the right time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a lot of
Facebook groups actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and a lot of these Facebook groups </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> are for like the otaku community, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes they have industry people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as surprise guests or like just show up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So go to those and you can meet people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or when there's like,
they're kinda like panels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> industry panels, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can meet people at the
after party of these things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - From experience, I've had people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one thing I know that doesn't work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is to just go up to someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, "Hey, I'm this person, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here's my business card, call me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, I don't
know what you do bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you want to do with me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had that so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They come to you really like
suave, like, "Here's my card, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I expect to hear from you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You small talk first though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least explain what is the purpose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of you going up to people, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what is the kind of
connection that you want? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not just about like,
"I wanna make a connection </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I want a connection." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's about, why do you
want the connection, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you wanna do with the connection </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and explain why it'll be
mutually beneficial, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'll just be like, "Here's
my business card, call me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you know that they would
be in a beneficial position </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I might just play dumb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "Oh yes, what do you do?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They'll tell me and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, no way, I'm in the same industry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But then they're like,
yeah, that's organic, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the whole time, I'll be like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because a lot of weebs don't realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that one of the most important
skills you need to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when getting a job in any
industry, it's just social skills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God-dam it, no! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not a lot, you just
gotta learn social skills. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I don't wanna talk to people! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually tutored random
people in English, in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to develop social skills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like, it should be
inspiration for all of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If this nervous wreck can
develop enough social skills </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to be working in the industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and convince fucking Japanese companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to form GeeXPlus, there's
hope for you as well, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No amount of social anxiety
is gonna stop you, alright? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause the first time I called you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Wow, why is
she so fucking nervous?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - On the phone, I think you were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's okay, don't be nervous." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Oh it's just,
it's winter, it's really cold." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause my voice gets shaking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the worst thing
to say though, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and it got me more nervous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Saying "Don't be nervous," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just gonna get them more nervous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I was like,
"Why are you so nervous?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you said that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "No,
it's cold, it's cold." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't know that was like-
- That's a no-no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanted to see what kind of
reaction Meilyne would give, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanted to see,
'cause I just got a vibe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you would react really funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We met in real life first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> at the anime expo.
- We did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why I didn't mind.
- And then you said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same thing, you were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, you don't have to be so awkward." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause we were talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, "Well, I
don't know if we can, um," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, what the fuck's
wrong with you? (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I remember my
first business meeting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with you as well and whenever
Meilyne's negotiating, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the most hilarious
thing I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When we had the piece of paper out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "How about this?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's so obvious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't like the deal that's offered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, (humming). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "How do I say no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without sounding like an asshole?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know how she says it, she says, "Oh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> When you hear Meilyne saying that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're immediately like,
"Oh, it's not good, is it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was about to say, you can
write a fuckin' dictionary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on your fuckin' ohs, and
like, which tone you say it in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just communicates something
completely different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You even type it to us as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I'm texting you about a business deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "Oh they
came back with this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you think?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And you legitimately come back with, "Oh," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and immediately I'm
just like, "Say no more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know exactly what you mean." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remembered a story, I
don't know if I've told this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I told you guys about the time
at "Promare" there was a guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, when I was at the
premier of "Promare", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was sitting in the Studio Trigger seats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause a friend got me into
the Studio Trigger seats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, well, it's fuckin' cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm sitting on the end
of the Studio Trigger seats, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Promare" is about to start, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's obviously Studio Trigger seats </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause all the seats say
reserved for Studio Trigger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm sitting there, and this
guy in like a final fantasy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Claude cosplay comes up to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and he goes, "Hey do you work at Trigger?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, no, these guys do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, and then I say that to him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and was like, Oh I've made a mistake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause then he's like, "Oh, hello." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'm like, Oh my god." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Over me, he's like, "Hello?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Bear in mind, he's full
costume, fuckin' giant sword. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "How do I get
a job at Studio Trigger?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to this Japanese man who
can't speak a word of English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like (sound) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you should've just
been like, "Not like this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bro, I don't think
this is the right time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He asked that to them,
they were visibly confused, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, "Bro, I don't
think this is the right play." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, what The fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With these kinds of people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do they expect the answer to be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Be like, "Oh yes, here's my
business card, contact me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "You were the right guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We were waiting for
someone to be bold enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to ask us at the 'Promare'." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) Like, no, fuck off! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like no, that's not how you get a job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like one of those
moments, I was like, "Oh no." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's secondhand embarrassment, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the biggest L
I've ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, advice, at your next convention </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you see an industry
guest, don't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not how you get a job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think they're looking to hire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they're at conventions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The person that's
like, the hiring person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wouldn't go to that
event anyways, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, if I ran an anime company, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the last place I would go to hire people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is the anime convention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just seems like the way to get hired </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japanese companies it's just
first to be in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - In Japan or like apply to U.S companies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like Crunchyroll and Viz Media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Being outright and so like, not even, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, that's a little
aggressive asking, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that kind of way, just doesn't work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you gotta insert yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You weren't even cosplaying
as a Trigger character, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're cosplay is fuckin' Claude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So if he turned up full,
like real "Kill la Kill". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - As you can see I am a
fan, can I have a job? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like our audience
knows what we think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about working in Japanese companies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How has it for you who actually
works in a Japanese company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the industry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I worked in different Japanese companies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before the anime one, awkward mode on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's okay, it won't hurt
you, it's a microphone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, you want me
to say it's like exciting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like nervous.
- No, just be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are the rumors true, are
Japanese companies hell? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause just like black companies, white. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so like, Japan
has like this terminology </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like, it's black or it's white. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> White is like, they follow the rules, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they treat their employees nice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then black is like, they overwork you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they ask you to work like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 12 hours or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But no, I got really lucky, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The company I work for is
really like very aggressive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about telling their employees, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Go home, have a social life." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And they highly, highly value that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's good.
- Well, what do you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about the Japanese like
work-life schedule? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - As someone who lives there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's on average Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they work on average 80 hours a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 80 hours a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How was like your work-life schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to when you are
working outside of Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you have any comparison. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I only worked
for an American company </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in like San Francisco
for a month before I quit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and chase my anime dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess, based on that
one month experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, in America I would just clock out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and leave that's it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here, it's like, you wanna
impress your supervisor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with good results and sometimes
to get those good results, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it doesn't
necessarily make more time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if you spend more time
doing more research... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Meilyne's a hard worker.
- I don't know, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - On the polar opposite, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you got like the Scandinavian countries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which are like six hours a day is fine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four days a week, that seems good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, there's been plenty of studies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that prove that working more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't necessarily mean more money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, there's studies to actually prove </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the opposite of that,
which is working less </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tends to be more productive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's where
the whole controversy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of the whole thing comes from, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where like employees of
traditional companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> are almost forced, like socially, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not a rule in the company, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they're almost socially
bound to stay back overtime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think they should though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not because they need to do the work, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but because as you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they wanna impress the supervisors, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, kind of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But there are some times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they really shouldn't stay behind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if they're not really
"working" or working </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because it really takes a
toll on their mental health. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like for me, usually before an event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the month or month and a half, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm actually working like really late, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like 11:00 PM or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because crunch time type of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I felt like, miserable
during those times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I can only imagine how
miserable Japanese people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at Japanese companies that do overtime- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel sorry for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I felt angry for no reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, why am I angry? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, it's because, am I working too much? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I really loved what I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even if you love what you do though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you get tired, you get cranky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's the same as us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, we love our jobs
but we're always working, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we never get a break but
even though we love what we do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's times when I fuckin' hate anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're just like, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are times where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't wanna work on this video man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wanna play games." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, I know.
- Watch porn or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like anything else to
just get my mind off of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Two hour porn marathon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just watch it. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just one of those days, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the convention
time like for you then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because for us, it's like,
especially AX is busy as hell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I've seen people
working in the industry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> working fucking overtime when
it comes to convention season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder as well, expanding on that is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how does it all work with
industries and the conventions? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can only speak from my
particular perspective or spot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wouldn't expect you to
be the arbiter of knowledge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on conventions. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japanese companies, I
think they have to prepare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot more than U.S companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we have to consider </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people that don't speak
English coming over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and their first time
exhibiting at an event, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and the amount of time it
takes to ship something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, if they're going to sell something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at overseas at the convention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shipping it might be a problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it takes like a lot of time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be fair though,
if I can say something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if it's just Kadokawa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've noticed with any booth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is run by a Japanese company, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the amount of staff they
have, it's kinda ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's usually like a supervisor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's watching another supervisor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching other supervisors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the entire supply
chain watching each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - In American company booths, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it's like two to five max. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The Kadokawa booth had like 60 people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember going inside
the Kadokawa booth, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember there was like 30 employees. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, this is just stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The reason is, each person,
like, even within Kadokawa, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> say these are all from the same series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or no, not the same
series, same publisher, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each department has a
different person in charge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and that person charged
needs to be there to like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But this feels like it's been like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But do they though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This feels like this
should've been like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Coordinated, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just get like one person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to just kind of look over everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then once the event
is done, just report that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Seems like a lot of redundancy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's also important
for them to go overseas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're like, their mind is open, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you become open-minded? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like how American otakus are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the problem is, half the employees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't come out of the booth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they don't even get to
experience the culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they can see, or
hear from outside the booth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like what item's being sold
the most and like take men- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what do they think
of foreign conventions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the foreign culture
then, from your perspective? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've heard think it's
like, wow, amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So different and like, so open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to the fan otaku culture here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I've heard from
a lot of Japanese people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fans here are really uptight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like for example, like
Comiket or anime events here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't go there and cosplay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you would bring
shame to the event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, I've heard that story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually, my friends
and I cosplayed at Comiket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like six years ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were the top
trending thing at that time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on tuchan, saying "These
three American girls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cosplaying as "Love Live" on the train." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And shame on me for not
doing my research beforehand- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But still, chill.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I had like friends in America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese friends in America messaged me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What are you guys doing over there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't cosplay in the train." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't it fun though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd love to see a cosplay on the train. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had like a circle follow
us from station to station. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, "Oh,
can you take that off?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But we were only wearing the wig. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I was wearing normal
clothes, just the wig. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're not even
allowed to wear a wig. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and then my friend told her, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, "You know, we're
only wearing the wig," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like, "No, they
know from your hair, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what character you are." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But look, I understand if
it's something gratuitous, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you were all
cosplaying as fuckin' Ryuko, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like a little
more like scandalous right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, it's "Love Live",
you're in school uniform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The only thing that separates
you from a regular school girl </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is just the wig. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But to be fair, they
wanna protect this culture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they wanna keep having these events. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just gate keeping.
- That is gate keeping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For example a normie
would be on the train </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they see some crazy cosplayer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't it fun though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also like anime otakus in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't viewed in like a positive light. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think they necessarily
are though in the West. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't feel like
there's as bad a stigma </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to this here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They think you're like
sweaty and I mean, I am, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, sweaty (laughing). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just so weird,
you watch the weird stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cosplay's not even that weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I rocked up on the London
underground in a maid outfit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, just did it, just like
40 minute commute, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone loves it,
they're like all laughing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> all giggling and asking questions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Were they being like,
"What do you cosplaying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or dressing up as?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get heckled from the
other side of the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like, you know,
it's just good fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I thought it was funny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but obviously, I guess- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's such a weird double
standard though, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it's like, anime-loving otakus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like, "Ooh, sweaty, gross." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then meanwhile, if
there's a guy rocking up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like full on like,
you know, idols shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like, "Yeah, he
just really likes idols." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no, he's just a sweaty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of people think it's gross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Every time I told Japanese people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like, "Oh, I'm an otaku," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like, "No, you're not,
you don't look like otaku." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What does otaku look like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, really, how
dare you insult my people? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like what do they
expect an otaku to look like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Where it's like, you're
fuckin' 300 pounds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's like how the word weeaboo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> used to be seen like 10
years ago in our community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where, who would identify
themselves as a weeaboo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like a cringy person
nobody wants to know, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the stereotypical
otaku in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't see people like that anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There's people who like anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's just normalized here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like 20 year old girls
have like the Ita-bags, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and love 2d boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everyone loves JoJo's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like the Chi-Chi, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you just where JoJo
merch to a business meeting- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just feels so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll get like a 50
year old businessman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, I love JoJo's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was buying manga,
like my local bookstore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was wearing one
of the glam JoJo shirts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a guy stopped putting in the books </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's like, "Where'd
you get that shirt from?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Oh, glam." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like, "That looks sick, dude." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He just high fived me, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never had this experience in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously this was before the
pandemic, social distance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everyone clapped. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And everyone in the
store applauded Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then they played the
JoJo opening and I left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - JoJo's theme came on.
- As I run out the store. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, he just straight up high-fived me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Jojo brings people together
man, that's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember I mentioned in my, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when I streamed the
dating in Japan video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mentioned like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just openly said I was an otaku, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why are people getting
all worked up about it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I've got loads of comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like, "It means
a bad thing in Japan." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, yeah, I
know, I just don't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If I can normalize it, I
can help to get there, sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Someone wants to see
it in a negative light, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's their prerogative. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of the people that I told it to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just didn't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Going back to conventions though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing I've always been curious about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is how would you guys pick
the guests to bring over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and showcase to people? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is there a process behind that or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, for my company, there was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> at the time when I was like
the person in charge of events. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We would look first at the
sales, like, oh, what's trending, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's like the top selling manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or light novels, the top 10, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I just contact them, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And because I'm in Book Walker, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and Book Walker like has really close ties </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to all different kinds of publishers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess we're able to ask them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That makes sense, 'cause I've
done so many creative panels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> especially at AX with Book Walker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like "DanMachi",
"Overlord","Goblin Slayer", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Monster Musume". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember every time
one of those panels finish, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's always one person who
comes up to me for some reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of all people and it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, next year can you get
the author of this light novel? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That'd be really cool." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you ever get people who thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you were the author of something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I've had that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone came up to my thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this is back when the
93% was still a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some guy, like a 13 year
old boy came up to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, that's weird, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why is there a guy in my line? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The 7%? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He comes up to me and
he's like, oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He took a photo, did the signing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like, you're the author
of "Goblin Slayer", right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> No kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "No." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we had autographs at our booth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for "Goblin Slayer". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was like, "You're the
author of 'Goblin Slayer'." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, do I look like Japanese? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't get a lot of,
"Oh, you're the author," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I always get a lot
of like, "You're the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who does the official translation." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like because you translated
what the author was saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you must split... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, I remember I
had a guy just being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when's volume three of "Goblin
Slayer" gonna get translated? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I fuckin' know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should've just been
like, yeah actually tomorrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm working on it right
now actually, don't worry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's coming soon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you would've just left me
alone, it would've been done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I get so many
people just being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, can you bring on this creator? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or like this author?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, don't ask me
about it, I'm just hosting it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The anime departments
of certain companies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they usually bring guests of
like say directors or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of whatever anime is
coming out that season, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they have a premiere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the author or director
comes to promote the premiere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So not necessarily, it's like trending- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's basically
just all marketing then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the way I see it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's all data, it's all marketing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all data and marketing,
it's all businesses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I always wondered, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> AX must be really expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to like put up all the booth,
the staff, the marketing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it like, I mean, it obviously
it must be worth it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is the return on
investment huge then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, they're not really
looking for sales directly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's just looking for presence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Brand presence.
- If you don't have presence, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like not being at
E3, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guess even companies now are questioning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if E3's worth it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, Sony wasn't there
E3 the year before I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was like massive news </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that was like a massive statement </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, "Hey, we
don't fuckin' need E3." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're fuckin' Sony. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder if that would
be a thing with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like AX when the company is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh we don't really need AX anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of companies
though, Japanese companies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> are bringing their own guests </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of doing the guest of honor thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I feel like right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with like anime growing
so much in the West, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there is a big, like
there's more eyes at AX now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so like, if you're not there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then that's like a missed
opportunity more than, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, this is E3, this
is already established." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's so much press too, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of news sites are all at this events </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so they could arrange interviews </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever that could promote it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So going back 900 million topics ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with how we started it, piracy
and KissAnime going down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what are our final thoughts? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What are our like final
thoughts on pirating anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we've thrown around
a bunch of like different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> discussions about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This episode's turned into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> an anime industry episode as a whole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think wrapping
up the piracy debates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't wanna get any companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that never wanna work with us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean generally, piracy, bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we can all agree
piracy is not good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like everything in life, there is no- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes it's a
necessary evil, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not always clear cut </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think until people in
the positions of authority </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time or who in the industry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recognize that there
might be, in some cases, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, it's like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's much of a service problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as it is a community problem, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like, yeah, of
course people will say like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh you know, the only reason
these piracy sites are thriving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because these legal
sites aren't doing the job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that these piracy sites are covering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then at the same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the community is like, nah, dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's just use the piracy stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think you need to
justify or shame people either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, definitely not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I think there's one thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one last point I want to
make about the service thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where no matter what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think legal sites
will ever get to a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when they can fully compete with piracy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, there's never
going to be one company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has all the shows or
has every show in existence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even though every company
is trying their best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every company is trying their best, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't think we'll
ever get to a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we're going to get
like a legal KissAnime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a legal whatever site. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think recognizing that
it is an uneven playing field </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and legal companies aren't perfect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in my eyes I give
them a bit of leeway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All I look for is if I can
just play my fuckin' anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my Chromecast without any worries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's pretty much all I
need for my $5 subscription. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've paid for
Crunchyroll for years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I just like, if we
could just stop the argument </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, okay, you are
either on one side or the other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either with us or against us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think there's a healthy middle ground </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for people to be hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, who the fuck
cares? Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna pay for it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you don't want to,
I don't particularly care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's enough people like me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who have disposable income
and can afford to do so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and are willing to do so
that at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who fuckin' cares? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mostly people who are
like on their high horse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> shouting at people not to pirate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're shouting at like 12 year old kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who don't know any
better, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what half of Twitter is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who gives a fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just keep paying, I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like going to the lower class </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like, you
can't afford Balenciaga? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, yeah, maybe
some people just can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean you're
buying knock-off Balenciaga? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're not supporting
the fashion industry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, yeah, just do you man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, none of us really
care that much, I don't think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're not like activists or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you pay for your anime legally, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You pay for it illegally? Cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My philosophy has and always has been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just do what you can, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone's situation is different, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's got a different reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or is in a different position in life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Just do what you can and
do what you feel like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't be a bully. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just don't be a dick.
- Don't be a dick, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and just like, don't try to
take advantage of the system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah, that's pretty much my opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And please, Konami stop
making Pachinko machines, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I beg of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Make anything but Pachinko. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And checkout Book Walker. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the bottom line. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can also check out Patreon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like these lovely people have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look at these lovely names on screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They support the show,
do you see them all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I like him, I like him or her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Big thank you to today's

<SPEAKER_02> - Monkey-brain gang rise up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unfortunately I don't think
you can check out Meilyne, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> do you have any social
media you want to shout out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's cringy, so no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But again, you can
check out Book Walker, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Check out Book Walker instead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you run the Twitter
account for that still? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I stopped like
last year or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why the memes became less fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The last thing I posted
was inter-species reviewers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you very much
for coming on Meilyne. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know there was a lot of limited things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you could not talk about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially still working on the industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we very much appreciate you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's business, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure people will be mad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you didn't get to talk as much as us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, we talk our asses off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I talk too much, I
might say something illegal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just kidding. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you guys want more
Meilyne, don't worry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there'll be plenty of Meilyne,
us shouting at Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - She'll always be behind
there somewhere, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Behind the camera, the secret
mastermind behind this show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you very much for coming on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and shining more light on the industry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you for having me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Saying what you can say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about what goes on behind the scenes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I know there's a lot of eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you don't wanna get
fired or anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think a lot of people that
will appreciate your opinions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> especially with the whole
like getting a job in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, check out Craigslist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shout out to Craigslist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shout out to Craigslist, except- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Craigslist doesn't even
sponsor people, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey, hey Craigslist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Except when there are
cockroaches in the fridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I've seen too much, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you should not be supporting this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Craigslist gave you
your visa. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
