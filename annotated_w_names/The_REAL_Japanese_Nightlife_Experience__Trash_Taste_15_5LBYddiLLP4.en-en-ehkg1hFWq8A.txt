<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Switch hands. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you tried to jack
off with the other hand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like workout, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No nothing happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I drilled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I throw the hands to one hand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is not the conversation
I wanted to discuss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Leave, leave Trash

<SPEAKER_02> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Welcome to this episode of Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm the boy... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why you laughing I haven't
said anything funny? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You sound so robotic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You would, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like such low energy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just expecting
you to project your voice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like, welcome.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah like your cadence
is really uplifting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but just the volume you said it out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was just so unenthusiastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to Trash Tastes podcast! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There we go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there we go.
- I'm the monkey brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and today I'm in my mirror, when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (screaming) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm today with Joey and Conner of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how are you guys doing this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean much better now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm awake after that scream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I needed that scream to wake
me up, to get in the zone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It works man, it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if my neighbors, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty wakes them up as well actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty hurts them actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They don't need an alarm clock anymore </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they just hear.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (yelling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt yelling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You got this Conner, you've got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's time to wake up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Conner snoozed that alarm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my good God, oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So have you guys been this week? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We fucking see each other all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Why are you asking me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What am I up to? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I mean, because
we all the three of us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> went on trips this week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You wanna talk about that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> We went to rafting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was not white water rafting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like playing a cut scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's basically what
our rafting was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing)
It was like we had to paddle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the maximum was three times
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then the rest was just floating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> downstream in the river. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It did feel like a shitty
house of the dead cut scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Asks secrets where
you press the gun once, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you just can't skip it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have like the quick turn of events </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you had to press X three times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing)
And then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was like the interaction
with the cut scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - One point they were like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can jump in the river, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they were like, yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you always put your foot in me and God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just fucking jumped in head first? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I didn't realize
it was like this deep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So I immediately was
like, yes, it's my time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just jumped in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and fucking slam my helmet into the floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least you were wearing a helmet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we'll see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure what
they were gonna warn us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it was too shallow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but the moment they said you can jump in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> before they could explain anything else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me and Connor just like jumped head first- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Monkey brain just like yeeeh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it was so hot and we
were just dying to jump in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really, really wanted
to jump in the water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole time.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Joey went on vacation
with his other friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you believe Joey's
friends outside of us too? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck?
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fuck Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're acquaintances </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now, I went up to Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to Hakodate.
- Fuck you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So careless </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Without the boys I know,
was absolute blasphemy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was so fucking nice because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> actually, speaking of which I've got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like a bunch of like
presents for the boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. This is a surprise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - While Joey is getting his presents out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we have a new camera angle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's because we need-
- Hello? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The space behind it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you hate it, that's tough shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna have to get used to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This podcast studio is
actually relatively small. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember the first thing Chris said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when he came into the podcast was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks a lot bigger.
- It was like a casing room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But all our camera used
to be right in the back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and we basically couldn't use the center </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the room with half of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's just like a lot of empty space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we couldn't use if
we use the old camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hey, if you'd like to
see the behind the scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then follow us on Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But, okay here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So this is one of the gifts... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did not get you a gift,
this is kind of awkward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel bad now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This two trips you've been
and all you brought me a gift </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I have been on one and... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The first time I got you guys gifts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the fucking snacks expired
before you even ate it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never told me I
should eat them quickly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, eat these quickly then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We'll just eat these now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess, so this is a type of a cookie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah just, just rip it open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm monkey brain, what am I doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna be civilized. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So this is the type of.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're like a five-year-old. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. So this is the type of cookie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you can only get in.. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Hokkaido it's kind of
known for it's called, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Shiroi Koibito which means white lover. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm civilized. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so well wrapped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just needed to bust that shit open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. So this is a type of cookie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can only get in Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's called Shiroi Koibito </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you very much Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really, really nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's white chocolate, like milk cookies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause you know, Hokkaido
is known for its milk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hokkaido is known for a lot of things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, Hoikkaido is-
- Milk, I've heard- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Hokkaido has like perfected food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the only way to describe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything I had in Hokkaido </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> tasted so much fucking better- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a cream pie.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't say that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing)
- No, it's every.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, wow! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it melted? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No no no, it's all good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it good? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hoo, hoo
- Where did you get that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Which like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I heard you say like
Hokkaido has amazing food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm thinking man, anywhere
in Japan already has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't imagine somewhere
leveling up that- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuji? If it's just like the seafood, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even just for the seafood, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because where I was in Hakodate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> its a coastal town- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Conner] That's really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they catch all of the seafood there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fresh at the fucking port and it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They have a fish market there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we went to in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all of the seafood
that they sold there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they caught that morning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's the freshest seafood
you can ever get, legit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> think of the best seafood you had, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and imagine that is just trash. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that's what-
- It's garbage, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's useless.
- It's garbage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> compared to what you can have in Hakodate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I got you another
thing as well because.. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, wow! That's kind of funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there's this... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You got a wishlist on Amazon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something I can like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanted to get you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to get this for you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel it's very indicative </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a kind of a vibe that we go for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's clown juice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing)
- What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Here's some clown juice for the boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hamburger-
- Hamburger Pierrot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Lucky Pierrot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. So there's this hamburger joint. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's specific only to Hakodate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not even Hokkaido </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's called Lucky Pierrot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they have their own
branded energy drinks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, do you guys
know what, like guarana is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the fruit that they use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Red Bull and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - They grow Guarana in Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and so, I guess they just took that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's literally just clown juice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally just send
us an IRL clowney motive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I was like, he's a clown cod, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> drink up boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anytime one of us has a shit take, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we gotta take a drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, just take a sip of the clown juice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> How is it though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tastes like an energy drink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, for me it kinda tastes like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some weird as it's to say,
it's like a healthier Red Bull. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a Red Bull
with a stronger aftertaste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, it's definitely got that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's definitely
the Guarana you are tasting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't decide if it
tastes cheap or expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll tell you,
(Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this was 150 yen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'll tell you.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll tell you what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It actually tastes like a tire Red Bull. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And to explain what
tire Red Bulls are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so, Red Bull actually
originates from Thailand, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And yeah.
- I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So Red Bull actually
originated from Thailand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the version they have in
Thailand is not carbonated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a thick syrup. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And whenever like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The only people who really
drink Red Bull in Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's truck drivers, it's
like you need to stay up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because you drink one and
last like drinking five... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> The equivalent of five Red
Bulls you get anywhere else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ-
- One American breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I think this
has probably the same amount </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of caffeine as like a regular Red Bull, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're gonna be loaded on this podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But they also have the
non-carbonated stuff as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So they have like Guarana juice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just beer
basically, it's as you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a non-carbonated
Red Bull essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I had that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and actually it tastes
really fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think it works better
than a coffee, in my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though it has just as
much caffeine as a coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So suffice it to say that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the rest of this episode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we'll all just fucking
had a coffee as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gonna see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when this energy drink hits.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause we're gonna be like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'll be able to see
the heart palpitations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> through the screen.
- I need like a beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to like downer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We definitely gonna kill
ourselves this episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I just wanted to
get you guys some gifts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now I feel super bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that we didn't give anything.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No it's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Although we didn't really
get any souvenirs either </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for ourselves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But hopefully, it will actually be able </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to take like a proper
boys' trip up to support </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I know you guys have been saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> how much you wanna go
up to the North, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I really do. I really, really do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really wanna go in the winter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it seems like
really a lot of things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening in the winter.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna hit up the onsen in the winter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's gonna be so nice.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just wanna get naked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanna get naked with the boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We haven't talked about onsens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> on this podcast publicly, have we? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen your guy's dicks so much now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that I don't even question it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to the onsen with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like it used... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know...
- Are you mad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first time we used to go... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> First time went to the onsen together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, well, we got
to like see each other's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Penises?
- Penises. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know how Joey
cares? It's kind a loot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But now it's just like whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're getting naked with the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Another day with the boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel like a lot of people are afraid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to go to onsens for the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because of that barrier, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you just have to be naked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in front of the boys- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, in a lot of countries
it's not very normal, is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some people have been like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you wanna come to the onsen with me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And immediately it's no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna do that. I'm like why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like, oh, cause
I don't wanna get naked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, it's just that... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't even like a
decision, it was in the head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like, of course it's
no, I'm not getting naked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's like, but
everyone around you is naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're not gonna be
the only one that's naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Most European countries, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like we're naked.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's surprising though, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that like I've tried
to convince so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of my European friends to go on an onsen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because in my head, it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> oh bathing together is like a
very normal thing in Europe, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a lot of European countries. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm like, Oh, well, if
it's normal in their country </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and their culture, then must be easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Conner] Yeah.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So many times I'm like, hey,
you wanna go to the onsen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They're just like, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe our generation, it's less of a thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than it was like 20 years ago? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it could be the older generation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember trying
to convince my cousin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to go to the onsen when he visited Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was just like
breaking down layers, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So first I'm just like, yeah, it's kinda </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like how can these... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause he is the biggest
norm you can imagine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> so how do I explain the cultural
significance of an onsen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and a hot spring to someone
who has never watched an anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the same cousin
that watched the live action </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a title in time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay, Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like seven,
eight years older than me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So he's from the older generation as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So, had to be like, okay, so
it's kinda like a hot tub, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's like a public hot tub </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Conner] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then he was like,
oh yeah, that sounds fun, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, so he was like, Oh yeah- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so real, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you wear a bathing suit
and everything, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like,
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, so, here's the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's naked, and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just a really relaxing experience, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a really cool experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean, his voice tone
just completely changed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was just, oh yeah, it's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I won't know about that one chief. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love how you had to go
in such a roundabout way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It wasn't just like, yeah, we get naked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like, well, I mean... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've got bathing suits.
We just take them off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Just take them off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can wear bathing
suits until you enter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause what was the
first onsen experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for you guys like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I remember-
- I was with you guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it was when we all went with... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was us three and Allen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the old onsen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in old diver.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is like a massive,
it's like a super sento, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> super onsen as it's called, but- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember the fact of knowing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna get naked
in front of each other, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was just like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I had just built
it up in my mind so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's about to happen,
it's about to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember that day, like
we all stepped into the onsen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and Allen was like all
right lads, whip them out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's just get it out of the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's just all- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Put them on the table,
get the mojos out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gather around in a circle,
and we'll just look it up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ditch our sticks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just be over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we're like, all
right, three, two, one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we'll look at the dicks
like okay, we good? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, one's popping a fart? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> All right we good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. And then it just
literally took five minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I was completely comfortable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it was an amazing experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then i feel like people who are so afraid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to go off that barrier, are missing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> such a good experience
of going to an onsen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's an experience you
can't really get anywhere else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel, like even I've
been to kind of, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> public bathing places in Europe as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But this just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just, I don't wanna
say it hits different, but.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Darnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, there's something
that's not quite right- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's the vibe, is just different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's definitely like vibe check. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hey y'all onsen check. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Onsen check, yeah bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think we have public
bathing places in Europe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Do we? But we have like
the saunas, which are... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's kind of similar, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a similar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess, Yeah. You don't
really bathe together, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you just get into the sort of naked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and some people are like,
they'll cover themselves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, because for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not just the onsen experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's everything around
is the onsen experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like getting out of the
onsen when you're like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially in the winter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting out in in a public onsen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it's really cold
or sometimes raining, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's I thought when it's snowing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's amazing as well.
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I put it's proper anime where
there's mist in everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to experience that one day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But after coming out and
having that drink of cold milk, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like the most refreshing- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hand on the hip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hand on the hip here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So what you do, you have to
put your hand on the hip, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> drink the milk and wine and
it's the most refreshing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> glass of milk-
- You don't have to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's like vibra,
you've got to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then having an
izakaya beer afterwards, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It makes you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you're in an onsen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason it makes
you wanna just be a CEO </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and talk business. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I don't even have
business to talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'll be like, gentlemen let's discuss, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the topic at hand, and
they're like animated issues. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just makes you wanna
talk about important things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get in a bath with three other people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's exactly the same kind of vibe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but a different kind of vibe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So we went to the... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The other day, went to a cigar bar, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it is
about having a fat cigar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> on your hand, you just
wanna talk business, and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You take a puff, you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have a problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We need to eliminate someone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're right in the groove. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We got exterminated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember we went for
cigars with PewDiePie, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he was like, damn, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your voice got even deeper with the cigar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Darnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I was made for this field. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - First time I had that cigar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, Oh my God, I
could finally understand why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mafia bosses is still so powerful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with a cigar in their hand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's got an energy to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- There is, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I never smoke at all. But for
some reason the idea of cigars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that sounds good, I like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, because unlike a cigarette, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't inhale the cigar smoke, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I mean, don't get me
wrong, it's still bad for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's still terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's still terrible for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you come out of
the bar smelling like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you've just like puffing exhaust pipe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's kind of the smell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of that
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But man, you feel so powerful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just with that aura of cigar around you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yes, I just came out
of the cigar bar wide open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mind your business
what are you looking at? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you do have a different
aura around you, don't you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just feel powerful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like when you
order a drink at a bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like you're the virgin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you order a drink at the cigar bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, they used to chat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then you're like name a
cocktail, any cocktail? A vodka. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you always get
again is Espresso martini. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Espresso martini, if you haven't had it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an amazing drink. It's just coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Just with a vodka.
- Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's amazing, it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tastes right.
- It's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coffee with attitude really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love my- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Coffee with attitude? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What a terrible way to describe it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a coffee with attitude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like-
- It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Describing anything with attitude- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why are you booing me, am right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's such like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, that sounds like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> How a Disney character is
introduced in a short, oh yeah... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's the bully with attitude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - After we go to the
bar, I'll take a coffee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with attitude please, hold the attitude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate it here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate it here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Today when you got a frappuccino </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, no, I didn't
just get a frappuccino, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got an espresso frappuccino. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, Oh my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you couldn't love Santa anymore white? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like 35 Celsius. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I want an ice cream and a drink in one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I also want a coffee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So yeah, I don't... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I normally think frappuccinos are awful, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I bent my own morals. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you best still got a
frappuccino with attitude, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate it here, I hate it here so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just add anything with attitude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'll just make it sound
bad and much more horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All the fucking comments
now are gonna be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> damn, that was something with attitude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love that, I love that to be a meme. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's gonna be a meme now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now I'm gonna describe everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with something with attitude now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it's something with attitude now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But-
- You're welcome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Speaking of cigar bars,
I think the topic for today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that we wanted to discuss was
nightlife in Tokyo, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or in Japan in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just take japan in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - True, true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I wouldn't know
I haven't been at night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of Japan for a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - For a while, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I miss her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I miss the English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I mean, what is a
typical nightlife for say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> UK or Thailand or Australia? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I don't know what the
nightlife is in Thailand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean the nightlife in
Thailand is, I mean it's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, let me ask the
question, does it exist? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all Thailand is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It definitely exists
and there's different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> kinds of vibes you can go for, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you can go for a disgusting cheap like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> my life in Bangkok or you can go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for some more extravagant
bars and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's very varied but I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if I would say that there
a significant culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that pertains all of Thailand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel like with Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's definitely like
the izakaya culture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I fucking love. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You talk about nightlife in Thailand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I'm in Thailand,
I just go to izakaya. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I like the vibe that much, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that's the thing right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel an izakaya is just, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should we explain what an izakaya is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just in case people don't know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For those who are uncultured, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's basically a Japanese pub. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically, but like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a restaurant and a pub combined. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's 75% pub and 25% restaurant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- That's what I would say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But like in a pub in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought-
- But it's not depressing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. It's depressing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and also for some reason,
I always feel pressured </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to live in the UK or just
drink, not sit down and eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I have this pressure
that's like drink, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not here to eat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause when you go out with
your friends to the pub, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm always that asshole whose like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm getting a meal, you
wanna ask for a meal? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's just really inconvenient, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you're there with
a table for the pints- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tiny table molded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then there's this guy he just orders </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a three-course meal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like where
are we meant to fit this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't give a shit
about us to hold out this- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would like slowly notch
the 12 beers out of the way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to make room for my extravagant
curry from Wetherspoons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Under the tables like
down here just like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its like bombing out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you like pubs? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the UK? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I loved them in London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought London had great pubs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, I really don't like pubs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pubs are the one thing
about the UK that I... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Anytime I go out the UK, I'm like, yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a much better drinking
establishment than a pub, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what it is
about pubs in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just find it so fucking depressing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause
- Yeah I can see that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It depends which ones you go to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> London has ton of bar like
pubs that are really lively </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and really great atmosphere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there are also equally as bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you guys took me to one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like a gaming pub, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's shut down now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That pub was a mess there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wouldn't even call that a bar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't even call it a ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was like a gaming bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like the dirtiest gaming bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And what was it called again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meltdown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meltdown.
- Meltdown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a gaming bar with five PCs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> one dirty old, WeYou- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No it wasn't even a
WeYou, it was just We. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We, a WeYou, and
there'll be the same people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> who'd hog the PCs and there's
no clement or anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it was just awful, it was terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's quite right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, you compare a
gaming bar anywhere else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, dude, they've got games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. They got real games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The way I would describe Meltdown is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's basically like a uni-bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hmmm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the charges-
- They charge more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> than the uni-bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it was just like a run down bar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like every single bar in London </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that is even remotely interesting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel is sort of run down, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I can see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I don't know the
thing about pubs that I hate is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that for some reason,
they just seem so dark. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. It's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what pubs you go into man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's so many in London and it's so fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Anytime I go to a pub style
bar, like anywhere else, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the first thing I notice is,
man, it's so bright in here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is nothing like British pubs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is nothing like British pubs, at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you going to the pubs
that are down the alley? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just go into like the
proper light local pubs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause in the UK, there's
the pubs that anyone goes to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then there's the pubs that have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact same 30 people go to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And those are the
depressing and dark ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, 90% of
Wetherspoons I'd say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fit on the backend story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah okay, most Wetherspoons are... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wetherspoons is a brand of pubs in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like this ultra treat brand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you took me to one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did take you to one,
I think it's I liked it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the reason people go there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is 'cause of the very, very cheap drinks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and cheap food they eat together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or was this five pounds
for a full course meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or something with a beer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You basically like a full course meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with an alcoholic drink
for seven pounds, like $9, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in London which is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In London the drinks
alone normally were $8, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which I'm pretty people
in California are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, that's cheap, in the UK that's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bear in mind where I grew up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a drink that's over three
pounds, which is like $4, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like wow, get low to this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because if you
go to a pub in Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for a pint it's nine bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean where... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The Wetherspoons, which is the cheap areas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of where I grew up, it was
like their main selling point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was two pound pints, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes some of the
special brews were one pound 60. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow.
- So that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like $2 something for a pint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No wonder that there's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> People are in there from 2:00
PM until 9:00 PM to dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Getting their money's worth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. 'Cause to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pubs are just the place
where you pre-drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> before you actually go out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the establishment you
want to go to, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's how I see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whereas with izakayas,
I can fucking stay there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> from the beginning of the
night, to the end of the night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't feel pressured to leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you don't really have like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They're normally cordoned off decently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while when you feel like
it's just you and your mates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whereas sometimes the
pubs having to see everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> around you is a little
like, Oh my God, it's busy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that's one thing
I don't like about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess UK style pubs and
there are a few of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Japan as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a place called the Hub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which I'm sure you boys are aware of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't go there by the way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like going
into a UK pub, but in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So why the fuck would you do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But brighter?
- [Conner] Okay. But- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's a little bit brighter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've heard there, if you're a foreigner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you really wanna pick up some people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who are really into foreigners, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They are probably there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because they know that
foreigners go there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you have the yellow
fever but can't be bothered </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to go the traditional
route, go to the Hub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. But like.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Hub at Shibuya, you'll just be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But every time I go
into a Hub, it's just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, first of all, it's
like 99% foreigners. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's also very depressing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's also very depressing because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of structured like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I'm saying, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's structured like a UK pub where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the seats are kind of sporadic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then everyone is standing around you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you just feel really close to her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I don't mind
standing and drinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes standing is fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, it's like I need a table. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It definitely needs to be a table there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I can leave my drink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I'm just standing in a corner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which sometimes on like a
Friday or Saturday night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in England where some pubs are crowded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just have to stand there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the middle of the floor,
just with your mates, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, this is not
the vibe I want to go for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My legs hurt, I want to sit down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. The thing I like
about izakaya is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're always sitting down, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have your own sanctioned corner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can just sit
and talk to your mates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just the perfect
kind of catch up vibe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I look for when I just wanna
just chill with my mates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and just chill-
- That's also so cheap, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you can go to any izakaya here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the most you'll
pay for a beer is what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like 400 yen? Maybe, that's
a pretty expensive one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's an expensive one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I'm saying like
the max you'll pay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Normally you pay
between 200 and 300 yen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for a beer, which is like $23 dollars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I went to an izakaya that
where it was at 50 yen beers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the point? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 50 yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do we even compete? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause one thing that
doesn't make sense to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that sometimes it's
cheaper to drink in an izakaya </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> than it is to go to a family
market or konbini and buy- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A can of beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Buy a can of beer, which is like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Can you imagine if that
was the case in the UK? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if going to Tesco's is more expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> than going to your local Wetherspoons? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, nobody would drink at home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone would just be
out constantly drinking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the UK economy would just stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think the country would fail. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. But like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the one thing I
like about izakayas is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> again, even people who don't drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> can still go to an izakaya
and have a good time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because as you know, we've
established it's mostly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drink based, but the
food a lot of the times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is also so freaking good and
cheap, that you could be... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably one of as much
fun if you want drinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but, you can easily take your friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> who doesn't drink at all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they'll probably still
have a decent time, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause like the food there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can easily order a
lot of snack kind of food, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not like you have to order a meal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like a giant fucking pub burger? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will say that I do feel
the food is a coin flip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes at the izakayas,
like you can normally tell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which ones are gonna have bad food, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but sometimes the food is just really bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you only saying that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because you got food poisoning? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I did get food poisoning, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I did get food poisoning very
recently from the izakaya, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then, the more I've
been living in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and the more I've been eating
out at restaurants in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I realized like my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this food is so much better
than the izakaya food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, yeah, it's fine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know, normally just
taking the Carnegie and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like the Japanese
boneless fried chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean yeah, don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the izakaya food is good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's definitely like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you want proper food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's somewhere... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You need to go to a
proper establishment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's sometimes
that I'm in an izakaya, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm eating and I'm like,
God, this food is depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's one Nero while we're
filming this, that like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You know the one, it was
the underground place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they had the driest
chicken I'd ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You think of like they'd
have let this chicken out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to die in the Sahara desert
before they harvested it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was pretty anemic, was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everything on it was just kinda like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, I guess you just
didn't love your job today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. The food... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That one is definitely like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know its gonna be that bad? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When like the menu, everything is 150 yen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you get what
you pay for, sometimes- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like comparing
Izakaya food to some of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the pub food that I'm used to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, I feel like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think pub food's really
fucking good in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Am I-
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, maybe I'm too white
to make this point, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, 'cause if I had a choice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pub food is where I go if
I have no other choice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I can't be bothered to cook for myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I promise right, hand on heart, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If I had to choose between izakaya food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and English pub food, I'd
go with pub food, no joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I'm gonna go with izakaya food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey's fucking biased. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I'm not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - He is never gonna admit that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't care about your opinion Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. Okay shut up for a second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. 'Cause it's the
kind of the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with Australian pub food as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know man, I can't comment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yours is a wild card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause Australian
pubs is kind of the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as the UK pubs right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Where most people just go to drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and usually it's very fucking depressing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's just a bunch
of middle-aged dudes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who've been sitting there
since 2:00 PM, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just wasting their life away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like a lot of pubs in Australia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have really fucking good food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But the problem is that you
only get a set portion of food, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a stupid amount of money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Conner] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. And so sometimes- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's like a cost thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yes, cheap- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only thing is that I smell broke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey's broke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You will be once you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> After you go to an
Australian pub, you will be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's 25 bucks for a fucking pizza. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just not worth it, but like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the thing is that
with Australian pub food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of it's good, but
there's just like you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even before you go into the pub, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what food is gonna be there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Conner] Yeah, yeah- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There is just so little variety... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, same thing
could be said with izakayas, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel that- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always the same shit in izakayas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, man, different izakayas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> have different things that
they specialize in I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but then, but yeah.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But pubs are always
just like burgers, pizza- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no. The reason
I love izakaya food is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they're designed to go well
with the beer or alcohol </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're drinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just the perfect... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the synergy you were
talking about, the pizza synergy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was right about that by away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just synergizes so well together, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas with pub food,
it's the same kind of meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like put this in your stomach. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think yes, sometimes it
is, but not all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's been plenty of
izakayas we've been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'm like, this is just weak, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is mid as you would say Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean I wasn't even gonna say that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But even like the mid
izakayas are still better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than some of the best pub food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just don't like pubs, I'm sorry England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't like pubs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do really like Irish
pubs for their food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I feel that at
least with Irish pubs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> unlike UK pubs, there's a
little more variety in the food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's I feel, at
least from my experience, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel less- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I took you to shitty pubs there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel less pressure
to get out of an Irish pub, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than I do in a UK pub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm not just sitting there drinking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold that-
- Yeah, I like Irish pubs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's normally... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Where were you drinking? In Dublin or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Dublin and I'd
went to something like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Limerick and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they were all around Ireland. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean the norm in
the UK, apart from England </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I think a lot of
England is just depressing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of the big cities, no offense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> In the small towns, in Wales and stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's some really fun pubs
'cause it's just like 20- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not gonna go to wales. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, you are not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no reason to go to Wales charity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry Wales. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sorry Wales, it's true, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We have to accept that
fact unless you like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like sheep? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you like nature Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like sheep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you like rundown
castles? Do you like those? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just hit or miss for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. You have love what... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is not really too much to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna go to that fucking Lake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that has the longest name in the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, that's sort
of like that's a town. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh It's a town. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliagogogoch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is the town named Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> How dare you not tell that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly you could have
completely made that up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd probably be like, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that true? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, that's right.
- Correctly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually was gonna make a video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or I went to that place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually filmed it, I filmed it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was that the town where the news anchor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> pronounced imperfectly,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that just went viral? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just up the road from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliagogogoch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the temperature you got at 21 Celsius. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like 6 millimeters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. So I went there and
I filmed a video actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I have all this
footage though, and like I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So wait, so what's in it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just me going around this place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Just checking out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No but I mean, what's the town like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was fucking rotten dead. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it dead because no one
can pronounce the place? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe I don't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's about... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like two hours
drive from where I grew up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I asked one of my mates, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> hey, can we go over here and
just film a bunch of shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why I was like, fuck it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe something fun will happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Though nothing fun happened obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there was also a climbing
place that we wanted to go to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so we'll just go there after
we are done with filming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Climb you mean the hill? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, like a climbing gym. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooooh, climbing gym, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get.
- It's huge, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> huge warehouse, pretty cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if you wanna go there,
there's a climbing gym </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inside there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I went there, and it was just a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of tourists from England, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were old, very, very
old, like sixties plus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just hanging around, just checking it out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a gift shop, tiny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there's a bunch of stores, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I went in there, you know, asking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we were in a
really West part of Wales, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they normally could speak Welsh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, Oh, well,
maybe I'll ask around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and see if anyone could speak Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one could speak fucking Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. I was surprised, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause normally in that far West, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that County is the
one with the highest rate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of welsh literacy as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, yeah, nothing there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nothing there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So if you've ever wondered
what's there, nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just a really comically
large train sign. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- It's actually like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do they fit in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it on size two font? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No no on, you know the normal... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So normally in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> each one has like a standard size of font. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's quite big. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They literally just add it on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like they drill it on by hand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - There is a really funny image </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of a guy standing next to
it and it's 10 meters long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really, really... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll have some footage
up from the video that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Meilyne Tran can just
show on screen right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fucking huge and
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's sad 'cause none of the
trains stopped there either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> There's a really... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Train that goes direct to
London but that doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stop through that, and I
think it's only local trains. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, at least you have
plenty of time to read it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as you go past it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna hear how the
train lady pronounces it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it an automated message that... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's shortened to like San vide PG or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Oh yeah. I got it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is still awfully long. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just sounds like you
got a lot of flame circles. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right, right, but it... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, the problem is even with Wales, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you look around the rest of that map, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the town names are just as bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Around that area to pronounce. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't pronounce some
of them without taking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> three minutes to look at it and be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of hard, it was a nice tangent, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like cute little town of Wales. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't go there, nothing there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Don't go there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I live next to some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird sounding places as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember when Joey came to visit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I took him and Aki to this
place called Devil's Dyke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Devil's Dyke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember saying that, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna take you guys to Devil's Dyke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Aki's face was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you just say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because do you guys like, is Dyke... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Does the word Dyke-
- Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have the same meaning? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So most of it is like a hill. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But there's tons of
fucked up names in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's places called White
Knight and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's another place
I live next to or close to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> called Cuckfield, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Conner] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every time I drive... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time I'm on the train
and it goes past that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just have a little laugh to myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a Cockfosters as well in London? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cockfosters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cockfosters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - One of the main trains
stops at Cockfosters finally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, this is
the train to Cockfosters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like a five-year-old
every time I go on that line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember what line it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Piccadilly line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Piccadilly line, the dark
blue line. Every time I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I haven't lived
in London for a few years, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> every time I go on there and I hear it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just have to laugh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Burst a little smirky like none. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I completely forgot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Should be those cock
fielders fucking a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's so many that
are just like sly words. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how this is a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did we get this? How did this happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We just like in Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't have anything like
that, it's kind of sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We just have a lot of life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Special new. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like a lot of the
names are just named off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the indigenous names. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they sound funny, but
they're not like Cuckfield. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always learned by
talking to you about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, why is
there a New South Wales, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like South Wales was
never good to begin with? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Why are we making another one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe you start up from the
ground up making a good one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The only funny named place in Australia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I know is Banana. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is a town in
Queensland called Banana, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it has this thing
called The Big Banana, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the Guinness little record </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the largest banana
statue in the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did they just name a
town after that one statue? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Almost because also every banana </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in Australia grows in Banana, Queensland. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That part it makes more sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You should have lied with
that before you told us... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no idea why it's called banana. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But they just grow a lot
of bananas. It's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a place they grow bananas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And that makes a lot of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like now that you've
explained the context, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that makes a lot more sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we just have stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but wish I fucking lived in
a place called Cuckfield. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That would be hilarious.
That'd be the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That would be the best
fucking conversations- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Feels like you'd grow tired after all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. But it's like, where are you from? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cuckfield and you immediately get along, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like I've already
blended in with the conversation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish you just go to a town
in Japan when they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sundei it's like you where you live now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you'll be like Cuckfield. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cuckfield.
- Cuckfield. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Getting back to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Izakayas-
- Izikayas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Japanese matters, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do we come from
izakayas to Cuckfield? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wales, wales man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me like I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Izakayas is my number one
kind of drinking establishment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I enjoy throughout the world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like anywhere else-
- I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the easiest, it's the chillest- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the chillest you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You always... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always nice, all foreigners love it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's so easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You press the little button-
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes it's all you can drink- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, 'cause you don't
have to order at the bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Never have to order at the bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Never order at the bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will say that is 100
times better than in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You all order all your food
and drinks from a tablet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no pressure to
get order at the bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just bring it to you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause there is a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One of my favorite izakayas I go to a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with my other friends is a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's one unique biko, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it's called anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It used to be called Kobayashi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think I took you guys there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember, but basically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's on the West side of Ikibuka, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's underground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's exactly like in izakaya, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it has food and everything but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you pour your own drinks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, I think I've
been to that one as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And there's a huge tub, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a fucking
barrel full of miso shiro, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> miso soup, and it's just
all you can drink miso soup, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well as the best fucking thing ever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause miso soup is the ultimate
hangover drink in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Another thing I wanna
talk about when it comes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to Japanese drinking culture is nomihodai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is all you can drink, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which anytime someone from England </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or America or someone comes
here and they see how many... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They learn about the way
you can drink culture, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt clapping) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> boys, I'm moving here, I'm
coming out every night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every Australian I've
taken to a nomihodai </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has always either been like,
so is there a drink limit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or they're like, Oh, it's
only for 10 minutes, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like happy hour, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no, you can do
it for as long as you want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They are just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much is a typical nomihodai? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's 1500 for 30 minutes, is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's cheaper than that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It depends with which one you go, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> either it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen like 2000 yen for two hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I think it's about... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's about 20 bucks for two
hours of all you can drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It depends where you go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But generally it's around that price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, around that price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And compared to everywhere
you see in England </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything, that's
like a massively good deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. It's like, why would you not... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Even if you can't drink that much, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Why would you not take that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even if you'd like,
I'm not at a brisk pace, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's still good value for money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause even like say, you
know, it's 500 yen for a beer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Conner] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even if you drink four
beers in the two hours, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you still getting your money's worth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's like every time I'm just, Oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really feel
like drinking that much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but let's do nomihodai, its much- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember when... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause obviously when you move here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you kind of stop wanting
all you can drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause you're like it wears off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - But for the first few
times I visited here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember thinking like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Treating it like an Olympic event. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, all right, how
many times during the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. 'Cause that's what it
would be if there was no way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you could drink in England, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would be, yeah. That's how we think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause that's how we're wired. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're like 80 percent
speed running izakayas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was yeah, I was like
get the clock ready guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember, I allege
she had this dilemma, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was drinking a beer and the
first one I smashed it back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no problem, that's easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Second beer I was like shit,
I'm two seconds off pace. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I remember... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually remember being like
I'm one minute off the pace </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I struck myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You were like, how many beers do I need to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drink to make this worth?
Then how many can I go over? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You were calculating this
in your head to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, if I drink one beer
every five to 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> then I can smash this many beers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'd be earning back
this amount of money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Conner] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You treating it like stocks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause this is what it is, 'cause we... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I first came here as a tourist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We visited a bar that had 200 yen beers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought, okay, that's my new baseline, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for all you can drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to make sure I
get more of my money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I need to make sure it's better
value than 200 yen a beer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So I think we went to one that
was 2000 yen for two hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, okay, in my
head, I'm working it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, okay.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that's 10 beers in 10 hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I need to get
at least 10 beers, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I got to get 11 just
check, just to get it under </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I feel this was worth coming to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I remember I was
in so much fucking pain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> on the ninth beer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Kinda got... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause we were eating as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and my stomach was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner panting) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I think it was eight
beers in where I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if I forgot to tell you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you can get other drinks too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It doesn't have to be just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I knew that
getting all you can drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like spirits was playing with fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would have been on the floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, now I'll stick with beer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause beer is the natural pace. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now I'm gonna take you guys
to the 50 yen beer place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's not an all you can drink, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's 50 yen- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm in this 50 yen
so you might as well be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all you can get.
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I feel like
that's just the difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in mindset between
anyone from like the West </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and people in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause when anyone in the West comes over </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and here's all you can
drink, all you can eat, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the same mindset
where it's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've got a fucking speed, run this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I've gotta optimize this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is the optimal speed versus trucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for all you can take? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And Japanese people are just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no we just drink however
much we feel like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the pressure
of not having to know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much you're gonna earn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I think it works
on the trust system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I remember... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We trust you not to
be a fucking alcoholic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why this would never work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in any other country, but Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I remember I went
to this kind of like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It wasn't a wine bar, what's
the place that they make wine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what's that called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Winery? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Winery, that's the place. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went to this winery with
Sydney, just outside of Tokyo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and they basically had a cellar of about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a 1000 different wines. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And basically you could
sample as much you like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for 10 bucks, 10 bucks you
had a cellar of a 1000 wines. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's gotta be some
really wrong catastrophe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, if you actually go greedy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you gonna get killed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You going into the cellar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No no, it's totally right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you can drink as much of
it, as you want for 10 bucks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. So you can sample as much of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sample? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, British people don't sample shakes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's exactly the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's exactly the point
I'm trying to make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So me and Sydney went to being like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The exact same mindset where it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there must be a catch,
there must be a catch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This competition- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One of them is poison. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We go down there and they
give us this little cup, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the super small
cup, where you can pour, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say a third of a
glass of wine into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And these Japanese
people were just pouring </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one little drop, like
two little drops now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like letting the
drop sit on their tongue. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then we were just
like, but we can draw... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We can pour however much we want, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause that's the thing, it's
based on the trust system. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you know, if you
want to, you can just pour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> however much you want for
as many wines as you want </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and no one's going to stop you, right? So- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's something similar to that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that I saw in, oh fuck, where was it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was in Nagano,
when I went for a trip, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a sponsored trip
and at the station, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because Nagano is kind
of known for its sake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was exactly the same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like 50 to like a 100 barrels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of all sorts of different sake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like yeah, again like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like water of everything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was a thousand
yen for all you can test. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All you can test. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - All you can test. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not all you can drink,
it's all you can test. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - All you can sample. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But there's nothing
stopping you from sampling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as much as you like, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was 20 tier in and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm only a fifth of the way through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm about to fucking faint. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Imagine if you can ask for a free sample </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's no one stopping you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from asking for unlimited free samples. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You get unlimited free samples. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's basically the mindset. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like we're here as a westerner, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking we got the
fucking cheat code to this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So, we can just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like bottomless fries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but if you can go up
and get your own fries. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like having a buff in this country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like being British, the
alcohol, it's like oh shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's another establishment
that's very specific </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to Japanese nightlife? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I like to think
that the karaoke nightlife? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, karaoke nightlife
here is just good as done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the perfect kind
of place for karaoke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I didn't realize until recently, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the karaoke in Japan,
is so much different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to the perception of karaoke
in Western countries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember when
you, me and Felix got... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When we took Felix to a
karaoke for the first time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he didn't wanna go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was kinda like, Oh, karaoke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sort of cringe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds cringe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I think in his mind, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> his idea of karaoke is
an open bar karaoke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I have- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which I think a lot of people think- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think a lot of people think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause in Japan I feel like
after the Izakaya, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or after going to a pub in England, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the precedence is after the
pub, you basically go clubbing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no other place to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We'll go home and watch fun animations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah exactly right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But in Japan, you can just go to karaoke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and just continue the session there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Also just hang out with your mates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and sing a bunch of songs as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's all you can drink again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And again, it's all you can drink, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> everywhere you go in Japan
you can get all you can drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all you can drink and
the karaoke establishment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is open 24 hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is just like a power move. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Although I swear
whichever brand is offering, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause not all of them
do all you can drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And some of them do it for way
more expensive than others. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I never know which fucking one it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so I just walk in and I'm
like, please be the cheap one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's it yeah,
that's the thing though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have to kind of go
around to each brand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of karaoke chain, and be like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the cheapest one
for all you can drink, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the most expensive
one for all you can drink, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so, you have to kind of be like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> do I take value over
price or price over value? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you know that if
you go to the cheap ones, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the food is probably
gonna be not that great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I've never like my entire life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never really enjoyed karaoke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> until I experienced karaoke in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's not only
having a private room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so to explain Japanese karaoke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have this private room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can just sing as many songs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as you like that you choose, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no one watching you
apart from your room mates, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can just have fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sing whatever the hell you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the comfort of your privacy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They also have like
every single Western song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So they have a selection that is like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> clips is everywhere else I've been to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They have English songs, Chinese songs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Korean songs and obviously Japanese songs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Anime songs, they got
all about anime songs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was about to say
man, singing anime songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while you're plastered as a week, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember my first
experience was with Joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was one of the
funnest experience ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like seeing that list
of all the anime songs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like opening Pandora's box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which one do I sing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then the moment he selected </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking Tell Me Why by The Penpals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just like, okay, this is my boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The original Berserk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - With the shittiest
guitar riff in existence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, yeah, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, it's already bad in the original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then the karaoke version was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh this is so much worse,
but it's so much better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was embarrassed at 3:00 AM </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we fucking destroyed that song more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than it already destroyed itself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We sang that song like three times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you once source an outpour
like, let's do it again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I fucking miss karaoke, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Ever since the Rona, we
haven't really been able to- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go shut down for a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's back open though right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> From what I understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. But Oh man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard to get into
that mood, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I know just like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel now that we've all
kind of been established here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's become a little bit more
difficult to just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey, do you wanna stay up
till 4:00 AM to go to karaoke? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's, maybe 'cause I get... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I go to bed at 12 now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I get really fucking tired early. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My sleep schedule is
a lot healthier now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. To explain another thing about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese drinking culture is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have this ticking clock, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's called the last train. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if you miss the last train, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're staying out until 5:00 AM. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> There's no... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's basically no in-between, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> either you choose to go home at like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 11:00, 12:00? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - 11, 12ish yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 11, 11:30, which to me is like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> if it was just one hour
later or two hours later, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it would be perfect, because
after about one o'clock, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd be like, okay, I've
had my fun, this is cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna catch the last train now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But having to choose
between going out at 11:30, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you were just about
getting to that point of drunk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this that you just want to keep going, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to staying up till 5:00 AM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which we've done it several times, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and every time I just
feel more dead inside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the night after that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's nothing worse... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think the only thing that is worse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> than going home while
you're buzzed at 11:00 PM </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is catching that first train at 4:30. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just fucking like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey yelling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like sunny outside and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this businessman next to you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're clearly a fucking mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just turn into a fucking vampire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like, the sun, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking fell asleep one time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and missed my stop by an hour. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I woke up at 6:00 AM, so fucking north. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the end of the line, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. I think I was
an hour and a half from Tokyo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I tell far I'd gone and
I was like get back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was so fucking done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It was 6:30 AM when I
realized and I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nooooo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So one of the sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I Mean, that's the tough thing, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, that's the thing like back when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I was still single and kind of going out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and doing a lot more of
the 4:00 AM 5:00 AM stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It would be a little bit
easier because, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> say like a couple of my
friends will be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it'd be like, you know, one or 2:00 AM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be like, ah, maybe we
shouldn't continue anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really easy because you
could just go to Ammonia Cafe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just book a fucking
room for two, three hours, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you just fucking sleep in
there until the first train. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's it so, but
we haven't done that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we should do that more often. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Instead I'll just be
like let's call up a taxi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and spend a hundred bucks to get home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've always known that
you can do the Mung cafes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't wanna have that
conversation at 3:00 AM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smashed to some Japanese
dude and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It should just be like,
sleep two hours, let me in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a monkey brand and they'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> okay we get it, we understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe, every single time was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just wait until 5:00 AM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we should just
do that from now on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> If we're having like a boys' night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'd just be like, I don't want it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause sometimes I don't
wanna spend a hundred bucks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to fuck-
- Coffee? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If we are all going back the same way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not split in two ways. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, yeah, I guess, still it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you still feel like shit, my heart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is wrong with my side? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this clown destroying me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The clown is just getting to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck. It's fighting my monkeyness. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The clown is taking over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This video is sponsored by Express VPN. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know most of you
are probably thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> why don't I just use incognito mode? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wrong gun, you can't watch Hentai in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> incognito mode, or clear
your browser history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as many times as you
want. It doesn't work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you mean people actually know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what Hentai I am watching? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Conner laughing). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - They can see? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The FBI possibly knows
if they have an entrance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Your Internet Service Provider can see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single website that you visit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why I never go online
without using Express VPN. </SPEAKER_02>

they can still legally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sell all your information to ad companies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm also told that Express VPN keeps all </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> - I actually do use it and
it's actually really seamless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's this is just a single button press in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> my little monkey brain, works great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you notice it when it's on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, never. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I use it all the time
and I do often forget </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've put it on as it
doesn't really affect much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I use it a lot actually to
get around geo restrictions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for Netflix and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes there are some
movies you just can't watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> on Japanese Netflix, so I
just pop, press a button, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's on, and you get around that shit. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> - Now back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I love about
karaoke the most though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey burping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry, the clown juice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking ulcers? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh it's hidden. It's hidden. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, on top of the all you can drink, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes they have like
other stuff that you can have, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like drink and eat, unlike soft drinks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but they might have like soup, sometimes- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - An ice cream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know the ice cream, I
don't know about the soup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know that fucking time when you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> were kind of stopped eating
so much fucking ice cream? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause they came back
with like two fucking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> packets of ice cream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So they had like small,
tiny cups and bowls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for this ice cream, and I
was like, no, I'll take one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of the big cup glass and fucking pull </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the ice cream in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Must have refilled it
like three or four times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so much ice cream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I was just sitting
there the whole time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at karaoke, sitting there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just, oh I'm good, you go next. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember when I saw
the ice cream machine next </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to the soft drink machine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who the fuck would get that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I remember that I'm
thinking like I'm a... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't need that, we need alcohol. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then two hours
later, fucking plastered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (sipping dry air) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cock fluid, cock fluid,
that was amazing right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That ice cream looks so good right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is pretty garbage
vanilla ice cream bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when you're that drunk, it's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can drink anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But anything that's
bottled at that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I'll say like in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just goes along with the nightlife. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the UConn drinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt nodding) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - John explained that
UConn drink because that.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I should have
bought one in preparation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if we can talk about this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's these tiny little things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 200 milliliter cans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like that big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a medicine bottle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah and it tastes like bubble gum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's apparently like
ginger, like it's ish ish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That it taste bubble gum
I think it tastes like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it tastes- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it tastes great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] Turmeric. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Turmeric.
- Turmeric. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like ginger.
- Thank you Meilyne. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, it tastes like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I liked the taste- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Conner] Do you like the taste? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like the taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Felix liked the taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but Felix is fucking weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It reminds me of Calpol,
that's why I like the taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So essentially, what
this drink is advertised </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as is prevents hangovers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone of the Western world is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that doesn't seem right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I first saw it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was like a scam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I first saw it, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty sure if it
worked, we would have like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was my thoughts
as well. Like how... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If it really works, why
has England not used it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't you think the
entire budget of the NHS </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would be spent on buying this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because then all of the medical
problems would be solved? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure we would
have it right here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then I thought, one
day on a whim, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, fine, I'll try it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it was like having
a shield on your liver, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not like none of the drinks got me drunk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was like that
for the first few times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until I really drank way too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it was like, not
drunk, not drunk, not drunk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely unable to sleep, like not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just like the 2020 economy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just like the Coronavirus tank, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you're fucking
drunk in like an instant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I never tried it
until tried it with you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because every time I
saw it, I was like, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe that will work for like one drink, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't go to an
izakaya and have one drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, no, this won't work for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But then yeah, I had it and
it tastes awesome, like great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> This is already good stock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then yeah, I think I was
like four or five drinks in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you don't feel like anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm just like, Oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The immunity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So it's advertises it like
you don't have a hangover, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but really I think it's
like format alchemists. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like lava equivalent exchange, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you drink it and you
lose your fucking mother. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You drink it and you get
less drunk when you drink it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you have to drink more to get drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the day after, if you did
completely destroy your body </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like it doesn't help the hangover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you go too hard, it doesn't help. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But you know there's
times where maybe you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had quite a bit, you're quite tipsy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not absolutely shit-faced, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it completely stops any hangovers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Please stop saying hangover, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but for me it stops that
tipsy feeling as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. In my mind, when it
comes to whether it gets rid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the hangover the next morning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like a lot of it is just placebo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's just like if I drink this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it'll probably stop it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I definitely feel an effect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Because at the hangovers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the worst hangovers I've had in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is when I haven't drank that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So now I've pretty much
like you'll never see me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> go drinking without drinking it now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I don't know if
it's a good thing or not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Is my body gonna get
dependent on it to drink? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like anything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always drink it when
I know I have something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to do the next day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not bad for you by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally just like turmeric </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or ginger.
- If anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very healthy by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a bunch of
fucking minerals and shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking know it, like I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at me, I'm a monkey brain, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I know what's in it,
I don't question this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just look it up and you'll find it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah, from what I understand it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's very healthy, it's
like a health drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone's gonna call it
and be like, actually it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, it destroys your liver. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like as if the
alcohol doesn't already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> destroy the liver. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually, hidden health benefits, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hidden health benefits of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you boys feel about clubbing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I've not been to
a club in Japan before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you been to a Koch club? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I've been to a few, but
I've never enjoyed clubbing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Even back in Australia, it
was just never really a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I like bars, but I don't like clubs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really like bars,
but I don't like clubs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like, okay, here's my theory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like clubbing is
this place that everyone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> convinced themselves they enjoy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they really don't enjoy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clubbing is one massive lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know anyone who
actually enjoys clubbing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause the only time you enjoy clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is if you're massively plastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you actually enjoy clubbing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're someone I don't wanna talk to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The people I know who enjoy clubbing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are normally the ones who I just don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like hanging out with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know I'm not gonna like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They are like the epitome of oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They always talk like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like clubbing is like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> clubbing is great when
you're young, I guess, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then you reach a certain
point until a few years past, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you realize, man, I
never really enjoy clubbing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just lying to myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All I do when I go to a club,
is go in, see the dance floor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> order a drink, go dancing
for like five minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realize I'm still too sober,
go order another drink, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then that cycle repeats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - When to repeat, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Until you're fucking drunk enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to not remember the night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you do remember the
night it's a shit night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it hurts 'cause
you gotta pay entry fee, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you gotta pay
double the price for a drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you're not drunk
enough, it's like fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not only am I having a shit time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> my wallet is taking a financial beating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Clubs are fuss, man, they're a lie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll tell you the only
times clubbing is fun, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But can I tell the story
about the last time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we went clubbing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure, sure. Go ahead, go ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I gotta hear this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like the only time
clubbing is actually fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when the night is unplanned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you don't plan to go to a club, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the spontaneous
clubbing nights are the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you're already really
drunk and in the mood, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you just suddenly
decide to go to a club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So last time I actually went
clubbing was over a year ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was with Conner and
two of my mates, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just a spontaneous
kind of clubbing nights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we didn't even plan to go clubbing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we just wanted to go hit up some bars, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we got massively twice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did we? I think we were
just sitting at your house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we were just gonna do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I think something boiled up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you were like, clubbing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think we were like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were sitting in the
house and we were just going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to have it like a chilled night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you were telling
stories about clubbing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were telling stories
about clubbing and I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eventually we were like,
should we just go clubbing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. 'Cause I remember
we hit up a bar before hand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and we were pretty married at that point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We weren't super drunk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we got to the bar, I think it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Absolute VOD Green Brighton or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just ordered three
of those 14 shot trays, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And we got drunk very, very fast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the person who got drunk
the most, was this guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt pointing at Conner) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I had like one of
the whole 14 shots to myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, bear in mind
I think I was just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Excuse us sweetheart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At the time, I'd just broke up with my ex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, I just wanna go out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wanna do something,
I wanna get out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like I just want to party
and then when I went away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what was the last
memory you had of that night? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember waiting in line for the club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Alcohol abusive badge by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we don't condone this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is a story, not condoning... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're laughing about it
but we don't condone it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've rarely... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Rarely do I get that drunk where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't remember exactly what happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which I always speak to
Americans like that sounds scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, yeah, I'm in
the company of my mates, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know they'll take care of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, after the bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we clearly realized how drunk
Conner was, but we still... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It was still pretty early in the night, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like 10 o'clock, 10:30. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Conner and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The club had just opened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's kind of the timing
we're talking about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And we just kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like, okay, before the
alcohol gets Conner anymore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we gotta fuck again this
club, as soon as possible, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so we line up just as
the club was opening... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone said fucking
Wednesday or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one was clubbing. No one, just us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We all worried about how
Conner was gonna get in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause he was clearly
over the fucking limit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And if you know UK clubs, if
you look like you're too drunk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're just not gonna
let you in, bouncers... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Bouncers in UK are like the school bully, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They will take advantage
of any power they have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we were fucking worried. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So, somehow Conner... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We managed to get Conner in this club. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the best heist by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So we must get
Conner in and we're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, that's this is it, we've done it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The mission impossible thing- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've done mission impossible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, then we go over to the bar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as you do in the clubbing experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first thing you go to is the bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then we go to order our drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I'm here with two of my mates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we each order a drink,
and then we look around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Conner is just not there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We are like, wait, if
you're not with Conner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're not with Conner
and I'm not with Conner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then where the fuck's Conner? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then we turn around, and
look at this empty dance floor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Conner is just standing
there, at a 90 degree angle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt bending at 90 degree angle) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey clapping) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, and we are like,
oh shit we better get him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off the dance floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And then like as a walking over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he starts fucking Fortnite
dancing by himself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the dance floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know you gotta do, you gotta do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And so the bouncer
sees this and obviously, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Conner's way over the limit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, he gets kicked out and
so, we also have to follow him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out of the club. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we're like, do we attempt another club? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's only like 10:30. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's try and attempt another club, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking we're not gonna get in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Somehow, Conner by pure instincts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like, he can't even
walk to this next club. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But as soon as he's standing in line, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like, yes gentlemen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did a why when I'm drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> For some reason I can
just like for 30 seconds, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I can be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Conner inhaling and
flexing his back muscles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes of course I am. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Darnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I dunno why, its super power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. When you're... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When he's in front of the bouncer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he just turns it to proper Seadog VA. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The monkey brain
unlocks into human brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Somehow we... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> We somehow get him into the second club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the same fucking thing happens again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We go into the bar, and
then we take our eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off Corner for one second, order a drink, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I look around, look to my
left, look to my right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're not with Conner,
and if you're not with Conner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we turn around, and once again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Conner on an empty dance floor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just Fortnite dancing by himself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that just like an
instinct for you to dance? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so, I think it
must be I like dancing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why Fortnite
dancing must be my go-to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so we get kicked out of that club </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was the end of the night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's Good night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's Good night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's Good night.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He woke up snug.
- Don't get drunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. We got him back home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I took him on the bed and he
just slides snuggling side </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the saggy pillow and yeah,
that's what he woke up with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> All the instincts giving you a lockdown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I woke up and I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where is my phone and wallet? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where is it? And it
was just under the bed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But I was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the first five
minute panic of mine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, where is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you don't remember any of that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember some of it, but not much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, that was pretty
the most drunk I've gotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in a very long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd rarely ever get that drunk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know, sometimes
you fuck up and do a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of vodka and yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It happens, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like, you've been
clubbing in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah I have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's that like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How is it compared to
the rest of the world? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least compared to the UK, and the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I felt like everyone in
the club is very drunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And in Japan I felt like everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was in the same situation
of, I need to be drunk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which makes a pretty
shitty club environment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause everyone's kind
of sober and it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one wants to like step out of line. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like no one's doing anything fun except </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for somehow, everyone
is really well-behaved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And somehow the moment
you step into the toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like a war zone in that toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There was a dude who was like pissing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he was not even aiming in the urinal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He was aiming at the wall next to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he was spraying, and
I walked in and I'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not getting blamed for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm walking out, 'cause I
know this guy was Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I'm not fucking with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to be blamed for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm the minority in this club. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, I'm the foreigner here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I looked at him, I'm
walking out right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, there, it was so filthy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the rest of the club was just fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It was whatever, it was
just a depressing situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd rather have been smashed
Fortnite dancing alone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any day of the week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. That's kind of a
similar experience I had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went to one club in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that was enough for
me to be like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I never really enjoyed clubs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm living here, I might
as well give it a go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wasn't it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt like everyone was doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they've seen it
in the movies there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what. I was
like, this is cool, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We cool right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, wait, we've seen
this in the movies, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is exactly how
we're supposed to behave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I think the most different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clubbing experience I've
had is probably in Thailand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, they have like, I don't like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like their clubbing culture even less. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they don't even
have a dance floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, some clubs in Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's you go in and there's no dance floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but everyone has their own tables. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the music is just as
loud as any other club. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So try and so... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So you're sitting around- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Such a loud restaurant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the wild bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're sitting at... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone has his private tables. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can't even like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not a social
environment where you can go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meet other people or even
interact with other people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're with your mates, but
it's so loud that you can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> communicate with your mates, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So all you're doing is sitting
in this loud fucking room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I must sound like such an old guy now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The music was too loud, this was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, too far. When the music is too loud, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like my biggest pet peeve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been in some clubs in Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where the bass is so fucking bass boosted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can actually
feel your chest going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey clutching his chest) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dude like this while you're sitting there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, hey, how are you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That voice is so bassy
as well than in clubs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I could just cannot communicate like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just extravagant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember university, if I
ever tried to hit on someone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd just be like, what
are you saying, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are you talking to me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have that thing
where you're trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to say something to your
mate, but it's so loud, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or your mates trying
to say something to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just sounds like
a blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like sorry,
can you say that again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You do it three times as the magic number, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the third time you are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll be like yeah, I
don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I have nothing to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just the clubbing
experience, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, we personally don't
recommend clubs in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, if that's your
stick that's your stick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But we don't... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think we've made it clear
that we don't really like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> clubbing anyway, so why
don't we gonna enjoy clubbing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reason I like izakayas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that 'cause it's the
perfect social environment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I like talking to people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like house parties, I
like house parties a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've always... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> In university, if there was a
choice between a clubbing... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Going clubbing and going to a house party, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like a hundred percent of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm choosing the house party, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I like talking to people and I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the izakaya vibe is
just that perfect vibe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just like you, it allows
you to talk to your mates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's also that
element of a house party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, are they gonna
fuck up their own house? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If so, I wanna be there to watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's like the craziest house parties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys have been to? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've got like two and they
were both in university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Of course they were. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah of course they were. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you have one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can only really think of like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have one if you want me to go first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of like poop stories </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - More poop? Noooo! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is where the poop
stories are coming in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - All of my poop stories
come from house parties. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? Whose plan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, okay... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So in Australia, Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Another thing I think about
it, it's as fucking disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no.
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But do you know what a shoey is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's where you do
the beer out of the shoe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. So it's this
thing that's very typical </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in Australia because there's
nothing as fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is this typical in Australia? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Typical house party shit we do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Australia.
- The local cuisine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The local cuisine of the shoey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but essentially what it is, is you... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of like shotgunning
in America, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where, shotgunning is like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if someone's holding a can of beer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like, Oh, shotgun it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So you poke a hole on the side
and then you kind of drink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole thing like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Shoey is that, but way grosser. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You say, hey, do a shoey,
and then you go around, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the tradition is you go around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and find whoever has the
dirtiest fucking shoe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooooh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not just any shoe, it's
whoever has the dirty shoe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's either you do your own shoe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or you pick whoever's
has the dirtiest shoe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is already starting horribly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you grab this
shoe, you pull the can of beer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> into their shoe and then you
drink the beer from their shoe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's disgusting, that's.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I mean, it's not
that exciting of a story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but my friend did a shoey once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and he got his friends a
shoe and he didn't realize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until after he finished the shoey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that he had stepped on his dog shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So he had like a firm grasp? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He had a firm grasp of
it and he finished it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and he's like, he flipped it
over and just saw like shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just smeared on that shoe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like normal people will
be like, Oh, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But because he was already so hammered, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's just like yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And everyone was like yeeee! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is fucking nasty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the only thing really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then other than that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like a lot of vomit stories, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know the usual that
you hear at house parties. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That was probably the grossest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - God that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> disgusting.
- But also the most hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. Where are you
going with some of them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I've been to like
a few crazy house parties. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think most of the crazy
house parties I've been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been in Brighton. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So that's where like my hometown. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There are some parties
that are just like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Kind of like, you know that
scene from American pie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you see that senior,
like there's no way there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that exists in real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no way this
crazy shit's happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I've been to a few parties </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where he was actually that crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember one time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where there was this party
who we'd heard from a friend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> who heard from another friend, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who heard from another friend, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now that kind of thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sounds like being in a horror story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was a party happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the middle of this field. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, there's no
fucking way this is true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we had to drive into the
middle of fucking nowhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, this is a scam, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we're gonna drive there, and
there's just gonna be like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just gonna be like
a drug dealer den or so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or this is gonna be like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We're gonna get fucking murdered. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so we drive to the
middle of this field, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and keep in mind, this is all pitch black, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it's like the
middle of the countryside, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where we're driving
to, so we can see shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we go there and it
was basically like a festival, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow they had managed to... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because this guy who had owned the farm, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had just told a few of his mates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he was gonna have a party, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then mates started
telling mates and then... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's always the worst. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I don't know how
it's spreads so wide. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like it's because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one else is having a party that weekend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and people were just
egging, and people were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> very much ready to go to somewhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just want to go to a party guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to do a party. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And yeah. Somehow there
was a fucking festival. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then things started getting weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They started setting things on fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, they went into his house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they took out the sofa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and somebody thought it
would be a fun idea to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just start burning stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So it started off- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is always there one
person that just burns things? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, there's always one pyro... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One fucking pyromaniac. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, first it starts with the chair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they get a chair out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like, okay, let's set this on fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like fucking
cave man mood activates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like whenever you start
a fire, for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you see fire, and then you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then you start fucking
dancing around it like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> woo, woo fire.
(Garnt dancing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno why whenever there's a fire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's a house party and
there was alcohol involved, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just forget... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The lizard brain just takes over, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you just like circling, just watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So they burned the chair
down, and they were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what could we do next? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What could we do next? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> let's get a table. So, I don't know... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where do you just take this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy's whole fucking Ikea collection? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> My Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then they take a table,
they set down fire, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> then as that's on fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking sofa appears out of nowhere, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they fucking
just shot the sofa in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, we were just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At the back of my mind, I'm thinking, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the host must feel so fucking shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno where he's probably
plastered out of his mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my furniture has been burnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then as the sofa is on fire, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we actually see the host just walk out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and he just looks at his sofa, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and his fucking Ikea furniture
connection that's on fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just goes, yeeeeeh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if right, what if all along, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he planned this out, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because in the UK, if you wanna
get rid of stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got to pay a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So maybe this was all applaud, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just so he could get new sofas and shares </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not pay to remove his old ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. There's always also
that one guy in any kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of situation like that,
where something's put on fire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they're holding
an alcoholic beverage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're like, I wonder
what happens if I pour it all? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like this the point I put it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It just makes the flame bigger. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, Oh, I wasn't expecting that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. Every time, every fucking time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Animals, animals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, fucking cavemen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So you know how I said I
lived in a student village? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was basically a whole
area that was just houses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And there had also two
really big apartment blocks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were disgusting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They are the cheapest apartment
blocks you can imagine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And one time people... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This doesn't exist anymore, this place, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they tore it all down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So, yes. Once the student village RIP, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they said, Oh yeah,
there's gonna be a party </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at one of the apartment buildings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They didn't say which floor or anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I thought that was kind of weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we turn up, and half
of this apartment building, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> there's bin bags on all
the windows and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] -Right.
- [Joey] - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you started
going into this building, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's been turned into
like the set of the raid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's just shit everywhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's mattresses on the floor and shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All over the place, and
some of the rooms are open </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and have nothing left in them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And meanwhile, everyone is drunk as fuck, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> there's people doing
drugs in certain places, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people in the kitchen,
there's always that one guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who is in the kitchen making food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for somebody in all these parties. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this building is
literally like falling apart, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one guy is standing there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Anyone wants beans? Any
beans that you want? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just weird, and it was
like the further up you went, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there like more of a mess, it was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember going to one floor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and there was just beds all over it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and people lying down and I'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the fuck is going on here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was just weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I just didn't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Some are like just what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, wait, so it was
an orgy floor or what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't stay long enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you get invited into this party? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was one of those
things where everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just everyone knew it was
happening in the village. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So we all just turned up it's the village. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Word around the village,
is that this building. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like why did you put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why did they put bin bags on the windows? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like, Oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so they can't see what's going on inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'm like, who, who can't see? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they think putting black window... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like blacking out all the
windows is suspicious in a way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also a bunch of people
migrating towards this one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they completely fucked it though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what happened to it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or how this was even possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure the owner- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean the fact that it's gone now- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. It's true, it's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then there was another party, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which was really weird
and it was a house party, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like just a normal
house and had a bouncer? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which I thought was really weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At a house? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At a house party. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I wondered- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the fucking motive? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was a three storey
house, not that big, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I thought, wow, this is fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a bouncer and he's a list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I said my name is and he is
like, you're on the list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, when do I get put on the list? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is this List? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who's arranging this list
'cause my friend invited me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So he must have put me on the list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I got inside, the
first floor just is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a big living room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just has one small couch in the corner, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like a hundred people
just standing around this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very average looking
laminated-like wood floor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just the people standing around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is there a bouncer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you go up the floors
and it starts to get weird, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> as of course it doesn't if you got floors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in these weird house parties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember asking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I found out that... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I asked my friend
and he was like, Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I paid them out so like 300
pounds just for tonight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why?
- Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What would you expecting to happen? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you that worried? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, okay, okay. To be fair... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I realized why he
was that worried because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the second floor was
just people having sex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was actually pretty standard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's pretty standard,
that's pretty standard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, okay,
maybe we were in shock. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the bottom floor
was just really loud. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, maybe I wanna go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to the floor where people
were just chatting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. So I go to the third floor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's where it gets
really fucking weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause one of the rooms is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought it was like
five beds, two bunk beds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and instead they just put all
the mattresses on the floor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why people are doing this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All the mattresses were on the floor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and people were making out
and one of them had like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Was doing like a needle, I
don't know what he was doing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, Oh, this is weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not going here, and so I was like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I asked my friend, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's gotta be somewhere else we can go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I do not wanna stay here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> There's someone doing what
I think is heroin upstairs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can we not do this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> University's a mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd never had any like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I hung out with
good Christian boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously, so do I, but
sometimes you go to a party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You hear about a party, you don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what it's gonna be like
till you get there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Until you see someone doing
like hardcore drugs upstairs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, I'm
not supposed to be here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to go to church. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Most of the house parties, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the more stairs you go up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the closer you get to hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the steps towards hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally the rate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the opposite, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the further up you go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the closer you get to hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's awful 'cause I
mean, you have no way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> of knowing in the UK what
the party is gonna be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> till you get there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, if your friend's dead set on going, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like alright fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I've been to
as many Dodd parties, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you go to and it's
like, this isn't a party, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is a house gathering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With like prettied up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We prettied up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. You never know... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never know, a party could mean like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a come dine with me,
four people making dinner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for each other experience
or it could be, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a vagan orgy going on upstairs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't know till you get there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No one knows, my parents
were probably terrified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like what was
Conner doing in university? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was not doing anything, mother. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You happen to go to places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It's funny because I did... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had less crazy parties in university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but that might just be because
of the university I went to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which was University of Bristol, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and because it's like a city campus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like University Bristol
was in the middle of the city, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was less going on
because it was all... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we're integrated
with the normal people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The normal working people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so, you can get away with less shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> than if it was on like a campus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Mine was kind of the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause Sydney uni was in
my the smack bang middle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of the city center in Sydney, so, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was always weird
shit that were happening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like the smaller campuses,
but nothing like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was just so many rundown places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was like, sometimes I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like locals would like see a party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then just like go in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just go in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I think that happened a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I would
never throw a house party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just let anyone in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how fucked up this is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bro, talk about the trust system, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just like the other
end of the stupid truck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember if you were having a party, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and you told your close mates,
especially in my school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause this was before
I went to university, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but in like college, if there was a party, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone would... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone in fucking Brighton
would know know about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Somehow. You know word would get out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would not throw a party, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially on a day, like New Year's eve, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where everyone's searching for a party. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - People just rock up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, that's kind of
why Chicano don't go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to open invite house parties anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like after seeing that I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just too much, that's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not signing up for that,
I don't need that in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's like if I
wanted to go to a house party </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and like four fits of people
there, are people I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd rather just go to
a club ,at that point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's basically... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It becomes the same thing right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. But clubs are pretty bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but at least as not people doing like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking hardcore without condom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on the dance floor, probably
in the toilet, that's them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Call on Conner, even Fortnite dance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fortnite dance without
people judging me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And me in the orgy
room Fortnite dancing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All the mattresses a
dance floor dance, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll have a dance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God. But have you
guys ever been to the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it's a property like tourist trap, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever it's considered, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the Golden Gai in Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, I've been. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And how did you like it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They are not really your thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not really because... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You wanna explain more Golden Gai is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes the Golden Gai is like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, what it's like? 40 by
40 meters area, if you will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like a series of
alleyways, extremely compact. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its not even a block, it's
within the block, isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's tiny and it's bars all seat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> max three to four people, sometimes two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depending on where you go,
and it's really expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You pay sometimes 10
bucks just to sit down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you only pay
10 bucks for a drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, it's a tourist trap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause a lot of the time it's tourists, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and also it's a very sketchy area. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And if you are a foreigner,
there will be a guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who is very much watching you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the moment they see you're foreign, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll come up to you, that's
really fucking frustrating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause sometimes it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I went in there once,
just 'cause I wanted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to take my friend who
had never been there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, okay, I'll experience it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, I was just like, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is just like a really cramped, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> super expensive drinking experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like you can get anywhere else in Tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like if you see pictures of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> which probably won't be on screen now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of like
cyberpunk house-cloud like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love going to Golden
Gai just to take photos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like that cyber punk aesthetic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where you just got these all... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of these buildings
and a lot of these bars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just crammed together, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you don't even know how
anyone could live in there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let alone operate a business in here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I can't imagine any of these bars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting maybe more than 10
people at cost, a night. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It depends there's
one or two of the bars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that would do something big, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but most of them are, yeah, very small. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, there'll be a few big ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of Golden Gai
right before you enter it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> near the entrance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But once you actually go into Golden Gai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, how do any of
these places stay open? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you go to Golden
Gai to meet other people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't go there with your... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You can go there with your mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you can also meet
other people anywhere else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But this is kind of
vibe to it that's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's so small, you
immediately have to talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to anyone who's next to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't really have a choice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like in the rest of Tokyo,
you kind of got your way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, hi, you
wanna know about my cult? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you got to like really- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's right, that's right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. You gotta seem
like a little weird, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you have... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in this bar, you know, you sit down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you're immediately next to someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you just start trying to communicate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And yeah, the one time
I went it was 'cause... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We used to staying right
next to it funny enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think it was one night where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's my second to last night in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my first time visiting, I think Joey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey like gone and Allen
didn't wanna hang out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and now I was like, well,
I wanna do something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so, I Googled on my, where can I go? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, this was the
only place that came up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, all right, fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd never heard of it before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know it was a tourist tracker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I just went there and
yeah, it was really fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, met a ton of people and
then eventually made friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with these Japanese people, who took me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to some of the Japanese only bars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was really fun 'cause
then they were all talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me and asking what
my favorite anime was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> knowing the Japanese titles
came in very handy that day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, of course.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes it's just a lot of fun, I mean it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it works and you go
out and you meet people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're actually cool and it's fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the best thing ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like you got quite
a lucky experience though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in Golden Gai, because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I've heard a lot of
horror stories about Golden Gai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could easily go there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and just have not meet anyone cool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and yet be bored, spend a lot of money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I've been to
quite a few smaller bars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and establishments that are outside, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like just outside the Golden Gai, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is really fucking cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Gaming bar that Chris Brown took me to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> literally across the road from Golden Gai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wanapo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think its called One Up, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One Up I have been there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And it's tiny,
there is just one bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it can only maybe seat six people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's a proper gaming
bar, we're not talking about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the one thing you guys
look into in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a legit-like gaming bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that one was really fucking cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and way cheaper than Golden Gai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But the problem is that those kinds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of places don't come
up in Google searches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's almost always like,
when do you drink Shinjiku? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Golden Gai always comes up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I noticed there's a lot of bars in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that are fucking tiny, and you go in there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like I really liked the vibe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's a really intimate vibe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it can only fit
like five to six people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's only one bar
and you sit at the counter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I do like that vibe and I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> how they stay in business? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause there are so many in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they are so hidden away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. There's so hidden- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like the cigar bar,
we went to in Ikebukuro, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, how the fuck
would anyone be like, yes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me go into this tiny building, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> go all the way up to the sixth floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there it is right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, how would you
know that that's right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like it could be just
someone's apartment for rental. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It probably is.
- It probably is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That they just remodeled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's kind of the size
we're talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like an apartment in Tokyo just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Like a one room
apartment in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or you took me to that
bar that was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like an apartment,
someone's apartment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in an apartment building
that have been converted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into a ping pong bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They served food and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It was fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney actually discovered that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because she read a manga
that I was based on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a manga that had that
bar and she Googled it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that bar actually existed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's this ping pong bar that has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this massive ping pong
table in the middle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like going into
someone's living room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - To get there, we had to go
down the dodgiest alleyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was literally this handwritten sign </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that says ping-pong bar,
go down this alleyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so we go down this alleyway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a dirty, dirty alleyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Take some sheep from PT. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like there could be someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing heroin around the corner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have no fucking clue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So we go in there and then we
have to go up these stairs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just the stone stairs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that someone's probably
pissed on, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That kind of bar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> As we go up and then it's
just someone's apartment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just literally someone's apartment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then they opened the
door and it's a proper... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They've properly remodeled it into a bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm thinking, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> how would anyone fucking discover this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause this is just hidden away, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down too fucking dodgy alleys
that I would not go down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like there are so
many where I'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you wouldn't, if you
didn't have a curious mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you weren't afraid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you might possibly get
stabbed down this alleyway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there are so many
places where it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd never be able to see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I try think Shinjuku is good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you're a
foreigner 'cause you can... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think a lot of people in Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like wanting to meet foreigners </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like that, or Shibuya, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so if you stayed with
those two places yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the super touristy and
everyone knows about them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think a lot of
places outside of that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you probably won't find
people who are super </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eager to talk to foreigners. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe Ikebukuro to an extent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe Ikebukuro, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's as far as
you'll probably go, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, in Shinjuku,
you'll definitely find people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who wanna speak to you
if you're a foreigner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's like sometimes you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a bar and the people serving you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> have time to speak to you as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah that's fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I like that experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the one place we went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that started playing all
of our YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there was this bar
that we went to, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was this bar that we went to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a really small intimate bar. And they... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember who
brought up the conversation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember they found out that Sydney </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was a YouTuber, 'cause
Sydney was there as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She makes the stupid
mistake of telling her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> her YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this bar has four... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Has about three TVs in it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, as soon as the bar
lady hears her YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she just Chromecasts Sydney's fucking... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sydney's videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sydney's videos all over the bar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where other people that are
also drinking there on this bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we're just there watching
Sydney's YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and she's just dying inside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a fucking nightmare, isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the one thing you shouldn't do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you have a YouTuber friend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is play their videos in front of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it about that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never understood that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just hearing your own voice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So you being not like being silly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It hurts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's just like you're... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like you're okay with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's such a weird dilemma </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause my cousin asked
me that same question, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which is like okay, so
you're all fine with me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching your videos, as
long as you're not there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But the moment you're there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't want me watching the video? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how does that make sense? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, I don't
know, I just don't like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I just don't like exactly the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I hate it when I have to rewatch my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> video to check it, like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm fine with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I'm just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I used to not be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And then now I'm like,
God, I love this video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> God I love it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - God I love that guy.
- I love this part. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Damn you Conner. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Damn, that was a funny joke
Conner. I'm proud of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I don't mind
rewatching back on my video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm editing for example, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm the only one in the room, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but if someone's standing behind me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like micromanaging me and
watching out the video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll be like please, leave. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want you watching this right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can go watch it after it's uploaded, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when I'm not there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I don't get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's weird.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you remember the
time that you accidentally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> deleted the video while
we were out drinking? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- You what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is one of the worst to have... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Look at what happened to us, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we were at a friend's house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were Chromecasting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> all my fucking videos to the Chromecast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't wanna watch my videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is about 2:00 AM in the night, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so we're pretty drunk at this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm, so fucking bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So here's my most recent
video and had a sponsor on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, here's what happens, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When you have the YouTube app </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone's Chromecasting
and you're also connected, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can move the video, skip it, whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was said like, Oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could click on the
playlist of the cute videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it said... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I clicked it, and my video was on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like I'm gonna turn this off so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I click it and there was no off button, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was only delete
video and I was like, well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> delete video from the Chromecast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I deleted the video on the spot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bear in mind I haven't even
paid for the sponsor yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it got paid like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I uploaded like two days ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I realized 10 minutes later, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I'm looking at my channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, where's the video gone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, wait, did I delete the video? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I was just sitting
there for like all nights. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sorrying up, thinking I
deleted the fucking video, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe they won't notice I deleted video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then on the taxi
backup, which was gone, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, God, I think I fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And what do I do? I
deleted the sponsor video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how do I play this off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, is this recently? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No no no, it was like two years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is back in England. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just like yeah, ages ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember Conner
calling and telling me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, yeah, I
think I deleted a video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, Oh, I mean,
it's still like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not that bad we just re-upload it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like, no, I mean,
it's a sponsored video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't been paid for a year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and do you think the sponsors will notice? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a pickle that you are in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - A bit of a pickle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then like they... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember who,
which sponsor it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure they probably
shouldn't tell anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they wanna have some fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They emailed me two days
after, they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hey, what was the video
called? Where's it gone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And luckily, I've just been dealing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with a ton of copyright issues. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I emailed them back and
being like, Oh gosh, darn it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That YouTube copyright
is doing its magic again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They've blocked the video worldwide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I'm like
retyping all the things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like I'm pretty sure I can fix it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by tomorrow at 8:00 AM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I uploaded that and they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great work on it back up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, thank you, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm so glad I fixed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow! You giga brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, Oh my God,
I fucking didn't see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So, yeah I was really drunk.
I wasn't even that drunk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wasn't even telling you.
I was just like lightly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, wasn't that really dumb? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. I was just really fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just did it and I was like,
fuck, that's a bad thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can you just please fire me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I paid for it in the end though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a YouTuber's
worst nightmare though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Deleting the video was not so bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but having to explain to someone- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why you deleted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I think it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have to explain to your parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've fucked up in some kind of way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, man, I
really have to hype myself up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to just explain to mum and dad
why this thing has happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But going back to Japan nightlife, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do we keep going off
on these fucking tangents? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fun, let the tangents happen Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All the fun is serious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm okay with it, I'm okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just impressed at ourselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that we can tangent that fucking far away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from whatever it is we
we're talking about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But one place I like to
go to a lot is Bagus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, I like Bagus too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you been to Bagus? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have not been to Bagus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I was saying
before that I was like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't remember if it was you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or Conner who hasn't been to Bagus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have been to Bagus plenty of times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah. So Bagus to explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it's like a darts, pool, ping pong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is more of other stuff as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it depends on some other places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a Manga cafe as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So basically where I did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the manga cafe video, that's a Bagus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So they have a bunch of
different Bagus that sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they focus on the manga
cafe side of things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes they focus on the pool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and darts bar side of things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but basically, it's
this 24/7 establishment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's where you can just go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and get drinks and just hang out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> play pool and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a ton in Shinjuku and Shibuya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah a lot, a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I'm surprised that you haven't been. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I don't think that... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah I don't know, I just haven't been. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's one of those places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you wanna spend at
least two, three hours there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't really wanted
to do it before your meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't really wanna
do it after your meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause that's like best drinking hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's normally like, you
know, it gets to 1:00 AM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, what do you guys wanna do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna keep drinking that much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'll just string your Bagus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fine I mean, it's
kind of pricey though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is a little- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you're there for like three hours </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that shit adds up fast,
'cause they charge you per- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Half an hour. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah half an hour. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you're buying drinks on top. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Which of the drinks kinda little pricey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you can get
all you can drink though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you, I don't even know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can
do all you can drink in Bagus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But again, you have to be prepared to stay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> for at least two hours, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. 'Cause I know they do a package </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like till the sun comes up package, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like one to 6:00 AM, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's quite cheap, but
obviously you're committing- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's like, I'm gonna stay up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> till 6:00 AM to play pool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's only so much pool you can play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before you're like this
just isn't fun anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We both aren't good at pool
and we've been doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for 30 minutes and I'm starting
to think I don't like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like I get better
when I'm drinking at pool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, that's the alcohol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making you think you're better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not like you're getting better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Your opponent would choose just as drunk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as he was getting worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I think I just doubt
myself too much where... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> When I'm like playing pool sober, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think when I'm about two pints in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just start hitting shots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, for some reason it just goes in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I have four drinks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I start getting worse again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, I feel like there's a sweet spot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm slightly tipsy and
I'm a fucking goaler at pool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like that with bowling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like the darts, because
there's not a dart board. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like an arcade
machine with a dart board. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like yes, I can electric- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And some of them are so fucking overkill </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what they are, like
there was one more, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you could play
on a whole RPG, in darts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's right. I remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> your dart would do extra amount of damage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's so hard with a straight face, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you're on a date
or something being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey, do you wanna play the RPG darts? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pretty great for the first time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But then some of the
levels were so bullshit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You had to get like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You needed to be like a fucking God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you had to get triple twenties, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like every single one, I'm
like, this is bullshit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Medusa should die way
easier than this, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but it's those
little touches, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That I think add to the whole Bagus- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a lot more fun
that you don't have to count </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the darts 'cause the
machine just does it for you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it does make it a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I've to a lot
of old-fashioned pubs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Australia where there
is like a dart board- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you get the real
darts in all of those pubs? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They have these fucking
flimsy plastic darts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's also just as dangerous as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I love the danger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ooooh I got a sharp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> metal object!
- The drunk danger, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's exciting, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm good, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm too old for this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you meet those people in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are like full pints in... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are getting nailed, they get
like the peak performance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of four pints. It's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like I was bowling, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucking suck at bowling while I'm sober, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but I've quickly discovered the other day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that if I drink two or three pints, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before bowling, I can do
like a fucking Turkey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like I don't know tomorrow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course you just
don't think, you just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like throw a ball, half pint. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why, but I
think bowling is the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> depressing activity out
of all of the activities. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like bowling with alcohol is fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But bowling without alcohol is boring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think, I feel like I like bowling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't really
play it growing up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I know it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> You're either the kid
who fucking used to bowl </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all the freaking time for fun, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or you were that one kid
who would only ever bowl- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck bowls are for fun? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So a lot of people do,
in the UK apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. A lot of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do you think bowling is depressing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, there's an air to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There always-
- It just doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hit different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. So I went... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. This isn't an exclusive incident. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of the places are like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm just giving this for an example. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went to a place in California. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Very nice area of California. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And somehow in California </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this place that was very
like, seemed very normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> There's just this one place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And somehow this bowling
place was the only place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that gave me mega redneck vibes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I went in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was very much just like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But what it seemed like
there was just a bunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of people who, you know,
like were, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you been bowling in Japan though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I haven't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well then maybe it might change, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unless there's screens
and shits fucking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Prrrrrrrrr! you got those
stuff like a tickle 10, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> woooooo! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like a guy comes over, congratulates you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unless that happens no way, no way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean it, there is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can bowling be any fucking different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with Japan, to other countries? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, there's no rednecks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I've like to me it
just sounds like the... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You said it was the era about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then this whole, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Although I live there kind
of like bowling places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason, universally, are the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> semi rundown places out of any
of the entertainment things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why, bowling's always... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like places always look the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I can see that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does anyone understand what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the difference is
that bowling alleys in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> are run by round ones, so
they'll usually have the first... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We usually with like a
lot of big round ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like a huge arcade
chain, if you don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like, the first three floors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are the arcades and the
rhythm games or whatnot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then the next four floors
are all the bowling exits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, to me it's just like an activity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to do when you're drinking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I enjoy it, but it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do think it's the worst
activity out of the bunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's plenty of time
to talk to your mates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just throw ball every few minutes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you get a laugh at
your mate being shooted ball. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause he know like everyone's
too invested in the bowling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're not talking, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Or nobody's invested in the bowling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the moment someone- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that's not the kind of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you should be going bowling with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tell me the perfect
level of bowling ratio </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to conversation ratio
I should be expecting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because what happens is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this happens every single
time you go bowling, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone's talking, Oh, it's my turn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I was in the middle
of a fun conversation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really wanna bowl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So do you just fucking
throw her like a med bowl? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But because you're already 10 points down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not gonna win this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not gonna get a
strike, let's be realistic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you're kind of shit at bowling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, then someone
or sometimes you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, so then, sorry, I'm losing my... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I'm getting tilted over bowling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then, you go up, you
miss out on the conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and just feels like you're speed dating, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but the one person is
not getting a date who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> keeps going out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I get that. If it's... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you're only going bowling
with your date, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> If there's only two people bowling- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No dates, it's just mates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, you're in a group </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you leave the conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then no one's really giving a shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the bowling because
am having a conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or its vice versa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like a background
activity you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then what's the point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't do something else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is exactly the same
as like darts and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's also what I had to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's exactly the same
as like darts or pool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now darts, you can keep talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> while you're playing
darts with each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can keep talking while you bowl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gotta like, what are you gonna do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> follow him up to the bowl? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you gonna do? Follow
him up to the thing like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, okay, keep going. Oh,
nice bowl, lets go back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> now lets go talk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I do that sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I would be like, fuck off
Jerry I'm trying to bowl here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whatever it is, that
doesn't make a lot of sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you are like I don't
give a shit about the bowling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I only care about the conversation right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because at bowling, I give
a shit about the bowling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when I'm talking,
when it's someone else's turn, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I give a shit about talking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're one the most
difficult fucking bowler </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just feel like it's a dichotomy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it shouldn't exist fully. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's so many activities
I can think of that you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, the easier pool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> While you're doing the pool, you can talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> While you're doing darts, you can talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything else you can
do without like talking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like 'cause it's a group activity, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause your pool and darts I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like two people that's doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can do it with group like pool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can all sit around
the table and enjoy- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but there's only
two people playing pool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but okay, with bowling- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can do it like tag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's such a distance,
one, too much for walking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Can I just put that out
there, too much for walking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - From such a distance? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to walk far enough away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> while can't be in the car. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay. This is going to
sound so fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> All of this sounds dumb I realize, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but you have to walk far enough away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're then
leaving the conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you don't have to
leave the conversation? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you lost. You're gone Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're gone. You're out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If the conversation is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like how, you're not gonna
be like fucking far away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for five minutes, you're
up there for three seconds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's enough to leave the conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll be honest, I've never thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this deeply about bowling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think this deeply
about everything in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except the music and story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So in your mind, are you
thinking like this could be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> optimized? This situation
could be optimized? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This isn't speed running fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, this is fun with extra steps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think there's
too much gap between... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one needs that much
run-up when they're bowling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And if you do something's wrong with you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's shorten the distance
between where the seats are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and where the alley starts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well then... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I mean, you don't gonna
have a 500 meter run up to bowl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know some people who are
like, I need the full length. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well then I don't wanna go
bowling with people like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That just sounds like a dush. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You taking this bowling
shit way too serious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just think that bowling
is a not very optimized sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for friendship engagement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna put that out there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think it's not the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, what can I say
gentlemen? I mean it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I felt like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, 'cause I've been bowling with like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sure there is one people out there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that are like, Conner knows
what he's talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's not monkey brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, well, then they
are the kind of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna go bowling with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's always gonna be those comments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they're gonna be
like, Oh, I'm not alone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to speak up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Finally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also bowling feels like an activity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where I shouldn't have to change my shoes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's that level of activity,
that isn't serious enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to warrant me changing clothes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will admit, the shoes part
is kind of bullshit, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's not like
you're going rock-climbing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I understand the need
to bring like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flexible clothing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels like an activity
that shouldn't require me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changing clothes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I hate the fact that
you always get the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> disgusting rancid shoes, that feels so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, okay, sure, they spray it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They give it a little alcohol spray </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that does fucking anything.
The shoe is disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, to be fair though,
Japan is really good, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> With that cleanliness and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I've never gotten... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've had that in Australia where like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Still I don't wanna
fucking wear my fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wales Waldo shoes while
I'm talking to my friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating the most pathetic
fries in existence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that had been half cooked, while we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a half good conversation
and overpriced alcohol. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think bowling
needs to be done better, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's depressing as
fuck, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's like with someone
with childhood trauma, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bowling alley. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who hurt you Conner? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Show me on the door where... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Show me on the doorway bowling is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Show me on the bowling ball. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No no no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My closing statement on bowling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. There's a question
I need to ask you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because have you had
bad bowling experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you were a kid or is it something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you developed as an adult? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, as I become an adult
all this became a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, now that I have that
thought now where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I just realized, 'cause bowling places </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> always had arcades, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I had more fun on the
arcade than the bowler </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whenever I went bowling. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So what does that say about bowling? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you know, when there was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If you would have a party with 12 kids, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you are waiting a long fucking time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before your turn.
- I feel like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't enjoy bowling for the same reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you skipped stories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I want the game play. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like if you could just
bowl 10 balls in a row, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then have conversation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure you would enjoy it then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but you're just like, skip,
skip, skip, skip, skip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, because it's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if you're like this but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it's like not my turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have a tiny bit of
anxiety of like, fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> when's it gonna be my turn? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know when it's gonna be my turn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I don't get called out? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna be that much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're not that serious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know it isn't but this is the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I have someone out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're only throwing
balls to an alley way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone out there
viewing experiences where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just like, yeah,
it's kind of anxious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just not knowing when I'm
gonna to fucking stand up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and throw something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I just don't like to know that okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna just do it and
then I can come back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You treating it like it's
a fucking quick time event. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you can go out whenever you want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanna talk to my
homies or play the arcades. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can we separate them both? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well then maybe you'll enjoy bowling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if it was a one player game. You will just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play bowling by yourself.
They'll be like finally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I get all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know my best experience bowling was? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Wee Sports, that was the
best project. You know why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No waiting, I just throw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that shit-
- And its 100% optimized. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you had that a 100 pin ball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that should be fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I love watching YouTube videos </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of people getting like a 1000 pins. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just amazing. It feels good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well then maybe we should do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just we bowling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, we bowling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no. I still gotta wait
for you to do it yourself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know you can skip it if you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Skip Joey's turn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Skip, skip, skip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I feel like talking
to you for enough times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, yeah, I kind of
get the monkey brain now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's starting to make sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like scientifically dissecting
how you're breaking away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just think, 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not my pool or darts so constantly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like talking and next to each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Doesn't really fucking
matter when it's my turn, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but bowling, 'cause it's like, hard, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to walk up and you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But why don't you walk up with them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And also, you know,
okay, I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm never been a big fan
of having to pick the ball. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I own for it. I'm kind
of sick of doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, 'cause you've been there, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That one place where they don't
have your fucking hand size. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like they're too fucking
big where it feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're tryna grab three
fucking food containers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like large, or it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes, I want my fingers to be crushed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to death and potentially just pull my... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like dislocate my finger
when I throw this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know 'cause you've
been to a place like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I haven't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I'm laughing, because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been to your place and you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I kinda enjoy this bowling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because none of these
fucking balls fit my hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, the one thing I
will say about bowling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is that no matter ball
you choose somehow it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't feel right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It never feels good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you pick a ball and
you're like, this feels right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you throw it like,
Ooh, that didn't feel good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me go for the smaller one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you throw it
and you're like, nah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that feels too light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So you go for the big one again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just, I don't know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never get the right one
and it's never satisfying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're in a constant
state of anxiety to be like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You guys must have gone
to some shit bowling alley. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, they don't fucking
clean those bowling balls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on the inside either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. That's all the more
reason I wanna take you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a Japanese bowling ball,
because every single thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that you guys have been
complaining about the bowling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> experience, I feel is
completely get rid of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I'm in the middle for this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't hate bowling as much as Conner, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but if I would like to make like a TLS, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> bowling's like good sea tale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's definitely one of the worst. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I'm not gonna say that bowling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is an extreme experience or anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like if there is a BET for me as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can say its like
the fairy tale all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its like the fairy tale
of entertainment sports. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Conner laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's just a mid man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bowling is mid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember I went on a
date when I first got here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they wanted to get a Bagus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, yeah, sure, sure, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Three Bagus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then at the back
of my head, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I'll take it easy on you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I just started fucking
destroying them in that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they are out there like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh man, I guess you got lucky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> We started playing darts, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I started just fucking
crushing them in that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, yeah, good, know your place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm joking, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That actually he beat me in darts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Does the word casual mean anything to you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like just playing casually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now bowling is a casual player sport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like bowlers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 'cause you can't win in it Conner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe that's why 'cause
I fucking suck at bowling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe that's why I hate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I always wanted to
ask you, like going back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the monkey brain thing,
like your opinion on gameplay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we've had a few comments about this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why don't you like fighting games? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is-
- That is pool for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The game genre that
would like in theory, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> appeal to you the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, there's no story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably like the
one type of video game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've just never enjoyed playing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have no... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think is like the difficulty
curve is insanely high, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel that like, I
don't wanna sit there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have to research combos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because sure, when I pull
one off, I'm like, cool, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that animation was fine I guess, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't feel like I care enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about like to learn these combos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas in a game, like,
a first person shooter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so intuitive that like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's just one button. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's risky just
putting click, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, it is very... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyone can figure it out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's that one simple
mechanic that you keep mastering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you keep getting better and better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so it's the kind of like I've noticed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I really only enjoy
games where it's easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to learn how to master type of thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And fighting game is just hard to learn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even harder to master. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I still fighting games that are easy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to learn how to master. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. The Smash maybe? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. Smash, I think is the one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really enjoy Smash. Smash is fun, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I feel that
it's just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not like fucking Tekken rafter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where I have to worry
about like the frames </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the frame spacing and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna worry about that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean like people in
smash worry about that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you can get to a high enough level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But smash is a casual
game there I said it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what Socrates says. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a take. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just like fucking
made a thousand people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (inhaling quickly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love watching Smash competitive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for me it's a party game, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well that's the great
thing about Smash, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that it's really fun
to watch as a party game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's also really fun process. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thing that's really hard
about fighting games is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's hardly ever a party game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Right? Because whenever you are at a party </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and people playing fighting games, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's always that guy or two guys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know who you are, you
see people put on like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Smash we'll take it, and you're like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause they never
leave that fucking couch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They will never leave it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If anything is pissed, they're not going. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They'll wait till they get home. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Fighting games don't wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like this is what they've
trained their entire life for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, okay, let me smash the move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me smash all the people at this party. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they need to find
other people like them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to continue on this path that
they've put themselves on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the same people who rock up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to an anime convention just
with that, like the game pad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're like, I know
why I'm spending this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is like speed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's no question
about where I'm spending </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> these three days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Put me to the room with the Wee U's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I feel like with
fighting games, it's yeah... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I enjoy watching fighting games more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than I enjoy playing them because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get to a point where
you just smashing buttons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like I kind of get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you go online or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just get destroyed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There is like the difficulty curve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as you said is just casual, but to be... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The difference between
a beginner and a casual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is so fucking massive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh it's huge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know. Because you
go from button mashing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to having to learn like basic theory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of fighting games of basic combos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the difference between that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like counting frames and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The difference between the beginner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the casual is so fucking hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. For example, in a
game of Overwatch, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> A pro can be killed by someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who is absolutely garbage at the game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it's very plausible
that he could do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But in a fighting game,
fucking pro is never gonna lose </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> to a casual like that,
it's not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think that element
of like, all right, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if I just play better, most
of the time I'll always win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's because of fighting games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no element of chance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And anyway, like, especially if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at a pro level because they
just know what's coming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I think its kind of fun
and that's the kind of stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that really drives me into like overdrive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of wanting to learn something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that like, I had a chance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of beating that guy and
I could have done it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I just keep practicing,
I'll easily get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I keep going, and
that's how I got into league. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So then maybe if you just gave that a go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I reckon if you learn one
fighting game, you'll be- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I reckon I will be hurt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is why I don't want to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm already
trying to learn Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the last thing I need is
something else taking care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of my fucking life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fair enough. Fair, fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like fighting games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People I know who like
fighting games, super chill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but their life is fighting games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't talk about anything else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, Oh, you had a nice day? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, that's cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a nice day learning
this mash combos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like what? Like they'll bring it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up when it's not even in the conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I love Leonardo DiCaprio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what it sounds like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes it's just horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like Leonardo DiCaprio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which somehow turned into Smash. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like what? What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's my shame the way
I'd smashed my combos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and stupid stuff and it's like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like stop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will say like from the outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looking in the fighting
game community looks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like one of the funnest
communities to be in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the trash talking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The trash talking is so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, like in League of Legends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They ban that shit and I'm
like, dude, I love trash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love trash talking in video games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's so fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe it's because of the trash talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in some of those communities
just go a little bit too far. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe. I mean, Legal
Legends is not trash talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I'm good to
kill you and your family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a legit threat sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I reserve the right to just
type to someone you're bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I think that's... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Come off.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Someone can do it to me. I won't mind it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It won't ruin my day. I'm not like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - In a sense, that's one of the worst ways </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to trash-talk right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you just stop and just typed in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you are bad in chat, lowercase, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey quivering) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How dare you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the worst type of insult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I competed on the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> One time they did a gaming tournament </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for my universities, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was really fucking
good at Cod. And so I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You were one of those kids, aren't you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I competed on that. So- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course you were called the wicked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course you were. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So there was this thing... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, my mates will just go
on this whole tangent then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now if you guys are fine
with that, I used to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I was 15, I went to a
fuck ton of Cod tournament's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because Modern Warfare 3,
and if you've ever played, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you would play Modern Warfare? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I stopped at Modern Warfare 2. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. So Modern Warfare
3 had this thing where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could pay like $40 a year or whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the pass for all the maps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you can also go on
this website that they had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like tournaments,
and I entered one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and they would have a prize for, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> first 10 people get a shot
glasses of Call of Duty, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like ladies fucked anyone who's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> over the age of 18, but 15 on me was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ( Conner straightening up) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wow!
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can pull my G fuel into that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, wow! I can be
like can I get something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for playing called. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I went to my mate's house 'cause I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that my parents would never let me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pull an all-nighter because bear in mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these tournaments were... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Essentially what they
were was a stat tracking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so it would be 24 hours tournament, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of where you would just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It would be like most
kills in team death match. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you would just go into a normal team </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> death match and just play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it would count
how many kills you hadn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> team death match before
and how many death sets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So basically just like who can get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the highest score. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right. So, basically it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you just fucking keep
playing and I shit you not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I played fucking like capture the flag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for 20 hours straight during this to- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Win these shots like hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To win these shot glasses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like crippled after it was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was worth it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I came like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I won so many at that
time that I was able to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to sleep confidently knowing
that no one would be up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'd be able to like overtake me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it came like third
or something, so I won. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, what happened
was that it all changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> They changed it so that
it was three hours now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> way more manageable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt nodding) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, sweet, I
can enter all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like most flags defended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and captured, that weird shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So sometimes I would be sitting
at my base, just waiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> for someone to take my
flag, kill them, get it back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then just go back and camp. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I would do this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I won like 15 tournament or
something in the end. I won- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So my room was full of shackles. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll tell you what though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was the best prize you got? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - iPad Pro, at the time- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh wow.
- [Garnt] Wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - iPad, when I was like 17, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the brand new iPad at the time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my mum thought that I was a drug dealer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because she was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause all this stuff turned up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I won this huge poker
set, wooden poker set. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They only made 250 of them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I still have it at my, at my house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I couldn't sell it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it was worth about 700 pounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a wood box this
big and you open it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all these wooden
poker chips, handcrafted, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cord tapes, dealerships,
metal, immaculate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll show you pictures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'll be on screen
right now. It's crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was doing these for ages. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I won like three skateboard decks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't skateboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck should I do with it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A hoodie, two coaster sets
that I still use actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> metal coasters with like Cod skulls on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Who the fucking cream stuff? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> One like wall decals,
which I couldn't use. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I sold most of the
stuff on eBay, but yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I won an iPad Pro, which is one time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And then, I got banned, from competing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why?
- 'Cause you were too good? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, the rules were not well-defined. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know how to, how do I describe it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You sneaky mother fucker? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You bent the rules to say- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, if I saw an opportunity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to win an iPad Pro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna take the
opportunity to win an iPad Pro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it seemed all legit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So about halfway through these tournaments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I realized, okay, I'm trying
really hard to win these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I think I can also do it a lot easier. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So basically what I would do is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd won a bunch of these tournaments, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I used that notoriety
from those tournaments, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to recruit people to come, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause all it would do
is track your stats. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So everyone else on
your team didn't matter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So if you had a team that was
coordinated into making sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you were the one
getting everything, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you basically smuffed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So what I did was is I got
these five Swedish players. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For some reason the Swedish and Norwegian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> do it always fucking amazing in Cod. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were way too good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I promised them if they help me win </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all these tournaments,
I would join their clan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like negotiating online. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be like I won't
shout you out, I will join. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Bear in mind, I wasn't worth anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But to them, they were like, yo, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's winning all these tournaments. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We've got to get this guy in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So did you know of the game mode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like kill confirmed? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically a game of
where you killed someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they would drop a tag
and you'd have to collect it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So there was one tournament that was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whoever gets the most kill
confirms in three hours, won. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So what I did was I told these guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, hey, kill these
dudes, and put a marker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the map of where you dropped
it and don't collect it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I just ran around,
collecting them all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't kill anyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I should have not done that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because what I knew was happening was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first place was like
1200, second place 400, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it raised like a lot of alarm bells. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> The people were like,
that doesn't seem fair. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So I got away with it for
two or three tournaments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> before people started really complaining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And people were like, this isn't fair. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's winning everything 'cause of this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then the thing was,
people started doing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So then it was a matter of everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was fucking cheating each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And because there was some
real fucking big boy prizes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was a Jeep, one of
them, which I fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like 10 points off
winning a fucking Jeep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the age of 16, bear
in mind, I was killed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was winning all these
prizes under my dad's name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause they wouldn't
ship it to you if you were- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Underage.
- underage yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They also made me fill out tax forms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which I couldn't even
legally fill out, which I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you tell your dad
that you were like filling out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, dad, I
have won a bunch of stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's gonna turn up to
the house in a UPS fab, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about 20 items. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I need you to pretend
that you won them dad, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were very visibly, like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they were like, okay, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so the thing that got me banned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from these tournament's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was this one
price that was, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the movie battleship
with featuring Rihanna? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah Rihanna. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that horrible movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were promoting
the movie Battleship. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One of the prizes was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could rent out a whole movie theater </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and take all your friends
to get drinks, snacks- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Secure the whole battleship. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I only thought to myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the amount of street
credit I'll get for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is just an outstanding move I'll need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the experience out
there and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. Bear in mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to say people
might've scored bullshit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on this whole thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was literally eight
hours a day addicted to Cod. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So straight up, like
made for me to do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what I had was this was a
team death match tournament. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember this so vividly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and team death mantra to kill them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So what I would do is
I would ask my friends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to go around with riot
shields and Kaji replay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't kill anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> If you can trap them in a
corner, tell me where they are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll come over and pop them in the head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So what we would do is I coordinated- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The mafia.
- It was literally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What incentive did you give them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to follow everything you said? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was keeping this all for myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I never ever told them once
I was gonna help them do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like I'm just
gonna take the prizes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you guys can help
me and they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it sounds good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds like a good deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It actually is great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I do remember thinking... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the Swedish dudes,
they had reason, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I said I would join that team. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did join that team and
we won a lot of tournaments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah, there are a lot of
the other people who helped me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> out. No incentive whatsoever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I just wanted to have fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was entertaining as a fact
to just go in and do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I won some of these
tournaments on my own </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I was sweating my ass off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I would have to really play my best. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I thought, why
do that when I can just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> get it secured? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's in the rules,
the rules against it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, why am I sweating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I can just guarantee the W? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, so yeah, I did that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And by that time that
they implemented a feature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you could see a heat
map of what was happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People were starting to see
that it was like 75 kills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to me, zero, zero, zero,
zero with my teammates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And people were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hmmmm, hmmmm,
- That's a little sauce. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't seem like a normal
game of team death match. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He got a nuke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Conner flexing his shoulder muscles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so what happened was is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they wanted to make an example out of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, no more doing this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one else is allowed to do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've banned this from happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so they banned me from doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember I spoke to the other... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause there was like four of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who won all of these tournaments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the other two were 30
year old men who worked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in construction companies and this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> all they would do in their free time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I felt bad for them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that was like a 15
year old kid being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna take the money
that you probably need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need this shit, I'm gonna take it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well I thought they banned you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you kind of became that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You were like V for Vendetta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like I wanted to make a statement </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I got banned for it, but
it was worth it to get the W. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Up to this day, I was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The one year after that
I was so fucking bitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was like wasn't
in their fucking rules. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They just didn't make
an example out of me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their website shut down five months after- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Down with the government. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. The website fails five months </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after I was like, yeah, fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - They emailed me like two
years later being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hey could you fill out
those tax forms we sent you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I just never did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, what are you gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I live in a different country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you gonna do, sue me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They can't sue you for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was 15 at that time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How legit was this website? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the official Call
of Duty website. It was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you wanted to go and track your stats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd have to go and do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And you would just get
10 pounds extra a year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to get access to the tournament. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you're that guy who just tries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to cheat every system in life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh dude, yeah. Like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Over-optimize everything yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, if there's like loopholes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> or corners to be cut, I'll
just always find them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause it's like, that's- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You work smarter, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like why would I, work harder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I can just do things easy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, that's what I want to do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what like every criminal says </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it was... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was not cheating, there was no rule </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> against what I was doing
and they fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They banned me 'cause I was
too good at their own game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wasn't cheating, I was
just bending the rules. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I was outsmarting-
- I was so sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was outsmarting the system. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm so fucking sad 'cause like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are now, I was
outsmarting the system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only thing... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> The only truth. Okay. Too bad that iPad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I got mad mileage out of that iPad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was worth the goal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That iPad was worth-
- I can Imagine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like $2,000 at the
time, so that was amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And my mum was like, still
even after it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hmmmm, if you got an iPad,
you start to send dick pics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to somebody's Conner? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that how you got the iPad? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You selling drugs on the side? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you winning son? Are you winning? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was such a fun time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was great, that was so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love doing that 'cause
I just won so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I won the good
stuff like the Jeeps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That dude, that would
have been a bad flex </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if you wanna chill with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a Jeep at 16?
- I was just busy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> watching animated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes I am, I was yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember the Jeep I
wasn't close to winning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but there was one time
where they had quad bikes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like four quad bikes,
worth about 10 grand maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I came fucking fourth and it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the top three and I came four by draw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'd drawn for it and I
didn't get it because of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so annoyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, mum, I didn't
get the quad bikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would you even be able
to use the quad bikes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I suppose in Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In wales yeah you have plenty of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to sell them too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think like four out of
the 30 people in my class </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> had quad bikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's everyone had
quad bikes for some reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Those were the guys who
like came in the top three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Man, see my quad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how they got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's how they got it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was yeah, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it would have been problematic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I got that though because
I'm not sure how much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> my dad could have bull-shitted, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I imagine that
would have been a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more forms involved when
it came to a court plan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like UPS isn't just dropping
off a quad bike like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Holding his insurance
and everything right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did he ever find out
how you got those stuff? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. They knew. They were just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the first few
tournaments that I said I won </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they didn't believe me, until... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause all of the stuff to end
up at once, like these 20... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I won around
15 tournament's total. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they all turned up at
the same day, the prizes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And my mum was like in complete disbelief. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She was like, you weren't lying? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish I could get my mum onto a test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She probably has a better
memory of it than me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I don't remember it very well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You are the epitome
of "I am winning dad". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally was that
hyper competitive kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I found something I
really liked, it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would get just insanely good at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - How I wish I could have
that, 'cause I like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> If I found something that I was... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause in that sense you're
very much like a perfectionist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that kind of things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not like that, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm good enough, then
that's good enough for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can never be like that. We stopped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But the problem is if
I don't have that drive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of don't care about anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because like for me- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so flirting . </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - For me when it comes gaming, I... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> In every kind of competitive game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always have this honeymoon period where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just learning the
game and it's just fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then when you start playing ranks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like ranked for the first few months, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like yeah, this is pretty fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you get to
that you hit the ball... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You hit the wall, and that's for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it stops getting fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That stuff for me is
when it starts becoming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a nine to five grind,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like, I'm not even
having fun grinding anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This feels like another job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm getting angry for some
reason over a fucking video game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Flashback. When I was in
my promos, I was close... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I was one game away from
being in master Tia at TFT. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'd only been playing it for a month, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, I'm gonna
be a fucking pro at TFT. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm actually gonna be a pro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I got demoted and I just lost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all interest in the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like to get better,
the amount of mind power </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd have to like exert,
which will be too much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I can't do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You realize to get 10%
better, would take like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> eight hours a day of playing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, I can't do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not worth it.
- I can't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd rather be just like an average Joe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at like a lot of different things rather </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than excel at like a couple of things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I'm the opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's what I've been. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been like really bad at
a lot of things in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the things that I
do, like you're like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you are really, really good at. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you are just super into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Normally when I'm into something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I rarely think about anything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I only wanna do this one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm going to do it as much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as possible until I'm bored of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when I'm bored of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I pretty much never come back to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just the every episode, just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the monkey brain
- I totally- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just gets like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know people look at it... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I know people, I already see some curse, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like Conner must be bullshitting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> One or two of the stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've like messed up the details and had to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking elaborate,
like go a bit extra but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guarantee that the stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where I'm talking about chess and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get, I see so many
people in the summer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it'd be like Conner's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's bullshitting.
- Kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experienced too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they're like he's bullshitting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one human can experience
this much in his life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's, it's normally the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the stupidest stories where I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe enjoy the details a bit more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make it more entertaining. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the stories that I'm talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. That was that legit happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like I don't
remember a lot of my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> back at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Back like I think, there's just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if it's like,
obviously not with you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but with Juju, do you have
a blank period in your life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you just don't remember much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of things that happened?
- Of high school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's just because I was doing drugs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I'm to be frank with
you, that's exactly why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you keeping that
in? You want that in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm okay with that, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It is the truth, I don't remember it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because there was the time
when we were talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how you were getting into anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I think you mentioned that... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But there's a reason Cory said what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I just stopped watching anime or like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was he jacking off? Is that
what he was insinuating? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was he like selling his body for sex? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what was it? It's
like, no, I was doing drugs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just to put it out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not hard Drugs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just like to pinpoint that,
not hard drugs, but yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that's where I had
that blank of just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't really doing
anything with my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And all I was really
doing was playing music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or playing games but not to the extent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you are playing games, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just like on new grounds
playing the bullshittest, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> dumbest fucking flash games
that have ever existed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I guess for me, the only thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been super invested
in is my career now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is YouTube, and I do
think of YouTube as a game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's totally a game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's totally a game of ad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's pretty wide being able
to like, you know, I guess- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Optimize it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess 'cause I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the way I see it is kind of like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have fucking optimized
YouTube game though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know.
- I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that there are many aspects </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that it shares with a game, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unfortunately.
- Yeah, yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean there's still a
huge creative aspect of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think there's ways to like iterate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on yourself that are very game-like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like social media
in general is a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You look at something like
Twitter, where I think... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I've watched this series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by this guy called Charlie Brooker, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he made a series called the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Top Most Influential
Video Games of All Time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he put number one was Twitter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and at first I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck is he talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Twitter isn't the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you think about it where like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah, you play an avatar
in line to affirm numbers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the more he gets into it
the more numbers you affirm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, you know,
he's kind gotta a point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, he's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Nobody really... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like playing a version of yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's not like you don't
show all of yourself online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one ever does show themselves online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've got to optimize
every tweet you make. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Should I rephrase it in this way? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Is this funny thing to Tweet or? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know how some
people can fucking tweet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 50 tweets in a day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think I have 50 tweets, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 50 thoughts in a
day, let alone like 15. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Remember when... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you ever get those moments? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, Oh, I wanna
find that one funny tweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from that account. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you're scrolling
and scrolling and scrolling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, Oh, it's
only been seven hours ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck? Stop tweeting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You tweet too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like how many? That's
the thing it's like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you just that kind of person where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you just can't think about
the thought to yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like I have to put
this out into the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We'll, shall people
get like a fucking coffee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at Starbucks like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Conner mimicking with his fingers) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I got us coffee from Starbucks, oh my God! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stay relatable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My God. Yeah, Twitter is a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's a hard game, but I enjoy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, that's gonna be, fuck.... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to go an episode or two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't tell a fucking
elaborate stupid long story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I could pretty remember that I used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to fucking play Cod competitors. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't even get to the
reason why I brought it up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's a story for another time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's all right.
Well, we'll leave it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for the next episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Remember how this episode
was a power Japanese night? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey man, we spoke about
that long enough, Cod came up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was like I said
everything I wanted to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about Japanese nightlife. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll come back to when
we've experienced more of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like there's so much
more of Japanese nightlife </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We need.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll see that Trash Tastes
special in a soap blend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We're gonna go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> If you don't know what a
soap blend is, it's a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a place where
you get clean with soap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have a service- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You cleanse yourself- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have a service
and they don't advertise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which soap they use. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They advertise which women are doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you can fucking figure out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> why that's the case on your own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was concerned with, well, what kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scrubbing method do they use? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I was like, I
need to know the phrase, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is it grass-spread? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do I bring my own loofa or
are they going to have one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do I need to bring a shower cap? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do they use their own soap? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Or I bring my, like my organics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a whole gap
organic that I need to use. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Meanwhile, the guy's
getting the hand job next </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me and I'm like, well,
that's kind of wooo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not okay with the soap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never been to one by the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just wanna make that very clear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> before someone fucking assumes so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm sure you guys have in as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no,
