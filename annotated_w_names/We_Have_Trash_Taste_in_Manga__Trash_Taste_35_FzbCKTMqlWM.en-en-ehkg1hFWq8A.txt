<garnt> (yelling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably do a (yelling) </garnt>
<joey> montage one day. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> - But like a fast cut, just like. </garnt>
<garnt> (yelling) </garnt>
<joey> - At the beginning of every fucking Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<garnt> Just one of us going. </garnt>
<garnt> (yelling) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm waiting for the day that someone just like samples, </garnt>
<joey> all of our audio and just makes </joey>
<joey> like a low-fi beat out of it. </joey>
<joey> - Do it. </joey>
<garnt> - Do it. - Do it. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (mellow music playing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> The anime podcast, where we talk about Japan, food </garnt>
<garnt> shitting and occasionally anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host for today, Gigguk. </garnt>
<garnt> And with me, are the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's our new tagline. - As always. </garnt>
<garnt> - Isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, well, what is a tagline </garnt>
<garnt> that could go well with Trash Taste? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> that sounds about right. (Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that's probably (Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> the most accurate. (Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - The anime podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anime podcast where it's 5% anime, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - 95% everything else. </garnt>
<garnt> - But how are you guys doing? - Good. </garnt>
<connor> How are you boys doing? - Good. Good. </connor>
<garnt> - Doing all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Since last week </garnt>
<garnt> we spoke about Claymore and I was like fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll read Claymore. </garnt>
<connor> And it was really good. </connor>
<connor> - You literally just finished it like </connor>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Two minutes before we started recording. </garnt>
<garnt> - But to be fair, (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> If you haven't read Claymore and are thinking about it. </connor>
<garnt> Don't worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't need to know anything. </garnt>
<garnt> Manga's good until the halfway </garnt>
<garnt> and then it kind of just goes a bit shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, second half's </garnt>
<garnt> definitely underwhelming. - The *star's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like a lot of anime or manga do this. </garnt>
<garnt> Where they build up like this fucking amazing world </garnt>
<joey> that I think is too big of a scope. </joey>
<joey> And then they just *let like fuck, </joey>
<joey> we need to finish this. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like within like 200 chapters. - Mm. </joey>
<connor> - How do we do that? </connor>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. - Well </garnt>
<garnt> I think for a lot of the times, </garnt>
<joey> at least with like Shonen Jump </joey>
<joey> cause *claim was from Shonen Jump. </joey>
<joey> A lot of the times the authors don't really have a choice </joey>
<garnt> as to how long it goes for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> Shonen Jump goes through the same problem. </garnt>
<garnt> As you know, a lot of American TV shows where, you know </garnt>
<garnt> you have some like rare, </garnt>
<connor> like something like Breaking Bad for example, </connor>
<connor> it's like a rarity where a show just gets better, </connor>
<connor> it hits its peak and then it stops, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> But the problem which - Then better call Saul </connor>
<connor> comes along. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's more like a spinoff. </garnt>
<connor> - I think Better Call Saul's better than Breaking Bad. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. Okay. You're one of those. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> (mumbles) - No. You're one of those. </connor>
<connor> - You're one of those. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's really fucking good. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't seen either one so I can't say. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. Yeah, go on. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, the problem with a lot of it, </garnt>
<garnt> like Shonen Jump Manga, </garnt>
<garnt> is that the most of the time </garnt>
<garnt> they either go on for too short or they get dragged out. </garnt>
<garnt> You either you're either like a Bleach or you are something </garnt>
<garnt> that gets canceled early, </garnt>
<garnt> like most other Shonen Jump shows. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. That's the thing is right. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that like with Shonen Jump, </garnt>
<connor> they have every month they have rankings. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And if you have even just a slight dip in popularity, </connor>
<connor> then they're kind of just like well time to wrap it up, </connor>
<connor> boy oh. </connor>
<garnt> *And the author's like well, I, I just, I just got started. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, it doesn't matter. </connor>
<garnt> You got to wrap it up. - I- </garnt>
<connor> - I wonder if that's what happened, but to be fair, </connor>
<connor> when I was reading this it's 150 chapters. </connor>
<joey> Around like the 80th is, I was like, ah, yeah </joey>
<joey> this isn't going to end like great. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh*! - It ended. </garnt>
<connor> which is better than most. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you know, yeah. It's better than like </garnt>
<garnt> what happened to like Yuyu Hakusho right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the last doctor's got completely fucking gutted. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you can tell when an, when an author </garnt>
<garnt> just like has to wrap things up </garnt>
<joey> in five chapters or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - It's just like- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. True, true. </connor>
<connor> Some, some, some stuff that they've been building up </connor>
<connor> for like a hundred to 200 chapters just gets wrapped up </connor>
<connor> in 10 chapters and you're like, what the fuck was this? </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, cool. </garnt>
<connor> - And then there's like the opposite of that </connor>
<garnt> with what's the Manga cover Hunter Hunter called? </garnt>
<garnt> - Togashi. - Togashi. </garnt>
<joey> - Togashi. Yeah, he introduces like the dark continent </joey>
<joey> when he can't make one chapter. </joey>
<connor> And he's like, how about I just expand the world tenfold. </connor>
<garnt> - I tweeted out about it the other day, but I found out </garnt>
<garnt> the other day that in the span that it took </garnt>
<garnt> Togashi to release chap- </garnt>
<garnt> Volume 32 to 33, Assassination Classroom started and ended. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> So if you don't know, Hunter Hunter has been on hiatus. </connor>
<garnt> Not hiatus. Basically, we had a chapter </garnt>
<garnt> like once every two years. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's definitely a hiatus. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. We got a check </connor>
<garnt> once or two years. - H X H is short for hiatus </garnt>
<garnt> and hiatus. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - What counts as a hiatus nowadays? </garnt>
<garnt> Is, is it like a Hunter Hunter hiatus </garnt>
<garnt> or Berserk Mura* hiatus. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean kind of the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's just like, </garnt>
<joey> maybe it's just a very slow release schedule, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - True, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - But have you seen some of Hunter Hunter's latest chapters? </joey>
<joey> Have you seen some of the dark continent chapters? </joey>
<connor> I've read. </connor>
<connor> I've seen like some of the later chapters </connor>
<connor> and some of them are just literally there are pages </connor>
<garnt> that it's just all texts. </garnt>
<garnt> `There's like one character and it's literally </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually saw it on Twitter, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. It's just a full page of text. </garnt>
<garnt> And at this one, I'm just like Togashi, </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to write a light novel </garnt>
<garnt> just write a light novel. </garnt>
<connor> - This Manga * is just somehow like writing a book </connor>
<connor> without realizing, I don't know how you do that. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, he's kind of releasing volumes </garnt>
<garnt> on the schedule of like light novel volumes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. It's like, why, why </garnt>
<garnt> why are we pretending that this is a Manga anymore? </garnt>
<connor> - And like the drawings? </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God. Like- - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Just hire - I mean. It's like- </garnt>
<joey> - Hire someone on deviant art man. </joey>
<connor> Just do it already like. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> What's going on? - Well, wait. </connor>
<garnt> What I want to know is like cause I don't think Togashi </garnt>
<connor> uses assistance. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe. Probably not. </connor>
<connor> Would spend a lot. - Probably not </connor>
<connor> Because if not you'd think- - This is all assumptions, </connor>
<garnt> I think </garnt>
<garnt> - You'd think that he'd get assistance to draw, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Wife. </garnt>
<garnt> - His wife? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, well yeah. His wife is the author of Sailor. </garnt>
<connor> Shit. So I guess. - Almost dissed on his wife. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - We dissed one of the greatest * Manga authors of all time. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> All right, listen. Hunter Hunter. </garnt>
<garnt> If you haven't read or seen it, just do it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> But be prepared for I guess - I just say </garnt>
<garnt> - To never be felt complete. - So here's the thing. </garnt>
<joey> - I haven't read Hunter Hunter at all, </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah. - But I have </joey>
<garnt> all of the volumes up until this point. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, watch the anime. </connor>
<connor> The anime is so fucking good. - Yeah. No- </connor>
<garnt> - The anime's great. </garnt>
<garnt> It's one of the few anime </garnt>
<garnt> that I think is better than the manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's because- - The 2011 version? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah The 2011 version. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because some of the later like arcs, </garnt>
<joey> especially the Chimera Ant arc </joey>
<joey> Togashi's arc is really up and down. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because of, you know his health complications. </garnt>
<garnt> That was going through but like </garnt>
<garnt> the anime is just consistent throughout. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - So then when he doesn't know, I would recommend him </connor>
<garnt> because I'd recommend- - Because I know so much about </garnt>
<connor> the series, like of like characters and like *yeah. </connor>
<connor> (mumbles) you know. - I know so many references </connor>
<garnt> but I've actually sat down a read a lot. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I think I know enough about Naruto to like, </connor>
<garnt> to like lie - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> my way through a conversation and be like, </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) oh yeah, the leaf village? Crazy. </connor>
<garnt> - I could probably lie my way through a Fullmetal Alchemist </garnt>
<connor> conversation. - Yeah *(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I have done many times. </garnt>
<connor> - Ah , man. That's just so sad bro. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean let's be real! </garnt>
<connor> Like, I feel we've all done that </connor>
<connor> where like everyone around you is talking </connor>
<connor> about an anime and you kind of just like, huh yeah. That. </connor>
<garnt> That thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - For like five years, I was an anime fan </garnt>
<garnt> who hadn't watched *Stephen galleon. </garnt>
<joey> People would be like, dude, it's Epic. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, yeah dude. Get in the robot.* </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, my dad hates me. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, dude. Love that. </joey>
<joey> Love the part where the mechs* fight. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's just crazy. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Just do that </connor>
<garnt> - I admittedly did that a little bit with, with Bleach. </garnt>
<connor> - It's when you're insecure, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I did that for a while with Bleach </connor>
<joey> because I didn't, I dropped it at the Eisenach. </joey>
<joey> So anything after that, I had no fucking idea, </joey>
<connor> but people around me kept reading it and they were like, </connor>
<connor> yeah! You know, the whole like wicked *mundo stuff. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> that thing. Yeah. - Whack a mundo?* </garnt>
<garnt> That thing. Totally. *munjo. - To be fair. </garnt>
<garnt> To be fair, which is one of, </garnt>
<garnt> one of those anime or manga that you could </garnt>
<garnt> you could feasibly lie your way out of it and make it seem </garnt>
<garnt> like you've seen it without having seen it </garnt>
<garnt> after you've watched like a further first few arcs, </garnt>
<garnt> then you kinda just kinda just </garnt>
<garnt> you kinda can just bullshit your way through. </garnt>
<garnt> - I too also want </garnt>
<garnt> to see more bang kae* - I feel like this thing </garnt>
<garnt> One Piece, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause One Piece is so long. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like the Simpsons, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where everything that could ever happen </garnt>
<garnt> has probably happened. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So you could be like, dude, my favorite episode </garnt>
<garnt> is where like Homer Simpson becomes a crack addict. </garnt>
<garnt> That's probably an episode on the Simpsons, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean You can probably do that with One Piece right now </connor>
<connor> 'cause you're the only one who hasn't seen it. </connor>
<joey> So you can just randomly be like, yeah </joey>
<garnt> I love that episode with *Loofy and Chopper make out. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love the ep- </garnt>
<connor> I love the part where the pirates </connor>
<connor> find another band of pirates that are bad initially </connor>
<garnt> and then turn and are a part of some military. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they're like, do let's just be good. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's help Loofy out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. The water seminar. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that like a thing? (mumbles) </garnt>
<connor> - That probably happened. - Probably. Something. </connor>
<garnt> - That was vague enough that </garnt>
<garnt> - If I keep it vague </garnt>
<garnt> that could be about four different arcs of One Piece. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes. I know enough base information about One Piece. </connor>
<garnt> I still haven't read it yet. </garnt>
<garnt> Again, I downloaded some episodes, some chapters on my phone </garnt>
<connor> but maybe, maybe one day. </connor>
<garnt> - So you're downloading a lot of chapters now. I see. </garnt>
<connor> No, I have like </connor>
<connor> I have like 10 volumes downloaded, which isn't much. </connor>
<joey> - How far into it? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, because we're approaching what? </garnt>
<garnt> Volume a hundred of One Piece. </garnt>
<garnt> - We were approaching chapter a thousand, </garnt>
<joey> I think all the way which is going to be a landmark and yeah </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Whoa. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - A thousand chapters. </garnt>
<garnt> That's- - Can you imagine? </garnt>
<garnt> Fucking a thousand. Every week. </garnt>
<garnt> A thousand chapters. </garnt>
<garnt> - I cannot fucking imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a thousand weeks at least minimum. </garnt>
<connor> - Because what I- - Has he married the author? </connor>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> I think so. - It's kind of interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> because, yeah. - Meyner* be the fact checker. </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind of interesting actually because Oda Eiichiro </connor>
<garnt> Oda Eiichiro </garnt>
<connor> I feel like you can't be married and make One Piece. </connor>
<connor> Like it's, it's pick one. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it's so interesting because like I feel not a whole- </garnt>
<garnt> - He is married. - He is married. Okay, </garnt>
<connor> because like not a whole lot about Oda is even known. </connor>
<joey> Because he's so rarely what makes any like TV appearances </joey>
<garnt> or like interview appearances. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's too busy fucking writing a chapter a week, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's not just doing that. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause Oda out of every author is way more involved </garnt>
<joey> in the anime production as well. </joey>
<joey> - [*] Right, right. </joey>
<garnt> Because normally- - he helps produce, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah. Normally a lot of Amie productions </garnt>
<garnt> people were just like, okay, there's the author. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the author just get sidelined </garnt>
<garnt> and they just continue doing that stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And maybe they'll watch the anime, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> But you know, Oda's been involved </garnt>
<garnt> in a lot of the anime production, which I did... </garnt>
<garnt> Where does he find the time to do this? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Ah, like as a sh- this man is like </garnt>
<garnt> a time management machine. </garnt>
<garnt> - As a Shonen Jump author, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how you can have a life. </garnt>
<garnt> Like most authors don't have a life. </garnt>
<garnt> outside of their magazine. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, most of them have health complications </garnt>
<garnt> because of how much they work. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not to mentioned that like I swear </garnt>
<garnt> with every new chapter odors, art is just evolving. </garnt>
<joey> Like it's getting more, like some </joey>
<joey> of the recent chapters are so fucking detailed </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Where it's like, </joey>
<garnt> how do you draw this in a week? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Exactly. Why people like to piss on </garnt>
<garnt> One Piece character designs </garnt>
<garnt> because oh it looks good cartoonish. </garnt>
<connor> Looks childish. - They do look fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> - They do look weird. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but at least it's like so distinct </connor>
<connor> to the point where you can look at a character and be like, </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah that's a One Piece character. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. - Yeah. True. </garnt>
<joey> You can say about Simpsons, </joey>
<joey> but you know what I mean like. - Well, yeah! </joey>
<connor> - Or Family Guy character. - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> Maybe. </connor>
<garnt> - But I would argue that that's better than </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking generic Goss looking character that could fit </garnt>
<garnt> into any like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> show of that caliber, right? - I mean it's way- </garnt>
<garnt> Any one of Oda's character designs is way more memorable </garnt>
<joey> here's generic Isokai* </joey>
<joey> protagonist number 75 - That's true. </joey>
<joey> that looks like Kerato, just re-skinned*, </joey>
<connor> you know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's, that's what I think. </connor>
<connor> I think that's my biggest problem with a lot </connor>
<connor> of light novel adaptations is that you can tell lighten </connor>
<garnt> of adaptations nowadays </garnt>
<garnt> by just by just the character design. </garnt>
<garnt> - How they look </garnt>
<garnt> - And just the art style as well. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because the character designs haven't changed </garnt>
<garnt> from like 10 years ago. - Yeah, I know, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like good-looking boy with average proportions </garnt>
<garnt> with a spiky hair, </garnt>
<garnt> color it in. </garnt>
<garnt> A weird color? There you go. - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like even a lot of like the girls as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I think one- - Here's pink haired </garnt>
<garnt> character. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, like one of my favorites </garnt>
<garnt> One of my favorite female characters to come out </garnt>
<garnt> of recent times is *my Sacra d Jima </garnt>
<garnt> from Bonnie Gail senpai.* - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> And like, I really liked all </joey>
<joey> of the cast there and all of the characters, but my God </joey>
<joey> they have such forgettable character designs. </joey>
<joey> - [*] Yeah. - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Compared to some of, some of the characters times from say </joey>
<joey> like *Mona Guthrie or something like that, which you know </joey>
<joey> it gets compared to, compared a lot to </joey>
<joey> and I see the same charm, </joey>
<joey> but in terms of the memorability of the character designs, </joey>
<garnt> it's just *bunny Girl's senpai just </garnt>
<garnt> looks like the most generic. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> that's why they had to- - well to be honest, </garnt>
<connor> - That's actually of the reasons I just didn't watch it. </connor>
<garnt> - That's why they had to put her in a bunny costume, right? </garnt>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Exactly (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - To like differentiate between </connor>
<garnt> all the other characters. - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because there's a lot of anime characters </garnt>
<connor> just like silhouette or eyes, right? </connor>
<connor> You can just know. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. And like, you know, I would argue again </garnt>
<garnt> like that's one of the strong suits about one piece, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that like, because the character </garnt>
<garnt> look so fucking wacky. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can immediately tell </garnt>
<garnt> that's a One Piece character. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's the way I describe Oda is it's some, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like you're reading a story with, from someone </garnt>
<joey> who has the imagination of a ten-year-old </joey>
<joey> but the writing skills of like Joe R R Martin </joey>
<joey> or something like that, - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> It's so weird because you see a character </joey>
<connor> like this cross-dressing ballerina, for example. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, </connor>
<connor> what is this wacky character? - Number three?* </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Mr. Two* - Mr Two* </garnt>
<garnt> I mean Mr. Two. - So yeah, Mr. Two. Mr Two.* </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I always get the numbers mixed up. </connor>
<garnt> - Mr. Two* bond clay summer </garnt>
<connor> - Mr. Green eggs and ham. (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> He's great. He's great. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I love that guy. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, you see his character design </connor>
<garnt> for the first time and you're just like this. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm never going to give a about this character </garnt>
<garnt> and then he ends up in later arcs </garnt>
<garnt> bringing you to tears sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> And just like, how did this happen? </garnt>
<garnt> How, how does he make, how did Oda make me care </garnt>
<garnt> about this person right now that you can see on screen? </garnt>
<garnt> Anyone who hasn't watched One Piece is probably looking at </garnt>
<garnt> this being like what the fuck? - Who is this clown? </garnt>
<connor> - Who is this literal clown? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's your mon- </connor>
<connor> your weekly jack off to One Piece </connor>
<connor> segment of the podcast. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - As we're going to do every week now for example. </garnt>
<garnt> - We are we going to do every week until you- </garnt>
<garnt> - Until you start reading it. </garnt>
<connor> - If I read it, well this will become </connor>
<connor> a fucking One Piece podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no. No it won't. </garnt>
<garnt> No it won't. But it might become more of a Manga podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - My, my I'll spend like 20 hours reading a Manga. </connor>
<connor> My review will be like, yeah, it's all right. </connor>
<garnt> - So wait, so what would you give out of 10, Claymore? </garnt>
<connor> - Six. </connor>
<connor> - Six? - Six? </connor>
<connor> - See I don't want to read </connor>
<garnt> anyone else's reviews of Manga. </garnt>
<garnt> At all. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to know. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I feel like right now, because I don't- </garnt>
<joey> - All right, I'm gonna head out. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't touch anything with reviews. </joey>
<joey> in terms of Manga. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the popular opinion is. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I should go to a thing. </joey>
<joey> I think it's good or bad. </joey>
<joey> I just see something I'm like, I'll read that </joey>
<garnt> and make up my own choice. </garnt>
<connor> Kind of like it there in my own bubble </connor>
<garnt> of like, - That's fair enough. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a shit what anyone else thinks. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's weird. Right? Because I feel like manga readers </garnt>
<garnt> just exist in their own bubbles, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause when we talk about the anime community </garnt>
<connor> most people refer to it as like </connor>
<connor> the Anime and Manga community. </connor>
<connor> It's we kind of, we're kind of </connor>
<connor> we're kind of assumed </connor>
<joey> that we're just synonymous with each other, right? </joey>
<joey> But then there are times when I just kind of realized </joey>
<joey> that I have no idea what's going on </joey>
<joey> in the Manga world sometimes. </joey>
<joey> Like there's this recent airing Anime right now </joey>
<joey> called a Horimia. That- - The fuck is that? </joey>
<joey> - So good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - Ah, so good. </joey>
<joey> Exactly Mayline* just </joey>
<garnt> like Evangelic - [Mayeline] Favorite Manga </garnt>
<garnt> The Manga's favorite Manga </garnt>
<garnt> according to Mayeline. - The Manga is </garnt>
<garnt> fucking awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> When the anime is getting adapted. </garnt>
<connor> There was like so many </connor>
<connor> Manga readers that would just - They come out. </connor>
<connor> - They just come out, just come out and say, Oh my God, </connor>
<connor> this is my favorite Manga. </connor>
<garnt> I fucking love this Mongo. </garnt>
<garnt> And here I'm thinking where where's is this rock </garnt>
<garnt> that you're all living on? </garnt>
<connor> What is this rock? </connor>
<connor> - This is the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> I say six out of 10 </connor>
<connor> but I'm sure that they're like me. </connor>
<connor> They're like, I forget about it. </connor>
<garnt> But when the animation out announced </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, yo, yo, (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> that's my fucking favorite. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I love that one. </garnt>
<garnt> I read that ages ago. </garnt>
<connor> I loved that. </connor>
<garnt> - No, because the thing is, I had never heard of Horimia. </garnt>
<garnt> Before the anime got adopted this winter season, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [*] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, it must be a pretty, like </garnt>
<garnt> it must have like a cult following or something. </garnt>
<garnt> So search it up and- - Oh it has a cult following </garnt>
<garnt> all right. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And it is following it is the 13th </garnt>
<garnt> most popular Manga of all time on my anime list. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, how have I never </garnt>
<garnt> how have I never heard this name before? </garnt>
<garnt> Or how's no one discussed this in my presence before? </garnt>
<connor> I thought. - Reading bad. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, that's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I find so interesting about </garnt>
<joey> the Manga wall is that even if it's like universally praised </joey>
<joey> and credited as being this most amazing piece </joey>
<joey> of work right in the Mongo wall, </joey>
<joey> it's just really surprising how few people </joey>
<joey> in the Anime community actually know about it. </joey>
<joey> Like, I guaran-fucking-tee. </joey>
<garnt> Not many people know about like Oyasumi Punpun. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though I think it's like the second </garnt>
<garnt> or third highest rated Mongo on Val*. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like I feel like, I dunno some like sane in Manga. </garnt>
<garnt> You, you have like the sane* in big four. </garnt>
<garnt> I think you have like, Binland* saga </garnt>
<connor> - Always the fucking big numbers. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It is cause it's not quite the medium for it. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Why, why why always the big one? </garnt>
<garnt> - The small four! </garnt>
<garnt> - What happened to the top? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That, that describes things pretty well. </garnt>
<garnt> - We should rename it. </garnt>
<garnt> (mumbles) like the giga four or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gigic four. </garnt>
<garnt> - It might be, might be three. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember cause it's it's all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which ones are you referring to? </garnt>
<garnt> - You know the crowd that always talk about Vinland Saga. </garnt>
<garnt> It's either Vinland Saga, Berserk or a fucking </garnt>
<garnt> - Kamuy? </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck. Vagabond. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh Vagabond. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think there's one more. </garnt>
<garnt> That is in that genre that everyone keeps. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe Golden Kamuy? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, that's not Golden Kamuy, </garnt>
<garnt> but maybe it's just a big three. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe, maybe I'm just imagining things. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, I feel like a lot of sane in Manga gets talked </garnt>
<garnt> about as like these masterpieces, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> But some like slice of life, romance, manga </garnt>
<garnt> like Horimia that is apparently very popular. </garnt>
<garnt> Just don't get talked about in the same sphere and- </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I would argue that like even the big </garnt>
<garnt> the big three scene, and I guess we've coined it now </garnt>
<garnt> like *Bailey had told us about light. </garnt>
<garnt> It upsets me how few people know about like Vagabond. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I feel like a lot of people know about Vagabond. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know about Vagabond. - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) (mumbling) </joey>
<garnt> - Damn it. </garnt>
<joey> - I know it is a title that exists. </joey>
<connor> I know absolutely nothing about it. </connor>
<garnt> So vagabond essentially is a it's a samurai Mongo*. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I would, but it's done by the author </joey>
<connor> who did Slam Dunk. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that sounds cool. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So you know where somehow not only managed to make one </connor>
<joey> of the greatest sports Manga ever made </joey>
<joey> but also one of the greatest samurai Manger ever made. </joey>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Yeah. - Mm. </connor>
<connor> And it's fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How many chapters is it? </connor>
<garnt> - Still going? (sighs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's still ongoing but it's- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's on hiatus. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what it is about this. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, the, the brutal scene in Mongo </garnt>
<garnt> where they get up to like 200 or 300 chapters </garnt>
<garnt> and the author's like aight, I'm a head out. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll take a break. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I think at least the Manga I've read. </connor>
<connor> It feels like they build up like a really cool world. </connor>
<garnt> And again, they just like, it either gets too big </garnt>
<garnt> and they're just like, well I've gotta reign this in. </garnt>
<garnt> It just gets way too big </garnt>
<connor> and it ends with like so many fucking things not explored. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, cause cause like </garnt>
<connor> Going back to Hunter Hunter. </connor>
<garnt> Like it got up to a point where I'm just like, this is a </garnt>
<garnt> this is a comfortable place to end it. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> This is a comfortable place to like try it. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, no, it definitely could have ended it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then she introduces the dark continent </garnt>
<garnt> which without spoiling the exact </garnt>
<garnt> details of it is - Fuck outta here. No one's </garnt>
<connor> ever gonna see the end of it. </connor>
<garnt> - You have this, you have this world </garnt>
<garnt> that's a gushy buildup in Hunter Hunter. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like, how, how long was </garnt>
<garnt> like the run, whatever, the 148 episodes. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 148 episodes, right? - Jesus. </connor>
<connor> Right. And it ended to a point where you </connor>
<garnt> explored everything you needed to explore about the world. </garnt>
<garnt> And he went on hiatus and everyone was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh you know, HunterxHunter </garnt>
<garnt> must be coming to an end. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then he comes back and he's just like, J K by the way </garnt>
<garnt> this is just one fifth of the world. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's... (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I hate it when they do that, man, like don't </connor>
<joey> don't come here and pull it out of your ass. </joey>
<joey> It's like a fucking like parody iPhone presentation. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, but wait, there's more </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, wait, but no stop, stop. </garnt>
<joey> They shouldn't be as cool as the idea is </joey>
<joey> of like expanding the world. </joey>
<joey> It's honestly one of the things </joey>
<joey> That makes me roll my eyes, emotion. </joey>
<joey> I've been reading manga lately is when that like </joey>
<joey> but there's another continent or planet. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, Oh, for fuck's sake </joey>
<connor> There is not going to be another planet that is </connor>
<connor> going to be satisfied. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's, that's exactly how I felt when like, you know </garnt>
<connor> in like dragon ball, when they started expanding </connor>
<connor> on like multi-verse and shit I was like, bro </connor>
<connor> I thought like I thought like blowing up planets </connor>
<connor> and like taking over the universe was hard enough. </connor>
<connor> And now it's like, well, you know </connor>
<garnt> there's like seven more universes out there </garnt>
<garnt> that we can explore as well. </garnt>
<connor> It gets my chub like softer than hearing multi-verse </connor>
<connor> or like expanding the universe out of like. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the one thing I hate the most is how like </garnt>
<garnt> I don't mind them like introducing that kind of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> If they Actually follow through with it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. But the problem is they'll just drop it. </connor>
<joey> In like a chapter there'll be like, Oh, by the way </joey>
<joey> There's other worlds. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And it's like no there wasn't. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> There was never, you never made this mango </joey>
<connor> with other worlds in mind. </connor>
<connor> You liar, you're adding this now. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that is true. - Cause like okay back. </garnt>
<garnt> Sorry to bring it up again. </garnt>
<garnt> For like the ninth time. </garnt>
<garnt> But like what I was reading Claymore </garnt>
<garnt> they just casually mentioned that like there's </garnt>
<joey> two worlds having a wall and then it's like </joey>
<joey> Never brought up again and then it just ends. </joey>
<joey> And we never hear anything about the other world. </joey>
<joey> That's apparently having a war. </joey>
<joey> It's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. </joey>
<joey> So everyone gets to go alone happy. </joey>
<joey> But the whole reason why this world exist is </joey>
<joey> because there was a war and this is like a testing.* </joey>
<joey> It's really bullshit. </joey>
<joey> Like I don't, I don't like it when they do this. </joey>
<joey> Especially when the Manga is like, you know </joey>
<joey> it's been going on for a long time. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> and it already feels like it's stretching thin. </joey>
<joey> And then they're like nother world, baby. </joey>
<joey> It's like, no, no, </joey>
<joey> no, no, no. - True, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - Because I think you said if they build it up fine </joey>
<connor> but when they just drop it, I hate it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you sometimes see these plot points in Manga. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like dropped. </garnt>
<garnt> And for some reason you just never </garnt>
<garnt> never hear about it again, like aside from other worlds </garnt>
<connor> the biggest example I can think of is the Gantz Manga. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I love that one. </connor>
<connor> But I was so dumb. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Well I just like </connor>
<connor> remember when there were vampires in it </connor>
<joey> and that was a big plot point, - Oh yeah, there was </joey>
<joey> then they just disappeared. like the vampire gang. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Just never heard about it again. </connor>
<connor> - There's a lot of stuff in Gantz. </connor>
<connor> So if you haven't read Gantz, I guess you could. </connor>
<connor> It's very long. </connor>
<connor> It's written... </connor>
<joey> The artwork is fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> We spoke about it before, but yeah, randomly </joey>
<joey> halfway through, they introduced vampires </joey>
<joey> into a world that never had vampires </joey>
<connor> and then they just never come up again. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Not going to lie. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I barely remember any of it because I think </garnt>
<garnt> at that point I kind of just like erase the front. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, this is so dumb. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even want to like put it's a memory. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just kind of, I always offhand remember </garnt>
<connor> you know, sometimes you just get flashbacks. </connor>
<connor> - You wake up at night sweating. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God. There was vampires! - You wake up. </connor>
<joey> - You wake up and you just like whatever happened </joey>
<joey> to those vampires? (laughing) </joey>
<joey> where did they disappear to? </joey>
<joey> They were built up as like the big fucking villains </joey>
<connor> or something. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And then they just, they just went nowhere with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I guess that's the problem </garnt>
<garnt> of when you're like serializing a Mongo every week. </garnt>
<connor> I wonder how much of it like is actually planned before </connor>
<connor> and how much it just feels like it's falling apart. </connor>
<garnt> Which is why the The more manga I read, </garnt>
<garnt> the more I respect to something </garnt>
<garnt> like one piece, which can keep coherency this long. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> And, and it just continually </garnt>
<garnt> getting more and more epic, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - And just continually getting better and better. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean like that's also why I really value when </garnt>
<garnt> a Manga just has a good ending, not even a Mongo </garnt>
<garnt> but just any media in anime, Mongo or light novels </garnt>
<garnt> that just has an ending that people are satisfied with. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't ask for much </garnt>
<garnt> but I do ask for a satisfactory ending to a story. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just the more I've been reading Manga. </connor>
<garnt> My pet peeve is like where it just starts to fall apart </garnt>
<connor> like in the last 40 50 chapters that's been really </connor>
<connor> that's been happening a lot </connor>
<garnt> - Nothing ruins I feel like an experience of going through </garnt>
<joey> this entire long journey with these characters that you fall </joey>
<joey> in love within this world that is interesting </joey>
<joey> to come to limp dick ending. </joey>
<garnt> You know what I mean? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like there are like, I, I swear to God </garnt>
<garnt> I can count the amount of like satisfying endings </garnt>
<joey> on like my hands in, in that I've read in Mongo. </joey>
<joey> - [*] Right. </joey>
<joey> because there is like most of the manga </joey>
<joey> that I love are still ongoing, like classics, like Bezerk, </joey>
<joey> Vagabonds, Vinland Saga, for example. </joey>
<joey> And then there are other things like Slam Dunk. </joey>
<garnt> Where you just feel, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it just kind of, kind of just ended. </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It had its, you know what, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't say that that final chapter of slam Dunk </garnt>
<connor> - Don't spoil it for me. I want to read it. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. Well essentially like I'm not going to tell you </connor>
<connor> how the story goes </connor>
<connor> because it's a lot to unpack, but basically like slam dunk. </connor>
<garnt> I really liked the final chapter of slam dunk </garnt>
<garnt> because it was kind of like experimental almost </garnt>
<garnt> because almost. </garnt>
<garnt> - Another dimension, where the basketball slam dunk. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because really made that </garnt>
<garnt> like final chapter famous was the fact </garnt>
<connor> that almost the entirety </connor>
<connor> of the final chapter has no dialogue. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Oh, that's cool. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like it, like basically he was just like </connor>
<garnt> let me just show you the story rather </garnt>
<garnt> than telling you the story. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have the problem with the final chapter. </garnt>
<garnt> I just felt like without the wrap-up or I felt </garnt>
<garnt> like they could have gone further with the entire story. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like he just kind of ran </garnt>
<garnt> out of ideas and just kind of just ended it. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> But it's not that it wasn't a great final chapter. </garnt>
<joey> It was just that I, I wanted to spend more time </joey>
<garnt> with these characters and I felt like </garnt>
<joey> there could have been room to spend more time. </joey>
<garnt> - That was me with Hikaru No Go. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> If we're talking about, if we're talking </joey>
<garnt> about absolute cuckold endings, </garnt>
<garnt> like Hikaru No Go. - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hikaru No Go is a show. </garnt>
<connor> No, no, no, a go Manga. </connor>
<connor> It's a- - You know what a go is? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, a go. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, of course. - Like a black and white. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is when the ghost teaches him. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - The one where the ghost </garnt>
<connor> teaches him. - Doesn't end well? </connor>
<garnt> It (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It just ends. - Oh okay. </garnt>
<joey> - It just ends. </joey>
<joey> - Say no more. - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> It just ends in like a really controversial way. </joey>
<joey> - Ah, I see. - Where </joey>
<joey> people were kind of just like, wow, there must've been </joey>
<joey> some like strings behind the scenes that were kind </joey>
<joey> of just like, you're going to end it this way </joey>
<joey> whether you like it or not, because it's </joey>
<joey> very, very unsatisfactory. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - That's sad. </joey>
<garnt> - Nobody was happy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are there any good endings that you can think of, </garnt>
<garnt> off the top of your heads? Aside from Oyasumi Punpun.* </garnt>
<joey> Because I know you were about to mention Oyasumi Punpun. </joey>
<garnt> That's the first thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I think when I think </garnt>
<garnt> of the most genius ending, it's Oyasmi Punpun. </garnt>
<connor> - I haven't read like many Manga. </connor>
<joey> Compared to Jerry, but I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I'm happy enough if it just doesn't completely fuck itself. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I honestly, is that how it is that how it is to </garnt>
<garnt> be a Manga fan? </garnt>
<garnt> Like where you're just like, as long </garnt>
<garnt> as it doesn't completely fuck everything up, </garnt>
<connor> I'll be okay. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Even if it's like average. </connor>
<connor> I'm still satisfied with it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Because like I just recently finished watching </connor>
<connor> reading Beastars. </connor>
<connor> Just the last volume came out like a week ago. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Not the strongest ending in my opinion </joey>
<joey> but it wasn't a complete shit show of an ending. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I'm satisfied. </joey>
<joey> Like - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Could have been better </garnt>
<garnt> but it could have been a lot worse as well, so. </garnt>
<connor> - Is the ending of a Mongo that important? </connor>
<connor> Cue v* salsa music (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like if an ending of a manga or even </garnt>
<garnt> an anime is good, that can bring it up from like a, from </garnt>
<connor> like a decent show to like a master piece level. </connor>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, go on. Go on. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I mean the biggest example I can think of </connor>
<joey> is the clusterfuck that was code yellow season two. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. And yet somehow the like I will never forget it </joey>
<garnt> because of how great the ending was. </garnt>
<garnt> Same with something like Cowboy Bebop, for example, as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I think the ending matters more in anime </connor>
<garnt> than it does in Manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you think is the difference? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the way you - Length. </garnt>
<garnt> - Length the way that you experienced it. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember vastly the best bits were Manga more than I do. </garnt>
<joey> Like I said, I, when I look back on Manga, </joey>
<joey> I remember it it's like an amalgamation </joey>
<joey> of like the whole experience </joey>
<joey> as opposed to episodes and like scenes. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And also, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I just find that when I finish a Manga </joey>
<connor> I'd rarely ever think about the ending of any of them. </connor>
<connor> I just think about my favorite moments throughout the Manga. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? I'm the complete opposite. </garnt>
<connor> - I think about the ending. </connor>
<garnt> I think with manga, I think about like certain scenes </garnt>
<garnt> whereas with anime, I think about it kind of as a whole. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think maybe it's because I binge anime. </garnt>
<garnt> So I kind of experienced the anime all at once. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas with manga, a lot of it, because it's rather long </garnt>
<garnt> for me, a couple of episodes, </garnt>
<joey> - I binge both. So I guess ending's </joey>
<joey> always important to me. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Especially if I've felt like I've spent like a lot of time </joey>
<joey> with these characters, like, like it doesn't have to be a </joey>
<joey> it doesn't have to be like an amazing ending </joey>
<joey> but what I want is a satisfying ending. </joey>
<garnt> But if there's an ending that is actually amazing </garnt>
<garnt> and sticks with me, then I'll always remember that Mongo </garnt>
<connor> - This is true. </connor>
<garnt> Because I read all of Vinland Saga, which is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Up to the point where it was out like a few months ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And if I, if I never read it again </garnt>
<garnt> I'd probably be happy knowing that I had a good story </garnt>
<garnt> up to where it, or up to where I got to, which sounds weird </garnt>
<garnt> because it literally was in the middle of like a fight. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, you know what? </joey>
<garnt> I've read a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> I've read so much of this. </garnt>
<joey> That I'm actually satisfied </joey>
<joey> if I just stop reading this manga, I'll be okay. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Like I'm fine. </connor>
<connor> - But I guess that's where the double-edged sword in right? </connor>
<connor> Is that the longer the mung, it goes for the more </connor>
<connor> greater of an ending you expect. </connor>
<garnt> - Almost, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> or sometimes you just, cause sometimes you are </garnt>
<connor> you've read a manga for so long that you kind </connor>
<connor> of just want it to end. </connor>
<connor> You can (mumbles) - I get it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You kind of just, cause that was me with Narato. </connor>
<connor> That was me with Bleach, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Where they, they got to a point when I was just like </connor>
<joey> I am reading this purely because I've invested so much time </joey>
<joey> and it it's it's, it's the league problem right? </joey>
<joey> You're just like, I've invested so much time in this </joey>
<garnt> that I just need to, I just need to play it out. </garnt>
<garnt> - What would you say is the cap then? </garnt>
<connor> Know? You just know it's like a feeling, right? </connor>
<connor> Like when I was reading Eyeshield, </connor>
<connor> I like when it goes to like chapter, like 250 </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, all right, let's wrap it up. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But it had like another a hundred left. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like this felt like it went on long enough. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it felt like they were adding too many things like </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of Manga had that where like </garnt>
<joey> what was once a gigantic threat earlier on </joey>
<joey> even though they haven't changed much </joey>
<joey> in power will suddenly be like, they dispatch it. </joey>
<joey> And like once one hit, - Right. </joey>
<joey> There's so many stuff like that where it's like </joey>
<joey> so this really cool enemy you introduce </joey>
<joey> you start just one shotting later on. </joey>
<joey> It's like, what's the point of this? </joey>
<joey> Like you're just completely ruining all the steaks over </joey>
<joey> and over again. </joey>
<joey> I hate it. </joey>
<joey> Well, so some reason, man, some fucking action scenes </joey>
<connor> are like nigh on impossible to figure out </connor>
<connor> what the fuck is going on in manga. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm, I'm, I'm looking (laughing) </connor>
<connor> at these panels and the shit going on. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I would need to like get out my fucking pen </connor>
<connor> and draw along to like try </connor>
<connor> and figure out what the actual cartography is. </connor>
<garnt> - Like a bird's eye view and you showing me like layout </garnt>
<garnt> of what's happening. - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> - I would have more chance having </garnt>
<garnt> like a battlefield view </garnt>
<connor> and you showing me like little fucking statues moving. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So fans trying to figure out* </garnt>
<garnt> - Before the anime, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was literally me </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, what's going on? </garnt>
<garnt> At manga? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I will sit there for a good, like 30 </garnt>
<connor> seconds staring at this. </connor>
<connor> Like yeah, I have no fucking idea. </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem I have with like Jojolion. </connor>
<connor> Cause I was I'm reading it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like these stand pals, like getting so fucking weird </connor>
<garnt> that I'm looking at something and I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> I guess the stand is doing its power </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't know what the fuck? </garnt>
<connor> - What are you doing? </connor>
<connor> Because then an action Manga. </connor>
<connor> I started like not really care about. </connor>
<connor> Cause half the time you can barely </connor>
<garnt> tell what's actually happening. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're just like putting the dots. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> There's something about watching the fight unfold and </garnt>
<garnt> like the way it was meant to in like a time way </garnt>
<connor> with music and noise was so much more satisfying. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno. </connor>
<connor> Cause I feel like that is the problem </connor>
<garnt> with a lot of anime fights period, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that they don't actually feel like flights. </garnt>
<garnt> They feel like just </garnt>
<garnt> they feel like impacts intermittently with, with dialogue. </garnt>
<garnt> In between. - Basically. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> Cause like no one know it, you see some anime flights </joey>
<joey> and you think no one actually fights like this. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> No one throws </garnt>
<garnt> A punch, says a sentence then throws a punch back. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> That, that doesn't know how fights work. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally every Bucky fight. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - What's a fight without a dialogue? Come on gone.* </connor>
<garnt> - Because it's like, that's why for example </garnt>
<garnt> the fights in God of high school really stood out </garnt>
<garnt> to me cause they actually felt like a martial arts fight. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Let's say what you want about the story or the whatever </garnt>
<garnt> but the way the fights were directed and frames </garnt>
<garnt> and just choreographed, they felt like actual fights. </garnt>
<garnt> - It felt like it felt like a Jackie Chan fight, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm cause that's what, that's what immediately stood </garnt>
<garnt> out to me about that direction. </garnt>
<garnt> And that animation was that, you know, sometimes you get </garnt>
<garnt> like the narrative episode where you have like </garnt>
<garnt> you have like the basic normal narrative fights. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you have like this one episode that is just </garnt>
<connor> like this, the studio putting all their budget and their </connor>
<connor> a team on one fucking fight. </connor>
<connor> And then that you </connor>
<connor> that that is the fight that people will remember. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> But most anime fights are just, I mean </connor>
<connor> they are literally just animated manga panels </connor>
<connor> and you can't tell what's going on </connor>
<connor> in a manga panel with action most of the time. </connor>
<joey> So that's really what sets the good fights </joey>
<garnt> from the bad fights. </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes you need that dialogue, right? </connor>
<connor> To help build it up. </connor>
<garnt> It's like a, it's like a good poem, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes you need the story to make the worthwhile. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<connor> - I think there's like a limit to how </connor>
<connor> much dialogue, like, you know, that's one thing I </connor>
<connor> didn't like about like a lot of Narato fights is the fact </connor>
<connor> that it's like, I don't need a fucking flashback </connor>
<connor> in the middle of a punch. </connor>
<garnt> I don't need that. (mumbles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I like it when they're like </garnt>
<garnt> internalizing their thoughts on the battle. </garnt>
<joey> That's more interesting to me than fucking </joey>
<garnt> Like, ah, you're strong. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, well obviously that's why </garnt>
<connor> You're fucking fighting each other. </connor>
<garnt> My least favorite, like anime fight trope is like the </garnt>
<garnt> the guy in the sidelines explaining everything </garnt>
<garnt> while it's happening. </garnt>
<garnt> - To be fair, that that's either hit or miss. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause the only like one of the only </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah like, like it's, it's </garnt>
<garnt> either Speedwagon or it's shit basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's like </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how this person is able to like </garnt>
<garnt> explain every fucking like physics movement </garnt>
<garnt> as this guy's doing fucking a one-inch punch. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, it's like, what is the timeframe? </garnt>
<garnt> How is that happening? </garnt>
<garnt> - And then there's like, Bucky, which just like you </garnt>
<garnt> you have an e-sports commentator just </garnt>
<connor> like explaining every detail </connor>
<connor> and technique and the fucking backstory. </connor>
<garnt> - I love that. That's fucking great. I love it. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the thing like. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> if it's like Jojo, Bucky, where it's, it's </joey>
<connor> it's gone to the point where it's so unrealistic </connor>
<connor> that it just becomes ridiculous. </connor>
<joey> I like that. </joey>
<joey> I hate it when they try </joey>
<joey> and make it as if it's happening in real time. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, don't kid yourself guys. </joey>
<joey> Like, isn't it. </joey>
<joey> Like you'd have to be like rap God </joey>
<garnt> in order to like commentate over it. </garnt>
<garnt> That fucking quickly as it's happening. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, sometimes you just hear a piece of dialogue </garnt>
<garnt> in the time it takes us for like one punch to get thrown. </garnt>
<garnt> A punch is just like a millisecond. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. And they have this five minute dialogue in the middle </garnt>
<garnt> of their head in between this punch getting thrown in just </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a multi page like (mumbles)* right? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, where's the punch? </garnt>
<connor> - Where's the impact? </connor>
<connor> (mumbles) </connor>
<garnt> - No I'm just like, is time dilation just a thing </garnt>
<garnt> when anime characters get punched or something? </garnt>
<garnt> Like Einstein's rolling in his grave right now when </garnt>
<garnt> when whenever a punch gets thrown man. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. And also how many fucking Manga are there </connor>
<connor> where like someone gets stabbed </connor>
<connor> and then like the like </connor>
<connor> but you fell in my trap and it's like, how many </connor>
<connor> how many times have you practiced this? </connor>
<garnt> Where you just been like stabbed or punched? </garnt>
<garnt> And this was like part of your plan. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, this is just like too, it happens so often. </garnt>
<garnt> Or like sometimes they'll get </garnt>
<connor> like a fatal wound and they'll immediately like heal it. </connor>
<garnt> And it's like what? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. But then again, right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, that kind of goes back into the whole thing </garnt>
<joey> of like how ridiculous it is as well. </joey>
<joey> Right? Like, Bucky does that so fucking often </joey>
<joey> where it's like, you should be dead </joey>
<joey> after one punch, but you've somehow managed to survive </joey>
<garnt> like 10 punches, a stab wound and like three gunshots. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're still able to like form a dialogue. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I feel like Bucky is just like one side </garnt>
<joey> of the extreme where it's so extreme that you can't </joey>
<joey> take it seriously anymore. </joey>
<joey> I mean a lot of anime flights on that. </joey>
<joey> I like anime trips, like anime </joey>
<joey> is just normalized getting punched and coughing up blood. </joey>
<joey> Whereas in real life, you're internally hemorrhaging and </joey>
<joey> (laughing) (panting) </joey>
<connor> You're probably gonna die. </connor>
<garnt> If you internally hemorrhage, let's be honest. </garnt>
<connor> - If you cough of blood, bro. - You're dead. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> - If you smash your head through a concrete wall </connor>
<garnt> which is apparently normal in anime </garnt>
<garnt> then you've got a fucking concussion, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or, or just a splattered head. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> No head probably. - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I want a realistic </garnt>
<connor> like toe stubbing scene in anime </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) That's what I want. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I want to experience. </garnt>
<connor> - What about? I mean, niche-y Joe* could have done it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Probably. </connor>
<garnt> - Toe stubbing is like the closest I get </garnt>
<garnt> to a real life anime scene. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - I want someone to just animate </connor>
<connor> someone's stubbing their toe. </connor>
<connor> And that it's just like immediately </connor>
<connor> like a Jojo sight, like cough up blood </connor>
<garnt> (groaning) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure like Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, boy </garnt>
<garnt> probably did something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno what it is about stubbing your toe. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you stop your toe. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's one of the few injuries you get where you do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, the pain is coming. </garnt>
<garnt> But for some reason there is a pain delay </garnt>
<garnt> between you'd stubbing, your toe and the immense pain. </garnt>
<garnt> You're about to feel like if there was time </garnt>
<garnt> for a real life, anime flashback, </garnt>
<garnt> it's in that delay. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's in that pain delay map*. </connor>
<connor> - Now, if you were an anime character, you would realize </connor>
<joey> that you can synchronize your energy to counter the </joey>
<joey> blow incoming. That's... </joey>
<garnt> Come on. </garnt>
<connor> - You can stop the nervous system </connor>
<joey> from delivering it to your brain. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. That's that's the closest you get </garnt>
<garnt> to a fucking anime injury or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - I wonder do you guys want to talk </connor>
<connor> about Attack on Titan? </connor>
<connor> Because Twitter's funny right now, Twitter is funny. </connor>
<garnt> I mean what is there to talk about? Like. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't realize </connor>
<connor> How much for the clown Fiesta Twitter is </connor>
<connor> about Attack on Titan. </connor>
<connor> How are, how is, how have people </connor>
<connor> turned this into a thing to like dislike? </connor>
<connor> I don't understand like- </connor>
<garnt> - Like I knew there was something wrong </garnt>
<connor> When I woke up in the morning and went on to Twitter. </connor>
<joey> Hashtag thank you Mapa was trending. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, what the fuck are these clowns doing now? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like every time, every time Attack on Titan airs, </garnt>
<garnt> and you go on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> and something about tack on Titan is trending. </garnt>
<connor> - And the time of recording is episode six came out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And basically the most recent thing that happened </garnt>
<garnt> was what was it? </garnt>
<garnt> People, people </garnt>
<garnt> on Twitter were just attacking the staff members. </garnt>
<connor> They were- - Why? What's wrong with them? </connor>
<garnt> - I think what I've read was some people were just </garnt>
<garnt> harassing the director for one </garnt>
<garnt> of the music choices that was </garnt>
<garnt> that was made in one of the big scenes. </garnt>
<garnt> And it got so bad that he had to deactivate his Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> - He did? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And a bunch of animators as well are getting harassed. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm literally watching this thing. </connor>
<connor> Like, this is amazing. </connor>
<connor> Why are people getting angry? </connor>
<connor> Like, is there like what was wrong with the song? </connor>
<garnt> - Like I can't (sighs) </garnt>
<connor> Who the fuck the knows? </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe it's like, I'm losing words </garnt>
<garnt> because it's so fucking dumb. - Stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm the- You can't do that. </garnt>
<connor> You don't deserve anime. </connor>
<connor> I'm just saying right now, like you just </connor>
<connor> you just don't deserve that. - You ain't a real anime fan, </connor>
<garnt> You're not a real anime fan if you do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What blows my mind is that like </garnt>
<connor> at the end of the day, a lot of these people, right? </connor>
<garnt> We're just, we're just anime fans. </garnt>
<garnt> Why on earth? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you think you have the right to that? </garnt>
<garnt> Just go to like the director level. </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking hate that. </garnt>
<garnt> - The fucking audacity. - How dare you. </garnt>
<connor> - You try and make an anime. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And see how you, if you can make a good light </connor>
<connor> I want to do is like, I just want to like kind of </connor>
<connor> cause I think one </connor>
<garnt> of the things I saw yesterday was people were complaining </garnt>
<garnt> about one of the Titans being like really bad CGI </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I'm watching this thing, right? </connor>
<garnt> And the CGI is honestly like barely noticeable. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really like, not even remotely, like </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I just want to like go off </connor>
<garnt> to all those people complaining about the CGI </garnt>
<garnt> and like link them to any scene from like Bizarre 2016. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Like this is one, the same people who've will </connor>
<garnt> The clip. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. And then run it </garnt>
<garnt> through Sony Vegas, call it 4k. </garnt>
<garnt> And re-upload it. </garnt>
<garnt> And be like, this is a 4k fight scene guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's my least favorite thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's it's absolutely absurd. </garnt>
<connor> - 60 fps, 4K fight scene. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Which is like (mumbles) - Let's go baby. </garnt>
<garnt> - The descriptions like I fixed this fight. </garnt>
<connor> I made it better. </connor>
<garnt> - Dumbest fucking thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I was </garnt>
<garnt> cause I tweeted out saying like, </garnt>
<garnt> Attack on Titan B will be carrying on in 2021. </garnt>
<joey> Obviously not being a hundred percent serious about that. </joey>
<joey> I'm not, I'm not literally sitting there being like my 2021 </joey>
<joey> would be ruined if Attack on Titan wasn't airing. </joey>
<joey> Like there's some, my God. </joey>
<connor> The arguments that arose in those comments. </connor>
<joey> - I made like an Attack on Titan tweet immediately muted it. </joey>
<joey> I was just like, I've done this enough times before to know </joey>
<joey> that saying anything about tackling Titan, whether positive </joey>
<garnt> or negative, you just set up, you just set up a minefield. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, I, you know, I tweeted it. </connor>
<garnt> I came back four hours later and then, you know </garnt>
<garnt> as I'm, you know, cause you refresh your Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> you see the most recent reply. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was something </garnt>
<garnt> about like Japanese whaling laws that they were arguing </garnt>
<joey> about. And then I clicked on it. </joey>
<joey> - Excuse me. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I click on this thing and it goes up like </garnt>
<garnt> 50 replies back and forth. </garnt>
<garnt> These two people going at it because one of them said that </garnt>
<garnt> like Ray zero season two was going to be better. </garnt>
<garnt> And they somehow devolved into like an attack on Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, what the fuck is happening? </garnt>
<joey> - Do these people have like anything else to do? </joey>
<joey> - I just, I just don't understand how people can be angry </joey>
<joey> about like a great thing. </joey>
<joey> Like even if they're CGI in it, that is barely noticeable. </joey>
<joey> What's wrong, it's getting adapted and it looks good. </joey>
<garnt> We're getting what we want. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I do understand why people are being so pathetic. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like this is coming from </connor>
<connor> the perspective of a lot of </connor>
<garnt> let's say more like entitled manga readers, right? </garnt>
<connor> Cause you can be disappointed </connor>
<connor> in some ways of an anime adaptation, because there, there </connor>
<connor> there are some times when you read a manga </connor>
<connor> and you have an imagination </connor>
<connor> about how this Mongo is going to play out </connor>
<connor> if it was animated and with something </connor>
<connor> like attack on Titan where the bar </connor>
<connor> by studio wits was set so fucking high, right? </connor>
<connor> That you go to mapper </connor>
<connor> which I still think mapper is doing a fucking fantastic job. </connor>
<connor> We've had bangers. </connor>
<connor> - We've had fucking bangers. </connor>
<connor> And what I will say is like </connor>
<connor> it's like the tiniest of nitpicks, right. </connor>
<joey> Where I would say that it's gone from like a 10 out of 10 </joey>
<joey> adaptation to like a nine out of 10 adaptation. </joey>
<joey> And that, that that's, that's, that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's, it's, it's a very slight step down from where it </joey>
<garnt> it's not bad by any step. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just a very slight step down. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the people taking that as </garnt>
<garnt> if it went from like a 10 to a one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, Exactly, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing is it's a nine hour 10 adaptation </garnt>
<garnt> for 10 out of 10 material. </garnt>
<garnt> You're still getting a fucking banger. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't fucking get it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not seven deadly sins, season three. </garnt>
<garnt> So I don't, I really do not understand the problem here. </garnt>
<joey> And like, you know </joey>
<joey> these are the people who were getting this nitpicky </joey>
<joey> on Twitter and those manga readers are just </joey>
<joey> the exact same kind of people who are just like </joey>
<joey> when their kids born, if that kid fucks up anything </joey>
<joey> they're like, well, it's ruined. </joey>
<joey> It's fucked. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I, you know, my expectations were fucked. </joey>
<garnt> It's ruined, what can I say? </garnt>
<connor> - What I- - Well, they just like </connor>
<garnt> this isn't like what was in the bottle. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're basing it off their own life. </garnt>
<connor> If, if the child fucks up, they're like, well fuck it didn't </connor>
<garnt> stick to the (mumbles) - Looking at the ultrasound, </garnt>
<connor> they're seen the baby born. </connor>
<garnt> It's like, well, that's, that's not, that's not </garnt>
<garnt> a good adaptation, is it? (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - So, you're saying to me it's not gonna be six foot. </connor>
<garnt> Honestly. Just put it back in - This isn't exactly the same. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the go go completely on a tangent. </joey>
<joey> That's all I completely feel about gender reveal parties. </joey>
<joey> I don't, I don't understand the point of gender reveal. </joey>
<garnt> - I've seen so many fucking </garnt>
<garnt> like absurd gender robot, gender reveal </garnt>
<joey> party clips on like tick-tok and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> where I'm just like, this is just hilarious now. </joey>
<joey> Did you see the one where it's like, fuck what was it? </joey>
<garnt> It was like, there was like a, a balloon </garnt>
<garnt> like a giant fucking balloon. </garnt>
<connor> You know like, you know, maybe like six- </connor>
<connor> - This is the weirdest fucking tangent we've ever done. </connor>
<garnt> - No, because what I was, what I was thinking was like. </garnt>
<garnt> - You took too long. - Yeah, oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, was just gonna say, like, there's just like a giant </garnt>
<garnt> like six, seven foot balloon that this guy carries. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's just like, all right, I'm going to pop it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just explodes into this like colored </garnt>
<garnt> like powder that just completely fills up the backyard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause what I'm thinking right. </garnt>
<garnt> Is okay. </garnt>
<garnt> The point of gender reveal party is to reveal </garnt>
<garnt> the gender of the baby, right? - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And celebrate that. </garnt>
<garnt> But like at which point do do, does like agenda get revealed </garnt>
<garnt> and the father is just like, Oh, it's, it's a girl. </garnt>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, Karen, Karen, go get the current hanger. </garnt>
<garnt> We're doing it again. </garnt>
<garnt> Like what, what kind of, what kind </garnt>
<garnt> of reaction do you expect the father and the mother to have? </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? - It's like what human? </garnt>
<garnt> Most normal people will be like, whether it's a guy </garnt>
<garnt> or a girl do reaction's going to be the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're gonna have a kid. </garnt>
<connor> - I just think that we celebrate too many things. </connor>
<connor> I think we have enough things to celebrate. </connor>
<garnt> How hard is it to just say, it's a boy. </garnt>
<connor> How hard is it? </connor>
<joey> - Is like having the kids birthday like not enough? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Like I think to me, I legitimately don't understand </garnt>
<garnt> like we have so many things to celebrate. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucking exhausting. Who is planning all this shit? </garnt>
<joey> Like who has this much free time? </joey>
<joey> Honestly, I barely can like get Christmas plans together. </joey>
<joey> Like my own birthday. Who has this? </joey>
<garnt> Is it the woman she's pregnant? </garnt>
<garnt> Shouldn't you be focused on that? </garnt>
<connor> Like I don't. I don't get it. </connor>
<garnt> - I wonder if there's like self fulfilling prophecy </garnt>
<garnt> of why some people working in retail in America </garnt>
<garnt> when a person comes in and being like </garnt>
<garnt> give me all of your blue dye. </garnt>
<garnt> I need as much blue dye as possible. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, oh fuck. One of these all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, back to Attack on Titan. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was such a weird transition. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a weird tangent. </garnt>
<garnt> Bottom line, stop complaining about Attack on Titan. </garnt>
<connor> It's good. It's fine </connor>
<connor> - I just felt like, I just feel like it's like </connor>
<connor> cause you know, I think it's a of edge edge </connor>
<connor> of people out there who are just like, I don't want to admit </connor>
<connor> that Attack on Titan is the best thing right now. </connor>
<garnt> I don't want to give it more clout than it deserves. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, you see these fucking God awful takes </garnt>
<garnt> on Twitter being like, yeah, it was boring. </garnt>
<garnt> Dropped it right away. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, who cares? </garnt>
<garnt> Just let the people who are enjoying it. </garnt>
<garnt> Fucking enjoy it. - Well. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's good. - Yeah. It's like- </garnt>
<connor> - Stop shitting on it. That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you can have you can have </connor>
<connor> an opinion about it, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like if you think it's shit, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't fucking harass the animators over it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. It's same thing with like </connor>
<connor> when Game of Thrones is like around. </connor>
<connor> People like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> people just want to be that person who's like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like game of Thrones. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Whatever, it sucked. - Cool. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh you happy about it? Fuck. That's lame bro. </joey>
<joey> I'm not excited about it. </joey>
<joey> I'm not excited about anything. </joey>
<joey> Bro, except my gender reveal, </joey>
<joey> party. - Fuck the system. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Everything I get excited for is my baby's gender like that. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> Like I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. For some reason, you know, I mean it does happen </garnt>
<garnt> in other genres as well, but for some reason </garnt>
<connor> who are these I don't even know the fucking @s </connor>
<connor> of these creators that Tweet. </connor>
<connor> How are they finding this shit? </connor>
<connor> Why, why are they finding this shit? </connor>
<connor> Just to fucking @ them and tell them that it's shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. As if like one of the animes is going to be like, </garnt>
<connor> Oh, thanks for your feedback. </connor>
<connor> We'll change it immediately. </connor>
<garnt> They go to the annual meeting like yo guys, you see him? </garnt>
<garnt> These people don't like it. </garnt>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. So like MiCasa276 on Twitter said that we should </joey>
<joey> we should just completely change the episode. </joey>
<garnt> It just changed studios. </garnt>
<garnt> Like what director's going to be like RFM. </garnt>
<garnt> I've got you. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it kind of sucks that, you know </garnt>
<garnt> in the time where the Japanese industry </garnt>
<connor> and the Japanese staff members are starting to, you know </connor>
<connor> we want them to open up to </connor>
<connor> to open up more to the international community. </connor>
<garnt> This is the they have to deal </garnt>
<garnt> with for some of like the biggest profile adaptation. </garnt>
<garnt> - I kinda want to just go there and be like, don't open up. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's not worth it. Don't open up. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't go to Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> I do think You know, there's a good amount of the people who </garnt>
<garnt> are probably sending hate, </garnt>
<garnt> who probably don't want it to open up. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause to them, I think it's, you know, it's the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> with like the idol and like kind of almost </garnt>
<garnt> like the whole life fan base a little bit where </garnt>
<garnt> they're like </garnt>
<garnt> we don't want all our people to interact outside, ruin them. </garnt>
<garnt> - We don't want the normies coming in </garnt>
<garnt> - We don't want, we don't. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We don't want like the American corporations </garnt>
<garnt> getting their fingers in our Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> like anime, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of people who are like that, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - As if they're Japanese, themselves. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, they bought at the time </garnt>
<garnt> it does come from a place of </garnt>
<garnt> - non Japanese. - Yeah, non Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> - We like all- I get it if they were </connor>
<connor> Japanese, but most, if not, all of </connor>
<connor> It's like in your video, when you did the </connor>
<connor> the anime studio tour and like the guy who was the director </connor>
<connor> of the studio, it was like, Oh we have foreign fans? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I like genuinely. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. So the CEO of CloverWorks genuinely didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> that they had fans. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, a lot of people don't know that </garnt>
<joey> - Can you blame them if he goes on 20 (mumbles) </joey>
<joey> Give him time to kill himself. What? </joey>
<joey> I would be like, no, they don't exist. Don't. </joey>
<garnt> - No. They don't honestly </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly like, </garnt>
<garnt> It's embarrassing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just saying you do to make you feel better. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I suppose if you think about it, </connor>
<connor> it's the same wave. </connor>
<garnt> It's the same mentality of like, for example </garnt>
<garnt> if we find out that Trash Taste has </garnt>
<garnt> or something had Japanese fans, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, Oh, there's people in Japan who watch us. </garnt>
<garnt> We have Russian fans? </garnt>
<garnt> - We have a Russian dump what's going on here? </garnt>
<connor> - I get emails every week. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you guys know you have like a Russian doll. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. We get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you say that Attack on Titan is carrying your 2021 </garnt>
<connor> - So far. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Dude, every episode I'm getting fucking hyped for. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, she just, you know, be appreciative </garnt>
<garnt> of the fact that we're even getting Attack on Titan. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? Like in the midst of a pandemic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean, the fact is </garnt>
<garnt> that Attack on Titan it's it could be carrying any year </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't think that anything can live up </garnt>
<connor> to what Attack on Titan season four is giving us right now. </connor>
<connor> And I say this in the midst of what I would- </connor>
<connor> - One of the strongest seasons we've ever had. </connor>
<connor> - I would argue that this is the front. </connor>
<connor> This is a contender for one </connor>
<joey> of the strongest seasons in the history of anime. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And that is a big statement. </joey>
<joey> But like it's so stacked </joey>
<joey> in every single genre and every single kind </joey>
<garnt> of every single category you can think of that. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't think of a single person who can't find at least two </garnt>
<garnt> or three shows that there'll be watching this season. </garnt>
<garnt> And then on top of that, you have the classic being made. </garnt>
<garnt> That is Attack on Titan. </garnt>
<connor> - Why would you, I, you know </connor>
<connor> if I was an anime studio and I found out when </connor>
<garnt> Attack on Titan airing, I'd be like, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> Just fucking hold on. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Don't don't let's wait like on YouTube, you know </garnt>
<garnt> if you upload a video </garnt>
<garnt> when like Shane Dawson dropped a documentary. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, just don't. </garnt>
<garnt> Just don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like movie companies being like, wait </garnt>
<connor> Avengers in cinemas right now, </connor>
<garnt> pull back pull back, pull back. </garnt>
<garnt> Never release at the same time as Avengers, </garnt>
<garnt> cause like, no one's going to watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like almost I would have been like </garnt>
<joey> just hold off because the Attack on Titan going to carry </joey>
<joey> like even if I only get to watch it once a week </joey>
<garnt> it's going to be in my mind the whole week. </garnt>
<garnt> So like just hold off and give me a banger of next season. </garnt>
<connor> But now they, all, everyone was like </connor>
<connor> let's all come out right now. </connor>
<connor> Let's let's all have all our bangers right now </connor>
<joey> In this one season. </joey>
<joey> Cause like the amount of like </joey>
<joey> we we've had a few seasons previously </joey>
<joey> with some season twos here and there </joey>
<garnt> but it seems like every season two </garnt>
<garnt> or like sequel the season is a fucking banger. </garnt>
<connor> - Because like Beastars is airing right now. </connor>
<garnt> Right. Okay. So - I do not know any </garnt>
<garnt> - No one is talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause Attack on Titan - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> is the only thing that anyone gives a shit about. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. So we got Beastars two. </connor>
<connor> Which is gotta be amazing. </connor>
<connor> We've got Promise Neverland. We've got Promise Neverland. </connor>
<connor> - Which no one is talking about. </connor>
<garnt> - No one's talking about </garnt>
<joey> - Remember when promise Netherland came out, it was massive. </joey>
<connor> it was the only one spoke about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<joey> - We got Lock Horizon three, Quints two. </joey>
<garnt> Quintessential Quintuplets two. </garnt>
<garnt> We got Dr. Stone two </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I sleep. </garnt>
<joey> - I sleep Attack on Titan season two. </joey>
<joey> I awoke. - Awoke. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Basically. </joey>
<joey> I mean like it's how can you not man? </joey>
<joey> Like every episode is just like a fucking roller coaster. </joey>
<garnt> And like for a lot </garnt>
<connor> of people we can on this for like five plus years. </connor>
<connor> This journey, right? </connor>
<garnt> - It's it's and it's, and it's one </garnt>
<connor> of the few ones where it feels </connor>
<connor> like it's run its natural course </connor>
<connor> actually it's actually coming to an end. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And I said in a tweet that I feel </joey>
<joey> like this is like watching a classic being made. </joey>
<joey> And I have no doubts that if like, even </joey>
<garnt> if he doesn't like completely slammed dunk the ending, even </garnt>
<garnt> if it's just an okay satisfying ending, </garnt>
<garnt> it's going to go down. </garnt>
<garnt> - As long as it's not like </garnt>
<connor> the crummiest fucking ending imaginable. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Which I- </connor>
<connor> - Wait for it. Multi-verse predicted multi-verse. </connor>
<garnt> - I would like to think not going to happen. </garnt>
<garnt> - I completely forgot Re Zero two is airing this season. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Again, you just can't compete. </joey>
<joey> - No one's talking about it. - No one's talking </joey>
<joey> about anything. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like </joey>
<joey> there's so many bangers to season </joey>
<garnt> and like Attack on Titan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just taking over. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I'm sure. Because I remember </connor>
<connor> I was watching the last season </connor>
<connor> of Breaking Bad as it was airing, week by week. </connor>
<joey> I'm sure I watched other TV shows during that time. </joey>
<joey> I cannot tell you what I've watched other than </joey>
<joey> than fucking Breaking Bad. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true true. </joey>
<joey> - Like it was like the highlight, right? </joey>
<joey> Like it's what it takes up your </joey>
<joey> your space and your hype for like or for what's going to </joey>
<joey> it's going to be 26 episodes, Attack on Titan right? </joey>
<connor> - No, it's going to be 14. </connor>
<connor> - It's 14? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. So right now, from what I've heard, like </connor>
<connor> this is me going off of whatever- </connor>
<connor> - Speculation warning. </connor>
<connor> - Manga, manga readers. </connor>
<connor> So it's going to be 14 episodes, I think 14 or 15 </connor>
<connor> which doesn't take it up to the end of the Manga. </connor>
<connor> Cause the end of the manga ends in April </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm poor... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I heard that. </connor>
<joey> - April or May. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember, but it's confirmed </joey>
<garnt> that the Manga is going to be ending this late spring </garnt>
<garnt> summer kind of time. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought they were trying to do like a duel ending, </connor>
<connor> where it was going to be. </connor>
<garnt> They both were like ending it the same itme. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like an anime originally. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. - No. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it was gonna, he was probably gonna </garnt>
<connor> I thought he meant maybe he was gonna </connor>
<connor> like tell them the studio, the end date. </connor>
<garnt> - No. So what's so with the confirmed </garnt>
<garnt> amount of episodes, that's out so far </garnt>
<garnt> what people are thinking is going to happen is </garnt>
<garnt> either we're going to get a season four part two. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or we are going to get a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would I'm speculating it's going to be a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think a movie is (groaning) </garnt>
<garnt> going to be more likely. - I mean look </garnt>
<garnt> how fucking successful Demon Slayer was. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know. I know. </garnt>
<connor> - They get to see that. - I don't wanna movie! </connor>
<connor> And they probably saw then was like, </connor>
<connor> we can do that with the last Attack on Titan thing. </connor>
<garnt> Just saying. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly. Like if- </garnt>
<connor> - I'm gonna have to speed run the Hong go real quick. </connor>
<garnt> Fuck (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm going (mumbles) </garnt>
<connor> - Like Joey was saying </connor>
<garnt> - There's a fucking type it out. </garnt>
<connor> - Please live translate for me. </connor>
<garnt> Come on. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll hire a professional light. </garnt>
<garnt> You know the ones that the governments </garnt>
<connor> when they go to the meetings </connor>
<connor> I'll hire them to get in the seat behind me in the theater. </connor>
<garnt> Just whispering in my ear. </garnt>
<garnt> - All I get to say is like personal reasons. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish I hope it's going to be a movie just </garnt>
<connor> so I can be the first one to make a video on it. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) (yelling) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm going to go to the midnight screening. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm going to make a video </garnt>
<connor> and be like, yeah guys, it was epic. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Where- - I would not do that. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm kidding. I'm joking. </connor>
<joey> - I wouldn't, I would not ruin possibly one </joey>
<joey> of the greatest animes to go down </joey>
<garnt> in history just for YouTube click. </garnt>
<connor> But I'd be like, Hey guys, I think I know what happened. </connor>
<connor> I watched it all three times. </connor>
<connor> I think I got the gist </connor>
<garnt> of what's going on with Made in Abyss. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah we watched it together. </connor>
<connor> - What the is this movie called? Dawn in- </connor>
<connor> - Okay. We watched the Made in Abyss movie. </connor>

<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty happy. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure I got it. </connor>
<garnt> - I got the gist. </garnt>
<connor> - Was like plot, plot, questionable child, Paul plot. </connor>
<connor> And then (mumbles) (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And I was just like, Oh Kevin, you did, you did a good job </garnt>
<garnt> Cause Kevin was sitting right next to us. </garnt>
<connor> - Damn, this song is good, man. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like go into hall. </garnt>
<garnt> Questionable child hall. Music, good. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Basically, but yeah like everyone </joey>
<joey> The Made in Abyss movie was amazing </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like had a good, I still haven't seen it. </garnt>
<garnt> Honestly. It's fine. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm not going to take your word for it. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - As a man who understood half of what was being said, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) it was fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - This episode of Trash Taste is sponsored by G fuel. </garnt>

<garnt> airing the season though? </garnt>
<garnt> - Masterpiece? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, and Joey. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Joey knows what I'm talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really funny cause (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I was just to bring it up too. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So, forget this Attack on Titans lando. </garnt>
<garnt> Like whatever we're going to call the classic. </garnt>
<garnt> The real classic that's coming </garnt>
<garnt> out the season is an anime called </garnt>
<garnt> X arm. - X arm! </garnt>
<garnt> - So I'm a, I'm a complete newb now I have seen clips of it </garnt>
<garnt> But could you please explain </garnt>
<garnt> to me what Xarm is and it's total ness. </garnt>
<connor> - It is hilarious. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It is an experience. I will say that. </connor>
<joey> So I think we have literally got the mass effect </joey>
<connor> Andromeda releases of anime. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - The Cyber Punk finish. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So this is, I didn't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Anime </garnt>
<garnt> Could have bugs and glitches. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I'm gonna say. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So it is a crunchy roll original </garnt>
<garnt> right? - Oh no. Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know that crunchy roll up proud </garnt>
<joey> of this because I have not seen a single piece </joey>
<joey> of promotional work about this at all. </joey>
<connor> - I saw the trailer on YouTube but I thought it was a joke. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And the show looks </garnt>
<garnt> Worse than that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It looks, it looks worse than </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate to say to you about the trailer's </garnt>
<garnt> probably the best part about the show </garnt>
<garnt> the trailer isn't the trailer. </garnt>
<garnt> The trailer is the anime (mumbles) </garnt>
<connor> But that probably makes it makes it good, doesn't it? </connor>
<garnt> - But it's so bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was crying and laughter the first episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is like I think the third lowest anime on mal right now </garnt>
<connor> after one episode - After one episode. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but you're laughing. </joey>
<joey> - So I mean it's, it's a that's that's what </joey>
<connor> it's a masterpiece of trash basically. </connor>
<connor> It's it's fucking. it's no masterpiece. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It is a masterpiece. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, it's like </joey>
<joey> the first time I watched like Ghazi's wing, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. All like, you know, Skelter heaven. </joey>
<garnt> I was like a scale to heaven, I was like, this is </garnt>
<garnt> I'm watching a masterpiece, but on the opposite </garnt>
<garnt> end of the. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, so to, to explain Xarm, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a control original anime that is made </garnt>
<garnt> by a completely new studio </garnt>
<garnt> by a team who's never worked in anime before. </garnt>
<connor> - American? </connor>
<connor> - No Japanese. - Japanese team. </connor>
<garnt> But they've never worked in anime before. </garnt>
<joey> And it shows, it shows, (laughing) </joey>
<joey> it shows that </joey>
<joey> They've never worked anime before. </joey>
<joey> And it is a 3D anime </joey>
<joey> that looks like it was made by a five-year-old </joey>
<joey> who just learned Blender. Like yesterday. </joey>
<connor> - Oh no. Oh no. </connor>
<garnt> - It makes Ruby look like it makes Ruby season one </garnt>
<garnt> look like an absolute master class. </garnt>
<connor> - I was going to watch it, but I just wanted to </connor>
<connor> get like drunk enough just to like fully enjoy it. </connor>
<garnt> - It makes Bezerk 2016 looked like Akira. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's pretty bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - And what's worse is that like </garnt>
<garnt> I posted the clip of it on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> but like there's a scene right near the beginning, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where the main character is 3D, but his brother is in 2D. </garnt>
<connor> - What? (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - So you have this truly awful CG, </garnt>
<garnt> like blocky Minecraft character standing </garnt>
<garnt> next to this 2D anime character. </garnt>
<garnt> And he literally in the same scene, the same shot. </garnt>
<garnt> And he literally looks </garnt>
<joey> he literally looks green screened on, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> It looks like someone just learned </joey>
<garnt> it looked like someone just had learned this </garnt>
<garnt> the Chrome Mickey's. </garnt>
<connor> - He said to his boss. Like yo, </connor>
<garnt> you heard of this thing called a chroma key. </garnt>
<garnt> This is nuts. - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Look </joey>
<garnt> - You can see it on screen right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. That's awful. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like, that looks like in the same scene. </garnt>
<connor> You know what that is, that looks like </connor>
<connor> if you told me that was what's that what's that </connor>
<garnt> game where everyone can have their own avatars in the game. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks like the like second life, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever it's called, yeah? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> it looks like if like, you know how </garnt>
<garnt> like someone other people have their own servers </garnt>
<garnt> and they like 2D things and they have like the 3D models. </garnt>
<connor> That's what it looks like. </connor>
<connor> - You know what that looks like? </connor>
<connor> That looks like someone took like a regular anime </connor>
<connor> and made like an MMD edit of it. Know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - I can see it. I can see it. </connor>
<connor> - Cause it is like that quality. </connor>
<connor> Actually, MMD is a better quality. </connor>
<connor> - Mmd is a better anime. </connor>
<connor> It's pretty damn good MMDs out there. </connor>
<connor> Don't be hating on my MMD. </connor>
<connor> - And then like, if, if that wasn't already bad </connor>
<connor> there was just like some </connor>
<connor> of the fight choreography is just hilarious. </connor>
<connor> Like this is one fight scene. </connor>
<connor> I think like it's like the last fight scene </connor>
<connor> of the first episode where there was just no music. </connor>
<connor> It's like, they forgot to put in the music. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's just like, like that, but there's no music whatsoever. </connor>
<connor> So it's just, I was watching it and I was just like </connor>
<garnt> there's something wrong with my headphones? </garnt>
<garnt> Like why is there no music playing? </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember like in the last part they run </garnt>
<garnt> out or something and it's literally a guy who looks like </garnt>
<garnt> it looks like it's literally looks like the characters are </garnt>
<garnt> like being animated with a steak or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> There's literally no </garnt>
<garnt> like they're not moving their limbs or something. </garnt>
<garnt> They just like rocking from side to side. </garnt>
<connor> - So, are we talking about like that? </connor>
<connor> Like Queen Bee would put them to shame. </connor>
<garnt> Oh, I wish this was automated by Queen Bee. </garnt>
<garnt> It makes queen bee look </garnt>
<joey> like studio wit. It's fucking horrible. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's also just a really fun time. </joey>
<garnt> Like I had a lot of fun watching the first episode. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I want to get some drinks </connor>
<garnt> and just enjoy it, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, we need to its so funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - This would be like even better if it had like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like a ghost stories dub. </garnt>
<garnt> So someone needs to dub Exxon like crunchy roll, please. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't be ashamed of XR. </garnt>
<garnt> You are sitting on a golden duck here </garnt>
<garnt> just marketed correctly. </garnt>
<garnt> And people will mean the out of us. </garnt>
<connor> Give us the rights to dub Waldoboro. </connor>
<connor> - We'll make an amazing dub of it. </connor>
<garnt> You know What I mean? </garnt>
<connor> Can't wait to direct those sessions. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - And like the opening song as well. </garnt>
<connor> Just what? (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> That, the one that sounds like some, some 41, it sounds like </garnt>
<garnt> it sounds like sum 41 cover band. </garnt>
<connor> I heard that was the one that used for the trailer, right? </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. That is just the anime </garnt>
<connor> Tried to send me it. </connor>
<garnt> And he's like, what the is this? </garnt>
<garnt> What the? </garnt>
<garnt> What is this? </garnt>
<connor> God. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's </connor>
<garnt> like a high school band that listened to too much green day. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what mean? </garnt>
<joey> It does sound like a cover band. </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> That is perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> But so why is no one talking about that? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know that you have attachment type </garnt>
<garnt> of season four, but who gives a about </garnt>
<connor> Greenlit? That like, I know, sorry. </connor>
<garnt> Like who, who let that through light quality assurance? </garnt>
<garnt> Like who led that through what qualities I'm saying? </garnt>
<garnt> Like just normally people who are like, yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this is good to go. </garnt>
<connor> Who, who dead watch that first episode was like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's good. </connor>
<garnt> I wonder though, if someone at like the production </garnt>
<connor> team was like, I feel like we're forgetting something </connor>
<connor> - QA. Oh shit. </connor>
<connor> You know how sometimes when like people like make shows </connor>
<garnt> but it's just one big like tax fraud scheme. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, I shouldn't say that you get in trouble. </garnt>
<garnt> It's definitely a joke. </garnt>
<joey> It's a joke. </joey>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> But like, I wonder what the people working </connor>
<connor> on it think of this, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Cause you know, sometime, sometimes you work </connor>
<garnt> on a project that you're proud about, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it </garnt>
<garnt> People want to get paid gone. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Or the end of the day, they're like, I mean </garnt>
<connor> I got to just keep toning up and doing what they ask. </connor>
<connor> Right. That's what I imagine </connor>
<connor> It's happening. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I just like to imagine that </garnt>
<garnt> like the animators came back to the, like the producer </garnt>
<joey> and was like, yeah, the, the, the models look great. </joey>
<joey> So like put some shading on it </joey>
<garnt> put a little more animation on the producers light. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's coming out tomorrow. </garnt>
<garnt> I just want, I just want to know, because you know </garnt>
<garnt> in like in any like anime production </garnt>
<joey> or any big project production, you know, you have this </joey>
<joey> you have this screening nights, right? </joey>
<joey> Where you as a group, as the team </joey>
<connor> you get to watch the final product before it airs. </connor>
<connor> I just want to hear the silence </connor>
<connor> in that room when the credits roll </connor>
<garnt> and you just, you just, what, what can you say? </garnt>
<garnt> Psych in Japan? </garnt>
<joey> Always silent. </joey>
<joey> That's what I see in America and the West. </joey>
<connor> We have clapping, right? </connor>
<garnt> Because like the thing that the entire </garnt>
<connor> like screen your room is just </connor>
<connor> like silently nodding their head. </connor>
<connor> Hell yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Every Japanese means just waiting for the visa card. </garnt>
<joey> Anyway, come on. </joey>
<garnt> I just want to be a man. </garnt>
<joey> I'm going to get a free meal at the end of the screening </joey>
<joey> and free drinks. </joey>
<joey> So it doesn't matter like that, that tuning </joey>
<connor> up to the screen. </connor>
<connor> I turn up to the screening. </connor>
<connor> If I could </connor>
<connor> Listen, man, like as someone who's like, you know </connor>
<connor> Donna document, you're going to name a studio. </connor>
<connor> I completely see </connor>
<connor> Oh, look at that flat. </connor>
<joey> It's hard. I get it. </joey>
<garnt> It's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> But also come on. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's hard but come on, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's hard. You know, we're not </garnt>
<garnt> we're not blaming the probably staff at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not blaming anyone for it. </garnt>
<garnt> If anything, I'd like to thank them </garnt>
<garnt> for giving us some like quality entertainment. </garnt>
<garnt> Honestly, it is honestly quality. </garnt>
<garnt> I watched episode two and it is also a banger. </garnt>
<garnt> Just coming out with a bang. </garnt>
<garnt> The episode, man </garnt>
<garnt> Exxon episode two is what I'm looking forward to. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you guys watching anything else this season </garnt>
<garnt> or are you guys waiting to see what gets hype? </garnt>
<garnt> And we'll get one to watch what the </garnt>
<garnt> called one drag priority. </garnt>
<garnt> That is one direct priority. </garnt>
<garnt> Weirdest fucking title, but I watched the trailer </garnt>
<garnt> on it because I heard so many people. </garnt>
<joey> A lot of people were asking me like, Hey </joey>
<joey> have you seen the first episode? </joey>
<joey> This I was like, that doesn't even sound like a real anime. </joey>
<joey> One direct wondering party that sounds made up. </joey>
<joey> But then I checked out the trailer. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, actually, this kind of looks fire. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. It's </garnt>
<garnt> It's too early to tell how it's going to go </garnt>
<garnt> because I've watched the first episode </garnt>
<garnt> about that is it's it's one </garnt>
<garnt> of those shows where I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know what, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's, it's one of those weird </garnt>
<garnt> I asked people, I was like, what's it about? </garnt>
<garnt> And people just said, just watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels like a </garnt>
<garnt> like an eco horror show or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like Sarah's </garnt>
<connor> on my or something or something like that. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just, I'm just throwing out words. </garnt>
<connor> Like the keeps me </connor>
<joey> like a slight light tatami galaxy vibe to it. </joey>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<connor> Like kind of just like </connor>
<garnt> it's like so strange that it's hard to describe what I </garnt>
<garnt> what I will say it, it feels like, it feels like Madoka </garnt>
<joey> Magica directed by eco horror. </joey>
<joey> It's it's really </joey>
<connor> - What the fuck you guys talking about? </connor>
<connor> So you can hire is the director that may penguin drum. </connor>
<garnt> What else has he made? </garnt>
<garnt> What else has he for hire made melee? </garnt>
<garnt> What's that magical girl. One day. </garnt>
<joey> It doesn't matter. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter. </joey>
<joey> You don't, you've not seen any of his work. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Right. </joey>
<joey> But he makes a lot of weird stuff </joey>
<joey> and it's I watched the first episode </joey>
<joey> and it it's the, what I will say. </joey>
<joey> I can't really sport with it </joey>
<joey> because I don't even understand the first episode. </joey>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> But it's a story that it presents the events </garnt>
<garnt> of this world out of order. </garnt>
<garnt> Hmm. So you get </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like racking my brain to figure </garnt>
<garnt> out how I can describe this show. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of presented. </garnt>
<garnt> Story-like like a boogie pot Phantom kind of </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it is very reminiscent of biggie. </garnt>
<connor> Like if you have no context of what you're talking about </connor>
<connor> it actually just sounds </connor>
<garnt> like you guys are talking about gibberish </garnt>
<connor> Alamo. You've watched come on away. </connor>
<garnt> I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a lot of the </garnt>
<connor> when people are like, dude, you gotta wash this </connor>
<garnt> animates. So </garnt>
<connor> It's kind of like on the same vein </connor>
<garnt> as serial experiments lane boogie, pop Phantom. </garnt>
<garnt> I, I feel like you just haven't </garnt>
<connor> You put those shows on you're like, there's no way </connor>
<connor> you could enjoy this without doing like four tabs of acid. </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like a lot of shows are like that </garnt>
<connor> Maybe with serial experiments lane </connor>
<connor> but I'd argue that like something </connor>
<garnt> like boogie bull Phantom is, </garnt>
<connor> - Don't really concern myself. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. I mean, it's something where you have to be </garnt>
<garnt> in a very specific mood to enjoy it </garnt>
<garnt> because it's not something you can just put </garnt>
<garnt> on and just enjoy it as an insane </garnt>
<joey> as like a coherent story or something. </joey>
<joey> But what I will say is out of </joey>
<joey> because I put my season on video, I watched every </joey>
<joey> the first two episodes of like every new anime and </joey>
<joey> out of everything I watched, it's the one where </joey>
<joey> I watched it didn't know what was going on. </joey>
<joey> Didn't fully understand it, but I </joey>
<joey> it stuck with me, you know? </joey>
<joey> It, it, it really, it was really the one where </joey>
<joey> I kept thinking about it after it had ended </joey>
<garnt> after I'd watched everything else, I was just like, nah </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> But I keep thinking about wondering priority. </garnt>
<garnt> And I dunno what it is exactly </garnt>
<garnt> about wondering priority that makes me latch onto it. </garnt>
<garnt> But there's something, I feel something special </garnt>
<garnt> that I kind of, I kind of got that same feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> The first time I watched </garnt>
<joey> like the first episode of like fully coli, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, I dunno what the is happening. </joey>
<joey> Like the student's forehead </joey>
<garnt> little robot just came out of it. </garnt>
<garnt> I can give you a play by play of what happens in wander rig. </garnt>
<connor> So this girl there's this like short hooded </connor>
<connor> like she wears like a yellow hoodie girl. </connor>
<connor> The first scene is there a Cicada comes </connor>
<connor> along and starts talking </connor>
<connor> to her and you're like, okay, whatever cool. </connor>
<connor> She can talk to cicadas. </connor>
<connor> And then she gets given an egg </connor>
<connor> and then she wonders what to do with this egg. </connor>
<connor> And then she's sitting on the toilet </connor>
<connor> and then toilet people starts talking </connor>
<connor> to her and she's like, yo, what the? </connor>
<connor> And then the egg hatches. </connor>
<garnt> And it turns out that it's a go hatches out the egg. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I'll just watch. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to spoil too much, but that's what was fun. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, if, if it, you know, if the weeks go </garnt>
<connor> on and everyone's still like, yeah, it's a good show. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I, from what I can understand, by the first episode </garnt>
<garnt> it deals with a lot of themes of depression and suicide. </garnt>
<garnt> And it seems like it's it </garnt>
<garnt> we get glimpses into our backstory because you know </garnt>
<garnt> we get glimpses into, is, is this a dream world? </garnt>
<garnt> Or is this the imagining things? </garnt>
<garnt> Or what's kind of going </garnt>
<garnt> on where we only get hints at everything. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like, again, it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like a modern spin on fully Callie, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like fully call is kind of the same where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it kind of used as </garnt>
<garnt> like absurd imagery to present deeper meanings. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like I said </garnt>
<garnt> it's way too early to tell what the show is going to be </garnt>
<garnt> about and how good it is. </garnt>
<garnt> But like I said, out of everything </garnt>
<garnt> I watch it stuck out to me the most. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the one I thought about the most, but I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if you wouldn't want to say the weirdest enemy you've seen. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I think you'd have to go through my lace </garnt>
<connor> but I was pretty simple that we did that last week </connor>
<connor> or it was pretty some on there that I liked. </connor>
<connor> Have you ever watched an anime or a show? </connor>
<garnt> And you're just like </garnt>
<garnt> what the did I just watch that made zero sense to me? </garnt>
<garnt> Like kinda like, like not in like the vein </garnt>
<garnt> of like, you know, this was kind of thing </garnt>
<garnt> but like just genuinely the storytelling was so like </garnt>
<garnt> on the same lines as the ending of Angelique </garnt>
<garnt> or like a, you know, like a take on concrete or so. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. I mean the first time I watched van galleon </connor>
<joey> I was like, I don't, what the I was like, Oh </joey>
<joey> that's how they're going to end it. </joey>
<joey> And like, you know </joey>
<garnt> some people love finding the deeper meaning in that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, that was a bit. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna get on with my life. </garnt>
<joey> I just that's really concerned me. </joey>
<joey> I just </joey>
<garnt> But I, I don't. </garnt>
<garnt> And then like maybe a video of my recommended </garnt>
<garnt> Monkey bar activation. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I </garnt>
<garnt> Think I've like programmed my brain to like </garnt>
<joey> just make my life easier. </joey>
<joey> So like when I want to just, you know, stuff like that </joey>
<joey> but might drive some people mad. </joey>
<connor> I'm just like monkey forget monkey Buffon. </connor>
<garnt> I just find it funny. </garnt>
<garnt> How like, considering like </garnt>
<garnt> Previous episode </garnt>
<garnt> you said like how you love to challenge yourself every day. </garnt>
<garnt> You definitely do not like to challenge yourself on anime </garnt>
<connor> but like more, what is </connor>
<connor> What is thinking about the end </connor>
<connor> of Ethan galleon challenging year in any way? </connor>
<connor> How was that? </connor>
<garnt> Well, not necessarily in a Vivo, but like, you know </garnt>
<garnt> something like, you know, like a fully Coolio </garnt>
<garnt> like a take on King Cree where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> there are deeper meanings behind </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing where you watch it once </garnt>
<joey> and you can't get everything you </joey>
<joey> you can't enjoy from just like watching it one. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. But like, why would that challenge you? </connor>
<connor> There </connor>
<garnt> Is all in challenge as in like, it makes you </garnt>
<garnt> You think about its themes more and kind of challenges your </garnt>
<garnt> I guess like perception of how you like consume it. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess it's hard to describe </garnt>
<garnt> It. It, it challenged challenges. </garnt>
<joey> . It's like, I broke them. </joey>
<joey> I've watched those things where it's </joey>
<joey> like the deeper meaning everything more often than not. </joey>
<connor> Like I realized that that that's what they're doing. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, Oh, okay, cool. </connor>
<connor> And then I'll just, I'll let </connor>
<connor> go on Google and I'll be like, what were they trying to say? </connor>
<garnt> But like, don't you </garnt>
<garnt> like? Cause I find </garnt>
<garnt> Like some enjoyment in kind of watching it </garnt>
<garnt> and trying to figure it out myself. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> I got a good way to, it's like unraveling a puzzle </garnt>
<joey> by yourself and it's like playing a puzzle game. </joey>
<joey> Right. You're given the pieces and you know </joey>
<joey> you're not told what the right answer is, but it's </joey>
<joey> up to you and it's up to you to unravel it yourself. </joey>
<garnt> It's more like, it's more like you've given a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> of pieces and as you're playing around with the pieces </garnt>
<garnt> you realize that it's a puzzle that can't be solved. </garnt>
<garnt> This is like, I love map. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Because there is a problem </garnt>
<garnt> and it is always very clearly defined as such, right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not logical with like yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> With stories and all that kind of stuff. </garnt>
<joey> It's I don't like that. </joey>
<joey> I have to figure out what this guy was thinking about. </joey>
<joey> Like sometimes I might get a meaning that is not </joey>
<joey> even remotely close to what he was thinking </joey>
<joey> or the author was thinking when they were writing the thing </joey>
<connor> down. And to me, that bothers me that I can just </connor>
<connor> wildly get the answer wrong and I'll never be corrected. </connor>
<garnt> I like that. </garnt>
<garnt> But you assume that that there's a right answer. </garnt>
<connor> Well, what if he didn't know there was a right answer </connor>
<connor> And that's the problem is that I don't like that when </connor>
<garnt> there's just like an interpretation and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> you just make up what you want. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it's like, then </garnt>
<connor> What? I would argue that </connor>
<garnt> The story can still entertain you in that aspect </garnt>
<garnt> whether it is the actual correct answer or not </garnt>
<joey> Like, think about it much, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> That's I just, I watch it and I, I like whatever thoughts </garnt>
<joey> I have when I finish. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, all right, cool. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. That's what I'm going to leave with. </joey>
<garnt> And most of the time, I don't really care to try </garnt>
<garnt> and find the meaning in it. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I think, again </garnt>
<garnt> I know this is like, that's such monkey brain. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't appreciate </garnt>
<garnt> Final, et cetera, et cetera. </garnt>
<garnt> But I'd say that's even more normal at the end of the day. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't care. </garnt>
<garnt> I think people like </garnt>
<garnt> Me who like actually like trying to find the deeper meaning. </garnt>
<garnt> I think we're the minority. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I think I'm the minority here because I talk </garnt>
<garnt> about the reason I value this so much is </garnt>
<garnt> because there has been time where like a piece </garnt>
<joey> of media has literally affected sometimes the way I think </joey>
<joey> or the way I view life. </joey>
<joey> So, because I know it can have that effect. </joey>
<garnt> I, you know, I try to search it out whenever I can. </garnt>
<garnt> Whenever I find that there might be even a glimpse </garnt>
<garnt> that there might be a deeper meaning I love going into it. </garnt>
<connor> No, I just like, I like everything to be efficient. </connor>
<garnt> I like everything to be done. </garnt>
<garnt> Everything on a silver platter, right? </garnt>
<garnt> No, no, not at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I like it when things are very clearly defined the rules </garnt>
<joey> like this is why, like, I always, like I never </joey>
<joey> ever did any artistic subjects in school, right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I don't like how it's all </joey>
<joey> it's all like a mess and it's totally interpretation. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I like how </joey>
<joey> in math and physics and life, the rules, they make sense. </joey>
<joey> And you can, you can like take them in and you can like </joey>
<garnt> No, I get like, you know </garnt>
<garnt> my math and physics were my favorite tool. </garnt>
<connor> Not fun when I'm like reading a book or something </connor>
<joey> and I'm doing this and I'm, I'm just being presented </joey>
<connor> with a bunch </connor>
<connor> of nonsense that I'm after to make sense of myself </connor>
<garnt> Argue then that if it's a bunch of nonsense </garnt>
<garnt> without an interpretation, then that's just a bad story </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, sometimes you can make your own </connor>
<joey> you can make your own thoughts </joey>
<joey> up from what I was being presented to you. </joey>
<joey> I want you to just kind of like </joey>
<joey> cool. Alright, nice. </joey>
<joey> I came up with what I think happened </joey>
<connor> and then it's like, all right, well that's what I think. </connor>
<garnt> I get that like the best stories are the ones where </garnt>
<garnt> you can read it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like someone like you can read it where like </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have to even think about the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that there might possibly be a deeper meaning </garnt>
<garnt> and it's still enjoyable. </garnt>
<garnt> And at the same time, people like me that liked to look </garnt>
<garnt> for deeper meanings can also enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Like once you get too philosophical, but you know, why </garnt>
<joey> why do we watch entertainment is to feel things </joey>
<joey> that's the end all be all right. </joey>
<joey> Entertainment to make us feel something, whatever you </joey>
<joey> want to feel, whether it's like adrenaline. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you just want to feel depressed or whatever </joey>
<joey> you know, it's and watching something like, for example </joey>
<joey> the ending episode of the van galleon I've I </joey>
<joey> remember first time I've watched it. </joey>
<joey> I hated that because I'm just like, why </joey>
<garnt> why can I not just be given the answer? </garnt>
<connor> Why, why is the answer? </connor>
<garnt> Not just, you know, being presented to me </garnt>
<connor> on like a golden platter, you know, that's what I wanted. </connor>
<garnt> And then as I grew older and I, it stuck with me </garnt>
<connor> and I've re watched it </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, Oh, this is, this is making me feel </garnt>
<connor> Different things. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I'll change my mind on it. </connor>
<garnt> But right now for me </garnt>
<joey> like entertainment and media, it's just like </joey>
<joey> I just want to relax and thinking is not relaxing. </joey>
<connor> I just want to get on with it. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm so God much. </connor>
<connor> And I just want to do the things I want to do. </connor>
<garnt> And to me and payment is purely </garnt>
<garnt> like a gas stop on my destination. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, let's just stop for a moment and have some fun. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> No, I mean, I get that too. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's not like every pieces came </garnt>
<garnt> and I watched this like mind bending and it's like, it's </garnt>
<garnt> like I said, sometimes you just need to be </garnt>
<garnt> in a very specific room to enjoy this piece of media. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, you know what? </garnt>
<connor> I want to feel pretentious right now. </connor>
<connor> Like I kind of want to like figure </connor>
<garnt> out if this has a deeper meaning. </garnt>
<connor> Like I, I, when I speak to people who talk </connor>
<connor> like that about the media, they like, I'm like, you know </connor>
<garnt> part of me is envious because I don't care for that. </garnt>
<garnt> But because I think a lot of people are envious of that </garnt>
<joey> because I think when you meet a lot of people, they'll claim </joey>
<garnt> that they can see the, find a meaning and all of that. </garnt>
<garnt> And most of the time they have no idea, but </garnt>
<joey> you know, I dunno, I'm just completely open </joey>
<connor> with the fact that I'm like, well, I don't care. </connor>
<garnt> I don't care to care </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. What I like </garnt>
<connor> What, what I don't understand is the other extreme </connor>
<garnt> where it's people who can't seem to enjoy media </garnt>
<garnt> unless there is something deeper about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I, there are times when I just want to </garnt>
<garnt> watch a shitty ISA call </garnt>
<garnt> and just not have to think, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I guess it's like the people who like think </garnt>
<garnt> that every single piece of entertainment </garnt>
<garnt> or media has some kind of deeper meaning under it. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like no anime review. </garnt>
<garnt> A non non-binary has no deeper meaning. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just a slice of life. </garnt>
<garnt> Like just chill. </garnt>
<connor> Well, it feels like privilege. </connor>
<connor> The problem it's like my only problem is life in life is </connor>
<garnt> that my media that I consume doesn't have enough </garnt>
<garnt> Meaningless. It's like, it's like, Oh my how privileged </garnt>
<garnt> I used to be where that's a concern, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like </garnt>
<garnt> That's like the biggest, first world problem where like </garnt>
<joey> you can't get enough fine art, you know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> That's like literally like billionaire problem. </connor>
<garnt> Oh, what me off even more. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, you can have your own interpretation for media </garnt>
<garnt> right? That's, that's, that's very normal for everything. </garnt>
<connor> But what me </connor>
<connor> off is when people project their own meaning </connor>
<connor> onto this piece of media. </connor>
<connor> Like I remember, I remember where the attack on Titan, when </connor>
<garnt> you know, the basement thing happened to them. </garnt>
<garnt> There were articles to be like, Oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this is promoting Nazi-ism and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, Oh, it's not, Oh God, he gets, he gets </garnt>
<joey> to a point where there's a difference between, you know </joey>
<joey> analyzing it and interpreting it in your own way. </joey>
<garnt> And just there's even when they know the right answer as </garnt>
<garnt> well. Right. </garnt>
<joey> It's just like, no, no, I don't care what the author says. </joey>
<garnt> This is what it actually means. </garnt>
<joey> He just doesn't know. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, no, I'm pretty sure </garnt>
<garnt> if the author said that this is what it means. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what a mean. </garnt>
<connor> Well, it's, I mean, there's plenty of cases of where like </connor>
<connor> The author loses control over the work. </connor>
<garnt> Well, I mean, isn't that like </garnt>
<garnt> the whole thing was Ava, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where like the frog grip, the death of the author. </garnt>
<connor> So you've always been up to anything interesting recently. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, we're currently back in lockdown always. </garnt>
<joey> So we haven't really been able to do much really </joey>
<connor> Japanese covers pretty useless. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, yeah, but </garnt>
<garnt> Statement restaurant, please close at eight. </garnt>
<connor> So you can still travel and do whatever you want. </connor>
<connor> But you know </connor>
<garnt> Not an enforced lockdown in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's always a suggestion. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a suggestion that in Japan people listen. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, no, I was crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> I think like where was it? </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, it was </garnt>
<garnt> because usually after we finished recording a podcast </garnt>
<garnt> we going out to dinner and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think we were at like one of the restaurants nearby </garnt>
<joey> and they were playing like news footage and the re watched. </joey>
<joey> Yes. There was a shot of station </joey>
<joey> zero people in front of it, which is </joey>
<connor> like crazy because she did a go station for you guys. </connor>
<connor> I know it was like literally the most busy station I think </connor>
<connor> in the world. </connor>
<garnt> Isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It is. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. It is at least in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Most of the world. </garnt>
<garnt> I think station. </garnt>
<garnt> I died a little inside. </garnt>
<garnt> Whenever someone, whenever a friend comes to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> I asked where to meet and they say Shinji meeting </garnt>
<connor> at re watched station is impossible, but like navigating it. </connor>
<garnt> Isn't so bad now I hate now. </garnt>
<connor> I think you get Bouguereau is worse than average. </connor>
<garnt> Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> What are you on? </garnt>
<connor> Because when you try and get to like the other </connor>
<garnt> like the subway lines, you'd like for someone she can stay </garnt>
<garnt> she literally has like 30 exits girl has maybe like 10 </garnt>
<garnt> like depending on which exit </garnt>
<garnt> you come out of sh sh re watched </garnt>
<garnt> like it tells you to go on the other side of the station. </garnt>
<garnt> And you would think walking in a straight line would work. </garnt>
<garnt> No, you can't walk in a straight line </garnt>
<garnt> in re watched because you've got to pass depending </garnt>
<garnt> on where you're on a station, you've got to pass </garnt>
<garnt> through like 10 different dailies with gigabit grow station. </garnt>
<garnt> I always, if someone's just like meet </garnt>
<garnt> at this gate that I dunno where the it is </garnt>
<garnt> then I'll just go out of the regular gate </garnt>
<joey> and I can at least walk around the station. </joey>
<joey> But if you try </joey>
<garnt> and do that with re watched station, you're. </garnt>
<garnt> If you ever come to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and you're going to meet anyone here </garnt>
<garnt> and you're staying and you're staying there </garnt>
<garnt> re watched never say you're going to meet </garnt>
<garnt> meet at re watched station. </garnt>
<connor> It is a lie. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> It's saying you're going to meet the re watched station is </connor>
<connor> like saying you're going to meet somewhere </connor>
<connor> in like times square or something. </connor>
<garnt> It's a massive area and station doesn't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not even that it's like saying like </garnt>
<garnt> I'll meet you in New York. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, all right, cool place outside </garnt>
<garnt> of the station and then send them the Google. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But you could do that with any other station. </garnt>
<garnt> It'd be way easier to get out of it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I, I remember I </garnt>
<connor> I met Jeff here mother's basement at re watched station. </connor>
<connor> And as soon as he said it, I was like, Oh, here we go. </connor>
<connor> God, I got to find, it's basically finding where's Wally </connor>
<connor> with your mates. </connor>
<connor> And you know, with Jeff, is it shouldn't be hard </connor>
<connor> cause he's massive. </connor>
<connor> Right. And he says, he, I asked him where he is </connor>
<connor> and he's he goes, Oh, I'm a near this place. </connor>
<connor> I think it's, it looks like there's a big camera nearby. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, cool, cool. </connor>
<joey> So, so I go to like the nearest big camera and so </joey>
<garnt> big camera is like this it's huge department </garnt>
<garnt> store Charlotte. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like electronic store basically. </garnt>
<garnt> So I go to the IU West re watched B camera, and then </garnt>
<garnt> I send him the message and I'm just like, okay, I'm </garnt>
<garnt> outside big camera. </garnt>
<garnt> And he goes, I don't see you and I'm go buck. </garnt>
<garnt> It was that at that point I knew ticks off of one. </garnt>
<connor> I up. </connor>
<garnt> And I, and I, and I tell him just to send me the Google map </garnt>
<connor> coordinates and he's </connor>
<garnt> on the other side of the, is that re watched </garnt>
<connor> West, like Google maps. </connor>
<garnt> It's so much easier. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh. So you can just literally meet </garnt>
<garnt> at like one station </garnt>
<garnt> on. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Because some of the stations lie </garnt>
<garnt> with how to get places </garnt>
<connor> like as well has like a East West exit or something. </connor>
<garnt> No, dude re watched is like, has like seven West. </garnt>
<connor> It has an East West exit. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. That doesn't, it doesn't even like re watched doesn't </garnt>
<connor> even have an East West exit. </connor>
<garnt> I think Shinju has like an East West exit </garnt>
<garnt> and a new east-west exit. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how many exits their own re watched that </garnt>
<garnt> they've literally run out of directions to name the exits </garnt>
<connor> The train stations in Wales where it's just a platform. </connor>
<joey> What was it? </joey>
<garnt> That was the whole station, maybe a vending machine. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're lucky </garnt>
<garnt> Honestly like what I usually do, I've done this </garnt>
<garnt> with a few people and it's actually proven to </garnt>
<joey> be effective is that instead of meeting in re watched </joey>
<joey> you meet one station down on the, which is Yogi. </joey>
<joey> Because walking, because walking to your Yogi, like </joey>
<joey> from your yoga to re watched is the exact same time </joey>
<garnt> that it will take to actually get </garnt>
<garnt> out of re watched station is because walking </garnt>
<garnt> from one side of the station to another, depending </garnt>
<garnt> on where you are could take up to 15 to 20 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas like Yogi only has two exits, very straightforward. </garnt>
<garnt> No, bro, what do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> I'm doing what you love to do best? </connor>
<garnt> Which is min maxing myself. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. Well what is the optimal straddling? </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> Google has this thing now where it tells you </garnt>
<garnt> which cart to get on. </garnt>
<garnt> So it tells you which train car to get </garnt>
<connor> on for the smoothest and quickest exit and 95% of the time. </connor>
<connor> It's spot on. </connor>
<connor> Let's do that. </connor>
<garnt> I'll say trick question though. </garnt>
<connor> There is no smooth exit or re watched. </connor>
<connor> There is, there is never </connor>
<garnt> I have legit. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I always have to Goshen. </garnt>
<garnt> Juki right. </garnt>
<garnt> And obviously I'm always using to do that because I need to </garnt>
<garnt> and I listened to what Google, my God </garnt>
<connor> Google tells me, you know, every time and it bang on </connor>
<connor> it's like go this exit gob, the first set </connor>
<connor> of stairs you see every single time it's basically right. </connor>
<garnt> You think someone who just come to came to Japan ball </garnt>
<connor> like which direction of re watched and which ex there are. </connor>
<garnt> I don't even know where it, I get out. </garnt>
<connor> I, I mean, it works for me. </connor>
<connor> I just listened to what the PC, the PC master race tells me. </connor>
<connor> If the computers tell me to go somewhere </connor>
<connor> I go where the computer second </connor>
<garnt> Carnivores. </garnt>
<garnt> The first time you come to Japan, don't do that. </garnt>
<connor> Find where you want to go. </connor>
<connor> When you go to the station, there'll be numbers </connor>
<connor> on the floor. </connor>
<connor> Just pick the number </connor>
<connor> what the Google tells you to go on and then do </connor>
<garnt> it. Trust </garnt>
<garnt> re watched. You all get lost navigating this station. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. Don't don't trust the station signs. </connor>
<connor> Cause there'll be like, Oh yeah, if you're on the platform </connor>
<connor> be like the exit this way </connor>
<garnt> You don't trust the sessions. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I've got. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, because when you go </garnt>
<garnt> to re watched and you follow Google maps, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Google maps says, take the West exit out of re watched. </garnt>
<connor> And then you go, you go to, you, go out your trailer </connor>
<connor> you go see the signs. </connor>
<connor> And there is probably every exit. </connor>
<garnt> But the exit that it says on Google maps </garnt>
<garnt> The mistake, you're looking at the signs, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The signs, the signs, all they do is deceive. </garnt>
<garnt> They, they make you second guess. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? Don't listen to the song full of. </garnt>
<garnt> Listen to what Google says. </garnt>
<garnt> A hundred percent, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because thing is right. </garnt>
<garnt> You'll be on the platform. </garnt>
<joey> Right? And there'll be like eight sets </joey>
<joey> of stairs that you can take. </joey>
<joey> That'll be an hour. </joey>
<joey> This is like this way. </joey>
<joey> This is the way to where you want to go. </joey>
<joey> And sometimes it's like the most unoptimized way to get </joey>
<joey> out of the out of the station </joey>
<joey> or go to the line that you want to go. </joey>
<joey> And there's bunch of stairs. </joey>
<joey> And sometimes it isn't clear which stairs to get. </joey>
<joey> It's a mess. </joey>
<joey> Right? If Google tells you to get off at a cart </joey>
<joey> go immediately to the nearest set of stairs that you see it. </joey>
<connor> I guarantee it'll work. </connor>
<connor> And just go out the exit that you see closest. </connor>
<connor> It'll always work. </connor>
<connor> Google knows. </connor>
<connor> Don't listen to the signs. </connor>
<connor> They're lie back. </connor>
<connor> Don't try a voice. </connor>
<garnt> You'll see. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno, man. </garnt>
<connor> I, I think I'll just avoid getting off fishing. </connor>
<connor> I just, I just feel </connor>
<connor> like not going through re watched </connor>
<connor> is just the optimal straps. </connor>
<connor> I'm just, I want to fly </connor>
<garnt> out of the country without an airport. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, if you're going to go to Japan </connor>
<connor> you're going to be going through re watched. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. But like I rather </garnt>
<garnt> meet like somewhere far away from the actual </garnt>
<connor> Station out of this place to meet </connor>
<connor> Somewhere, anywhere near the station </connor>
<garnt> because it's just extra. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just extra stress. </garnt>
<garnt> You're adding onto your commute. </garnt>
<connor> AI. Do it for you. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know because it </garnt>
<garnt> I have tried following the AI and Google maps. </garnt>
<garnt> Isn't perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> That's pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> Is this, what is this why you hate it </garnt>
<garnt> Mo more because of the AI maps? </garnt>
<connor> I definitely. </connor>
<garnt> So that's why you hate you </garnt>
<garnt> Such a mess of a station. </garnt>
<garnt> The way it's been laid out. </garnt>
<garnt> Like shouldn't you queue. </garnt>
<garnt> I get it. </garnt>
<garnt> It makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> is that the science makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> You can see the </garnt>
<garnt> I follow assigned to an exit. </garnt>
<garnt> It actually takes me to the eggs. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, because I like putting my trust </garnt>
<garnt> in my own sense of direction. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. So if I'm in a place like eco bucardo </garnt>
<connor> I can trust that wherever I am. </connor>
<connor> I can find the right way out. </connor>
<connor> I just follow the signs. </connor>
<connor> I just follow the signs. </connor>
<connor> Not the right way with, with, with </connor>
<connor> re watched. I'm if you literally have to put your trust </connor>
<garnt> in an AI machine to tell you the right direction </garnt>
<garnt> then it is just a poorly planned system. </garnt>
<connor> I mean </connor>
<connor> It works though. </connor>
<connor> I kept where I need to get to no problem. </connor>
<garnt> Well, let's say that I wanted to people watching this </garnt>
<connor> you'd never been to Japan. </connor>
<connor> Like what the is this problem? </connor>
<garnt> If you've never been to Japan, don't listen to corner </garnt>
<connor> meet anywhere outside of China </connor>
<connor> Listen to the white guy in Germany. </connor>
<connor> Would you trust the white guy? </connor>
<connor> Listen, listen to me, the white guy, trust me. </connor>
<connor> I find life hacks where they don't exist. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. I mean, we've locked down. </garnt>
<garnt> There's not so much new I can be doing. </garnt>
<garnt> So recently I had, this had woke up one day </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just like, Oh, I should get back into fate. </garnt>
<garnt> Go. No, no, I saw you taking a bath. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, no, no, no </garnt>
<joey> No. It's like watching. </joey>
<connor> It's like watching a friend start a new drug. </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's no, please stop. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just seeing a mate like just relapsed. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, no, no, you were 10 weeks sober, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean </garnt>
<garnt> I'm kind of the same way. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I </garnt>
<garnt> I did something that I haven't done in literal years </garnt>
<garnt> which is by an arrogance, like a Japanese area. </garnt>
<garnt> Ooh. I am brand new </garnt>
<garnt> Came out arrogant. </garnt>
<garnt> So cause I was in Akihabara a while back doing some shopping </garnt>
<joey> for a video and, and I was walking parceling Mellon books </joey>
<joey> which is like, you know, where they sold a little </joey>
<joey> like donations and stuff and out the front. </joey>
<connor> Okay. So basically say out the front, they have like a bunch </connor>
<connor> of signs for like new games that come out and every now </connor>
<connor> and then they'll also show some signs for like arrogance. </connor>
<joey> Right. Cause that's where they sell it. </joey>
<joey> And there was one where I was just like </joey>
<joey> that actually looks really cool. </joey>
<joey> Like I didn't actually know it was an arrogant. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was like a standard JPG or whatever </joey>
<joey> but I was like, that actually kind of looks cool. </joey>
<joey> So I looked it up, found out it's an arrogant by Alice soft. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, wow, Alice self actually just </joey>
<joey> like click baited me into thinking that this was </joey>
<garnt> like a legitimate JL Fiji when it's just a irrigate </garnt>
<garnt> with JPG elements in it. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, all right, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I'll buy it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll buy it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's locked </garnt>
<garnt> down. I </garnt>
<garnt> Go out anywhere and I haven't bought </garnt>
<garnt> and played an arrogance so many years. </garnt>
<garnt> it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll do it. </garnt>
<garnt> Play at it. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's kind of all I've been doing for the past three </garnt>
<garnt> Days. Really trying to give context to kind corner </garnt>
<garnt> About what Alice soft has done. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I just zoned out. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if there's any games like that </garnt>
<garnt> of famous outside of Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> That also basically Alice soft is like one of the oldest </garnt>
<garnt> I guess like most well-known in the era gay world. </garnt>
<connor> There's like illusion like Alice soft, what? </connor>
<connor> A leaf, a leaf? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. You train them and poke them on </connor>
<garnt> You know, Maples and other maker. </garnt>
<connor> My favorite Pokemon type maple lumber sugar is another one. </connor>
<garnt> There's like </garnt>
<garnt> Basically it's like, it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically just like an O G arrogant developer. </garnt>
<garnt> And they came up </garnt>
<garnt> with a new game that looks completely different </garnt>
<garnt> to anything that they've done. </garnt>
<connor> Okay. So I played a few like Ali soft games back in my head. </connor>
<connor> So we said, what the do you do in America? </connor>
<garnt> Explain to me it's a visual novel </garnt>
<garnt> visual novel with porn. </garnt>
<garnt> Or if it's good </garnt>
<joey> Connors like, wait, how can you get </joey>
<joey> off? How </joey>
<garnt> Does that work? </garnt>
<connor> If it's good. </connor>
<garnt> Basically think of it as it's like perfectly halfway </garnt>
<garnt> between jacking off to a Dogan and jacking off to a hammer. </garnt>
<connor> Imagine how the latter or the former field site </connor>
<garnt> Basically it's like jacking off to a dojo, but the audio </garnt>
<connor> from the hand ties playing. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. So there's voice acting </garnt>
<garnt> Sound effects. </garnt>
<garnt> So, that can also be auto played </garnt>
<connor> or so like you you're playing this story game </connor>
<connor> and you might say you just beat one </connor>
<connor> out and then you just carry </connor>
<connor> on. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I that </connor>
<connor> You know, 30 seconds after I've got it. </connor>
<connor> I've just looked at discussed of what I've been testing. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, turn that off </connor>
<garnt> With all the milk you've been watching. </garnt>
<connor> I will be disgusted right after it. </connor>
<garnt> You are in like a heightened state of like, you're </garnt>
<garnt> you're basically like a monk </garnt>
<garnt> for 30 seconds where you're like, I will never have sex. </garnt>
<connor> Well, I'm not, I don't know why I'm like turning the. </connor>
<garnt> You get postnatal. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, a hundred percent every time, every time. </connor>
<garnt> And then I'm like, weak-willed with porn. </garnt>
<joey> If I could abandon porn, I would, you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. I would. </garnt>
<garnt> If I, if every guy says that </garnt>
<garnt> if you could say comment, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You just never need to ever again. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be like, sure. </garnt>
<garnt> Why not? </garnt>
<garnt> Well, let's try it. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's see how it goes. </garnt>
<connor> I have the completed. </connor>
<garnt> No, not November. </garnt>
<connor> No. I've never attempted it. </connor>
<garnt> Well, it sounds like you're wanting to attempt to right now </garnt>
<connor> I ended up getting like a wet dream eventually. </connor>
<joey> Right? Like that'll happen. </joey>
<joey> Right. If you don't care. </joey>
<joey> Well, if you leave it for a month, yeah. </joey>
<joey> When was the last time you didn't check off for a month? </joey>
<garnt> I will never, but that's because I'm </garnt>
<garnt> but that's because I'm not going to </garnt>
<garnt> Spew being like, I can live without point. </garnt>
<connor> Like </connor>
<garnt> No, I want a one point. </garnt>
<connor> No, I want to, I want to live without it. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to be, I just find out this is </connor>
<garnt> this is the literally I don't want to be horny. </garnt>
<connor> I want to, like I've ever seen in real life. </connor>
<connor> I hate being distracted from what I'm trying to do. </connor>
<connor> And it's just distracting. </connor>
<connor> I look at that meme and I'm just like, I want both really. </connor>
<garnt> I want to be horny and happy. </garnt>
<garnt> So you just, you just say you see this </garnt>
<garnt> as like a distraction from your optimized life. </garnt>
<connor> Optimized lifestyle is being ruined by this. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> I can never hear the word optimized the same way </garnt>
<garnt> after this podcast. </garnt>
<connor> You're you're playing this game. </connor>
<garnt> You know, it's a game. </garnt>
<garnt> How are we going to game? </garnt>
<garnt> It's reading. </garnt>
<connor> It's tricking you in a jacket. </connor>
<garnt> Alice soft one has like full on JPG RPG elements as well. </garnt>
<connor> Oh. So you're like you're in the middle </connor>
<connor> of a battle and you're trying to Jack </connor>
<garnt> off. No, no </garnt>
<garnt> No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. So think of, okay, this is </garnt>
<garnt> I hate the fact that I'm using this as an example. </garnt>
<garnt> Think of </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh God, here we go. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait. Like the persona games are, in my opinion </garnt>
<connor> persona games are the perfect blend of visual novel </connor>
<connor> and JPG way. </connor>
<connor> Like they've somehow managed to make two like elements </connor>
<connor> of two completely different styles of games </connor>
<connor> and mix it perfectly. </connor>
<connor> Right. So in persona, the J RPG elements are most often </connor>
<connor> than not completely separated </connor>
<connor> from the actual visual novel elements. </connor>
<connor> Right. In persona. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. In persona. </connor>
<connor> Whereas </connor>
<garnt> What a visual novel of quake. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if I just fell small, smaller Jake. </garnt>
<connor> No, that's pretty this for me </connor>
<connor> Man. </connor>
<connor> So in persona, right? </connor>
<connor> Like the, you have the visual novel elements </connor>
<connor> and then you have the JLL in between the yeah. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. So like, you know, you'd have like, you go </joey>
<joey> through a dungeon or whatever, and then, you know, once </joey>
<connor> once you complete that dungeon </connor>
<connor> then it goes into the visual. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You call it. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I would argue that the GRPC elements fill </joey>
<joey> up for you as well, but regardless. </joey>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, you have like the story elements </connor>
<connor> and you have like the actual like gameplay elements. </connor>
<connor> Right. Whereas in this era gay </connor>
<connor> the sex scenes time start to happen </connor>
<joey> during only the visual novel elements. </joey>
<joey> Hmm. Okay. </joey>
<garnt> So, so the, the vision of elements </garnt>
<garnt> of the sex scenes and the gameplay stuff breaks up that. </garnt>
<garnt> So like a standard Silicon. </garnt>
<garnt> So like the standard error, like a standard error. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. That doesn't have JFE GL in the heart </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically just a visual novel </garnt>
<garnt> with sex scenes put into it. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> So it kind of interweaves with the story with this one. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just that separately. </garnt>
<garnt> It has a J Apigee portion as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, what do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> Like you battle, like what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> Like what? </connor>
<connor> I'm confused, what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> What the else do you do in a J LPG? </connor>
<joey> So you're just, it's just a dead and normal J RPG game </joey>
<joey> where you're going around battling monsters leveling off. </joey>
<joey> And then it cuts to like a visual novel with yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Who comes up with </garnt>
<connor> Unlike on a slide. </connor>
<connor> I can literally hear the gears </connor>
<garnt> like turning in his head and it's just not computing. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, wait, what? </garnt>
<garnt> No. Like they don't, they're not coming to the gym. </garnt>
<connor> They're just stuck. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I'm just like, this sounds to me, right. </connor>
<connor> This is the equivalent of being like, so it's a food </connor>
<connor> tray that jacks you off. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I don't want those two things going </connor>
<connor> near each other. </connor>
<connor> What are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> Like those two elements, the JL PG game, and then </connor>
<connor> just a visual novel with porn in it. </connor>
<garnt> I like just two elements that just shouldn't be </garnt>
<garnt> involved at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Why not? </garnt>
<connor> Why? Why would, why wouldn't you want them </connor>
<garnt> Look, don't look like your </garnt>
<garnt> As if like there's the visual novel </garnt>
<connor> like storytelling, part, and then there's the sex scene. </connor>
<connor> And then immediately, and then immediately there's a battle. </connor>
<connor> That's not how it works </connor>
<connor> But how does it work then? </connor>
<connor> It </connor>
<garnt> Works as if like there's the storytelling element </garnt>
<garnt> the visual novel element. </garnt>
<garnt> And in the middle, there is a sex scene. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's sandwiched between the visual novel elements. </garnt>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> So there's the visual novel elements where </connor>
<connor> they're telling a story and there's porn </connor>
<connor> in the middle and then it just cuts to when it </connor>
<connor> when the done with the talking it goes </connor>
<connor> to a normal dead-ass game. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. What, why </garnt>
<garnt> Does this look good to you? </garnt>
<garnt> Am I insane? </garnt>
<garnt> This sounds awful. </garnt>
<garnt> It sounds great. </garnt>
<garnt> No, it doesn't. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just playing devil's advocate. </garnt>
<connor> Okay. I've I mean, I've, I, I say this </connor>
<connor> to someone who has also played Aero gaze </connor>
<connor> before this there's something, there's something </connor>
<joey> about like hen Thai games and arrow gays, where </joey>
<joey> the sex scenes feel like this there's something different </joey>
<joey> about feeling like you've earned a sex scene </joey>
<joey> Oh fuck off. </joey>
<garnt> A hundred percent, a hundred percent agree. </garnt>
<garnt> It is. </garnt>
<garnt> It is </garnt>
<garnt> Like you could have the most mediocre sex scene </garnt>
<garnt> but you feel </garnt>
<garnt> like you've earned that sex scene. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's even more so in this game </garnt>
<garnt> because like you can unlock certain sex scenes depending </garnt>
<garnt> on what you do in the J RPG </garnt>
<garnt> a person who watches a hand-tight. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want an X-Box achievement. </garnt>
<garnt> I want a hand tie. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a person </garnt>
<garnt> Who watches a hint high and skip straight </garnt>
<garnt> to 15 or 20 minutes or not know what we're talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> Story and hand tag. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't want to sit there </garnt>
<garnt> and read a book and then </garnt>
<connor> into the book and then wipe the cut off my hand </connor>
<connor> and go around my RPG world, leveling up my character. </connor>
<connor> Right. I don't wanna fucking deal with </connor>
<garnt> like, look, don't get me wrong. </garnt>
<joey> Like </joey>
<joey> I'll say, man, this is not the type of game for anybody. </joey>
<connor> This isn't, this isn't, this isn't like. </connor>
<garnt> I completely understand that. </garnt>
<garnt> The stuff I like in hindsight </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty shit. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. This is like, you don't want to say like </connor>
<connor> don't eat where you shit. </connor>
<connor> Right. This is like beating the that you're sleeping. </connor>
<connor> Like this is like, this is so fucked. </connor>
<connor> Like this shouldn't be a combination of things. </connor>
<connor> Like only Japan would make something </connor>
<connor> like this because it's just so stupidly like </connor>
<connor> like this shouldn't exist. </connor>
<garnt> Like look at honeypot. </garnt>
<connor> That was, that was made by Americans. </connor>
<connor> I don't like honeypot by honey pot either. </connor>
<connor> I enjoy honeypot because it's literally what I just think </connor>
<garnt> of because I can buy American because like, I, for example </garnt>
<connor> Bejeweled or some wasn't that game. </connor>
<garnt> Like it was one of those </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, it's like a puzzle game. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a puzzle game. </garnt>
<garnt> But also gave him that a too. </garnt>
<garnt> But then under, because the thing is, the thing </garnt>
<garnt> is it's like Jackie off to a jigsaw puzzle, be </garnt>
<garnt> Like, Oh, Oh, it's making porn. </garnt>
<garnt> The pieces </garnt>
<connor> Of making a poem because the thing is, the thing is right. </connor>
<connor> You have this gameplay loop, right? </connor>
<garnt> You have this gameplay loop, but unlike you, I need a reward </garnt>
<garnt> for playing this game. </garnt>
<garnt> I need a reward for playing this game. </garnt>
<garnt> Unlike you. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't the X-Box </garnt>
<connor> I don't jack off to Xbox achievements, either terrible. </connor>
<garnt> Most of the time, it has to be story most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I play games. </garnt>
<garnt> If I have a gameplay loop, you can have the best </garnt>
<garnt> gameplay loop of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> If there's no motivation for me to play it, then I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> going to not play most games that don't have a story. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's like, what's the why, why am I playing this? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. There's there are so many games that I agree have </garnt>
<connor> I can totally agree with that </connor>
<connor> but why is that porn in it? </connor>
<garnt> Because that's the rewards you get for playing </garnt>
<garnt> The game because I'm sorry you find feeling a little horny. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes I just can't imagine holding the yet </garnt>
<connor> Xbox controller and then just put it down </connor>
<connor> get the tissue box out like what? </connor>
<connor> Say for example, like a game, like </connor>
<connor> for example, degeneracy should not be reached </connor>
<garnt> Well at first I gave him like dead cells, which I heard </garnt>
<garnt> which I, which I played and I played it for what </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought this was a really good game. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I got bored for five minutes because I was like </garnt>
<garnt> why am I playing this game? </garnt>
<connor> There's no motivation for you to actually play </connor>
<connor> through levels. </connor>
<connor> It's nice gameplay loop. </connor>
<connor> Same with something like Celeste. </connor>
<connor> That's amazing game. </connor>
<connor> This is an amazing game. </connor>
<connor> I went through one level when I got bored </connor>
<connor> because I really couldn't care about the story, man. </connor>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<connor> That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> If it had a reward </connor>
<connor> for me to complete the level that I would inflate </connor>
<garnt> through it, then there needs to be some kind of work. </garnt>
<garnt> So what Guk is saying, is that Celeste would've been </garnt>
<garnt> And what's the last, would it be? </garnt>
<garnt> every time. </garnt>
<garnt> If, every time, like if every time I completed a level </garnt>
<garnt> of Celeste, there was a Hentai scene </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> You literally just went </connor>
<connor> Like, Guk wants to S to have like a beat a level. </connor>
<garnt> And then the porn hub music starts playing. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what Guk wants. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. That's I want that. </garnt>
<connor> Imagine guys are too comfortable jacking off. </connor>
<connor> Imagine that imagine an Sero gay with something </connor>
<connor> on the gameplay level of dead cells or Celeste </connor>
<connor> or something along those lines, masterpiece, masterpiece. </connor>
<connor> I'm just imagining that right now. </connor>
<garnt> That would be, that would be a mask. </garnt>
<garnt> That will be amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Because like, you know, every time you finish a level </garnt>
<garnt> of Celeste you have such light. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. Like moments, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> I, I went through that. </garnt>
<garnt> I died hundreds and hundreds of times. </garnt>
<garnt> And now here is my reward. </garnt>
<garnt> Hell yes? </garnt>
<garnt> That is going to be the best jack off you'll ever have. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. To, to not saying, make Celeste porn. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not saying that's what I'm saying. </garnt>
<garnt> For example, we don't want to lude the character. </garnt>
<garnt> That's not, we're talking about, we're talking about </garnt>
<garnt> if we had a gameplay loop </garnt>
<garnt> of something like Celeste or something on that level. </garnt>
<connor> And then we had, we had it hen side, my God </connor>
<connor> that is improving upon perfection. </connor>
<connor> You people have not </connor>
<garnt> how has noon crowdfund the now I'm making these </garnt>
<garnt> I amazed all the. </garnt>
<garnt> I am going to fund some money. </garnt>
<garnt> Gimme Some money </garnt>
<connor> I'll make it happen. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking animals like you have the reason why we have </connor>
<connor> like Minecraft sex scenes. </connor>
<garnt> Like this is the prop you guys would want to </garnt>
<garnt> put porn and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, have you seen the Minecraft porn on YouTube? </garnt>
<garnt> It's so fucking awful. </garnt>
<connor> Some of us kind of like finishes at level in mind. </connor>
<joey> That's not even a levels in mind. </joey>
<joey> Jerry finishes getting some diamonds in Minecraft </joey>
<joey> just swapped over </joey>
<connor> to the next tab and start playing Minecraft. </connor>
<garnt> Do you know how hard it is to get diamonds in Minecraft? </garnt>
<garnt> That's like a great achievement. </garnt>
<connor> I can say that publicly </connor>
<garnt> because I know I'm not the only one who genuinely thinks </garnt>
<connor> that the fact that Minecraft won't even exists means </connor>
<connor> that I am not. </connor>
<connor> You're saying you like Minecraft porn. </connor>
<connor> No, I'm not have a problem with it. </connor>
<connor> No, I mean, I don't care what this is. </connor>
<connor> It's like a kid's game though. </connor>
<garnt> I've this, this podcast has been a weird one. </garnt>
<garnt> I just think it's sad, right? </garnt>
<connor> That there are kids out there who legitimately like </connor>
<connor> are curious about porn. </connor>
<connor> And the first thing they think is my two </connor>
<garnt> loves Stephen Minecraft. </garnt>
<garnt> I would like to see if they did that to him. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's only kids watching these things. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? Cause no adult can to Steve. </garnt>
<garnt> Steve blocks something. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, no joke. </garnt>
<connor> I'm not saying I am, but I think, I think you </connor>
<garnt> underestimate some like adults willpower. </garnt>
<garnt> I've okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I have jacked off to Minecraft. </garnt>
<garnt> No, no. </garnt>
<connor> I've this is the first I've ever heard of Minecraft porn </connor>
<joey> on this. </joey>
<connor> You've never seen it. </connor>
<joey> Never seen it. </joey>
<garnt> Describe it to me please. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we just kind of have to show you this. </garnt>
<garnt> You need to describe it to me </garnt>
<connor> In like four or five years ago </connor>
<garnt> wishing been made the video about it </garnt>
<garnt> but there was actually like so much like full </garnt>
<connor> on traditional porno I've made in Minecraft. </connor>
<garnt> When, when you first mentioned it, I thought, okay </garnt>
<connor> we're just being sarcastic. </connor>
<connor> I know. </connor>
<garnt> There's like a, what's his name? </garnt>
<garnt> Captain sparkles. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? The one who was like Minecraft animations. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Basically imagine that. </garnt>
<garnt> But they would literally be </garnt>
<garnt> like a porno situation where it was like </garnt>
<connor> someone would be like, Oh no, it's like a, high-quality </connor>
<garnt> like Minecraft I saw one that was like, Steve, like </garnt>
<garnt> like Steve, like a creeper or something or something. </garnt>
<connor> And the creeper is like. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. This is legit. </connor>
<garnt> This is actually, we will show you. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the path. </garnt>
<garnt> If you don't hold back, right. </garnt>
<garnt> If you let your creative juices run wild </garnt>
<garnt> on projects like Joey wants to do </garnt>
<joey> with all of this, this is what happens. </joey>
<joey> And we don't need this. </joey>
<joey> We don't need this. </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> We don't need it. </connor>
<garnt> That's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? People want it? </garnt>
<connor> No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't matter what people want people to have to sell </connor>
<garnt> People don't deserve what they want. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it's worth, I don't know if it's worse. </garnt>
<garnt> What I just imagined in my mind from you describing it </garnt>
<garnt> or actually watching the actual thing </garnt>
<garnt> we'll show you afterwards. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know, maybe just we can add a clip </garnt>
<garnt> of like got reacting to when we're done with the episode </garnt>
<garnt> we'll leave the cameras rolling. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like this is a post, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's literally like, it can only be kids watching it. </connor>
<connor> Right. It's so disturbing </connor>
<garnt> That it's just funny. </garnt>
<connor> Well, I mean, it's </connor>
<garnt> Funny to us, but obviously I'm sure. </garnt>
<connor> I'm sure the on the kid watching is pretty much </connor>
<garnt> every reached that age. </garnt>
<garnt> Is this what our parents felt when they walked in and saw us </garnt>
<garnt> like jacking and elf to animated he's how is this how </garnt>
<garnt> they felt now? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I'll never forget the look. </garnt>
<garnt> My parents gave me. </garnt>
<connor> Whoa. You've never had like your parents like walking </connor>
<connor> on you jacking off. </connor>
<garnt> No, I've hit it very well. </garnt>
<connor> If they have really, again, I remember that was my stairs. </connor>
<garnt> Would Creek I had a warning. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's right. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Your parents walked in on you with my dad walked in </garnt>
<garnt> on me once. </garnt>
<garnt> How big was the screen? </garnt>
<connor> I was like this tiny meant jacking off on like a game boy SP </connor>
<garnt> Like my old, like desktop computer with like </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think it was like a 16 inch or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> I had a black and white TV. </connor>
<garnt> Oh really? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> The black and white. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a hand me down and it can fly like via. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. It's awful. </connor>
<garnt> So I couldn't couldn't put porn in it. </garnt>
<garnt> All right. </garnt>
<joey> Well, I can't believe I'm about to tell this story. </joey>
<joey> Oh God. </joey>
<joey> I don't even remember how old I was. </joey>
<joey> It was easy. </joey>
<joey> It was, it was, I remember, I don't remember exactly </joey>
<joey> how old it was, but it was around that age as a teenager. </joey>
<garnt> When you first discovered porn, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, way between like. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, 13 to 15, something like that. </joey>
<joey> Maybe even early for some people. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> But I remember a lot. </joey>
<joey> It was, I think it was legitimately the first time </joey>
<garnt> I watched like a hentai on my computer and </garnt>
<connor> Straight to hentai even watch it. </connor>
<connor> This was like, this is like </connor>
<connor> not long after I discovered porn. </connor>
<connor> He quickly </connor>
<connor> Got down that rabbit hole. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, no like that, that first time I </connor>
<joey> but the first time with hentai was a different story </joey>
<joey> And I was in my room and like, my room has like </joey>
<joey> had a lock on it. </joey>
<joey> So I thought I locked the door. </joey>
<garnt> Oh, Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> And my thought. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, I remember as well, we hentai it was </garnt>
<joey> it was a comedy show, Collegeville, Kalamazoo. </joey>
<joey> Oh, classic classic. </joey>
<joey> Right. It's like next to bible black classic. </joey>
<joey> Right. And, and yeah. </joey>
<garnt> So I was like, Oh, something has arosen in me. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> right. My, my little joke </garnt>
<garnt> Has woken up. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. So I was like, let's give it a go. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I did it and then I hear like a, a clock. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> The door opening. </connor>
<connor> And I had looked around and </connor>
<connor> Standing there. </connor>
<connor> He's pretty, he's pretty proud of you there. </connor>
<connor> No, no. </connor>
<connor> Oh. He looked at me and he looked at what was </connor>
<joey> on my screen and he looked at me again and he just said </joey>
<joey> Really, mate? </joey>
<connor> - Your dad seems like the most Australian man alive. </connor>
<garnt> He just said, I remember exactly what he said. </garnt>
<joey> He's like really mate couldn't have been regular porn? </joey>
<joey> He was like </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't be, I wouldn't even be disappointed with you </joey>
<joey> if it was just regular porn. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I mean, I've, I've been past that point. </joey>
<garnt> I was kind of experimenting. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, all right, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I dunno what I dunno. </garnt>
<connor> I have already gotten bored of regular porn. </connor>
<connor> I'm seeking new adventures. </connor>
<garnt> I could, I could legitimately see the very moment </garnt>
<connor> Where the disappointment came. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's like, it's like a certain look </connor>
<connor> in my dad's eyes where it kinda went from like, Whoa </connor>
<garnt> what are you doing to, oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, he's into that. </garnt>
<garnt> He's into that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Huh? Oh yes, father. </garnt>
<garnt> I am into that. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you winning son? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> He wasted his days. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I talk about it for a job. </garnt>
<connor> So yeah. </connor>
<connor> I hope you're proud of me dad. </connor>
<connor> - That felt so desperate. </connor>
<garnt> - Please love me please. </garnt>
<connor> I'm winning now. </connor>
<garnt> I'm finally winning dad. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just that that moment is carved into you. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, you're like the son who just looks </garnt>
<garnt> for your dad's approval. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't have a lot of like distinct memories </garnt>
<garnt> during my childhood, but that was definitely </garnt>
<garnt> one that will like forever stick with me. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I, it, it's kind of just implanted itself into the back </garnt>
<garnt> of my brain now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never been caught, jacking off at all because </garnt>
<garnt> to me it's like, if, if I do this, a checklist happens. </garnt>
<connor> - I think 100 for me, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's it's </garnt>
<garnt> It's, it's the same- </garnt>
<garnt> - When my snake, unfortunately, </garnt>
<garnt> - It's it's the same way, when you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you leave the house and you have your okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Pat keys, wallet, phone, same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> When, when you do the same thing, same thing, you know </garnt>
<garnt> you do, you do the deed and you just like head door locks </garnt>
<garnt> headphones on or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> Make sure nobody's in the house or nobody can hear. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you start. </garnt>
<garnt> - With the lock on my door. </garnt>
<garnt> I got a little too overconfident. So I'm like, yeah, this is </garnt>
<garnt> This is full proof isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> And then I just, I guess I just forgot, you know </garnt>
<garnt> what it felt like, it felt like, you know, when </garnt>
<garnt> you're playing Pokemon </garnt>
<joey> and you like go into a cave and you put repel on </joey>
<joey> And it runs out just before, you're </joey>
<joey> about to leave the cave and you get into an encounter. </joey>
<joey> That's what it felt like. </joey>
<joey> I was like shit, I wasn't that close, but I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Like I've, like I said. </joey>
<joey> I thought getting walked in on, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is like a common thing. </joey>
<joey> Cause you see it so much on the internet. </joey>
<garnt> Right? It's like, I go in like, what do I do? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, that kind of stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> So have you ever walked in on anyone or been walked in on? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. Maybe I have, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like these are like buried memories. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah. That's pretty a good chance. </joey>
<joey> I've pretty walked down. </joey>
<garnt> I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been to parties and seen shit </garnt>
<garnt> but like people to don't care, but just like </garnt>
<garnt> like a private time, you know? </garnt>
<connor> No, I don't think I have actually no. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I, I th I think I've never walked in on someone </garnt>
<joey> but the closest I've come is it was union university. </joey>
<joey> You know, it was visiting a mate and it was </joey>
<joey> like a group house. </joey>
<joey> So like two or three of them mates are there </joey>
<joey> and we were getting ready for the night out. </joey>
<joey> So I was just like saying hello to everyone. </joey>
<joey> And then I knocked on this. </joey>
<joey> I knock on one of my mates door and I, you know </joey>
<joey> that panic scramble hear? (laughing) </joey>
<joey> You can hear so there's doors locked. </joey>
<joey> Right. But I knock on the door and all I heard was </joey>
<joey> Honestly, that's all I heard was. </joey>
<joey> (scrambling noise) </joey>
<joey> And then he opens the door </joey>
<joey> and the laptop, which is opposites </joey>
<joey> like where the door is, is conveniently closed. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, Oh, you're just doing. </joey>
<joey> And he was like, nothing. </joey>
<joey> I was just, just working on my presentation, you know </joey>
<joey> But I've never actually walked in on anyone </joey>
<garnt> but I feel like it's more common </garnt>
<joey> in America because in university there </joey>
<joey> if you share a room that's, this is what I can imagine. </joey>
<connor> Weird to me. </connor>
<connor> This is why I can't imagine having a roommate </connor>
<connor> because how would you, how'd you schedule that? </connor>
<garnt> Do do anyone in America. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you ask me, do you have </garnt>
<garnt> do you actually have to schedule your sessions? </garnt>
<garnt> Because when do you have to be like, where are you going? </garnt>
<garnt> How long will you be out what time are you coming back? </garnt>
<garnt> Urban legend. </garnt>
<garnt> Where do you tell each other? </garnt>
<garnt> Where do you like to do you like </garnt>
<connor> have like a calendar where you schedule it? </connor>
<connor> Okay guys. </connor>
<connor> Okay. So this time is my time. </connor>
<connor> There's going to be a sock on the door. </connor>
<connor> That's how you know. </connor>
<garnt> And if the sock is on the door, then it is like code red. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't come in. </garnt>
<garnt> Never disturbing during </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, like, I guess like </garnt>
<connor> I want to ask you guys is like, I mean, we </connor>
<connor> none of us have children. </connor>
<connor> Right. But like, hypothetically </connor>
<connor> say it like bright. </connor>
<connor> Right, right, right, right up </connor>
<connor> Hypothetically. Right. </connor>
<joey> Like if you ever like, get a kid, for example </joey>
<joey> and you become the role of the parent </joey>
<joey> and then you walked in on your kid doing that, like </joey>
<connor> how would you guys, like, what would you say, join it after? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> This is not, it's not really to have a conversation there. </connor>
<garnt> You're like, sit down son. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, Whoa, but I'm sure some parents have, right. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what is even like as a parent </garnt>
<connor> what's the correct answer. </connor>
<garnt> Ah, I'm going to tell him not to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> Really. It really, because they're going to do it anyway </garnt>
<garnt> but you don't encourage them and be like </garnt>
<connor> watch as much porn as you want son. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like my dad said that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<connor> - Something similar. </connor>
<connor> He's just like, because like I specifically </connor>
<connor> remember you can get addicted to porn. </connor>
<joey> Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> I remember my dad wasn't so much like disappointed </joey>
<garnt> in the fact that I was like jacking off it. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. That was the Hentai </garnt>
<garnt> It was the hentai </garnt>
<connor> He was like, I don't care that you're jacking off. </connor>
<connor> Like if you have a penis </connor>
<connor> and you're an adult, that's normal. </connor>
<connor> Right. So whatever you were eventually going to get </connor>
<garnt> to this point </garnt>
<garnt> it could have been anything else you were jacking off to. </garnt>
<garnt> I probably, you just walk out. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the next time I see like my child </garnt>
<garnt> I probably just be like, we can just forget about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Because I, I feel like the more you talk about it </garnt>
<joey> the more you put lights on it </joey>
<joey> the worst that they're going to feel. </joey>
<garnt> Well, just, just make it as, make it as casual </garnt>
<garnt> as possible to be like, how many parents, you know </garnt>
<garnt> end up doing like this, sit down, son. </garnt>
<connor> Let's have a talk. </connor>
<connor> I feel that's the worst answer. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Cause like, I feel like there's nothing more. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I never got the talk from my parents, but I feel </connor>
<garnt> if I ever was in that position, I'd be like. </garnt>
<garnt> Did you ever ask your parents where babies came from? </garnt>
<garnt> You gave me some answer. </garnt>
<garnt> I still remember. </garnt>
<garnt> I still remember the answer my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. So I thought that was literally what she </garnt>
<garnt> said was babies came out of the belly button. </garnt>
<joey> Right. And thinking about this as an adult, I think I'm </joey>
<joey> that's permanently scarred me </joey>
<joey> because when I see a belly button now </joey>
<joey> cause as a kid, as a kid, I had this disgusting thoughts </joey>
<garnt> of oh babies crawl out there. </garnt>
<garnt> And now as a fully grown adult, I still see belly button. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, Oh </garnt>
<garnt> all I all I can think seen an ACE Ventura </garnt>
<garnt> You know, when he's coming </garnt>
<garnt> out of the Lake rhino, that's all I can imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like some alien shoes </garnt>
<garnt> like looking back I'd rather than my mom. </garnt>
<garnt> How just tell me graphically where babies came </garnt>
<garnt> from. Well, as, as opposed </garnt>
<garnt> to just telling me yeah, they, the belly button. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the first time, like there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's two moments that have scarred me fluff. </garnt>
<garnt> One was that. </garnt>
<garnt> And the second time was the first time I saw the matrix </garnt>
<garnt> where? Yeah, the matrix cause scene. </garnt>
<connor> There's a scene where, how have you guys seen the matrix? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I can't imagine the scene. </connor>
<connor> So there's same thing. </connor>
<connor> I know. </connor>
<connor> Which one is it about? </connor>
<joey> Yeah, that there's a scene where the agents pin Neo </joey>
<connor> down and then like a spidery shrimp, like emergent </connor>
<connor> crawls up his belly button and that me </connor>
<joey> up so badly because I'm just like it. </joey>
<joey> Okay. I reinforced that it was possible </joey>
<joey> for things to go in or out of the belly button. </joey>
<garnt> So I'm just like protect this at all costs. </garnt>
<connor> my vital point. </connor>
<garnt> I thought he was like some alien burst </garnt>
<garnt> our share where she's like, you know </garnt>
<joey> I had a similar thing with him, with the mummy, you know </joey>
<joey> when like the beetle is rolling. </joey>
<garnt> That was the first time I like physically was like </garnt>
<connor> I'm sorry. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like, yeah, that matrix thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I blocked out my mind because I remember being </garnt>
<garnt> I remember watching that like a ten-year-old </garnt>
<joey> and being disgusted. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. God, it was awful. </joey>
<connor> But yeah. </connor>
<joey> I mean that's a tangent right from porn </joey>
<connor> I don't know if I'm my kids or my kid do it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I'd probably be like, well, did you do it efficiently? </connor>
<garnt> Did you mean max and son? </garnt>
<connor> How much time did you spend it? </connor>
<connor> But that 30 minutes you're in that full that's way too long. </connor>
<joey> You cannot get in the habit of doing that son. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Cause like when you see the like people talking about like </joey>
<garnt> I legit would worry if my kid got like addicted to porn. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh it was like </garnt>
<joey> you hear about the adults who get addicted to porn. </joey>
<joey> Like Terry crews was addicted to porn. </joey>
<joey> Right? Was he? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, he was addicted to porn I think. </joey>
<garnt> And there was generally like I sent you the link. </garnt>
<garnt> So I, I was on YouTube and there's just a video </garnt>
<garnt> something called, like coming clean or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Remember it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just this guy who was just like, no one </garnt>
<garnt> no one had exposed him on YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> No one had said anything. </garnt>
<garnt> He just came out with it. </garnt>
<garnt> He was just like, I'm addicted to porn guys. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going broke because he's like, Oh you had a few million. </garnt>
<garnt> And he just like </garnt>
<garnt> Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I do remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> He was that guy who was in like a happy relationship. </garnt>
<connor> He wasn't married. </connor>
<connor> Wasn't me happily married. </connor>
<connor> And </connor>
<garnt> He wasn't, he wasn't like a </garnt>
<connor> it was like a buff really good-looking dude. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. I remember. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was just like, yes. </garnt>
<connor> So like I'm just like horribly addicted to porn. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. He just spent his money </garnt>
<garnt> on chatter Bay so bad for the dude. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, you know </connor>
<garnt> had this like come out any other way. </garnt>
<connor> People probably would've mocked him, but he, you know </connor>
<garnt> he spoke about it himself </garnt>
<garnt> and you kind of felt like really bad for the dude. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, I can't, I can't sympathize </garnt>
<garnt> per se because I would not sympathize. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't ex you know, experience that myself. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, I was like, dude, I would never want that </garnt>
<garnt> on like my kid or something to be like </garnt>
<garnt> cripplingly addicted to like virtual video porn. </garnt>
<joey> Right. Whatever. </joey>
<connor> I don't, I feel so bad about that. </connor>
<connor> I think it especially hurts considering the fact </connor>
<connor> that like he's going broke. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. And luckily the guy like </connor>
<joey> the video is really good. </joey>
<joey> I recommend watching it. </joey>
<joey> Like just to like, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> And him and his wife was like understanding of it. </joey>
<joey> And w she helped like walk him through it. </joey>
<connor> I still was really sweet </connor>
<connor> and I hope the guy's doing better now. </connor>
<connor> I've, I've no idea. </connor>
<connor> I didn't watch any of the videos, but like </connor>
<garnt> how'd you even get to a point when you rise? </garnt>
<connor> Like what, what, what is </connor>
<connor> what is the line where you realized, what, what is </connor>
<connor> what is a porn addiction? </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<garnt> It's, is it how snap it's going to kill me for that joke? </garnt>
<connor> It's like, is it to the point where it's like </connor>
<garnt> you're spending so much money that it's </garnt>
<garnt> like putting a dent on your car to spend money on porn? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. You off. </garnt>
<garnt> I can handle the hot seat. </garnt>
<joey> I've never spent any money on porn </joey>
<joey> I feel that is like a big line to cross where </joey>
<joey> you're comfortable getting your credit card out to </joey>
<joey> to put in. </joey>
<joey> Right. That's like just a lie. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to cross. </joey>
<joey> And I'd be really sad </joey>
<connor> in my son or my daughter, if they were like </connor>
<connor> you've got a premium process subscription. </connor>
<connor> I'm like </connor>
<garnt> why? Why? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I don't know what it's like to me spending money on </garnt>
<garnt> like Kensai games or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I completely understandable. </garnt>
<garnt> As soon as you spend money on like, I guess real life porn </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason that just flips a switch me to be like, how </garnt>
<garnt> why? I think it's because </garnt>
<garnt> Like, unlike arrogation like hand-eye and stuff like that </garnt>
<garnt> there was so many options to get the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> That's for free. </garnt>
<garnt> That's it? </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Because I've, I'm guessing none </garnt>
<garnt> of us have ever actually bought a hint. </garnt>
<garnt> I DVD or hint. </garnt>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<garnt> Oh, wow. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, I did. </garnt>
<garnt> I did. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I bought the classic. </garnt>
<garnt> I bought mother knows breasts. </garnt>
<joey> Did you actually, I actually bought it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I bought a physical copy </joey>
<joey> because obviously the podcast. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I, it hasn't arrived yet. </joey>
<joey> I bought it because I was like </joey>
<joey> I noticed that the, that who's selling it. </joey>
<joey> They eventually, delist the older ones. </joey>
<garnt> And I thought, well, I've got to get a copy </garnt>
<garnt> of mother's breast just in case it goes into that. </garnt>
<garnt> That doesn't count </garnt>
<garnt> because you've already seen him to it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's going to be pristine. </garnt>
<garnt> You bought that for me. </garnt>
<connor> I bought it to preserve </connor>
<connor> this is the you're going to frame. </connor>
<garnt> And you're going to begin to show your kids and be like </garnt>
<connor> kids cost me $50. </connor>
<connor> Well, that's understandable. </connor>
<connor> Right? Like, no </connor>
<garnt> one's going to frame their Brazos subscription </garnt>
<garnt> on a wall. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. So it's like, when you mean </garnt>
<connor> there are people out there </connor>
<connor> But because it's like, you know, you hear </connor>
<connor> about those, you know, that'd be like politician scandals </connor>
<connor> and they'd be like, he spent $40,000 on porn. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I even know how you would do that. </connor>
<garnt> Or you start to spend that much money on porn? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know how you go about how would you, like </garnt>
<garnt> what I want to know is how would you not have enough sources </garnt>
<garnt> of porn that you need to spend money on? </garnt>
<garnt> I think a lot of people want like specific porn, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like, I think again, like this is where a lot </connor>
<garnt> of like independent craziest company. </garnt>
<connor> No, no. </connor>
<garnt> That's, that's totally the reason why </garnt>
<connor> only fans this thing, because I feel like </connor>
<connor> No pay $20 for something I a dude. </connor>
<garnt> Right? Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, like for me </garnt>
<connor> for me, like, I can't, I can understand why </connor>
<connor> people would want to support independent creators. </connor>
<connor> Like for example, only fans or something </connor>
<connor> because you know, you, there </connor>
<connor> there is that parasocial relationship in there. </connor>
<garnt> And I can totally understand why people would want to </garnt>
<garnt> spend money on that. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand like browser subscriptions </garnt>
<garnt> or just like when there is no parasite </garnt>
<connor> there is no parasocial relationship. </connor>
<garnt> I would almost argue that only fans </garnt>
<garnt> and all those parasocial relationships are way worse </garnt>
<garnt> off than getting a break. </garnt>
<garnt> I totally agree with you. </garnt>
<garnt> It is a dangerous </garnt>
<joey> I don't even like dislike anything about it. </joey>
<joey> I just feel sad. </joey>
<joey> But I look at it all. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I just feel sorry for everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I mean, other than the creators </garnt>
<garnt> are making bank, right. </garnt>
<joey> Good for them. </joey>
<joey> Like totally understandable. </joey>
<joey> The grind you do what you gotta do, but like </joey>
<joey> what do you look at some of these guys and you </joey>
<joey> see what some of them say online? </joey>
<garnt> Like, you just feel sad for them. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> This isn't to demerit any like, Oh </connor>
<connor> I don't work as, or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> This is a lot of the, they make is awesome. </connor>
<garnt> And a lot of them put a lot of work into it. </garnt>
<connor> Like I just feel dangerous </connor>
<garnt> Line that I don't want to cross. </garnt>
<connor> I don't want to go into that. </connor>
<connor> Cause if you, if you pay for </connor>
<connor> One, I feel like you'll do it again. </connor>
<garnt> I'll probably buy another one. </garnt>
<garnt> I know some really good ones </garnt>
<connor> and it's dangerous for the creator as well, because </connor>
<connor> Then you get, you know, some </connor>
<garnt> of these supporters who get a little too comfortable </garnt>
<garnt> with it and try and start crossing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I can't imagine </garnt>
<garnt> I can't imagine what they have to deal with on the day. </garnt>
<garnt> Huge, huge respect to them every time </garnt>
<garnt> Like creepy dude, you know, thinking that just </garnt>
<garnt> because they paid like a grandiose amount of money </garnt>
<garnt> to this creator that suddenly they're like best friends </garnt>
<garnt> you know, when that's just not how it works. </garnt>
<garnt> A few of them on Twitter </garnt>
<connor> this is pretty good to see like, Oh God cut. </connor>
<garnt> What do you see? </garnt>
<garnt> I like just seeing what they get </garnt>
<garnt> up to is like it, I mean, it's sad. </garnt>
<garnt> Some of the they got to deal with just to like </garnt>
<garnt> you got to like fight just to take </garnt>
<connor> to have people take you serious. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, because the thing is, I would like to think </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's end goal for watching porn is like, you know </garnt>
<connor> an offset for being able to go </connor>
<connor> into like a happy relationship where you just </connor>
<connor> feel satisfied and, and like happy with banjo life. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, you stop wanting to be horny </connor>
<connor> and you just be happy. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Saying Brandon horny happy. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like if you go out and pay for porn </connor>
<garnt> you're crossing a dangerous line where I've no return. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Not, not that you can't return from it, but you're </garnt>
<garnt> you're getting comfort. </garnt>
<connor> It may not be dangerous. </connor>
<connor> I'm just perceive it to myself. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. That's I mean that this is, this is sounds dangerous. </garnt>
<connor> Everyone has </connor>
<connor> Brian has a different line. </connor>
<connor> This is my line as well. </connor>
<connor> Where if I go out and cross this line </connor>
<connor> it's the line that I'm not comfortable </connor>
<connor> with myself being about. </connor>
<connor> And you know, some people are comfortable </connor>
<connor> and I'm sure there's healthy people out there who </connor>
<connor> You know, have I'm sure </connor>
<connor> The thing was the addiction thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Like it's like 95, 95% of people are totally capable </connor>
<joey> of self-regulating and not over-consuming things </joey>
<joey> but there's a good amount of people out there </joey>
<joey> where they find that one thing that just breaks them </joey>
<garnt> and they just can't stop. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Like it's just what it is. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it's just, we go back to the point </connor>
<connor> of how would you recognize what, what point is too far? </connor>
<connor> Is it when your life is being actively ruined </connor>
<garnt> or when you just can't find a happy relationship? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. Which is like, again </connor>
<connor> why like going back to that video, like massive props </connor>
<connor> to the dude for being able to like stop himself </connor>
<garnt> and be like, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> This is getting out of hand. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And honestly, like I, to me </garnt>
<garnt> I was just amazed </garnt>
<garnt> that he was willing to talk about that publicly. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, to me, I was like, that's like </garnt>
<connor> that's like pretty big balls to come </connor>
<connor> out and be like, listen guys, I'm addicted </connor>
<connor> to porn knowing that people are going to meme you. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But in, in reality, yeah. </connor>
<connor> There's probably a lot of people going through that. </connor>
<connor> And I have massive respect for the guy for coming </connor>
<garnt> out. And I think I remember as </garnt>
<garnt> Well, like from what I saw hardly </garnt>
<connor> Any meaning at all, the comments were really positive. </connor>
<connor> Again, like w when the stuff is sensitive </connor>
<garnt> people don't want to talk about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause they mean it. </garnt>
<connor> But it's really important to have people come </connor>
<garnt> out and be like, listen, this is a real thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, it's me </garnt>
<connor> over. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's the exact same thing with </connor>
<garnt> for example, Gacha addiction, you know, we </garnt>
<garnt> we can meme the out of it. </garnt>
<garnt> But if someone has an issue, you should take it seriously. </garnt>
<garnt> And you shouldn't just think </garnt>
<garnt> that people are going to mock you </garnt>
<garnt> and meme the out of you. </garnt>
<garnt> Some people with addiction to anything is never good. </garnt>
<garnt> Some people will </garnt>
<garnt> but the good people out there will actually understand that. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you can have an embarrassing problem. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes. Sometimes it's hard to tell when </garnt>
<garnt> you've gone too far </garnt>
<connor> Joey plays era games. </connor>
<garnt> You know, I feel sorry for him. </garnt>
<garnt> You know </garnt>
<garnt> You play leagues </garnt>
