<garnt> - How do we podcast again? </garnt>
<joey> - It feels so weird doing this somewhere else. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just, I don't feel comfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> (gentle music) </garnt>
<joey> - Hey, guys, welcome to another Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> episode. (Connor burps) </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, sorry. Can you do that? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Startin' things off good, I see. </garnt>
<joey> - Sorry, sorry, I had to burp. </joey>
<joey> - If you couldn't tell, we're in a different location. </joey>
<connor> In fact, we're on the road right now. </connor>
<connor> We're in the beautiful city of London. </connor>
<garnt> - I thought you were gonna say </garnt>
<garnt> the beautiful city of England. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the beautiful city of the United Kingdom. </joey>
<garnt> - England is my city. - England is my city. </garnt>
<joey> - England is my city. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And no, I'm not from Compton. (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> - Hopefully, it looks good. </connor>
<joey> So, we brought our cameras. We are using different mics. </joey>
<joey> So hopefully, it won't be too different </joey>
<joey> of a Trash Taste experience. </joey>
<joey> And it should be like this for like two or three episodes. </joey>
<joey> So if you like the old setup, or you like a different setup, </joey>
<connor> we'll mix it up. </connor>
<connor> We'll mix it up, so don't worry. </connor>
<garnt> - We're gonna have a few weeks here. </garnt>
<garnt> We're gonna film a few episodes here. </garnt>
<garnt> Then we're gonna change places again. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we are on the road right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - This is a very like gorilla kind of setup. </joey>
<joey> We kind of brought </joey>
<joey> all of our equipment from- (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It is Janken's behind fault </joey>
<garnt> behind this camera there. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I walked in this room, and I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> "This is like making me feel nostalgic." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like the old studio. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like the old studio. </joey>
<joey> There's like the trip hazards are back. </joey>
<garnt> Like there's wires everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> But hopefully, we're making it work. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But hey, welcome back. </joey>
<joey> This is, I guess, the proper like start to season three </joey>
<connor> of Trash Taste now. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, season three. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And by the time we were recording this, </garnt>
<joey> we had just finished MCM London. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, which I think by the time of releasing, </garnt>
<garnt> won't be too far after we went there, </garnt>
<connor> about two weeks, I think. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is it? Is that how- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, </connor>
<connor> round about two weeks. - Oh, I didn't know that. </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God. - Yeah, it would be two. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, "Where the fuck are we </garnt>
<joey> in my Trash Taste time?" (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I have no idea. I have no idea. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, it was my first MCM London. </garnt>
<garnt> Actually, this is only my second time in London, </garnt>
<joey> just in general. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So, MCM is a, I dunno what it stands for, but- </connor>
<connor> - It's Comic Con, basically. </connor>
<connor> - It's Comic Con. It's London Comic Con. </connor>
<connor> And it's like </connor>
<connor> the biggest UK convention. - Massive Comic Con, mate. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Massive Comic, mate. </garnt>
<joey> - Massive Comic, mate. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Massive Comic meetup. </connor>
<joey> - It's like an A1. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone has A1 comics. </garnt>
<connor> No, but I mean, yeah, it's good to be back there. </connor>
<garnt> We haven't gone in like three years. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, this is my first convention since 2019 AX. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it is for all of us. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, me too. </joey>
<joey> - So that was the last convention we all went to. </joey>
<joey> And I believe the last Comic Con, </joey>
<joey> or the last MCM I went to, was probably 2018, I think. </joey>
<connor> No, maybe even 2017 </connor>
<connor> because I went to MomoCon like one of the few years, </connor>
<connor> and it was the same weekend as MCM. </connor>
<connor> So it's been a very, very long time </connor>
<connor> since I've been to MCM. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Well, regardless, it was a very different experience </connor>
<garnt> this time. - Yeah, not only </garnt>
<joey> it was our first con in three years, </joey>
<garnt> but it was also our first con as "Trash Taste," </garnt>
<connor> so we had no idea what to expect, </connor>
<connor> and (laughs) a lot of shit happened, </connor>
<garnt> that's for sure. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, it kind of put things into perspective. </joey>
<joey> Just one, like how long it's been </joey>
<joey> since Trash Taste has started. </joey>
<joey> And two, how long it's been since the world has moved on </joey>
<joey> since Trash Taste has started. </joey>
<joey> Because I remember like, this is, </joey>
<joey> not anything to do with MCM, </joey>
<joey> but I remember like we met Kevin. </joey>
<joey> I met Kevin and his partner. </joey>
<joey> - Kevin Penkin, by the way. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Kevin Penkin, sorry. </joey>
<joey> So I should have (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - This is just Kevin, you know. </joey>
<joey> - It's just Kevin. </joey>
<joey> You know Kevin. - Our mate, Kevin. </joey>
<garnt> - You know the Kevin. </garnt>
<garnt> There's only one Kevin </garnt>
<garnt> in the world. - Garnt's the worst at this. </garnt>
<connor> Garnt just throws names out that mean nothing to people. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - So we met our friend, Bob. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you know Bob. - It's like, </connor>
<connor> Garnt either don't say anyone's name or just fully explain. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry, you met Kevin Penkin who has flown over here </garnt>
<garnt> to the UK as well. </garnt>
<joey> And I remember the first thing his partner says to me is, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, congratulations on everything, by the way." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Well, what are you talking about?" </joey>
<joey> And she's just like, "You guys have been killing it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like so proud of you guys." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, - Aw. </joey>
<joey> - "Wait, I haven't met you </joey>
<joey> since before Trash Taste started. </joey>
<garnt> That's so fuckin' surreal to me, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel like the last time I met Kevin </garnt>
<garnt> was just like a year or two ago. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Wait, the last time I met Kevin, </garnt>
<garnt> Trash Taste didn't exist." </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was nothing. - It feels like- </garnt>
<connor> we started it two months ago, </connor>
<garnt> but in reality, it's been too whole freakin' years. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like... </garnt>
<garnt> And that two years though, it's just gone like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and now like meeting people, </garnt>
<garnt> for like meeting friends who I count as like really, </garnt>
<joey> really close friends, </joey>
<garnt> and them congratulating me for starting Trash Taste </garnt>
<garnt> is like so fuckin' weird. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Startin' to congrats on starting Trash Taste, </garnt>
<garnt> what are we, like episode five or something? (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right. (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> "Hey, you guys got a long way to go to go still." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Meanwhile, we had just released 100 episodes this year. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It makes you realized how isolated you are in Japan. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause like, you know, - Yeah, definitely. </connor>
<connor> - we don't get to speak much English outside of our crew. </connor>
<connor> So it's so like, you know, it's like 10 of us, </connor>
<connor> and then, no one else. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then obviously here it's like, "Oh, your friends, </connor>
<connor> or there's, "Oh, their friend knows Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> but it's like our friends don't know, </connor>
<connor> outside of our group here, no one knows Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> 'cause they don't fuckin' watch English podcasts. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Suffering with success, </connor>
<connor> is that what we're titling this episode? </connor>
<connor> - Probably, yeah. - Yeah, probably. </connor>
<connor> - Suffering from success. - Fuckin' DJ comics. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh God. </connor>
<garnt> - Suffering from DJ comics. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but it was a first MCM for me. </garnt>
<connor> I'd only heard of MCM from these guys mostly. </connor>
<joey> And you know, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, it's like, what, the biggest con in the UK, probably? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe- </connor>
<garnt> - Definitely. - Probably by far. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's definitely the biggest. </garnt>
<garnt> It's definitely the biggest. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not the biggest con- - MCM London. </garnt>
<garnt> - in Europe, though, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. - No, that's Japan Con, </garnt>
<garnt> I believe. </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna guess. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, AnimeJapan. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, isn't it- </garnt>
<joey> - No, it's Games Con, isn't it, in Germany? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I was talking about anime conventions. </joey>
<connor> - Let's see whose bullshit is the best here. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it might be... </garnt>
<connor> I heard there's an anime- </connor>
<connor> - [Sound bite] Your fingerprint. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> I know there's a Japan expo in Paris that's gigantic. </connor>
<joey> - AnimeJapan. </joey>
<joey> - AnimeJapan, </joey>
<joey> something like that. - I thought it was Japan Expo. </joey>
<garnt> - Something with like- - Is it? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's got the fuckin' rotary of like Anime Expo/Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like mix and match, bro. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's one of them. I don't know which one it is. </connor>
<garnt> - Are we all talking about the same convention? </garnt>
<connor> - We're all talking- - I don't fuckin' know. </connor>
<connor> - about the same convention </connor>
<joey> because we don't remember what it's for. (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Japan Expo, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think now that you said Japan Expo, it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - It's huge, but I don't know anyone who's gone to it. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, that's 'cause British people, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> we're like, "France? Oh, God." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And then there's Games Con in Germany, </joey>
<connor> which is also huge. - I've been to Games Con. </connor>
<joey> Games Con is massive. </joey>
<joey> Like I remember I went to Games Con, and like I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, man, I kinda..." </joey>
<joey> This is when the Switch was about to come out. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember that Nintendo had a booth </joey>
<connor> to play Super Mario Odyssey for like 10 minutes. </connor>
<connor> And the line was like eight hours. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it was ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> There was a Japanese woman just standing outside </connor>
<joey> with like a thing that said, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, the wait time is like 600 minutes," or something. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> And people were like joining in this queue. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "You know, the thing closes before this is done. </connor>
<connor> What do you want? (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> What is this math? </connor>
<connor> But like, Games Con is like so big </connor>
<connor> that also I feel like you can't really do anything. </connor>
<connor> Like it gets to a point where it's almost, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's like this has reached a capacity </connor>
<joey> where I can no longer do anything. </joey>
<joey> I think I played like... </joey>
<joey> The only games you could actually get on </joey>
<joey> in a reasonable amount of time </joey>
<joey> were like the games that were destined </joey>
<joey> to fuckin' fail the moment they came out. </joey>
<joey> The games that nobody gave a fuck about. </joey>
<joey> - Is it kinda like E3 in a sense? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's E3, but for Europe. </connor>
<connor> But it's open to the public, I think, </connor>
<garnt> all days by one. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just like, it was insane. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't really wanna go back. </garnt>
<garnt> I think if I were to go back, </garnt>
<garnt> it would be under like a press pass or something </garnt>
<joey> where you can just be like, </joey>
<joey> "See, you losers, I'm going in line. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna go to the front." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's just like- </joey>
<joey> - Just cut the entire line, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm hype for like... </joey>
<joey> I was hype for Super Mario Odyssey, </joey>
<joey> but I'm not waiting over an hour hype, </joey>
<connor> like an hour was putting my personal limit. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think I'm like anything is worth me </garnt>
<connor> waiting an hour in terms of like games for me. </connor>
<connor> I can't think of a single game where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, okay, two-hour line, </connor>
<garnt> two-hour wait time for like a five-minute demo or something? </garnt>
<joey> Yo, let's go! Let's go!" </joey>
<joey> - I think the longest I ever waited </joey>
<garnt> was like an hour and a half, </garnt>
<garnt> hour and 40, at TGS to play Persona 5. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. Was it worth it? </garnt>
<garnt> - An hour and 40. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, but you know how long that game is, </joey>
<joey> So five minutes is not a lot of time. </joey>
<connor> So, you know, like- - Yeah, exactly. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - You can't do anything. - you can't get into it. </joey>
<joey> You can't sink your teeth into it, what's the point. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? - Not at all, not at all. </joey>
<connor> - Like you're just teasing. </connor>
<joey> - And it's like, I knew I was gonna buy it anyway. </joey>
<connor> So I was just like, at the end of the hour and 40, </connor>
<joey> I got to the front of the line, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Wow, that was </joey>
<joey> (motorcycle revving) </joey>
<joey> a bike? </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Definitely not as quite as our studio. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like I was waiting for like an hour and 30, </joey>
<joey> an hour and 40 minutes, </joey>
<joey> and then I got to the front of line, and I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Wow, I don't know if this was even worth it or not." </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) - Oh bro, </connor>
<connor> you know what I actually, a play game I played at Games Con </connor>
<connor> and there was like no line for? </connor>
<connor> This is before Cuphead came out, </connor>
<connor> and I was like so fuckin' hyped to play Cuphead, </connor>
<joey> and it was only like a 10-minute wait. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's awesome. - And I played Cuphead, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Fuck ya, this game is awesome. </joey>
<joey> I can't wait to buy it." - Hell ya. </joey>
<connor> - And it was good. It was good. </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, so we went to MCM. We were there for three days. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, I mean, Connor and I were there for three days. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor and I went there </garnt>
<joey> on a Saturday. - I was there for </joey>
<garnt> (clears throat) one day just because I had some things to do </garnt>
<connor> in and out here and there, </connor>
<connor> so I only wanted to commit to one day. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, how was your first UK con experience, Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, we'll get into details later, </joey>
<connor> but it was lot of ups and a lot of downs, that's for sure. </connor>
<connor> It was very much a roller coaster. </connor>
<joey> I mean like I expected British fans to be super chill, </joey>
<joey> and they were for the most part, </joey>
<connor> but of course, you know, at the same time, it's like, </connor>
<connor> this is our first con </connor>
<connor> as Trash Taste, right? - Trash Taste, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like, I knew that my fans, The Anime Man fans, </connor>
<connor> like British fans, would be like chill as they usually are. </connor>
<connor> - Are you blaming Trash Taste for this? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - I mean like, could you say that it was like 100% chill? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I think- </joey>
<joey> - It was, for the most part, </joey>
<garnt> 100% chill. - It was like, </garnt>
<joey> okay, so here's the thing, it was like 99.9% chill. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then, there were like those one or two people </joey>
<joey> that obviously really, really stood out, </joey>
<joey> and some of them even made waves. </joey>
<connor> You might have even seen some clips online </connor>
<connor> about some of the people we've had to deal with </connor>
<connor> over the weekend. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because it just like, </connor>
<connor> the intensity was just like way more intense than anything </connor>
<connor> that I've ever experienced in my life before. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like the same, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Me and Joey, we walked around on... </connor>
<connor> So it was a three-day con, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. </connor>
<connor> And they have this odd ticket system </connor>
<connor> that I've never seen any other con, </connor>
<connor> where like every single day they have a priority ticket, </connor>
<connor> which means you can come in from nine. </connor>
<connor> And then a general ticket, </connor>
<joey> which means you can come in from, I think, 11 or 12, </joey>
<joey> something like that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was really confused about that system. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't quite get it. It's just cheaper. </joey>
<joey> I don't really understand it. </joey>
<joey> But we walked around on like Friday at 10:00 AM </joey>
<joey> before everyone got in. </joey>
<joey> And like, we could walk around, it's pretty chill. </joey>
<joey> We got stopped a lot. - We got stopped. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, we got stopped every now and then. </joey>
<connor> - But like, we could still walk, like we went </connor>
<connor> to get around. - But like, you went Friday, </connor>
<garnt> 10:00 AM, which is literally </garnt>
<connor> the deadest time- - the deadest time, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - of the entire week. - Yeah. (chuckling) </connor>
<joey> You're not gonna get a deader time </joey>
<garnt> than that time. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - So at least I got to actually like walk around </connor>
<connor> even for a little bit to actually see what the con was like </connor>
<connor> and all the other places, </connor>
<joey> 'cause it's freaking massive, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's really big. </joey>
<connor> It's just like 20 warehouses attached to each other. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - But, yeah, that was cool. </joey>
<garnt> But then, once the actual general admission </garnt>
<garnt> started to come in around like 11, 12 ish, </garnt>
<garnt> it got very heated very quickly. </garnt>
<garnt> It got very packed. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, what was your guys' expectation </garnt>
<garnt> going into this convention? </garnt>
<joey> - I was expecting like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, obviously more people are gonna know us now, </joey>
<garnt> not just for individual stuff, but for Trash Taste, </garnt>
<garnt> If anything, there's probably gonna be more people </garnt>
<garnt> who know us for Trash Taste, </garnt>
<joey> but I wasn't expecting it to be like 10 times as much. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean, I had some expectations, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously I expected to be more recognized </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that, now that I've shown my face more, </garnt>
<garnt> got an extra channel now </garnt>
<garnt> where you just talk shit with the boys, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But this was definitely like an eye-opening weekend for me </garnt>
<garnt> because we've speculated before </garnt>
<garnt> about what an anime convention is going to be like now </garnt>
<garnt> since Trash Taste has started. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think this weekend has definitely cemented </garnt>
<joey> that anime conventions will never be the same again for us. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, it was like a bittersweet realization </joey>
<joey> because I remember we were all... </joey>
<joey> It was a Saturday when we all realized this, I think. </joey>
<joey> And it was right after our panel. </joey>
<joey> So we had our first Trash Taste panel ever, ever! </joey>
<joey> And for the most part, I thought it was good, </joey>
<joey> but then there was some really, really standout things </joey>
<joey> that it's hard to forget </joey>
<joey> about our first Trash Taste experience. </joey>
<joey> - So if you've been living under a rock, </joey>
<joey> there's probably about 30 different perspectives </joey>
<joey> of some dude running up onto the stage </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> and 30 different perspectives of me </joey>
<joey> shitting my pants on stage. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, we weren't really like... </connor>
<connor> We didn't really prepare anything. That's kind of on us. </connor>
<joey> Like we could have prepared something, we didn't. </joey>
<connor> Just like, we were gonna do a Q&A. </connor>
<connor> We were just, "We'll just do-" </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, just keep it simple, like how we've always done. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause we we've always done panels </joey>
<joey> where it's just, "Okay, Q&A, easy." </joey>
<joey> We don't need to think too much about it, </joey>
<garnt> people are normally chill. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a Q&A, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "How rout up can fans get most of the times?" </garnt>
<connor> - But I mean, the thing is with the Q&A, </connor>
<connor> it's completely made </connor>
<garnt> by how good are the questions people ask. </garnt>
<joey> And I think it's just like roll of the dice sometimes </joey>
<joey> that some people just ask questions </joey>
<joey> that were either just like cringy or would ask questions </joey>
<connor> that didn't really actually make us talk about anything. </connor>
<connor> It was just kinda like, "What's your favorite anime?" </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "All right, is this okay or maybe not?" </connor>
<connor> - It was kind like, </connor>
<joey> there was also like a lot of like very loaded questions </joey>
<connor> where it's like, everyone knew the answer to it </connor>
<connor> before it was asked. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Why would you ask a question </connor>
<garnt> that everyone already knows the answer to?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I'd say, for the most part, we had good questions. </garnt>
<connor> - There was some good ones? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think like, okay, I'm gonna say this now. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna say this now, right? </connor>
<joey> If you ask Connor about his relationship status, just stop. </joey>
<joey> - You'll cringe, bro. </joey>
<joey> - It is cringe. </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna call out 'cause like when we see it on comments, </connor>
<connor> and I've read it, it's like... </connor>
<connor> Connor's commented on it in the past. </connor>
<connor> Like now, as a mate seeing it in real life on stage, </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, "Come on, guys." </joey>
<joey> - It's cringe, stop it. - Come on, please don't, </joey>
<connor> please don't. </connor>
<connor> - Stop. </connor>
<connor> - Thanks, boys. </connor>
<connor> Thanks, boys. Thanks, boys. - I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> It's just like- </connor>
<connor> - Don't hold me back! (Connor and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - I got this! I got you! (chuckles) </garnt>
<joey> - It's just a question that people always wanna know. </joey>
<joey> 'cause they're fuckin'- - Like I understand </joey>
<joey> the curiosity. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, people wanna know, and I get it. </joey>
<joey> My thing is like, alright, if one person asks, </joey>
<connor> I'll make some joke and tell you, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, funny, haha, I'm dating Chris." </connor>
<connor> And then, it was just like, </connor>
<connor> okay, then someone else just asked again afterwards. </connor>
<connor> And then, it's like, "All right, he just asked that like, </connor>
<connor> and you didn't get an answer. </connor>
<connor> You're not gonna get a fuckin'... </connor>
<joey> I'm not gonna tell you anything." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like, "Don't ask me this shit!" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like, "Oh, we didn't get a full answer. </joey>
<connor> What if I ask again?" (Garnt and Joey chuckle) </connor>
<joey> - It's like, whether I did or didn't, </joey>
<joey> or I'm married with four kids, </joey>
<joey> I'll talk about it if I wanna talk about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's frustrating. </connor>
<connor> - If someone wants to keep something private, </connor>
<joey> then let them keep their privacy. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's not me confirming or denying anything, </connor>
<garnt> so shut the fuck up for actually speculating. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - They're gonna be like, "Psychoanalyze, </connor>
<garnt> breakdown word for word." - Enhance. </garnt>
<garnt> - Enhance. </garnt>
<connor> You know, 'cause it's parasocial andy's, dude. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how (chuckling) to say it, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just what it is. </garnt>
<connor> You know, it sucks, but I know it's like a part of, </connor>
<connor> how it is. </connor>
<connor> - I guess it was just like, </connor>
<connor> we've seen the comments and everything, </connor>
<joey> and I'm sure you get it on your Twitch chat all the time. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Hearing it in person, like as a mate, </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, I felt my bro, man. </connor>
<connor> I felt my bro. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I would feel uncomfortable if like I was asked that </garnt>
<garnt> that involves me and Syndey. - It's happened </garnt>
<connor> so many times now where it's kind of like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, I just have the routine of dealing with it, </connor>
<joey> of like, "Haha, dating Chris." - But that's </joey>
<connor> the one thing I like. </connor>
<joey> That's another one that I've kind of figured out, </joey>
<joey> like going to this convention, doing the panel, </joey>
<garnt> is that like it... </garnt>
<garnt> Because we've talked about parasocial relationships </garnt>
<garnt> so many freakin' times on the show, and it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> you'd think that after the amount of times </garnt>
<joey> we've talked about it, people start to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, yeah I get the boys' perspectives on it." </joey>
<connor> - But there's also the fact </connor>
<connor> where if you talk about parasocial relationships, </connor>
<connor> it makes it seem like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, the person listening is in a parasocial relationship </connor>
<connor> 'cause they're listening, they're hearing. </connor>
<connor> But then it's like, </connor>
<connor> okay, but it doesn't always like translate well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But also I understand how like on the day, </connor>
<connor> sometimes people get in weird moods and some things happen. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I get it. You're like, "Yeah, yeah." </garnt>
<joey> - I will say that it was, like I said, 99, </joey>
<joey> like I met like a lot of people there. </joey>
<joey> And the people I can respect was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Look, I know 'cause you've talked about it plenty of times. </joey>
<joey> I know you more than you know me. </joey>
<joey> I just wanna say, I get that, </joey>
<joey> and I still love your stuff. </joey>
<joey> I still respect everything you've done." </joey>
<joey> And that was like just a genuine, </joey>
<joey> okay I met like a few people at the bar, at the hotel, </joey>
<connor> who I just had just had a genuine conversation with </connor>
<connor> from like that starting point, where, you know, </connor>
<connor> "We acknowledge this, </connor>
<connor> but I still wanna get to know this person </connor>
<connor> because we're in a environment where I can get to have </connor>
<connor> a more chilled conversation about it." </connor>
<connor> But then, you do just get these one or two maybe fans </connor>
<connor> who just don't watch Trash Taste as often as other people. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause especially like reading the subreddit </connor>
<connor> and reading how much people have called this out, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "That's fuckin' great." (clapping hands) </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately, not everyone of our viewers </connor>
<connor> is on the subreddit, for example. </connor>
<connor> Not every viewer watches every episode. </connor>
<garnt> So you will get that casual viewer </garnt>
<garnt> who just doesn't know more, </garnt>
<garnt> like doesn't know about the boundaries </garnt>
<garnt> as much as like other viewers, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I mean, to me it was like, </connor>
<connor> this is just all a learning experience. </connor>
<connor> Like this is no way made me </connor>
<connor> not wanna go to cons or anything. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Like we've said this a million times, but yeah, </connor>
<connor> everyone was super fuckin' nice. </connor>
<connor> The signings were great. </connor>
<connor> Everyone was really respectful, </connor>
<connor> except you got shot by a Nerf gun by someone. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that wasn't cool. I wasn't there to see, but- </joey>
<joey> - So, it was 'cause it's like open, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was open. </joey>
<joey> - So, we had like a table, and there was three of us. </joey>
<joey> I was in the middle, Joey was on the end, </joey>
<joey> and then there's Garnt on this end. </joey>
<connor> And this end is completely open, </connor>
<connor> so anyone could have walked up and thrown anything at Garnt, </connor>
<connor> which is just an oversight. </connor>
<connor> They should have had someone there who is stopping this. </connor>
<connor> - I think it was like... </connor>
<connor> It's a learning experience. </connor>
<garnt> It's not just for us, but for the convention itself, </garnt>
<connor> for the convention as well. </connor>
<connor> So like, I remember the conversation where we talked about, </connor>
<connor> we don't know if we need security </connor>
<connor> for future conventions yet. </connor>
<connor> This taught us that we definitely do need- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, we definitely do. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> We definitely do need security. </connor>
<garnt> Like that was like a very much a big eye opener for us. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, obviously we had the incident happened </connor>
<connor> where someone came on the stage, who apparently... </connor>
<connor> Okay, so this is the whole fuckin' thing. </connor>
<connor> You said it was a learning experience with the convention. </connor>
<connor> I feel like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> they should know that it would've been better. </connor>
<connor> And to be fair, they stepped it up, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like it should have been there anyway. </connor>
<connor> We practically had no security really </connor>
<connor> for like the first two days. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think they definitely should have had security </garnt>
<garnt> for the panel. </garnt>
<garnt> But I talked to some people afterwards, who working there, </garnt>
<connor> and they said, "This has never happened before. </connor>
<connor> This has never even become close to happening. </connor>
<joey> There was never like a precedence </joey>
<connor> of this like ever happening at MCM." </connor>
<connor> So it was also, it wasn't oversight, </connor>
<connor> but also, like a lot of people just didn't expect it </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it just never happened before. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah, I agree, and I don't wanna go too hard, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause obviously, like we wanna go to cons again, </garnt>
<garnt> but like it blows my mind </garnt>
<joey> that you would have a main stage event </joey>
<joey> and not have like at least one scary dude in the front, </joey>
<joey> 'cause like it was anyone could have come up, </joey>
<joey> everyone could have come up. (chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - And it's still like MCM haven't had insanely large guests </garnt>
<garnt> in the past. </garnt>
<joey> So I'm thinking like, "What do they do-" </joey>
<connor> - Well, they had like Tom Hiddleston. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's like there's no way Tom Hiddleston </joey>
<joey> could do a panel on stage, </joey>
<joey> and there wouldn't be a single fuckin' bodyguard anywhere. </joey>
<connor> - I dunno, maybe it's just like a thing of they're like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, well we have some guests this year. </connor>
<garnt> None of them are super high profile. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess we can scale it back, save some money." </garnt>
<garnt> But obviously, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> And also, a lot of these cons, they know YouTubers are big. </garnt>
<garnt> They know it, but they don't like, </garnt>
<garnt> they don't know it, right? (chuckles) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They understand, "Oh, yes, 3 million subs," </joey>
<joey> but they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, but we have the guy who voices </joey>
<joey> in 'The Fairly Oddparents,' here. </joey>
<joey> And I know what that is. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know who this Trash guy is. </joey>
<joey> Who's these rubbish rubbish boys?" </joey>
<joey> - The rubbish lads. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, who's these rubbish lads? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) What are they? </joey>
<joey> So there's this complete... </joey>
<joey> Like a lot of cons do have </joey>
<joey> this kind of disconnect between like... </joey>
<joey> Because a lot of the cons are ran by people </joey>
<joey> who understand older media and traditional media, </joey>
<joey> they don't really understand YouTubers that well. </joey>
<joey> They should buy now, but they don't. </joey>
<joey> And so I feel like there's a lot of oversight </joey>
<joey> that happened there. </joey>
<garnt> And then getting to this guy in particular, </garnt>
<garnt> who came on the stage, which was a weird thing, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause this guy didn't do anything for the first 20 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And then started shouting. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone thought he was like just a heckler. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought he was a heckler, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was just like, </garnt>
<joey> "We've all dealt with hecklers in the past as well." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - So, someone asked a question, </joey>
<joey> and then I just like heard someone shouting something </joey>
<joey> in like the fuckin' background and something, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "Oh, okay, it's-" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just ignore 'em. It's whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Passionate anime fans, I've heard it all before, you know? </joey>
<joey> And then suddenly I see some guy </joey>
<connor> just walking up to the stage, and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Is this happening?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Is this happening? </connor>
<connor> - I heard like a guy go, "No, no I'm coming on." </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> And then, someone stood up, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck? Someone's coming up." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, "Oh no worries, </connor>
<connor> security will deal with it." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was like, "There'll be someone there." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I was just like, "Okay, he'll get to the stage. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no, he's on the stage. Well, he'll get near the sofa. </garnt>
<joey> Oh no, he's near the sofa. </joey>
<connor> Oh, oh, he's sitting next to Joey." </connor>
<connor> And then I remember just like just waiting </connor>
<joey> because I assumed that there would be someone </joey>
<garnt> who would've come on and- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, like someone's coming from backstage. </joey>
<garnt> He's gonna come and collect him. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, "Backstage?" </joey>
<garnt> No, I was like, "No, no one on the sides. </garnt>
<garnt> Um, what did we do?" - And a good like 30, </garnt>
<connor> 40 seconds passed where nothing happened. </connor>
<joey> - Even the crowd was like, "Is this a bit?" </joey>
<joey> Like, "What's happening?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was so like out of left field </joey>
<joey> that I talked to some people, and originally, </joey>
<joey> they thought that it was just a special guest </joey>
<joey> that had come on. </joey>
<joey> - A special guest. (chuckles) (Garnt and Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - A special guest. </joey>
<connor> - Just a random dude, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just a bit in like our show or something. </connor>
<connor> And we were just like, </connor>
<garnt> I think the best way to describe it is just, </garnt>
<garnt> we were just shell shocked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, it was definitely traumatizing, that's for sure. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause that's like, yeah, as I said, it was unprecedented. </connor>
<connor> Like that's never happened at any, </connor>
<garnt> probably never any of our panels, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt and Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, so it's just like- </joey>
<garnt> - I dunno how calm we looked on camera, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm pretty sure internally, we were freaking </garnt>
<joey> the fuck out. - Oh, I was shitting myself. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I was like... </garnt>
<joey> This dude like sat right next to me, </joey>
<connor> like he kinda like shoved me outta the way 'cause I sitting </connor>
<connor> kind of in the middle of the couch like this, </connor>
<connor> and he like shoved me out of the way. </connor>
<connor> And then, he like, I mean, everyone who was there saw it, </connor>
<connor> but he tried to like grab the mic off my hand. </connor>
<connor> - I saw that. - Yeah, 'cause he wanted </connor>
<connor> to say something, and I was like, "Ah, no, dude," </connor>
<connor> like, "What the fuck are you doing?" </connor>
<connor> And then, yeah, </connor>
<connor> he just like starts rambling off about something, </connor>
<connor> I don't even what the fuck. - But he wasn't even </connor>
<connor> like being coherent. </connor>
<connor> - No, but it was just like coming into one ear </connor>
<garnt> and out the other </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was just fuckin' looking around like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Ah, is anyone gonna do anything about this?" </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Like I remember what he was talking about was nothing to do </garnt>
<connor> with what the question was asked </connor>
<connor> or what we were talking about before. </connor>
<connor> - He was just completely out of his mind. </connor>
<connor> - He was just rambling on </connor>
<connor> about something completely incoherent. </connor>
<garnt> And meanwhile, Joey is frantically looking around, </garnt>
<connor> trying to find- </connor>
<garnt> - Joey, (chuckles) I felt really bad for you. </garnt>
<joey> You were like, "Anyone? Anyone?" </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Help." </joey>
<joey> Because I didn't wanna be the one </joey>
<connor> to like instigate something. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't know, the dude might have a knife, you know? </connor>
<connor> The dude might suddenly fuckin' swing at me. </connor>
<connor> So it's like, "I don't know what to do." </connor>
<connor> I can't like push him off or anything </connor>
<connor> 'cause he was also fuckin' massive. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, this guy was big. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, big guy. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I not saying that I would punch </connor>
<connor> if like a fuckin' two-foot man came on the stage, </connor>
<connor> but like I'd be a lot more lightly just to be like, </connor>
<connor> to try and leverage (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> my own position if they were- </connor>
<garnt> - If a child comes onto stage, you're like, </garnt>
<joey> "Okay, baby." - Just stand up </joey>
<joey> for the drop, kid. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Well, it was just like, you're in the situation, </connor>
<connor> someone comes up, and you look at him, and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "If this guy really wanted to swing for any of us, </connor>
<garnt> odds are it's gonna fuckin' like really fuckin' hurt. " </garnt>
<garnt> And I probably wouldn't be able to punch him. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he was really tall and big. </garnt>
<connor> So it's just like, you just sit there, </connor>
<connor> and you're like weighing your odds. </connor>
<garnt> You're like, "What do I need to do? </garnt>
<garnt> What's the best way to handle this?" </garnt>
<connor> Like I'm processing, processing, processing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause you rarely find yourself </connor>
<connor> in a situation like this </connor>
<connor> where you don't know what the outcome is going to be, </connor>
<connor> so in your head you are just like, </connor>
<connor> "What's the worst outcome this could possibly be </connor>
<garnt> and how could I prepare for it?" </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you're kind of in like fight or flight mode </garnt>
<garnt> at that point, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and also, it's like, </joey>
<joey> there was that like side of me as well </joey>
<joey> that was like, okay, say for example, </joey>
<joey> like if I fuckin' tripped him up </joey>
<joey> as he was like trying to flee, </joey>
<joey> and he like smashes his head in, </joey>
<joey> and he's gonna Amber Heard me </joey>
<joey> and like try and sue me for defamation and damages. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like, "I didn't want that either." </connor>
<connor> So it's like, I literally couldn't do anything, </connor>
<connor> and I just had to sit there and be like, </connor>
<joey> just prayge that way someone would help me. </joey>
<connor> - I was just like hoping, I was, "Okay." </connor>
<joey> Obviously, a lot of people were like, </joey>
<joey> "Man, you should've just like punched him or something," </joey>
<connor> and it's like, "Well, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna be the one to escalate it." </connor>
<connor> At the end of the day, we're still on stage, </connor>
<connor> and we are trying- </connor>
<connor> - Bro, Creator Clash was like a month ago. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, dude. (Connor and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That's not what they paid the money for, man. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like you're sitting there, </connor>
<connor> and you have to like go through it. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "All right, well what does this guy want? </garnt>
<garnt> Why is he on stage?" </garnt>
<joey> And so, initially, I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, maybe he just wants to be funny." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, this is great 'cause I can handle cringe." </joey>
<joey> Like half of my videos on my channel are like, </joey>
<joey> try not to cringe challenges. </joey>
<joey> And like I'm fine dealing with a guy </joey>
<joey> trying to be funny on stage. </joey>
<joey> I'll just outweighed him in cringe. </joey>
<joey> Like I know that I can sit here, </joey>
<joey> and if this guy was trying to be funny, which he wasn't, </joey>
<joey> but if he was, I was like, "It's fine. </joey>
<connor> I'll just wait until he feels so unbearably awkward </connor>
<connor> that he'll just leave." </connor>
<connor> And then I'll be like, "All right, good," </connor>
<connor> which is what I think happened eventually. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> But this guy was completely, you know, </connor>
<joey> he was not in the right state of mind, </joey>
<connor> like this guy was clearly unwell. </connor>
<connor> - And he was also doing it </connor>
<connor> to a bunch of other panels as well. </connor>
<connor> So he clearly wasn't like a targeted thing. </connor>
<connor> He was just like going around, </connor>
<joey> just wreaking as much havoc as possible. </joey>
<connor> - So yeah, what I heard was, I don't know how... </connor>
<joey> Again, this is not 100% confirmed, </joey>
<joey> but this is the story that I was told. </joey>
<garnt> Apparently he did this to another stage. </garnt>
<connor> - After ours. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, after ours? Oh shit, I thought it was before. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, </garnt>
<garnt> it was after ours. - Oh, so, after ours. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, they tried to get him removed, </garnt>
<connor> but at the time, they didn't </connor>
<connor> 'cause for some reason they didn't listen to the person </connor>
<connor> who was trying to get him removed or something. </connor>
<connor> It was like a whole thing. </connor>
<connor> And then, yeah, we were told the next day </connor>
<joey> that he was arrested afterwards, and I think charged, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what with, but apparently, </joey>
<connor> they went and asked him why- </connor>
<connor> - Being cringe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, why he did it. Yeah, cringe. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> Sentenced to- </joey>
<joey> - Sentenced to jail for being cringe. </joey>
<joey> - Sentenced to die of cringe. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I sentence you for being cringe. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Honestly. </connor>
<connor> - So what are you in for? </connor>
<connor> I was cringe at a con. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I dunno. Maybe like trespassing or some stuff. </garnt>
<joey> I don't fuckin' know. </joey>
<joey> Either way, I mean, glad that something happened. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They caught him and asked him why he did it. </joey>
<joey> He said something along the lines of, yeah, </joey>
<garnt> he apparently just wanted to go up on stage. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he didn't really know who we were. </garnt>
<connor> He was just there trying to get on stage to things. </connor>
<connor> So it was just unfortunate timing </connor>
<connor> that it was a guy at our panel </connor>
<garnt> who just wanted to jump on stage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, it could have been anyone at the end of the day. </garnt>
<connor> - We're lucky it turned out well. </connor>
<connor> If that guy really wanted to do something, </connor>
<connor> this could be a really different story. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I see it as a positive experience </garnt>
<garnt> because it really- </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Sure. </garnt>
<joey> - Do you wanna be in my seat and say that or? (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Sure. (laughs) Okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> Let me say, I see it as an event like this, </joey>
<connor> where something this big happened </connor>
<connor> and nothing bad came out of it, </connor>
<connor> it really put things into perspective for us. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It made it guaranteed </connor>
<connor> that something like this isn't gonna happen again </connor>
<connor> because now we are more aware of it. </connor>
<connor> Now we're gonna convey this to wherever we go to. </connor>
<connor> So I think, it's obviously not a good thing that happened, </connor>
<connor> and maybe we should have been more prepared for it, </connor>
<connor> but it did happen. </connor>
<connor> Nothing too bad came out of it, aside from just seeing- </connor>
<connor> - A lot of cringe. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laughing) - A lot of cringe. </connor>
<connor> And just like getting his ass flashed in front of our face, </connor>
<garnt> because his trousers were like half way down. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't even like a half crack. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he might as well have not been wearing pants. </garnt>
<connor> It was like the full ass crack. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh, God, why? Why?" </garnt>
<connor> Also he stank, </connor>
<connor> like he really fuckin' stank. (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Holy shit, </joey>
<joey> you definitely smell like a con goer, that's for sure." </joey>
<joey> - I just fuckin' hope that guy gets the help he needs. </joey>
<joey> 'cause he's clearly fuckin' unwell. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was like, I dunno, it was just fucked. </joey>
<joey> It sucked as well 'cause halfway through, we had to... </joey>
<connor> The panel, it was going okay at that point, I'd say, </connor>
<connor> and then we were already kind of like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, dude, we gotta do this panel now after that happened, </connor>
<joey> like pretend like nothing happened. </joey>
<connor> - At least if it was like near the beginning </connor>
<connor> or near the end, then it'd be a little bit easier </connor>
<connor> to kind of just like clean it up and get over it, </connor>
<connor> but it was like dead set in the middle of the panel. </connor>
<connor> So it was like the hardest to kind of recuperating, </connor>
<joey> like get back onto the flow of things. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember I tried to like continue the panel </garnt>
<garnt> and the only image that was in my mind </garnt>
<garnt> was just that ass- - That ass. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - that bare ass crack. </garnt>
<garnt> That bare ass crack just like hypnotized me to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Whoa, where am I right now?" </garnt>
<joey> - For me, it was that. </joey>
<joey> And also, just like in the back of my head being like, </joey>
<connor> "What if someone else also does this?" </connor>
<connor> Like what if like another person is just like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, they didn't fuckin' do anything, </connor>
<connor> now it's my time to get 15 minutes of fame." </connor>
<connor> So I was like so fuckin' scared for that. </connor>
<connor> And it's like... </connor>
<connor> And also, I was just like, "Oh good, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna see this all over the subreddit </joey>
<joey> and the Twitter feed in like 17 different fuckin' angles." </joey>
<connor> But yeah, it was whatever. </connor>
<connor> Again, the silver lining is that now we know, </connor>
<garnt> now we're gonna be a little more prepared for future cons </garnt>
<garnt> and future events and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nobody got hurt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, nobody got hurt. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the important thing. - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> Just a lot of trauma and a lot of cringe. </joey>
<joey> - Just a lot- </joey>
<garnt> - Just a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of emotional damage. - of torture, </garnt>
<garnt> drama by cringe, </garnt>
<joey> basically. - Yeah. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Emotional damage, but no physical damage, so that's good. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Aside from the panel, </garnt>
<connor> how else was your guys' kind experience? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean the signing was freakin' awesome. </joey>
<connor> That was a good thing, </connor>
<connor> at least like everyone who came to the signing </connor>
<connor> was super nice, super respectful, </connor>
<connor> lots of like really cool artists and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> I just like kind of wish I had enough time </connor>
<connor> to go to the Artist Alley </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel MCMs Artist Alley was really freakin' good </connor>
<connor> compared to like other cons that I've been to. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like naturally when you're at signing, </connor>
<connor> a lot of people bring up stuff that they bought </connor>
<garnt> at the Artist Alley. - Oh, I saw some of the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> from the Artist Alley. - Some of the stuff </garnt>
<connor> I was genuinely like, "Where the hell did you get that?" </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I wanna get it. </connor>
<connor> But unfortunately, we didn't have enough time </connor>
<garnt> to go to the Artist Alley this year, </garnt>
<garnt> so that was a little disappointing, but, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, It was kind of hard to walk around </garnt>
<joey> in general this year, I feel like. </joey>
<connor> Because I feel like the last convention we went to, </connor>
<connor> it was like AX 2019, and we've said that </connor>
<connor> we could still walk around the convention, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like we get stopped every now and again, </connor>
<connor> especially at a event like AX. </connor>
<connor> But it wasn't to the point </connor>
<connor> where it completely stops your movement </connor>
<connor> and like made it so you couldn't walk around. </connor>
<joey> And I felt like that was very, very different this year. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like I didn't even bother trying, </joey>
<connor> especially after I heard what Connor tried to do. </connor>
<joey> - (laughing) Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - I knew you were gonna fuckin' tell. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) We've got to. </garnt>
<garnt> We've got to. - (laughing) It's just so- </garnt>
<joey> - It's so funny. - It's so funny. </joey>
<joey> - It's so funny. </joey>
<joey> So like after the panel and after our signing... </joey>
<connor> Was it after the signing? </connor>
<connor> - It was after the signing. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so after the signing, like our day was free, </joey>
<joey> and we had like a good two, three hours </joey>
<joey> to enjoy the convention. </joey>
<joey> - We were like up in the green room right after. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, we're up in the green room. </joey>
<joey> And normally, at this point, we're just like, </joey>
<joey> "Great, we've got two, three hours to enjoy the convention. </joey>
<joey> Let's just walk around and stuff like that." </joey>
<joey> But like seeing how many people were at our signing </joey>
<garnt> and seeing how many people couldn't even make it </garnt>
<garnt> to our signing because the signing got cut off. </garnt>
<garnt> The line was like full capacity like an hour or two </garnt>
<garnt> even before we started the signing. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I felt bad to everyone who wanted the signature. </garnt>
<connor> Sorry. - Yeah, really sorry. </connor>
<connor> - We would've done it if we could've. </connor>
<joey> - We would've done it if there was enough time, </joey>
<joey> but unfortunately- - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> I think we were signing for like two and a half hours, </joey>
<joey> and that was like capping the line two hours </joey>
<joey> before the line even opened. </joey>
<connor> But yeah, so I got the feeling that probably not a good idea </connor>
<connor> to walk around, especially without security. </connor>
<connor> And Connor was just like, "Guys, I got this. </connor>
<connor> I got the perfect disguise." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> So let me tell you what Connor's disguise was. </connor>
<connor> So, so let me tell you what con's disguise was. </connor>
<connor> like a normal COVID surgical face mask and some sunglasses. </connor>
<connor> - And a hat. </connor>
<connor> - This is genius. - And a hat. </connor>
<connor> - This is genius. </connor>
<connor> - So, first things first, wearing sunglasses inside, </connor>
<connor> totally inconspicuous. </connor>
<connor> No one's gonna look at you at all. </connor>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - Why would you be wearing sunglasses inside? </joey>
<joey> - It was bright. </joey>
<joey> - Second, that he forgot that the shirt he was wearing </joey>
<joey> was a Trash t-shirt. </joey>
<joey> - That hasn't been released yet. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I know, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> It was a Trash t-shirt that hasn't been shipped out </garnt>
<garnt> to the general public yet, so. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, I- </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, it's the Trash t-shirt that you see him wear </garnt>
<joey> in almost every video (Garnt and Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> and every episode. </joey>
<joey> So it's like that shirt has just been synonymous. </joey>
<joey> Look, like, yep, that's Connor's shirt. </joey>
<connor> - I wanted to say hi to some of my friends, </connor>
<connor> so I was like, "Hey, I'll just come quickly and say hi." </connor>
<joey> I wasn't gonna stay out long. I was just gonna say hi. </joey>
<joey> And obviously, I knew it wasn't a full-proof disguise. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't fuckin' going to film any movie scenes </joey>
<joey> fooling anybody. </joey>
<connor> I was just like, "Maybe it'll just buy me enough time </connor>
<joey> where people will double glance, </joey>
<joey> and then I can just walk away," right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - So I was like, "Okay, let's-" </connor>
<joey> - And how far did you get? </joey>
<connor> - Well, no, so I went to meet my friend </connor>
<connor> who I told to come meet me like at the gate. </connor>
<connor> So it was like, I literally walked out like two meters, </connor>
<connor> and there my friend was. </connor>
<connor> Problem was that at this area </connor>
<connor> that was really convenient for me, </connor>
<connor> people were waiting for Sydney, signed Sydney stuff. </connor>
<connor> And obviously, </connor>
<connor> people were waiting around there and recognized, </connor>
<connor> so people just started coming up to you right away. </connor>
<connor> But I was trying to talk to my friends, </connor>
<connor> and it was just really fuckin' annoying. (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I was just like, "Hold on a second. </joey>
<joey> I'm just talking to my friend, give me a moment." </joey>
<joey> And then they were like just asking for photos. </joey>
<joey> And then the moment I turned around to like go back, </joey>
<joey> there was like five people on this side. </joey>
<connor> And then because my friend left, who I was talking to, </connor>
<connor> people just filled the void, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, shit, I'm getting surrounded." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> So, the people in front of me, </connor>
<connor> I just quickly took a picture with them, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Make this fast, please, please." </connor>
<connor> And then the people behind me, </connor>
<connor> I could just feel them be like, "Connor, Connor," </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "I've gotta go. </connor>
<joey> I gotta go. I'm so sorry." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if I start doing all of them, I won't- </joey>
<joey> - It just never ends. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I won't stop, and it sucks. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "I have to go." </joey>
<joey> Like, "I'm sorry that I wasn't able to give you a picture." </joey>
<joey> - That is the most like suffering from success story ever. </joey>
<connor> - But it sucks, right? (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like, friends would be like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, come hang out, I'm over here." </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "I'm sorry, I can't walk there." </connor>
<joey> And they're like, "Oh wow, okay, you're too big, huh?" </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "Literally, yes." </connor>
<connor> Like, "I actually can't walk to you." </connor>
<joey> This will be a miserable experience if I walk near you. </joey>
<connor> - Like it's literally not even us </connor>
<connor> trying to like humble brag. </connor>
<garnt> It's just like the truth. - No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<joey> - It was just like this was the eye-opening weekend </joey>
<joey> for us to see like, "Oh, okay, </joey>
<garnt> now we have to consider things </garnt>
<garnt> that we've never had to consider before." </garnt>
<joey> - Don't get me wrong, we're greatly appreciative. </joey>
<garnt> - We're very grateful, </garnt>
<joey> but obviously- Yeah, we fuckin' love it, </joey>
<joey> but, you know. </joey>
<joey> - I mean like 'cause after a signing, </joey>
<joey> I really, really wanted to go to Sydney's panel. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause her panel wasn't on the main stage. </connor>
<connor> It was on like one of like the side stages </connor>
<garnt> that was like in the middle of the convention. </garnt>
<joey> - It was kinda like a two or three-minute walk, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> So it was like a two or three-minute walk </garnt>
<garnt> through like this crowd. </garnt>
<joey> And I remember asking one of the handlers, like, </joey>
<joey> "Can I go see Sydney's panel?" </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was our first panel. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "I wanna see my girl, man. </connor>
<connor> Where's my girl? </connor>
<joey> Where's my girl?" - Of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> - And they were like, "I don't think that's a good idea. </joey>
<connor> You should not be walking through that crowd." </connor>
<connor> Like they literally were just like, "No. </connor>
<connor> After what has happened on stage, we cannot stop you, </connor>
<connor> but we highly, highly," and they're like begging me, </connor>
<joey> "Please don't go." (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I could see like the sweat drop on their face. </joey>
<joey> Like being like, "Oh, if he says yes, I can't deny him, </joey>
<joey> but I don't wanna deal </joey>
<connor> with like the consequence of it happening." </connor>
<joey> (chuckling) 'Cause actually like, so on the second day, </joey>
<joey> so on the Sunday, we were hanging out at one of the bars. </joey>
<connor> It was like the Novotel, </connor>
<connor> which is like far enough from the convention </connor>
<connor> that it's like not too many people there, </connor>
<connor> but close enough that you could walk </connor>
<connor> to and from the convention. </connor>
<connor> So I was hanging out there with a few of my mates </connor>
<connor> on like the Sunday, and it was like, </connor>
<connor> everyone was still in the convention, </connor>
<connor> so it was like pretty dead. </connor>
<connor> And so you guys had your signings, </connor>
<connor> So I wanted to meet you guys in the green room or whatever. </connor>
<connor> And so once the con ends, your guys' signing ends, </connor>
<connor> so I'm like, "Great, let's go meet up." </connor>
<connor> And I said, "Oh, okay, I'll go to the hotel </connor>
<connor> that we were staying at," </connor>
<connor> which we had to go to the other side of the convention. </connor>
<connor> And I remember going out with my mate </connor>
<connor> to see the optimal path to walk to the hotel </connor>
<connor> that we're going to. </connor>
<connor> And what it felt like, I walk outside, </connor>
<connor> and everyone started to go outside to the big grassy area, </connor>
<garnt> because the convention's over now, </garnt>
<garnt> so you just see like this massive crowd. </garnt>
<garnt> And what it felt like is, </garnt>
<garnt> you know like in that fuckin' zombie movie </garnt>
<garnt> where they're on like the roof of the mall? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they have to get like the food, </joey>
<joey> and they see like the crowd of zombies </joey>
<joey> that they have to walk through. </joey>
<joey> - Literally, like the opening scene to Dead Rising. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, (laughs) that's what it felt like. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm just like, (sighs) </garnt>
<connor> "Okay, let me plan on my route. </connor>
<connor> What's like the most optimal route I can walk </connor>
<connor> without like... </connor>
<connor> What's the least possibility I could be stopped. </connor>
<connor> - Grab the bench and start swinging. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> It's like, "Outta the way! I need to get food!" </connor>
<joey> I get my baseball bat out. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - It's just short of "The Dead" or something. </connor>
<joey> - My God, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, like a lot of things happened this weekend, </joey>
<joey> but I think all in all, </joey>
<joey> it was a positive experience, I'd say. </joey>
<joey> This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </joey>
<garnt> - Guys, how much time do you spend on your phone nowadays? </garnt>
<garnt> - All the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - And what'd you guys do on your phone? </garnt>
<garnt> - Just browse on the web. </garnt>
<garnt> - The scary part is that your phone carrier </garnt>
<garnt> collects all the data on whatever you're doing. </garnt>
<garnt> Verizon even admitted it! </garnt>
<garnt> - What?! - Oh, God! </garnt>
<garnt> - They say it's so that you can get a better understanding </garnt>
<garnt> of your interests. </garnt>
<garnt> But really, all they wanna do </garnt>
<garnt> is sell your activities to advertisers. </garnt>
<garnt> The more they can get on you, </garnt>
<garnt> the larger the paycheck becomes, </garnt>
<garnt> which is why I use ExpressVPN. </garnt>
<connor> - ExpressVPN is the app that prevents your phone carrier </connor>
<connor> from being able to see the sites you visit </connor>
<connor> and sell it off to third parties. </connor>
<connor> All it takes is one tap of a button, </connor>
<connor> and all of your network data gets encrypted and rerouted </connor>
<connor> through ExpressVPN secure servers for ultimate privacy. </connor>
<connor> Not only does it shield your web browsing, </connor>
<connor> ExpressVPN protects all of your network data, </connor>
<connor> so you can stay private even when using your favorite apps. </connor>
<connor> And the best part is one subscription can be used </connor>
<connor> for up to five devices at the same time. </connor>
<connor> I have my whole family using ExpressVPN. </connor>
<connor> I don't have a family, but if I did, </connor>
<connor> they would all be on ExpressVPN! </connor>

<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<connor> - It was cool and weird having bodyguards. </connor>
<joey> We got bodyguards on the last day. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah! - Yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> we certainly did. </joey>
<joey> - Obviously, what happened on Saturday, </joey>
<connor> which is the main panel, </connor>
<connor> and Garnt getting shot by a Nerf gun and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They kind of were like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, we will step this up a lot." </connor>
<joey> And then they went like... </joey>
<joey> They gave props to MCM </joey>
<joey> for doing it. - Above and beyond, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We had like- - They went above and beyond. </joey>
<joey> - (chuckles) four fuckin' bodyguards with us. </joey>
<joey> It was so, I felt excessive, but I appreciate it. </joey>
<joey> Had a really nice guy, </joey>
<joey> you know, he was really chill, who would speak to me. </joey>
<joey> And then it was really strange going in in the toilet </joey>
<joey> and just coming out of the toilet, </joey>
<joey> and he's just like waiting for me. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Okay, this is weird," but it makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> It was cool. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, he was very professional. </garnt>
<garnt> I see why people don't mind having one, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I thought it was gonna be really overbearing </garnt>
<garnt> having someone behind you, but he was really nice. </garnt>
<garnt> He just kind like stood back, </garnt>
<joey> and whenever he felt anything was happening, </joey>
<joey> he would just kind of introduce himself or not. </joey>
<joey> He would just kinda step up a little. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just kinda interject a little bit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was really good. I mean it was nice. </garnt>
<connor> Definitely, we learned that we have to get it now for AX, </connor>
<connor> I guess. - For AX, </connor>
<connor> and like future conventions that we're going to. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, like I said, this is like our first convention </connor>
<connor> since starting Trash Taste, and now we know. </connor>
<connor> This has like set the presidents, precedence, for us. </connor>
<connor> - President. - President. </connor>
<connor> - That word's really given you a lot of trouble. </connor>
<connor> - It is, it is, it is. </connor>
<connor> - The president, Mr. President. </connor>
<connor> - Set the standard for us </connor>
<connor> is what I'm saying. - Yeah, definitely. </connor>
<connor> - But I mean, I still had a great time, actually. </connor>
<connor> - No, it was awesome. </connor>
<garnt> Like I said, everyone was super nice. </garnt>
<connor> Like getting to see people after so long </connor>
<garnt> has been like crazy. </garnt>
<connor> - Just reminding you that great people exist. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, man. </connor>
<connor> - You know, just like seeing everyone, </connor>
<garnt> seeing the gifts that we've been given as well. </garnt>
<connor> - So many fuckin' talented artists and stuff as well. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I think my favorite gift </garnt>
<garnt> that was given to all of us, actually, </garnt>
<garnt> was there was this like wooden Trash Taste plaque, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was like perfectly crafted. </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, there was such great craftsmanships on it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh, this looks amazing." </connor>
<connor> And I remember gorping at it with Joey, </connor>
<connor> and we were just admiring like the craftmanship. </connor>
<connor> And then, we turn it around, and it says, </connor>
<joey> "Lick my balls." - Lick my balls. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> And we're both just like, "Damn!" </joey>
<connor> - He got gonged. </connor>
<connor> (Grant laughing) </connor>
<connor> Someone gave me these cards, </connor>
<connor> and I found them in my pocket earlier. </connor>
<connor> And one, it just says, "Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder." </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, those are Yu-Gi-Oh cards, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't know, there was Hamon in Yu-Gi-Oh. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, there is, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Why is there Hamon in Yu-Gi-Oh? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - This one is "Raviel, Lord of Phantasms." </joey>
<connor> I didn't really understand why that one was relevant to me. </connor>
<joey> - I think Hamon is my one, actually. </joey>
<connor> - What? You're Hamon? - I wonder why you have it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. - What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I was given Hamon. </joey>
<joey> - I want Hamon, dude. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Someone just gave me a Yu-Gi-Oh card. </joey>
<connor> I don't know, I had it in my pocket. </connor>
<joey> - I think they gave one for Garnt as well, </joey>
<connor> but it must be in the bag of stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess. Wow, it was cool. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, thank you to everyone who showed up </connor>
<connor> and gave gifts and signing and the panel and all that. </connor>
<garnt> It was really, really cool. Really cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you guys think about getting masks to wear </garnt>
<joey> for like future conventions and stuff like that? </joey>
<joey> A better disguise </joey>
<garnt> than what you have? - No, dude. </garnt>
<connor> That was a solid disguise, dude. </connor>
<joey> - Now, do you wanna talk about </joey>
<joey> the disguise you were thinking of having? (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, okay. You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> After seeing what happened on the second day, </garnt>
<garnt> I call up my mates, who was on like the floor, </garnt>
<joey> and I was like, "Can you buy me a mask?" </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I wanna see if like the mask works. </joey>
<joey> - Like a full? </joey>
<joey> - Like a full face mask. - Like a full face mask. </joey>
<joey> And so, they buy me a mask. </joey>
<connor> I'm not gonna say what it is in case I end up using it </connor>
<connor> for future conventions, </connor>
<connor> but they buy me a mask of a character. </connor>
<connor> That's that's all I'm going to say. </connor>
<connor> And so, we go to the bar afterwards, </connor>
<connor> they bring me the masks, and I try it on in front of Joey. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "Joey, does this mask work at all? </joey>
<joey> Can you tell it's me?" </joey>
<joey> And the first thing Joey says is like, </joey>
<joey> "You ain't tricking anyone." </joey>
<joey> - No, because it's like the mask just covers the face. </joey>
<connor> Because Garnt's hair stands up, </connor>
<connor> it's just Garnt's hair above it. </connor>
<connor> Like, you can tell from... </connor>
<joey> If you are aware of what Garnt's hair looks like, </joey>
<joey> it's so freaking obvious. I'm like, "Yep, that's Garnt." </joey>
<joey> Yeah, because I knew that wasn't gonna work </joey>
<garnt> because back in AX 2018, 2019, whichever the last one was, </garnt>
<connor> Aki and I tried to do the same thing. </connor>
<connor> We didn't even have like a face mask. </connor>
<connor> We had like a full covering the head, </connor>
<garnt> like balaclava-style mask. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were both wearing that, </garnt>
<connor> we were like, "Yeah, we're gonna get away with this." </connor>
<garnt> They'll never freaking know." </garnt>
<connor> And we were walking from the hotel to the convention, </connor>
<connor> which was like a two or three-minute walk. </connor>
<connor> And as soon as I got out of the hotel, someone was like, </connor>
<joey> "Hey, Joey." (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> I was just like, "Fuck it! Damn it!" </connor>
<joey> - My perfect disguise. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, I immediately gave up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So, I don't think it's gonna work. </connor>
<connor> That's why I was laughing also when Connor was like, </connor>
<joey> "They'll never know it's me." </joey>
<connor> - I didn't expect it to work. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "It'll just buy me enough time." </connor>
<joey> - You might as well just had a sign that says, </joey>
<joey> "I am Connor for Trash Taste." (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Just like a sign that says, - I'll do that. </joey>
<connor> - "I am not Connor." </connor>
<connor> - I am not Connor. (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I'll do that on the next show. </garnt>
<garnt> We'll get a giant fuckin', </garnt>
<joey> like one of those pizza flipping sign things? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, "I'm not Connor." - I'll be like, </joey>
<connor> an arrow here that's like, "I am not Connor." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I actually did try it on a Sunday, </joey>
<joey> and it worked for a bit, actually. </joey>
<joey> It worked, yeah. - Really? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like people would definitely recognize me. </joey>
<joey> Like as I was walking around the convention, </joey>
<joey> people would definitely recognize me, </joey>
<joey> but it wasn't like... </joey>
<connor> It was like Connor's trap, </connor>
<connor> well, what Connor wanted to do, </connor>
<connor> which was it bought you enough time </connor>
<connor> that they didn't like... </connor>
<connor> You didn't get stopped immediately, </connor>
<connor> but I could see like every fifth person I walked past, </connor>
<connor> they did like the double take. </connor>
<connor> They did like the double take. </connor>
<connor> They would walk past and then like something would click, </connor>
<joey> and then they just like, "Is that?" </joey>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Who was that guy? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, who was that guy? </connor>
<joey> I felt a disturbance in the force for a second there, </joey>
<connor> but like that bought me enough time to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, they've looked around, </connor>
<connor> and I'm already like enough the way down." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, it definitely didn't hide my identity, </connor>
<connor> but it made people </connor>
<joey> not immediately recognize me. - Like not run up </joey>
<joey> from a distance kinda like, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> And I think like as long as you don't stop in one place </garnt>
<garnt> for too long, then it's useful. </garnt>
<joey> - But the problem with that is that like </joey>
<garnt> if you have that particular mask on, for instance, </garnt>
<garnt> then the word is going to spread. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's gonna be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Yeah, so the guy in that mask, yeah, that's Garnt." </connor>
<joey> And then it just doesn't work anymore </joey>
<joey> because it's like, </joey>
<joey> now they're just looking for the guy in that mask. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - So it's like, it's a one trick pony. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> You gotta get like a new mask for every day </garnt>
<garnt> or every fuckin' convention (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> or something. (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I did see like a couple of people I knew, </joey>
<garnt> like YouTubers and stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> who were going in like cosplay, and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Okay, that's smart </garnt>
<garnt> because you're in a full cosplay type of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - So it's not just like covering the head type of thing, </connor>
<connor> but like in saying that, </connor>
<garnt> am I bothered to get like a full </garnt>
<garnt> or my full body cosplay to like walk around? </garnt>
<garnt> No, I'm not. - It's too hot. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It is, it's too hot. - Speaking of cosplay, though, </joey>
<garnt> my God, Genshin has like taken over this year. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like every third cosplayer I saw was a Genshin character. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause normally I remember </garnt>
<garnt> like the anime con experience is like one or two characters </garnt>
<garnt> would completely take over. </garnt>
<connor> Now, it was just like the entire cast of Genshin. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a lot of Genshin. </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize that it was that popular. </connor>
<joey> - That's right, 'cause I remember in like 2018, 2019, </joey>
<joey> I think the big thing, </joey>
<joey> at least for people who came up to my signing, </joey>
<joey> was like Nekopara characters. </joey>
<joey> And I think I saw like two Nekopara characters today, </joey>
<connor> and I was like, "Oh, okay." </connor>
<connor> - Nekopara, was that big? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, there was a lot </joey>
<connor> 'cause it's so easy to cosplay, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess so. - And it's like, </connor>
<connor> there's so many variations, </connor>
<connor> so like it's very easy for a lot of people to cosplay it, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, now it's just like Genshin or Demon Slayer </connor>
<connor> or there's something else. - I saw a lot of Demon Slayer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And there's always </garnt>
<garnt> gonna be a lot of- - I was expecting that, </garnt>
<garnt> though. - I was expecting </garnt>
<garnt> Demon Slayer. </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of JuJutsu Kaisen as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. - That was like </garnt>
<garnt> the big three that I saw. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's not mid. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, because it's not mid, </joey>
<joey> apparently. - It's not mid. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like my mates were telling me </garnt>
<connor> that like the Genshin line or the line to buy Genshin merch </connor>
<connor> was like by far like the longest line. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even know they were selling Genshin merch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, this is the closest any Genshin fan is gonna get </connor>
<garnt> to buying actual feel real merch, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But there was one part of me that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh man, there's so many Genshin characters </garnt>
<garnt> that have been cosplaying, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like, "Oh yeah, this is like a new era </garnt>
<connor> of like cosplaying at cons." </connor>
<connor> But the one thing where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, this will never change," </connor>
<connor> is people coming up to me making me sign Death Notes. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. - Ah! </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, "That is a piece of con culture </garnt>
<garnt> that will probably never go away." </garnt>
<garnt> - That will never go away. </garnt>
<joey> - That will never go away. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "All right, that's familiar right there." </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck, I just remembered that happened to me as well, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I probably signed like 10 or 20 Death Notes </joey>
<connor> like during this week. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "All right, that's one piece of like con culture, </garnt>
<joey> I'm glad will never go away. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like gotten to the point </garnt>
<connor> where I know the notebook now when I get given it, right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because they make it like you always get the Death Note, </connor>
<connor> and then they make you sign it, </connor>
<connor> and then they're like, "Close the cover," </connor>
<connor> and they're like staring at you. </connor>
<connor> You know, they're like, "Ha, what do you think?" </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Haha, you got me!" </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the pages are very noticeable. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, I don't know, you're not fooling anyone. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even have to like flip the cover anymore </joey>
<connor> to see what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, "Yeah, that's death." </joey>
<joey> - Are you superstitious about it? </joey>
<connor> I know some people don't sign Death Notes </connor>
<connor> 'cause they're like, "Oh, what if I actually do die?" </connor>
<connor> - What? Who? </connor>
<joey> - I've met some people who don't sign them. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Oh. - Ah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, "Are you wishing me to die or something? </joey>
<joey> That's fucked up." </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't care. </joey>
<garnt> - Ah, I mean, like also another thing </garnt>
<connor> is like there's a lot of people </connor>
<joey> that try to get you in Deez Nuts strokes nowadays as well. </joey>
<joey> That's the new like Death Note, like trick now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> It's like I had a couple of people being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, can you sign this for my friend? </joey>
<joey> He couldn't be here because he had ligma." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like this close to being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I'm sorry for your friend." (laughs) </joey>
<connor> And I had to stop myself. </connor>
<joey> I mean, I was like, "Mmm." (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think this guy tried it on all three of us. </connor>
<connor> And I think I was first, and I was like, "All right, nice." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Ligma, okay, wow." </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Come on, man. </joey>
<connor> Do you really think that's gonna fuckin' work?" </connor>
<connor> Come on, </connor>
<joey> find something creative. - Although, I must say </joey>
<joey> that the dude who found that restaurant in London, </joey>
<joey> which was called Secundus. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that was genius. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, "All right, you deserve that. </garnt>
<garnt> You deserve the grit. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like a Deez Nuts stroke </garnt>
<connor> that had effort put into it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I respect that </connor>
<connor> 'cause he got us these like Indian, or I think like- </connor>
<connor> - Indian nuts or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like a snack that was made outta nuts. </connor>
<joey> So it was like, "Oh, I got you some nuts from Secundus." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Okay, that's kind of funny." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) That was really funny. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, "I'll take it. I'll take it." </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, "You know what? </connor>
<connor> I respect the creativity, I'll take that." </connor>
<garnt> - What were some of the gifts that you guys got? </garnt>
<garnt> Was there anything that stood out? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, there was one. Actually, we got it yesterday. </joey>
<joey> But there was this guy, this artist guy, </joey>
<connor> who gave us this like poster, </connor>
<connor> and he's like a mecha artist. </connor>
<connor> And he made this like- </connor>
<connor> - Maybe it's on screen. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe it's on screen. I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> But like he made this like Trash Taste mecha, essentially. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my gosh. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it's like full on. </garnt>
<connor> - It looked- - Connor, </connor>
<connor> - really fuckin' good. - you saw it, right? </connor>
<connor> It looked freaking amazing. </connor>
<connor> It was like kind of a cross </connor>
<connor> between a Gundam and an Ava type of thing, </connor>
<connor> but it was like, it had like the Trash Taste purple on it. </connor>
<connor> And it looked really freaking cool. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, - It was really good. </connor>
<connor> - "Yeah, I did it in two days." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What the hell?" </connor>
<joey> I wish I could do that. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It was really nice. </joey>
<joey> - I really wanted to give it to Alan </joey>
<joey> 'cause I know he is like a massive mecha head. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so I've like held onto it, </connor>
<connor> so I'll give it to Alan. </connor>
<connor> - That's really cool. </connor>
<connor> - But I wanna see that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there was just like so many cool, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> really talented people. </connor>
<connor> Like a girl gave me a ring that she had like made as well. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds so cool. - Brilliant. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> obviously, pieces of fan art and stuff like that </connor>
<garnt> is like amazing as well. </garnt>
<joey> And like, we've kept all of it obviously. </joey>
<garnt> - I got like a custom Pokemon card </garnt>
<connor> for mine and Sydney's wedding. </connor>
<connor> It was like custom-made. - Oh really? Shoot. </connor>
<connor> - It was like proper metal and everything. </connor>
<joey> I was like- - Oh, cool. </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty fuckin' cool. </joey>
<garnt> - that was one of the coolest gifts I've gotten. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember there was a guy </garnt>
<joey> who came to my signing on the Friday, </joey>
<joey> and he made me sign like Holo Yu-Gi-Oh card. </joey>
<connor> and I was like, "Oh, that's really cool. </connor>
<connor> I haven't seen that in a long time." </connor>
<connor> He came back on the Sunday to give me the card </connor>
<connor> in film like this. - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - It was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I like scoured it all over the continent </connor>
<connor> and like find it for you." </connor>
<connor> And he like came back on the Sunday to give it to me, </connor>
<joey> and I was just like, "You've achieved, bro! (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> You've achieved!" </joey>
<connor> - Give me a limited edition first (indistinct) please. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I would like one. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you get someone... </garnt>
<garnt> Did you get a masterpiece? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, no. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, the guy, I was really disappointed, </connor>
<connor> he brought out a copy of "Master Piece," </connor>
<joey> which is like- - The Hentai. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the Hentai. It was like the full doujin colored. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh my God." </connor>
<connor> He said, "Yeah, sign it for me." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Can I have it?" And he was like, "No." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Hey, I gotta shoot my shot." </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, "Oh, you got this for me!" </garnt>
<connor> "No, just sign it bitch!" - It was like a joke. </connor>
<garnt> I was like joking with him, </garnt>
<joey> like, "You got this for me, right?" </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "No." </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "I think you've got it for me." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then, this poor guy behind, </connor>
<connor> so we had like, obviously, you have like a handler at a con, </connor>
<connor> basically the handler's job </connor>
<connor> is to just kind of get you to where you need to go </connor>
<connor> and also help with the signings, kind of help with the flow. </connor>
<garnt> And he was like this normal British dude who just like, </garnt>
<garnt> he was talking me about football and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I pretended like I understood what was going on. </garnt>
<garnt> And (chuckles) I take out this masterpiece to sign it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I just open it up, and I'm like, "Nice, nice." </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, "Whoa!" </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Whoa! And I'm like, "Oh yeah, this is not normal." </garnt>
<garnt> This is not a normal thing to open </garnt>
<garnt> and just admire right now. </garnt>
<connor> And so I closed it, and I was like, "All right." </connor>
<connor> He was like, "Wow, that was intense, wasn't it?" </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah." </connor>
<joey> Fuckin' wierdo, right? Wierdo. </joey>
<connor> Freak! What a freak, dude! </connor>
<joey> - No, I totally just like bought into it </joey>
<joey> because like my handler who was next to me, </joey>
<joey> she was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, yeah, you've signed some pretty weird things." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "You haven't seen anything yet." </joey>
<joey> And then, literally, as I said that, some dude was like, </joey>
<joey> "Can I get you to sign something </joey>
<joey> that's like very questionable?" </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "All right, here we go," </connor>
<connor> and he pulls out like a Sasuke X Naruto, </connor>
<connor> like yaoi doujin. </connor>
<connor> - I signed that as well. </connor>
<connor> - And he was like... </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Where do you want me to sign it, </connor>
<connor> like on the cover and stuff like that?" </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "No, open it up </connor>
<connor> and find the most fucked up page to sign it on. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't wanna open this in front of my handler </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> being like, 'Oh, wonder where's the most fucked up scene.'" </joey>
<joey> And then, I did find the most up scene, and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, I'll do it right there." </joey>
<connor> And she was just like, "No judging. </connor>
<connor> You know what? These are your fans, I guess." </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Yeah." (chuckles) </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I remember, like I had a similar experience, because okay, </joey>
<joey> we've talked a lot about MCM. </joey>
<joey> I always say like the signing experience </joey>
<joey> was like the smoothest signing experience I've ever had- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<connor> - at any convention. </connor>
<connor> They had this shit on lockdown, </connor>
<connor> like it was like in and out, in and out, take your stuff. </connor>
<connor> They gave us like a post note </connor>
<connor> of like what they wanted us to sign, </connor>
<joey> what the person's name was. </joey>
<joey> It was like excellent. </joey>
<joey> - It was so streamlined. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was so streamlined. </joey>
<joey> I remember the first one, the first SAS one that I got, </joey>
<connor> it was a manga called, </connor>
<garnt> like I think like "Dick Fight Island" or something. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think I remember that. </joey>
<joey> - I know the lot. </joey>
<joey> - It was "Dick Fight Island," and I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, what's this?" </joey>
<joey> And he goes like, "Oh, Sydney recommended it." </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "That sounds </joey>
<joey> like Sydney recommendation." - Of course, she did. </joey>
<joey> - And he just goes off on like, </joey>
<joey> he just starts going off on like the entire synopsis </joey>
<joey> Of "Dick Fight Island," </joey>
<joey> which is apparently just a bunch of dudes on an island, </joey>
<joey> and they fight with their dicks. </joey>
<joey> And that's what I'm guessing is it. </joey>
<joey> But he goes into it in like such graphic detail. </joey>
<joey> And so I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> "Yeah, that sounds like a really, really interesting story." </garnt>
<garnt> I sign it, he goes away, </garnt>
<garnt> and we had like a little five-minute breather. </garnt>
<garnt> And my handler goes to me, "So, what do you do?" </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's a long story. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, "How do I explain this?" </garnt>
<garnt> - You should have just been like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yes, I'm the author of "Dick Fight Island." </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Oh, you know what, actually, </joey>
<connor> I got someone came out to me who is like... </connor>
<connor> This is like referenced, I guess, </connor>
<connor> to anyone who has watched this episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> He was like, 2Oh man, I love your work." </connor>
<connor> And then he just gives me a copy of "Goblin Slayer." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And I was like- - Did he actually? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "Oh, can you sign it?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Yeah, dude, let's do it." </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I signed a "Goblin Slayer." </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Hell, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Oh God, that was interesting. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of normal things. </connor>
<connor> Everyone thinks that like they're gonna hand you </connor>
<connor> the weirdest thing. </connor>
<connor> They're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I'm gonna go show you something really out there." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "All right, I've signed everything." </connor>
<joey> And I love how it's those people who are always like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, I'm sorry, you've never signed anything this weird." </connor>
<connor> And I was just like (chuckles) no idea. </connor>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - This is baby mode right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this is baby mode, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - So, did anything else notable happen to you </garnt>
<garnt> at the convention? </garnt>
<connor> - Ah, I dunno. Did anything? </connor>
<joey> I got to see a lot of people I haven't seen in years, </joey>
<garnt> which was nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you guys get recognized anywhere, </garnt>
<garnt> like at a weird place that was not in the convention? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I got... </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause the hotel they put us in </garnt>
<connor> was like literally like the Connor Hotel. </connor>
<connor> So anyone who was going to the con </connor>
<connor> was staying in this hotel. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like I'm in the elevator, sorry, lift. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Wow, you've changed. You've changed. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I've changed. So I got on the lift, right? </connor>
<connor> And there's this guy, and he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh wow, you're CDawg, right?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Yeah. Hi, what's up?" </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Can I have a picture?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, sure, let's do it. Let's do." </connor>
<connor> So like I'm taking a picture with this guy, </connor>
<connor> and he's like trying to get his phone ready, </connor>
<connor> and he's like giving stuff to his girlfriend </connor>
<connor> or whoever this is. </connor>
<connor> And his girlfriend's like, "Honey, who is this guy?" </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "You know, it's CDawg." </connor>
<connor> And she's like, "All right." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Yeah, I used to watch his videos." </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - So it's such a backhanded compliment. </joey>
<garnt> - Bro, that's a bro moment. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a bro moment. </joey>
<connor> - And he said this to her and looked at me and just smiled, </connor>
<connor> like, "Ready for the picture?" </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What the fuck?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Unravel, stars playing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I used to watch his pictures, I mean videos. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "What the fuck, dude?" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Where you just like, "What happened?" </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I get it, maybe you got busier and stuff. </connor>
<connor> But could you say that little later? </connor>
<garnt> Why are you gonna say it to my face? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] That's kinda like saying- </garnt>
<joey> - Did you just get like L plus ratio plus fell off. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This guy was like, "I used to watch his videos," </connor>
<connor> and then he just smiled at me. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What bro, what do you mean 'used too'?" </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I guess like one notable thing was the panel </joey>
<garnt> that we had on Sunday. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, how did that go? 'Cause I wasn't there. </garnt>
<garnt> - So the Saturday panel </garnt>
<connor> was kind of like a Q&A type of thing, right? </connor>
<connor> So it was like, there was a microphone in the crowd, </connor>
<connor> people could come up and ask the questions, </connor>
<connor> and we'd answered type of thing. </connor>
<connor> But the Sunday one, it was like the title of it was </connor>
<connor> A Conversation with the Anime Man CDawgVA. </connor>
<connor> So we structured a kind of like... </connor>
<connor> It was me and Connor on the stage, </connor>
<connor> and then we kind of had like an MC type of thing, </connor>
<connor> who was there to navigate and ask general questions </connor>
<connor> to like get a flow of conversation going. </connor>
<connor> And because we asked this MC guy, </connor>
<garnt> who was a great MC, mind you, but it was very last minute. </garnt>
<garnt> And he obviously didn't know who me and Connor were, </garnt>
<joey> what we do. </joey>
<joey> He only knew like a very baseline information. </joey>
<joey> So, obviously, a lot of the questions </joey>
<joey> were like very general, </joey>
<joey> but (chuckles) then there was one question. </joey>
<joey> He was like something along the lines of like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I was an MC for your wife, Sidsnap. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> And he was like looking straight at me. </connor>
<joey> - And I was like, "Ah," and I looked at Connor, </joey>
<joey> and we kind of like met eyes, and I looked back at the MC, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Could you repeat that?" </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> He was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, yeah, your fiance and wife Sydney or Sidsnap, </joey>
<joey> she was telling me all these stories </joey>
<joey> about planning for the wedding and all that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> and there was a murmur happening in the crowd. </joey>
<joey> And I was like... </joey>
<joey> And I just like slowly pulled my hand out, and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm Joey, by the way, </joey>
<joey> nice to meet you." (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "No, no, you're Grant or Garnt, right?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Is this really happening? </joey>
<joey> Is accidental racism happening live on stage right now?" </joey>
<joey> And I think people in the crowd were kind of like, </joey>
<joey> "Ah, yeah, funny bit. </joey>
<joey> Got nice execution, nice landing guys." </joey>
<joey> And meanwhile, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "This motherfucker literally confused me with Garnt." </joey>
<joey> Like, what? All Asians look the same now? </joey>
<joey> Is that how it is? (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Congratulations on getting married to Sydney, by the way. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you. Thank you. </joey>
<garnt> - Hope the wedding goes well. (chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> - You know, I've been planning for a while now. </connor>
<joey> You know how it is. Whew! (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I think Alan said it best last night, </joey>
<garnt> he was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Wow, I can't believe he confused the Anime Zone </joey>
<garnt> with the Anime Man. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Easy mistake, you know. </connor>
<joey> Easy mistake. - It's an easy mistake. </joey>
<connor> - Easy mistake, yeah. - It's like, </connor>
<connor> "Aw, when you put it that way, </connor>
<joey> it's fair enough." (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - None of you are watching anime, right? </connor>
<joey> - Well, he would love us to watch an anime. </joey>
<connor> - I could sympathize with him. </connor>
<connor> He kinda got dragged to do it last minute. </connor>
<connor> - And I could tell when like... </connor>
<joey> And he was like trying to double down on it on our cast. </joey>
<joey> - That was the thing where I was like, </joey>
<joey> "No, no, come on, dude." (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> He was like, "No, I'm sure it was something, something." </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "No, just move on, dude. </joey>
<joey> And then there was a moment during the panel </joey>
<joey> where like people in the crowd started to laugh </joey>
<joey> when he doubled down, and just like wouldn't land. </joey>
<joey> And he just like put both his hands in his face, </joey>
<connor> and he was just like, "Oh no, I've made a horrible mistake." </connor>
<connor> And I was like- - Aw- </connor>
<joey> "No, don't worry, man. - I feel so bad. </joey>
<joey> - It's fine. It was funny." </joey>
<joey> It was funny and harmless, </joey>
<garnt> and, you know, great story for the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, "It's whatever." </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, but other than that- </joey>
<garnt> - Why are you Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You are Garnt. </garnt>
<joey> - I am not Garnt. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> You are Garnt. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> Why are you Garnt? - Oh, God. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that was an interesting- </joey>
<joey> - I got somethin', </joey>
<garnt> like I got recognized in some interesting place. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, (laughing) one funny thing that happened actually was, </garnt>
<garnt> so, I got recognized by someone </garnt>
<connor> and took a picture with them, </connor>
<connor> and they were like, "You're not gonna believe this. </connor>
<connor> I saw the most convincing Sydney lookalike </connor>
<connor> I've ever seen in my life." (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh, okay, let me see this. What's that like? </connor>
<joey> I wanna see if there's a my wife lookalike. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Sidsnap is funny. </joey>
<joey> - He slightly like gets out's phone, puts the picture on, </joey>
<joey> starts swiping like furiously. </joey>
<garnt> And then he goes, "Look at that. </garnt>
<garnt> Does that not look like Sydney?" </garnt>
<garnt> And it's him standing next to Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Pretty damn good look-alike. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "My guy, I think that's just Sydney." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Let me show you another picture." </connor>
<garnt> So he shows me a full body shot of Sydney, (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "No, I think you just got a picture of Sydney." </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna know what Sydney looks like in this guy's head. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the real Sydney, what it looks like in this guy's head. </garnt>
<connor> - So, how did he take a picture of Sydney </connor>
<connor> and like explain it to her? </connor>
<garnt> - No, because what he explained to me was, </garnt>
<garnt> "No, you don't understand. </garnt>
<garnt> I asked her if she was Sidsnap, and she said, "No." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] What?! </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Because Sydney being the troll that she is, </connor>
<connor> sometimes she's like, "Are you Sydney?" </connor>
<connor> She's like, "No." (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> So this guy's like, "Can we take a picture? </connor>
<garnt> I just gotta, you look so much like Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> I just need to take a picture." </garnt>
<garnt> So Sydney takes- - I can't believe </garnt>
<joey> he was convinced by that. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Just like, "Well, I guess she's not, then." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, he's like, so what he was saying was he told me, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, she looks like Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> and she sounded like Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> but she told me she wasn't Sydney." </garnt>
<connor> - So, this British dude, </connor>
<connor> so there was an American Sydney look-alike </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> in London. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think he thought she must have been cosplaying Sydney. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Wait, that's a wig, right? </joey>
<joey> That's what you really wear. </joey>
<connor> - He was saying, "It's your girl?" (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I can't believe Sydney committed to this like at heart. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember 'cause like I was with a friend... </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we were outside a hotel, and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he refused to believe me (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> that it was like Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, I turned to my friend, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can you go get Sydney please?" </garnt>
<garnt> He was just like sort of like shell shocked, </garnt>
<garnt> like it was like speech a hundred. </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney had like convinced him that she just was not Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> by saying one line that "I am not Sidsnap." </garnt>
<garnt> And then, so my friend gets Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> and the first thing she says is, "You stupid motherfucker." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Joe Baden. </joey>
<joey> - Joe Baden. </joey>
<joey> - I love how all it took for Sydney to get away </joey>
<joey> from that situation was her just saying, "No." </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, this guy's in a full fuckin' disguise, </joey>
<joey> and he can't get away with it at all. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe I should've just been like, </connor>
<joey> "No, I'm not-" - You should've just been </joey>
<joey> like, "Are you CDawg?" </joey>
<connor> He's like, "No." - No, I'm not CDawg. </connor>
<joey> - Then, it's like, "Oh, well, fuck, I guess not." </joey>
<connor> - "Oh, I love your videos." </connor>
<garnt> "Who? What videos? - "Who? What?" </garnt>
<joey> - "I don't watch- - "Do you know who we are?" </joey>
<connor> - YouTube videos." - You did it again, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - Well, to be fair, you weren't CDawg that weekend, </joey>
<joey> you were CDawgz. (laughs) - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> One of my favorite pictures of the entire weekend </garnt>
<garnt> was just your like face of just confusion </garnt>
<garnt> in front of your picture. </garnt>
<connor> - It wasn't even like me pulling a... </connor>
<joey> I was just walking. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he was literally just walking, </joey>
<connor> and I just like took a candid shot </connor>
<connor> of Connor just being like, "Ugh," </connor>
<joey> in front of a sign that said CDawgzVA. </joey>
<garnt> - It just looked like... </garnt>
<garnt> Your face just looked like you had just gone through, </garnt>
<garnt> like you'd seen the end of the universe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you wanna explain what happened? </garnt>
<joey> Could you explain what this is? </joey>
<joey> - So at the signing, </joey>
<joey> we had like a dedicated section for our signing. </joey>
<connor> There was a picture of all three of us </connor>
<connor> that said Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> And then there was individual photos </connor>
<joey> of like The Anime Man, Gigg. </joey>
<joey> And then, (chuckles) next to that, </joey>
<joey> there was a picture of Connor, </joey>
<joey> but it's instead of saying CDawgVA, </joey>
<joey> it said, CDawgz with a Z, VA. </joey>
<joey> And I remember, I was admiring the posters, being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, we look sick in these." </joey>
<joey> And then I did a double take with Connor, it was like, </joey>
<joey> "C, what?" (laughing) </joey>
<joey> He said, (laughing) "I don't know what's CDawgzVA." </joey>
<connor> - Me neither. I liked the name. </connor>
<connor> - And I was just like, Connor, </connor>
<joey> you should change your name to CDawgzVA. </joey>
<joey> It looks so sick." (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It was that. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we'd come in the next day, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like black tower mark, </garnt>
<joey> and I laughed even harder. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It was the most like inconspicuous. </garnt>
<connor> Like, yeah, then to pretend that never happened. </connor>
<connor> - They fixed it. - We got this. </connor>
<joey> They fixed it. - They fixed it eventually. </joey>
<connor> - I just kind of felt, I was like, "I don't care." </connor>
<connor> Everyone kept carrying out to me like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow, you must be so offended." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Why would I give a shit?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I've had that happen before. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, </connor>
<joey> I've had that happen before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was just like, "I don't really care." </joey>
<joey> It's not like I'm suddenly now like a different person. </joey>
<joey> It's not like a file location </joey>
<connor> where if you type in the wrong thing, </connor>
<joey> It's like dot C, dot EXE is missing. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I'm still here. </joey>
<connor> - At least, the large majority of your name </connor>
<connor> was still there and intact. </connor>
<joey> Like I've been to a convention where they had a sign up, </joey>
<joey> and it said, "The Anime Guy." </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, - The Anime Guy. </joey>
<joey> - "That's just a completely different person." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - They must have done that on purpose to fuck with you. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, they weren't. </joey>
<joey> They genuinely thought I was The Anime Guy. </joey>
<connor> And I didn't have the heart to tell them </connor>
<connor> at the time. - Yeah, just another timeline. </connor>
<connor> - I was just like, "All right, you know what? </connor>
<joey> It's good enough. Fuck it." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, for me, like every convention I go to, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a 50/50 chance of whether it be Gigguk or GiggUK. </garnt>
<joey> That is like, I swear, </joey>
<joey> half the conventions I go to is just GiggUK, unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - I guess it's our fault </joey>
<joey> for having confusing names. - You're in London, </joey>
<connor> it should've been GiggUK. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it makes sense, right? (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's when we go to like Australia, </garnt>
<joey> it'll be GiggAUS, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, GiggAUS. </joey>
<joey> - Or just GiggUS. </joey>
<connor> - In like US. </connor>
<joey> - GiggUS in America. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, like another thing like I noticed </joey>
<joey> is just like every time you hang out with your mates </joey>
<joey> or you were somewhere where you think you're private, </joey>
<connor> it's just like if someone mentions that, </connor>
<connor> wouldn't this be a funny time for you to get noticed, </connor>
<connor> it is like the worst fuckin', </connor>
<connor> it's like summoning the devil, it is going to happen. </connor>
<connor> ¡Cause that happened to me. </connor>
<connor> Well, it happened to me indirectly, right? </connor>
<connor> Because, so we were outside a hotel, </connor>
<connor> and we were just chilling out there. </connor>
<connor> It was pretty late at night. It was about 1:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> And we see this guy just stumble over to like the tree, </connor>
<connor> and he just starts throwing up. </connor>
<connor> And we were just like, "Fuck, who is..." </connor>
<connor> "Is he all right?" </connor>
<connor> He's obviously not in the right state of mind. </connor>
<connor> I dunno where his mates are. </connor>
<connor> So we go over to him, </connor>
<connor> and he's obviously had too many drinks that night. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And unfortunately, he didn't know where his mates were, </connor>
<connor> which if you're watching this, guy, if you're watching this, </connor>
<connor> and you happen to be a Trash Taste watcher, </connor>
<connor> get better mates. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<joey> - You don't leave your mates out like that. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - That's quite fucked up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, he was by the tree. </connor>
<connor> Luckily, some guys, like a father had found him </connor>
<joey> and was trying to make sure that he was okay. </joey>
<joey> And so we went over and started to help out as well, </joey>
<joey> just to make sure that he was kosher and everything, </joey>
<joey> making sure that- </joey>
<joey> - He was all right. </joey>
<joey> - He was all right, he was gonna get home. </joey>
<connor> So we managed to contact his sister, and keep in mind, </connor>
<connor> this like 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM, </connor>
<connor> like he's just out here in the middle of London, </connor>
<connor> and she was like, I believe, on the other side of London </connor>
<connor> or something. - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - And we were like, "Can you come pick your brother up?" </connor>
<connor> And you know, being, being the gigachad sister that she was, </connor>
<connor> she's like, "Yeah, yeah, just tell me where he is. </connor>
<connor> Just let me get there now, I'll come bring him home. </connor>
<connor> So we were with him </connor>
<connor> for like a good like half hour to 45 minutes, </connor>
<connor> making sure he was okay, making sure he was warm, </connor>
<connor> making sure he wasn't too passed out. </connor>
<connor> - That's nice. - And just, </connor>
<connor> hopefully being a good Samaritan </connor>
<connor> while waiting for this mythical sister </connor>
<joey> to come pick him up. - Being a good replacement </joey>
<garnt> for the shit mates </garnt>
<garnt> that he particularly has. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And so we're with him for half an hour to 45 minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I go into the toilet quickly, </garnt>
<connor> and then as I come outside, </connor>
<connor> apparently when I was in the toilets, </connor>
<connor> this mythical sister comes. </connor>
<connor> And she's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, thank you so much for taking care of my brother. </connor>
<connor> I'm so sorry. I dunno what's happened to his mates. </connor>
<connor> I dunno what's happened to him. </connor>
<connor> I'll make sure he gets home okay." </connor>
<connor> And then like the next line, </connor>
<connor> which is the line I heard </connor>
<connor> as I was walking out the door to go outside again was, </connor>
<connor> "By the way, did you guys see the Trash Taste boys </connor>
<connor> in MCM today? (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What, the sister said this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, the sister said this, right. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - My mates told me it was like sitcom level timing. </joey>
<joey> She was like so compassionate. </joey>
<joey> And then she was just trying to make conversation. </joey>
<joey> And then, she just mentioned, </joey>
<joey> "Did you guys manage to see the Trash Taste boys?" </joey>
<joey> - And then, what? </joey>
<connor> You just like slowly back inside, right? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, and then the automatic doors open. </connor>
<garnt> And then everyone looks at me, and she just goes, </garnt>
<garnt> "No, no! You?!" (Joey and Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - But you were on the phone with her, right? </joey>
<connor> - No, I wasn't on the phone with here. </connor>
<connor> It was someone else on the phone, but they had mentioned </connor>
<connor> that we had a bunch of guys taking care of her brother. </connor>
<connor> I was like the guy who was just like chatting to him, </connor>
<connor> trying to make sure, </connor>
<connor> trying to know what the fuck happened to him tonight </connor>
<connor> and make sure he felt comfortable and that shit. </connor>
<connor> And she was just like, "You were taking care of him?!" </connor>
<connor> You!? You?!" (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "Are you the sister? </connor>
<connor> Are you the mythical sister?" And she's like, "Yes." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, first I said, </connor>
<connor> "Thank you so much for being amazing." </connor>
<connor> I could tell like she was like </connor>
<connor> trying to hold in her excitement. </connor>
<connor> And then, she pauses for a second. </connor>
<connor> She looks at her brother, dead on the floor. </connor>
<connor> And she's like, </connor>
<connor> "I know this is a bad time, (Joey and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> but is it cool if I ask for a picture?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, no! It doesn't even sound real, dude. </connor>
<connor> - 100% it happened, and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Look, you were like such a gigachad </connor>
<connor> for coming all the way out here, like 1:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> Luckily, we had other people to take care of her brother. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> We take a quick picture, she goes home, and everyone's safe. </garnt>
<joey> Everyone's safe. </joey>
<garnt> - Please tell me the brother was in the shot. </garnt>
<joey> Like in the background. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like that mean picture of the guy </joey>
<joey> like leaning towards the grave and like doing that. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Except it's like </joey>
<joey> the brother's just like dead on the floor, like. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - That doesn't even sound real. </connor>
<connor> Like it sounds so like in between his ass. </connor>
<connor> - It does, it was like so surreal. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's so funny. </connor>
<connor> One of the funniest things that happened to me that weekend. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> But yes, it's just like, </connor>
<garnt> sometimes you just have like really weird coincidences </garnt>
<garnt> and weird timings with shit, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is like the words you must never utter at a con. </garnt>
<joey> Of like, huh, what if? Hilarious, right? </joey>
<joey> And then almost every single time, </joey>
<joey> it's like, "Oh, hi," from a distance. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right. </garnt>
<joey> - Fuck's sake. Where's the canned laugh? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's the live audience? (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Aside from MCM, though, </connor>
<connor> how is your guys experience being back in the UK now? </connor>
<connor> This is your second time- - Good, good. </connor>
<connor> - in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Only my second time, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno if you had a lot of chance </joey>
<connor> to explore England outside of- </connor>
<connor> - No, we've been in... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the MCM in London is kind of outta the way, </connor>
<connor> so we've kind of been just kind of contained there. </connor>
<joey> - And like the first time I was around, </joey>
<connor> I think in like 2017, 2018, whenever it was, </connor>
<connor> I was mostly in Brighton at Garnt's place. </connor>
<connor> So I think I was only in London for maybe like a day or so. </connor>
<connor> I think this will be like my first proper time </connor>
<connor> kind of like getting to check it out. </connor>
<garnt> And I've already seen way more of London </garnt>
<garnt> than I ever did last time, </garnt>
<garnt> so, yeah it's been, it's been chill. </garnt>
<connor> I mean the weather's been fantastic this weekend as well, </connor>
<connor> which is great. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like everyone was like, "Oh yeah," </connor>
<connor> when I tweeted about like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, I'm landing in London soon. </connor>
<connor> Haha, it's gonna be sick." </connor>
<connor> And everyone was just like, "Weather's gonna be shit." </connor>
<connor> "Shit weather, </connor>
<connor> "Expect the shit weather." - It's been good. </connor>
<connor> It's really good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and I landed, and I was just like- </connor>
<connor> - Brought the red carpet. - What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> This is shit weather, you guys?! </joey>
<garnt> - Literally, I remember the first day meeting you all. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, you couldn't ask for like better weather. </garnt>
<garnt> It was literally clear skies. </garnt>
<joey> It was clear blue skies. - Yeah, it was like warm, </joey>
<garnt> like not too hot, like nice and toasty, bright. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, perfect, sunglasses. </garnt>
<garnt> Like having a coffee outside type of weather. </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone was like, "Yeah, shit weather, shit weather." </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, "Oh man, you guys got it good here." </garnt>
<joey> Apparently though, it was just like an absolute fluke. </joey>
<joey> Like everyone was like, "Damn, this is fucked. </joey>
<joey> It's actually good weather here. Jesus." </joey>
<connor> - I think around this time of year it's okay, though. </connor>
<joey> - This is a pretty good time </joey>
<connor> to come to London. - Because the last time </connor>
<connor> I was in the UK, </connor>
<connor> it was like the biggest heat wave in like 30 years </connor>
<connor> or whatever it was. - That's like every year. </connor>
<connor> It's the biggest heat wave every fuckin' year. </connor>
<connor> - We get one week, or in your case, </connor>
<connor> it was like the one month of just- </connor>
<connor> - That was really fuckin' hot that time you came. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like holy shit. - I remember that time. </connor>
<connor> - Like the heat wave in the UK, </connor>
<garnt> just we are not built for it. </garnt>
<joey> - And I was just like, "Where's the AC?" </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> "Where's the AC?" </connor>
<connor> - We don't have any. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah, it's been good so far. </connor>
<connor> I haven't really done anything. Oh God. </connor>
<connor> Dude, I haven't really awkward interaction at the hotel. </connor>
<connor> It was really like (gasping) </connor>
<connor> That was of an awkwardness. - Which one? </connor>
<connor> (Connor gasping) </connor>
<connor> - Well, so we were in the hotel bar </connor>
<connor> just talking to all our friends. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's the Sunday, it's after the cons end, </connor>
<connor> and everyone's just chilling. </connor>
<connor> We're all just hanging out, </connor>
<connor> saying goodbye to all our friends. </connor>
<connor> And this person was like pretty chill at first. </connor>
<connor> And like they would kind come up and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, hi, do you wanna drink or anything?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh no, it's okay, it's okay." </connor>
<connor> And I got my friend to buy me a drink instead. </connor>
<connor> I didn't that their money. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then, they were kinda like, just kept saying hi, </connor>
<connor> which is fine. </connor>
<connor> Like it's chill, 'cause people do it all the time, </connor>
<connor> and it's like, whatever. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, probably a couple of drinks deep at that point? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> If someone's having a bunch of drinks </connor>
<connor> and enjoying themselves, they wanna be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God. Yeah, hi, you're there." </connor>
<connor> It's like, whatever. I don't mind that. </connor>
<connor> But I noticed that like whenever we would like... </connor>
<connor> If I went outside or like any of you guys went outside, </connor>
<connor> they would like kind of like also then happen to go outside </connor>
<connor> at the same time </connor>
<connor> and just listen to whatever you're talking about. </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, I'd go to the toilet, then suddenly, </connor>
<connor> they were in the toilet as well. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Okay, this is like," </connor>
<joey> all right, a little sauce, but like nothing happened. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, "All right, cool, cool, cool. It's chill." </joey>
<joey> - It's kinda like tailgating a little bit, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it just kinda like watching, I guess, </connor>
<connor> which is, obviously, it's like not ideal, </connor>
<connor> but it's nothing bad. </connor>
<connor> It's like I'm more like, "All right, whatever." </connor>
<connor> But then like you guys went to bed, </connor>
<connor> and there was only maybe like six of us left. </connor>
<connor> We were chilling. </connor>
<connor> And there was like two couches, </connor>
<connor> and there's like an empty space </connor>
<connor> because obviously, you guys had gone to bed and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And they came over, and they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, do you mind if I like take the seat?" </connor>
<connor> It was like 1:00 AM, so it's kind of winding down. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I don't really think that's appropriate </connor>
<connor> 'cause like no one really knows you. </connor>
<connor> You don't really know me. </connor>
<connor> And like, you know, it's kinda weird and stuff." </connor>
<connor> And they were like, "Oh, oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> Well, do you mind if I just introduce myself </joey>
<joey> to everyone then?" - No. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like (inhales deeply) </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, no, I don't think that's like the best. </joey>
<joey> I appreciate it, but like, no, </joey>
<connor> it makes this a bit uncomfortable. </connor>
<joey> - So the doing intention is there, </joey>
<connor> but they clearly didn't quite read the room- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I was trying to be as like polite, </joey>
<joey> but like no as possible. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> like there's still somebody who, even though, </joey>
<joey> I guess some people would be like, </joey>
<joey> "No, you have the promotion to be like 'fuck off' </joey>
<joey> at that point." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause people say that, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I still don't wanna do that." </joey>
<joey> Like to me, it's like, "There's still a person." </joey>
<connor> - I don't wanna be that guy, right? </connor>
<connor> - They shoot at their shot, and it didn't work. </connor>
<joey> And they should've just given up at that point. </joey>
<connor> But then, after I said that again, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "No, I don't think that's..." </connor>
<connor> "Come on, man, like no," </connor>
<connor> They just kinda like stood there awkwardly, </connor>
<connor> just like looking at us. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> And then, it was just kinda like, </connor>
<connor> all my friends were just looking at me like, </connor>
<joey> and I was like, "Yeah." </joey>
<joey> - Like "Yeah, please do something." </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "Okay, all right, man, bye." </joey>
<joey> Wouldn't leave, and then one of our friends just goes, </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> What the fuck did he say? </joey>
<joey> He was like, "Just please leave us alone." </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Like he was begging in like a pleading way. </connor>
<connor> It was like, "Please just leave us alone." </connor>
<connor> - Please! </connor>
<connor> - Please, just leave us alone. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I know who. I think I can guess who the guy is. </garnt>
<joey> - It was such a like desperate way that the person was like, </joey>
<connor> "Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry." (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was just like, "Oh no," </connor>
<connor> but that was really funny the way he said that. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) It was really. </garnt>
<garnt> - Please, leave us alone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Please, leave us alone. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey whining) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, when you hang out at the bar at the convention, </connor>
<connor> in the convention hotel, this shit is gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> Like if we really wanted to go somewhere else </connor>
<connor> and like avoid this shit, we could've. </connor>
<connor> But like we just wanted the convenience. </connor>
<connor> We were all staying in that hotel. It's chill. </connor>
<connor> So like when people do shit like that, </connor>
<connor> I know people get like, </connor>
<connor> "That's fucked up that they did that." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, it's not ideal." </connor>
<connor> But I'm also like, you know, </connor>
<connor> "People get excited, they shoot their shot. </connor>
<connor> They didn't do anything. </connor>
<connor> They asked. They didn't just sit down." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause people have done that before. </connor>
<connor> People just fuckin' pull and grab. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but we've been good. - On the panel, for instance. </joey>
<garnt> - See, I'm glad people can now know </garnt>
<connor> that we aren't bullshitting. </connor>
<connor> - No, like you can... </connor>
<connor> You have the right, anyone has the right to be like, </connor>
<joey> "Hey, can I join you?" </joey>
<joey> And I have the right to say, </joey>
<joey> "No, fuck off." - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> Like I'm not gonna get at someone </connor>
<garnt> for trying to shoot their shot. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you want to, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it kind of rude and insensitive to do it? Yeah, it is. </garnt>
<connor> But at the same time- </connor>
<joey> - But at same time, like respect my privacy. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> If you did it respectfully, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna give you the respect to be like, </joey>
<connor> explain it nicely and be like, "That's not appropriate, no." </connor>
<connor> And if you don't get it, </connor>
<connor> then (chuckles) maybe one of my friends won't be so nice. </connor>
<connor> But I'll still be nice, but I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Please just leave alone. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I just say these stories 'cause it's on my mind, </connor>
<connor> wanted to talk about it, </connor>
<connor> but I know it's gonna happen again. </connor>
<connor> It's not gonna be the last time. </connor>
<connor> If you ever see me around, and you ask to sit next to me, </connor>
<joey> I'm probably gonna say no 99... </joey>
<joey> No, fuck it, I am gonna say no 99- </joey>
<connor> - 100% of the time. </connor>
<connor> - 100% of the time. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna say no probably 'cause I don't know you, </connor>
<garnt> and it's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like- </garnt>
<connor> - It's not organic. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think in a convention setting, </connor>
<connor> it's hard to like draw like a comfortable line, you know? </connor>
<connor> Whereas maybe if you meet someone at a bar, </connor>
<connor> and you're not with like a massive group of friends </connor>
<connor> or whatever- - It's different. </connor>
<connor> - it's different. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely different. </joey>
<joey> - It's very different. </joey>
<joey> It's you kind of do have to like read the room sometimes, </joey>
<connor> which I know some people aren't as in tune with that </connor>
<connor> as other people. </connor>
<connor> But you try not to hold things against people </connor>
<connor> unless they like seriously do cross like a social boundary, </connor>
<connor> in which case, </connor>
<connor> maybe I should listen to fuckin' Ditus more </connor>
<joey> and just be like, "Sorry man." </joey>
<connor> - Did you use the man technique? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, did you use the man- </connor>
<connor> - I dunno, I think I just waffled on </connor>
<connor> for 10 minutes (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Just being like, "No, no. </connor>
<connor> Here's another reason why no. Here's another reason why no. </connor>
<connor> Here's another reason why." </connor>
<garnt> - If he would've just said, "Sorry, man," </garnt>
<joey> then they would be like, "All right, man, I respect that." </joey>
<joey> - "I respect," that's what we should've said </joey>
<joey> to that guy who came on stage. </joey>
<garnt> Fuck, he was right all along! </garnt>
<joey> - I should've just turned and being like, "Sorry man." </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - "Sorry, man, this just aint' the place, man." </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, man. </connor>
<connor> - There was this one dude, </connor>
<connor> and I like (chuckles) still don't know what his deal was. </connor>
<connor> I was like, we were at the bar with John, </connor>
<connor> and John was talking to me, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "John, man, yeah, it sucks, dude." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Yeah, it kind sucks." </connor>
<garnt> - Super Eyepatch. - Super Eyepatch. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry, sorry. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I did it, I did it. </garnt>
<garnt> - You literally just did it! </garnt>
<joey> - I did it, I did it. </joey>
<joey> - What did you tell Garnt before? </joey>
<connor> - But we've said John like a million times, right? </connor>
<connor> I should've said Kevin too. - It's just there's </connor>
<joey> so many other John's. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Literally, such a common name. </joey>
<connor> - I was in my own head, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> Okay, that's my bad. I suck, dude. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I was telling Super Eyepatch Wolf, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Yeah, man, it sucks, dude. </connor>
<connor> I don't feel like I can't really like experience </connor>
<connor> a con the way I used to." </connor>
<connor> And then while (chuckles) I'm telling this story to John, </connor>
<connor> this guy who must have been like 40 or 50ish </connor>
<connor> just shouts full on from across the bar. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Hey, Connor, Connor, you want a drink? </connor>
<connor> You want a drink?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Nah, I'm good man." </connor>
<connor> And John was like, "You know that guy?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "No fuckin' clue." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I know, it's just like so weird. </connor>
<garnt> - I get it because that happened to me a few times </garnt>
<connor> in other conventions. </connor>
<garnt> - He was nice enough. </garnt>
<connor> He just asked me, and I was like, "No." </connor>
<garnt> And that was it. That was it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because they shout your name in such familiarity </garnt>
<joey> that even I have to double take to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Do I know this guy?" - Yeah, yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Do you know what I mean? - Yeah. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Do you know what I mean? (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause like a few times when I hang out with mates, </garnt>
<garnt> like I will hear like, "Garnt, hey, Garnt." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Oh it's... </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, I've never met this man in my life." (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like friend of a friend? No? </joey>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Don't offer me a drink. </connor>
<connor> "I'm privileged," as you all say, so don't fuckin'... </connor>
<connor> I don't need it. I'm good. </connor>
<connor> - He can buy his own drink. </connor>
<connor> - I buy my own y'all, I promise. </connor>
<joey> I appreciate it, though. </joey>
<joey> Some people are just nice. </joey>
<joey> I had one time I was in London last time... </joey>
<joey> I never told this. </joey>
<joey> It was like someone in like a Mexican restaurant. </joey>
<joey> It was like the thing in the movie. </joey>
<connor> It was like, </connor>
<connor> "That person over there wants to buy you a drink," </connor>
<connor> when the waiter came over, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "This is fuckin' cool. Yeah, I'll have it." </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> He bought me like the strongest drink on the fuckin' menu. </connor>
<joey> And I was like (coughing) </joey>
<connor> - It's like trying to spike you. </connor>
<joey> - So then I realized, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I'm not doing this again. </joey>
<connor> I'm not letting them choose the drink." </connor>
<joey> - The weirder one for me is like the ones </joey>
<joey> where it's like just in passing, </joey>
<connor> but you're also like not too sure either </connor>
<connor> because the lack of information. </connor>
<connor> Like it's the ones where you're like, </connor>
<connor> where you're in the hotel lobby, </connor>
<connor> and you're trying to get to the toilet or something. </connor>
<joey> And then a person is walking past you, </joey>
<joey> and you just very briefly have eye contact, </joey>
<joey> and they just go. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then they walk off, and I'm just like, "Do I know you?" </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - This is something like "The Number 23" shit. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, "Wake up." </joey>
<connor> It's like, "Wake up." (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - That does happen a lot. </joey>
<joey> - It does happen a lot. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like... </joey>
<joey> And it's not until I turn around, </joey>
<connor> and sometimes, they'll turn around and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, love you stuff," </connor>
<connor> or like, "Hope you're having a good night," </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that." </connor>
<joey> You know, maybe they're just being friendly. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> But it's like, it's just the silent nod. </joey>
<joey> Like, what? Is this code for something? (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> Yeah, but it's cool, though. (Connor burps) </connor>
<joey> - Sorry. </joey>
<connor> - It's cool. </connor>
<connor> Like, that's the one thing, I guess, as well, </connor>
<garnt> that I've just been like kind of getting back used to again, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like, I personally have been stuck in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> for the past three years now, </garnt>
<connor> and it's like stranger friendliness is not as big of a thing </connor>
<connor> as it is, say, in like the UK, right? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially in a con setting, so it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just getting used to just random people </garnt>
<garnt> just being like, "Hey." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we've gone from like- - It's strange. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like it has been like just us readjusting </connor>
<connor> and reacclimating to con culture </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's been like such a... </connor>
<connor> We've gone from like zero to like 200% </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> in like the span of a day. </connor>
<connor> And it just like, I'd forgotten, one, </connor>
<connor> how intense it was before, </connor>
<connor> like before COVID and everything. </connor>
<connor> And now, it's like even more intense 'cause, one, </connor>
<connor> COVID'S happened, </connor>
<connor> everyone's even more excited and enthusiastic. </connor>
<connor> And also, we are way more recognizable. </connor>
<garnt> So it's just kind of like all culminated </garnt>
<garnt> into this massive stirring pot. </garnt>
<joey> - I know like for me it was... </joey>
<joey> I caught myself being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh man, it's been such a long time </joey>
<joey> since I've been to a con," </joey>
<joey> because there's so many times during the signing, </joey>
<joey> where like, 'cause you're meeting so many people, </joey>
<joey> you start to get into like a pattern of things to say. </joey>
<connor> It's like, you start off with the hello. </connor>
<connor> Like, "How's your con experience been? </connor>
<connor> How's your day been?" whatever. </connor>
<connor> And then (chuckles) there was so many times </connor>
<connor> where like people would be like, </connor>
<joey> "I hope you enjoy your time in the UK." </joey>
<joey> And I'd be like, "Yeah, you too." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> As if they're not from here. (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> - Well, there was a lot of people actually </connor>
<connor> who are like not from the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's like clearly, </joey>
<joey> every time I said "you too" to that question, </joey>
<joey> it was always the most like British sounding person ever. </joey>
<joey> I was like, yeah, as if they don't live here. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, "Ah, damn it." </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I said that a few times, not to that, </garnt>
<connor> but like, "Oh, thanks a lot for your content," </connor>
<connor> I go, "You too." </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, "How did you know?" </connor>
<connor> - Okay, it's not a con experience. </connor>
<connor> We had a cab back, me and Joey and a few other friends. </connor>
<connor> And it was like 41 pounds, this cab ride. </connor>
<joey> This, this cab ride. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you know, I went to go pay. </connor>
<joey> I gave the guy, 'cause I only had like 10s, </joey>
<joey> so I gave the guy 50, right? </joey>
<joey> So, in my head, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, it's been like three years </joey>
<joey> or like since I've been like tipping normally." </joey>
<joey> and I know that sometimes you tip cab drivers </joey>
<joey> in London and stuff, and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, yeah, yeah, I forgot about this." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I never took cabs when I lived here before. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, it was late, </joey>
<joey> and we were in like the middle of nowhere. </joey>
<joey> So, I pay this guy, and then he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll give you the change. </joey>
<joey> Just get out the car, and I'll give you the change." </joey>
<connor> So I get out the car, and I'm kind of just tired, </connor>
<connor> it's like 3:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> Like, "Bro, I just wanna go to bed." </connor>
<connor> And so the guy, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, so can I have my change?" </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the way I tip, I don't know if you do this, </connor>
<joey> I want all my change first- </joey>
<joey> - And then you give some back? </joey>
<connor> - Then I will be like, "Here's here's your tip," right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And so (chuckles) I was like, "Oh, can I have my change?" </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "What?" </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And he looked at me like. </connor>
<connor> I asked for change, and then he just looked at me </connor>
<connor> like he wanted me to take it back. </connor>
<connor> Like he wanted me to pretend like I did- </connor>
<connor> - Say sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Say sorry. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Bro, what the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> I was gonna tip him, and now he's being weird about it, </connor>
<joey> and now I wana tip him less. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like, "Just gimme my fuckin'..." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Nine pounds is a lot," right? </joey>
<joey> This is not America. We don't tip 20%. </joey>
<joey> I was gonna give him like a five. That was my plan. </joey>
<connor> And then I was like, "You're being weird about this, man. </connor>
<connor> Just gimme my fuckin' money back, </connor>
<connor> and I'll give you some back." </connor>
<joey> I was like, "What the fuck, dude?" </joey>
<joey> - That's not cool. </joey>
<joey> - And so, I'm like, "All right, yeah, yeah." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Can I have my change?" </joey>
<joey> And then he like looks at me. </joey>
<connor> Again, I wanna say it was the most awkward </connor>
<connor> five to 10 seconds of my life. </connor>
<connor> I felt like Za Warudo in Jojo. </connor>
<connor> I could feel the one second, two seconds. </connor>
<joey> And I feel like he was trying to figure out if I was drunk, </joey>
<joey> I was fine, but I felt like he was trying to see if like, </joey>
<connor> he was like, (inhales deeply) "Can I get away with this?" </connor>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<connor> And so he goes into his car, he like rummages around, </connor>
<connor> and he comes out, and he just gives me five pounds. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Dude, all right, okay, fine." </connor>
<joey> - He's probably thinking like, </joey>
<joey> "Maybe if I just give him some money, </joey>
<connor> he might just shut up about it. </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna give you the five pound notes. </connor>
<connor> Now you got four pound because you're being a dick. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, "Just gimme my money back, </connor>
<connor> and I'll tip you!" </connor>
<connor> It's like, "What the fuck?!" </connor>
<joey> And I was just like, "What a weird experience." </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, the people in the car were just like vibing. </joey>
<connor> They know that I'm like having like this mind battle </connor>
<connor> with this cab driver. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Just tip him." </connor>
<connor> I was gonna give him money, and he was making it weird. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Why are people like this?" </joey>
<joey> - Everyone else was in the car just like kind of chatting, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like dead on the fuckin' backseat, </joey>
<joey> not knowing that this is happening. </joey>
<joey> - I was just like, "Bro, okay." </joey>
<joey> And so he got his four pound tip. </joey>
<joey> Jokes on you, you'd have got a five pound tip </joey>
<connor> if you'd just giving me all my change, dude. </connor>
<connor> This is just a weird experience you don't get in Japan. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> They just give you it back immediately, </connor>
<connor> and you never have to deal with this. </connor>
<connor> And it was just so weird just seeing the guy </connor>
<joey> just not wanna give me my fuckin' change, </joey>
<joey> and I was just like- </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Me no speak English." </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - That was weird. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just like, yeah, </joey>
<garnt> talking about like transport in London, I guess. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I guess like there has been </connor>
<connor> like a talk of the town since we got here. </connor>
<connor> Because everyone that I've hung out with </connor>
<garnt> can't stop talking about this Elizabeth line </garnt>
<joey> that has just fuckin' opened up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I like heard about it, </garnt>
<joey> and it's like some like fancy new line </joey>
<joey> that's like recently opened up or something. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so apparently, it's this line that's been planned </garnt>
<garnt> that was meant to open, I believe, in like- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh many years ago. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, like 2020, I believe, that it's opened? </garnt>
<garnt> - Nothing in the UK ever gets done on time. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. (chuckles) </connor>
<garnt> And then it got delayed. - Nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It got delayed, but like the hype was real. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought like, "I'm coming to London, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm coming to a convention, people would be like, </garnt>
<connor> 'Oh, have you started watching "Spike's Family?" </connor>
<connor> Are you watching any new anime?'" </connor>
<connor> No, everyone's like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, you've been on the Elizabeth line." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) "Have you been </connor>
<connor> on the Elizabeth line?" </connor>
<connor> Like I haven't yet. - I haven't yet. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't. </connor>
<connor> And I swear to God, </connor>
<connor> someone could just like have given birth the day before, </connor>
<joey> and I'd be like, "Baby, nah, bruh. </joey>
<joey> Elizabeth line, that's the real hype, man. </joey>
<joey> I gotta try </joey>
<connor> the Elizabeth line." - Real shit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> But from what I heard, it's just like, </joey>
<connor> "It's a air conditioned line," and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Isn't that just every train in Japan?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And heated seats. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't notice that actually, </connor>
<joey> it's like the series of questions we got </joey>
<connor> were very different to how the list of questions </connor>
<connor> I would normally get at signing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like before Trash Taste, it was always like, </connor>
<connor> "What do you think about this anime? </connor>
<connor> What do you think about this manga? " </connor>
<garnt> And there was like definitely some amounts of those. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think the top three questions I received </garnt>
<connor> during that entire weekend, number one was, </connor>
<joey> "Have you had a Tesco meal deal yet?" </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Number two was, "Have you been to Greggs yet?" </joey>
<joey> - Yes! - And number three was, </joey>
<joey> "Have you been to Spoons yet?" </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like nothing to do with anime. </joey>
<joey> It was all just like, "Have you had these things?" </joey>
<connor> - Have you had any of them? </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, you took me to a Spoons last time I was here, </joey>
<joey> but apparently, you took me into like the worst Spoons. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was the worst Spoons. It was the worst Spoon. </connor>
<joey> - But no, I still haven't had </joey>
<connor> a Tesco meal deal yet. - Oh, bro, </connor>
<connor> I really want a Greggs. </connor>
<garnt> - I haven't had a Greggs yet at all. </garnt>
<joey> So I mean, we're here for a little, so. </joey>
<garnt> - I've forgotten how passionate people are about Greggs. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's very good. </joey>
<joey> - Greggs is the bakery? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's the bakery. - Okay, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's so more than that, though. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's the experience. - It's so much more than that. </connor>
<connor> Just a bakery, dude. </connor>
<connor> - Like I feel like you have to go there at least once </connor>
<joey> to get your British passport, that's the last test. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's really weird </joey>
<joey> 'cause I didn't realize how unknown Greggs was </joey>
<joey> to people outside of England. </joey>
<joey> Because a lot of people British people, </joey>
<joey> we speak about Nando's, we speak about Spoons, </joey>
<connor> but like not a lot of people speak about Greggs abroad, </connor>
<connor> and it's just one of these British things </connor>
<connor> that if you're in England, </connor>
<connor> you would've been to a Greggs at least once in your life. </connor>
<connor> You might not always talk about it, </connor>
<connor> but it's part of being British. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't realize this until I came back to England, </connor>
<connor> and everyone started asking me </connor>
<garnt> if I'd gone back to Greggs yet. (chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> - It's important. Greggs is an important thing. </connor>
<joey> I feel from what I heard from people, </joey>
<joey> like I feel being British person and not going to Greggs </joey>
<joey> is like being a Japanese person and not going to FamilyMart. </joey>
<joey> It's like that level of like, how have you not- </joey>
<garnt> - To me, it's even more than FamilyMart. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you can find FamilyMart all over Asia. </garnt>
<connor> It's like all over Asia. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, </connor>
<connor> there's like FamilyMarts in Thailand, actually. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> - It's like 7 Elevens. - I didn't know that either. </connor>
<connor> - This is news to me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> So it's not like a specific... </connor>
<connor> It's obviously very Japanese, </connor>
<connor> so like I'm gonna assume it started in Japan, </connor>
<connor> but it's like expanded, </connor>
<connor> but like I believe Greggs is only available in the UK. </connor>
<joey> And it's nothing- </joey>
<garnt> - So there's like a really British pride. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, it's cheap, </connor>
<joey> and it tastes amazing. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, what's not to like? </garnt>
<garnt> - Best sausage rolls, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Why haven't you guys taken me there yet? I wanna go. </connor>
<connor> - I actually haven't seen any. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the hype is so real in my head. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, not only have you guys like hyped it up, </joey>
<joey> but like every second British person I met this weekend </joey>
<connor> is like, "Greggs, though, </connor>
<connor> bro, Greggs." - Let me see </connor>
<connor> where the nearest Greggs is. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, real shit. </joey>
<connor> - Let me have a look at that real shit. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, get your boys some Greggs. </connor>
<connor> And then there were people being like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, so like have you been a Tescos yet?" </connor>
<connor> Have you had the Tesco meal deal?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Not yet." </connor>
<connor> And I knew it was like real shit </connor>
<connor> because like people will like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, here's my recommendation. </connor>
<connor> These are the ones to avoid. </connor>
<connor> These are the ones that you should go for." </connor>
<connor> And I didn't realize there were </connor>
<connor> so many different meal deals. </connor>
<connor> And like there were people like in the signing, right? </connor>
<connor> There would be like a person in front of me being like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, so here's the meal deal I recommend." </connor>
<joey> And I knew it was a real shit </joey>
<joey> when like the person behind them would like interject </joey>
<joey> and be like, "No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> Don't spread misinformation like that. </connor>
<joey> This is the real shit." </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, "Guys, chill out." </joey>
<joey> - There's a Greg's 10 minutes away from him. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck ya, let's go. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Let's walk off to London. - After this episode. </connor>
<connor> - After, after. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I mean like we talk about Tesco meal deals, </connor>
<garnt> but a meal deal is like a lot of choice. </garnt>
<garnt> So you need to like have the optimal order. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, there's just like... </connor>
<connor> It's like Blackjack, there's the perfect way to play it. </connor>
<connor> That's what a meal deal is, right? </connor>
<connor> So you need to need to learn how to count cards, okay? </connor>
<connor> Pick the right meal deal. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you know, there's certain items in the meal deal </connor>
<connor> that you can get where if you were to buy them individually, </connor>
<connor> it would cost like two pound 50. </connor>
<connor> So you can kind of min max the price options. </connor>
<connor> So don't be buying water. </connor>
<connor> Don't get like a fuckin' little fruit thing, </connor>
<connor> maximize your cost performance. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you don't wanna go for Walker's crisps. </garnt>
<connor> - McCoy's crisp, the big boys as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Or the (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - Or Walker's MAX. - Walker's MAX. </connor>
<connor> - You can't just go </connor>
<connor> to like the little fuckin' basic gas vanilla water. </connor>
<garnt> - You can get like an Innocent Smoothie as well. </garnt>
<garnt> There only like two pounds thirty. </garnt>
<joey> - You literally sound like every person at the signing. </joey>
<joey> - It's important. It's important. </joey>
<joey> - I knew it was real as well </joey>
<joey> because there was like a bunch of people also, </joey>
<joey> like when they mentioned the Tesco meal deal, </joey>
<joey> they came up to me and they were like, </joey>
<connor> "Yeah, Tesco meal deals are amazing, </connor>
<connor> but they opted it by 50 P, and it's an absolute travesty." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "I wish I could feel your anger right now </connor>
<joey> 'cause it seems very real." </joey>
<connor> - There's one like a one-minute walk, not even one minute, </connor>
<joey> like it's literally opposite our hotel. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck yeah! </joey>
<joey> - There was this article in the UK </joey>
<joey> that some doctor was calling for meal deals to be banned </joey>
<joey> because they're too unhealthy. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - And they're too like appealing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughs) Appealing. </joey>
<garnt> - Because people just buy these like every day for lunch </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's such good value for money, </garnt>
<garnt> and they taste fuckin' amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> but they're really bad for you. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause the sandwiches are like absolutely just stuffed </connor>
<connor> with awful stuff. </connor>
<connor> But it's like a McDonald's burger, </connor>
<connor> it's like, you don't wanna know what goes in, but you know </connor>
<connor> it tastes so amazing. - But it tastes good, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Why does it taste so damn good? </joey>
<connor> What does Ronald put in those- - FamilyMart sandwiches </connor>
<joey> are exactly the same as well, right? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, you know the sandwiches are not fresh at all, </connor>
<joey> but like, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But they still taste good. </garnt>
<joey> - They taste really fuckin' good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess, it's like going back to </garnt>
<garnt> like why people are recommending you what to order. </garnt>
<joey> It's kinda like going to a Chinese restaurant from here </joey>
<joey> and ordering like compow chicken or something. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, "I've had Chinese food." </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then everyone would be like, </connor>
<joey> "No, you have not had Chinese food." </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - It's like going on Pan Express. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Yeah, I love Chinese food." </joey>
<joey> - I'm not even the meal deal guy, </joey>
<garnt> but if you're gonna try one out, Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> at least try like the optimal meal deal. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - We'll get the real experience. </connor>
<garnt> - And then we can argue about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Fair. </garnt>
<connor> - Some of the sandwiches come with an additional slice </connor>
<joey> just for free. </joey>
<joey> Like just outta the generosity. </joey>
<connor> - That's not like a secret menu or anything. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You don't have to say like a code word? </joey>
<joey> - Normally, it's like two slices, </joey>
<joey> but some of them for some reason, </joey>
<joey> they have like one sandwich and a half in it, </joey>
<joey> and no one knows why. </joey>
<connor> It's one of the great mysteries of the world. </connor>
<joey> - It's like they're just trying to figure it out </joey>
<garnt> if you've like truly optimized it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you're a real player, you'll know. </garnt>
<joey> You see the (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - That's how you've gone </joey>
<joey> through like everything in the menu, you know? </joey>
<garnt> So you know the good shit. </garnt>
<connor> - I've had a pot noodle yet. </connor>
<joey> Fuck, I wanna have a Bombay bad boy. </joey>
<joey> - Is that like the cup noodle... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's like a cup noodle here. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, the spicy one is so good. It's so good. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I wanna experience this. </joey>
<connor> - All right, all right, all right. </connor>
<joey> - I guess if someone- </joey>
<joey> - I'm just scared that you might not like this stuff, </joey>
<joey> and I'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "This is literally my entire existence is waiting on this." </joey>
<joey> Like if don't you don't like this, I'm gonna die. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, look, there's a lot of food </connor>
<joey> that is considered awful that I absolutely enjoy. </joey>
<joey> So, I mean, how bad... </joey>
<garnt> Famous last words? How bad could it be? </garnt>
<garnt> - You gotta be honest, Joey. You've gotta be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> We wouldn't be the Trash Taste podcast if we weren't honest. </garnt>
<connor> - I keep forgetting how shit mayo is as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Huh? </garnt>
<connor> - I keep forgetting how bad mayo is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've gone back to not eating mayo. </connor>
<connor> I had one sandwich </connor>
<connor> 'cause like Japan has conditioned me to being like, </connor>
<connor> "Mayo taste good." </connor>
<connor> I always want the for my entire life. </connor>
<connor> I come back to England and have one sandwich, </connor>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't it, I don't like mayo again." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I always forget. </garnt>
<connor> I just assume everywhere has Kewpie mayonnaise. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Oh no, that was like a delicacy." </connor>
<garnt> - Should've bought your own. </garnt>
<joey> - That's like some real shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I've kind of like come to this realization </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's a small tangent, but before the boys came here, </garnt>
<connor> I did go on like a quick trip to Belgium, </connor>
<connor> and I ate a lot of bread. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, oh, oh, oh. </connor>
<connor> - I ate a lot of- </connor>
<connor> - I'm awake now. </connor>
<connor> - Basically every meal, I'd ordered the meal, </connor>
<joey> and I'd get a loaf of bread. - Of course. </joey>
<joey> - And it wasn't like the same loaf- </joey>
<connor> - A loaf? (chuckles) Like a little bun? </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm not talking about- </connor>
<connor> - It was a loaf? </connor>
<connor> - They basically gave me half a loaf. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, wow! </connor>
<connor> - I swear God, - Damn. </connor>
<connor> - every fuckin' meal. </connor>
<garnt> Like even if it wasn't a meal, </garnt>
<garnt> even if I ordered a drink with like some quick snacks. </garnt>
<garnt> They just give you bread plentiful. </garnt>
<connor> - Belgium knows what's up, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you like bread? </connor>
<joey> - I think I like bread. </joey>
<garnt> (hands clapping) </garnt>
<joey> - That's character development right there. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow, good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna do a proper </garnt>
<garnt> like bread tasting stream or something </garnt>
<garnt> where I actually try proper bread. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I kind of realized that maybe my entire life, </joey>
<joey> I didn't have shit taste. </joey>
<joey> Maybe my entire life, I just grew up in a place </joey>
<garnt> that just had shit food. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - You just had shit bread. </connor>
<joey> - Shit bread, you know? (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - You can get good bread in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> You just didn't seek it out. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just need to like seek it out, where it's just like, </garnt>
<connor> you'd have to go to like specialty places. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good, though. Fuck, man. </connor>
<connor> - Which is like true for a lot of cuisine in the UK, </connor>
<garnt> which is like, you kind of get good stuff here, </garnt>
<garnt> you just have to seek it out. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, so what's your favorite bread now? </joey>
<joey> Like your favorite kind? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I just tried a lot of bread, and they all tasted amazing. </garnt>
<connor> I need to get more informed in bread, man. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, I just got given bread, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "They have the same bread." - I want bread. </connor>
<joey> - My man's finally getting that bread. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I love it when they give you bread, </connor>
<connor> and they give you like a little fuckin' olive oil </connor>
<joey> kind of dip thing </joey>
<joey> with like spices. - Yeah, like the balsamic. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I love that! - And you're like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, don't mind if I do." </connor>
<connor> Like, "Ooh, ooh." - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, I love bread so much. </connor>
<connor> - Every time I go to like an Italian restaurant </connor>
<connor> in the states, - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - and they give you like that bread with the olive oil </connor>
<connor> and the balsamic, I'm like, "Fuck the pasta. </connor>
<joey> Just gimme more of this shit." </joey>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> (phone chiming) </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I guess I just got a text from Garnt. </joey>
<connor> (mobile chimes) </connor>
<connor> Wait, Garnt just found a new Waifu. </connor>

<connor> I think spending money in England is way too easy. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt sighs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just tapping that card. </joey>
<joey> - It's like monopoly money. </joey>
<joey> - So like I know the US has contactless. </joey>
<joey> Japan has contactless, but like- </joey>
<joey> - In the form of Suica. </joey>
<joey> - You can't use at like restaurants and stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like for like other places, </joey>
<connor> and cab rides. - It is getting better, </connor>
<connor> though too. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor And Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I did notice that a lot of places... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like in Australia as well now, </connor>
<connor> it's like, everything is just like, tablets, right? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, like in the UK now, </connor>
<garnt> it just seems to be that like the default is now </garnt>
<garnt> the tapping the credit card. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's way too easy to spend a lot of money. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just something pops up, you're like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't even know how much it is," </connor>
<connor> fuckin' tap and then you're like, "I'm broke now, shit!" </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause like I remember like the first time </joey>
<joey> they bring that out, </joey>
<joey> and they just kind like hand it to you to like tap, </joey>
<connor> because I'm so used to doing it in Japan, </connor>
<connor> so I pulled my phone out to get my Suica ready, </connor>
<joey> and I was just like, "Nope, that's not it." </joey>
<joey> It's credit card. It's credit card. </joey>
<connor> - Think you could do with your phone, though, </connor>
<connor> if you had the right thing set up. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> And 'cause I'm so used to like, </joey>
<connor> even in Japan when you do like the whole tapping thing, </connor>
<connor> not only can you see how much money you've spent, </connor>
<connor> but it's also like there's a little bit of a process, </connor>
<connor> so like, you know, kind of get it going. </connor>
<joey> But in the UK, it's literally just boop, and you're done. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause a lot of the times, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we've contactless here, </garnt>
<joey> they have like a specific device for contactless, </joey>
<joey> or they'll like show you the side with the contactless on. </joey>
<joey> And it's not the side with the price on, </joey>
<connor> so you don't even know how much you're spending </connor>
<connor> all the time. - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - And like I realized after coming back this time, </joey>
<connor> they've increased the limit again. </connor>
<connor> So when first contactless started coming out, </connor>
<connor> I believe the limit- - 30. </connor>
<connor> - was like 20. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it was at 20? Oh, shit. </connor>
<connor> - And then it increased to 30, and then, I believe, 40, </connor>
<connor> and now it's like 80. </connor>
<connor> We just fuckin' doubled the amount. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ! - With a single tap </connor>
<connor> of your card, you can spend a hundred bucks. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - That's so scary. </connor>
<connor> - Like I realized how dangerous this was </connor>
<connor> 'cause we're at the convention, </connor>
<connor> I was like buying a round of drinks, and I didn't... </connor>
<connor> Normally in Japan, they at least like tell you the price. </connor>
<connor> They tell you the price of how much you're spending, </connor>
<connor> and here they don't even tell you the price. </connor>
<connor> They just assume you know the price, </connor>
<connor> and they give you the contact thing, and you beep it. </connor>
<connor> And so I bring back the drinks, </connor>
<connor> and I remember one of my friends asked me, </connor>
<connor> "oh, are the drinks expensive here?" </connor>
<connor> And I would just go- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't know. </connor>
<connor> - "Maybe." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - So I feel like, yes is the answer, but I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and I say, "I think it's probably expensive," </connor>
<connor> and they were like, "No, is it London expensive? </connor>
<connor> Or is it London hotel expensive?" </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "Yes." </connor>
<joey> - Either one of those two. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I probably have to ask how much drinks are, </joey>
<garnt> but right now I literally have no idea. </garnt>
<garnt> I just tapped my wallet away. </garnt>
<joey> - I literally dunno how much I've spent </joey>
<garnt> while I've been here, because again, they don't tell you. </garnt>
<connor> It's so easy. </connor>
<connor> It's literally just like throwing monopoly money out. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] True. True. </connor>
<connor> - And being like, "Yeah, cool. </connor>
<connor> That was easy. Sweet." </connor>
<joey> And then it's only when you get back to the hotel, </joey>
<garnt> and you're like, "Oh, fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> - I wish it was monopoly money </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause at least with monopoly money, </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of like know how much you're spending. </garnt>
<garnt> You'll know if you're broke. - I keep track </garnt>
<connor> of my monopoly money. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I spend it very carefully. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, that's scary. </connor>
<connor> - I remember like... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we had a night, </connor>
<connor> and we ended up just like quickly, </connor>
<connor> just like as a group mates in the casino. </connor>
<connor> And so, we didn't play that much, </connor>
<connor> but I played a little bit, </connor>
<connor> and I ended up with some physical money on me </connor>
<connor> at the end of the night. </connor>
<connor> And I remember like cashing out, </connor>
<connor> getting this physical money in my wallet. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, this is useless. </connor>
<connor> When am I ever going to spend this? </connor>
<connor> When am I ever going to spend this physical money </connor>
<connor> that they've given me? </connor>
<connor> And because you don't ever need to spend like cash at all. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I noticed that. </joey>
<garnt> - So now it's just like a paperweight in my fuckin' wallet. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Suffering from success. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not even. It's like- </garnt>
<joey> - What am I gonna do with all this money?! </joey>
<joey> - This is just suffering from convenience. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> It is suffering from convenience that we've gotten to now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] My God, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, I guess that's been our return to the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - It's been great. </joey>
<joey> It's been great so far. </joey>
<garnt> - It's been absolutely amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you for carrying this episode. </connor>
<connor> I've been like dead for some reason. </connor>
<connor> I think jet lags still kicking my ass. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it is a bit. - I'm like, "Yes, bro." </joey>
<joey> - It's also really warm in this studio. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's so hot. I feel like when I'm in a sauna. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like a little extra warm. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, at least in like Japan, we have an air conditioner. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, in my head, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Can we turn the air con on?" </joey>
<joey> And I was looking around briefly. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Where is it? </joey>
<joey> Where is it help? Help!" </joey>
<garnt> But hey, look at all these patreons. Ooh! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, look at all these lovely patreons. </garnt>
<joey> I forgot that we needed to shout them out. </joey>
<connor> - But it doesn't even feel like Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - No, I know. - It feels weird. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, like I was so excited </garnt>
<connor> to have like the boys come over </connor>
<garnt> 'cause we haven't recorded the Trash Taste </garnt>
<joey> in like, I feel, like a month, three weeks, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, almost a month, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Not, not only that, </joey>
<connor> but normally at least like I'm in Japan or something. </connor>
<connor> You know, I had come to the UK early </connor>
<connor> to finalize my wedding stuff, </connor>
<connor> so I was just like here, </connor>
<connor> and I was just like not talking to the boys, </connor>
<connor> not recording Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, when I saw them come to England, </connor>
<connor> it was just, I dunno, it just felt nice. </connor>
<connor> It feels nice to have the boys back, man. </connor>
<joey> - Hell, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Glad we reunited. - It feels so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's go. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
