<garnt> - You good? You good? </garnt>
<garnt> You good? You good? </garnt>
<garnt> - Just doing my hair. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, we're just gonna wait here </garnt>
<garnt> and just let Connor do his hair, I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't even see what I'm
doing, I'm just bullshitting. </connor>
<garnt> (gentle electronic jingle) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello, and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host for today, Gigguk, </garnt>
<garnt> and with me today, I do not have a guest! </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - For the first time! </garnt>
<garnt> - This feels so refreshing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, for like, the past two
times we've had guests on, </garnt>
<garnt> and I just haven't been
able to sit in the center </garnt>
<garnt> where I deserve to be. </garnt>
<joey> - I love how the, as well
the subreddit has come up </joey>
<joey> with this controversy
or like conspiracy that, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, Garnt is the one that always hosts </joey>
<joey> all the guest episodes
because he's the most social </joey>
<garnt> out of the three." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, no,
- No, there is no conspiracy, </garnt>
<garnt> it was just a coincidence that both times </garnt>
<garnt> it was my scheduled time to be a guest. </garnt>
<garnt> But this is my time now, I get this side. </garnt>
<joey> - Finally, you're sitting by yourself. </joey>
<joey> You get the entire camera </joey>
<garnt> to yourself.
- Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're meeting again
with the boys, as per usual. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was that drop in energy, Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> You just got like, sad, bro. </connor>
<garnt> - I know! And there's the boys there. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Gigguk! And the
boys, it's whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - I should be the tired one,
I've been up since 4:00 AM. </connor>
<joey> - Why were you up since four? </joey>
<connor> - I was doing fucking
Carson's pool tournament. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you for inviting all
of us by the way, Carson. </garnt>
<garnt> But there was only one madman </garnt>
<garnt> between our group who
was willing to wake up </garnt>
<garnt> at like, 3:30 AM? </garnt>
<connor> - 3:30 AM, and then I had
Japanese school after, </connor>
<connor> so I had to go into Tokyo and then I had </connor>
<connor> to come back here and do the podcast. </connor>
<garnt> But Carson, fuck you for kicking
me out of the tournament! </garnt>
<garnt> As you, I don't know if you, </garnt>
<garnt> you guys probably didn't see this. </garnt>
<garnt> I was crushing my opponent. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey, do you wanna
explain the tournament? </garnt>
<garnt> - So it was an eight ball
pool tournament, right? </garnt>
<garnt> and 64 bracket, and I was first to play. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't have any
knowledge of what the, </garnt>
<connor> this fucking pool table looked </connor>
<connor> like an eight bit Windows kind of game, </connor>
<connor> it was fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> He kept saying, "No, it's
great" on the stream. </connor>
<connor> It was fucking awful, Carson. </connor>
<connor> I like you, Carson, by the way. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I like you, Carson, but I
don't like your pool table. </joey>
<garnt> - This pool sucked, Carson! </garnt>
<garnt> Anyway, immediately, I was against Botez </garnt>
<connor> and I just started clapping her, dude. </connor>
<connor> I was getting all of these
balls in, no problem whatsoever. </connor>
<connor> And I was down to the eight ball </connor>
<connor> and then like, something weird happened </connor>
<connor> on the fucking, in the pool thing, right? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Carson, what is this?" </connor>
<joey> He's like, "Oh, don't worry.
Just click, just click." </joey>
<joey> So I just clicked. </joey>
<joey> I shouldn't have believed Carson, </joey>
<joey> because of course he's gonna troll me. </joey>
<joey> It's the first game. </joey>
<joey> So I just ignored it, potted
the black, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Right, see you guys in the next round." </joey>
<joey> And I was about to leave the call, </joey>
<connor> and then they were like,
"Wait, you lost, Connor." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "What do you mean, I lost?!" </connor>
<connor> Like, oh, you picked the wrong hole. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "It didn't give me-" </connor>
<connor> Oh my god, Carson fucking played me, bro. </connor>
<joey> Carson, why?! </joey>
<connor> - Because in eight ball, </connor>
<connor> you have to select which pocket </connor>
<connor> you're gonna put the eight ball in, </connor>
<connor> and if you put it in a different hole, </connor>
<joey> then you automatically lose. </joey>
<connor> - I feel so lied to </connor>
<connor> because on Miniclip, on
the eight ball pool game, </connor>
<connor> - (in high-pitched voice) Miniclip! </connor>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Going way back! </garnt>
<connor> - But it's from Miniclip, right? The game? </connor>
<connor> This game, which is the one </connor>
<connor> that I know he plays all the time, </connor>
<connor> you don't have to select a fucking pocket, </connor>
<joey> you just hit it in any of them! </joey>
<joey> I felt lied to.
- That's normie rules though, </joey>
<joey> bro, that aint competition rules. </joey>
<joey> - Justice for CDawg,
man, that's all I want. </joey>
<garnt> Give me my 20K cash prize. </garnt>
<garnt> - The thing I noticed
about playing pool is like, </garnt>
<garnt> I swear, every country I play pool in </garnt>
<joey> with a different person, </joey>
<joey> everyone has their own fucking rules. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what happens half the time. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like Uno and Monopoly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like the free
parking spot in Monopoly. </joey>
<joey> Everyone just makes up
their own fucking rules, </joey>
<garnt> no one knows what the actual rule is. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just, no, no, the
actual rule is nothing happens. </connor>
<joey> That's just, that's genuine, </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- That's the actual rule, </joey>
<connor> - Because in my house,
- nothing happens! </connor>
<connor> - what you would do is </connor>
<garnt> you know how you have to pay- </garnt>
<garnt> - The taxes!
- Pay taxes and 50 bucks </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's bullshit.
- to get out of jail? </joey>
<joey> All of that money goes into the middle, </joey>
<joey> and then if you land on free
parking, you get the pot. </joey>
<connor> - I think that's hopeless optimism. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause, y'know, we like to
think our taxes go somewhere, </garnt>
<garnt> perhaps to someone else. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't, they just
get sucked into a hole. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't get, nothing
comes of your taxes, </garnt>
<connor> you're not happy about it, okay? </connor>
<connor> That's what happens,
I remember I saw this. </connor>
<joey> - That makes more sense. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, nothing happens. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing)
- And it's just sad! </connor>
<connor> - It's just taxes. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know how this
one rule in Monopoly </connor>
<connor> just got spread around like, globally, </connor>
<connor> even though it was not on
any rule books, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Like pity rules. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think because it's so depressing </garnt>
<joey> to do a roll in Monopoly, and
it's like, "Wait, nothing?" </joey>
<joey> Like nothing, like not even a bad thing? </joey>
<connor> No, no just nothing.
- Especially when it's already </connor>
<connor> a game when nothing
fucking happens sometimes. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, I landed
on my own property." </connor>
<connor> - Could you imagine if
there was a white circle </connor>
<joey> on Mario Party, and it was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my god, what's gonna happen?" </joey>
<connor> Just nothing, nothing,
nothing's gonna happen, </connor>
<garnt> because it's white. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, have you guys ever
completed a game of Monopoly? </garnt>
<connor> I have never completed a game. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Of course. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, I just
don't have that patience. </connor>
<garnt> - Dude, I would like, </garnt>
<garnt> I am so competitive that I will </garnt>
<garnt> trap everyone.
- Of course you are! </garnt>
<joey> Of course you are! </joey>
<connor> - I will trap everyone in the
room until the game is over. </connor>
<joey> - This just calls for
a Monopoly episode now. </joey>
<garnt> We need to play Monopoly for- </garnt>
<garnt> - How long is a game of
Monopoly meant to last? </garnt>
<joey> - Depends how much you suck (laughing). </joey>
<connor> - Because I've been in Monopoly games </connor>
<connor> that I've lost like two, three hours. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - That's a short game. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, this is the thing,
some people don't do this. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you let auctions happen? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I think in the rules, auctions, </garnt>
<joey> aw fuck, are they allowed? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they're allowed. </joey>
<connor> - I thought they were
allowed, I could be wrong now. </connor>
<garnt> - I just get to a point in Monopoly </garnt>
<garnt> where just the money is just circular. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> Where people are just passing
the cans to each other. </joey>
<joey> That's exactly what it feels like </joey>
<garnt> playing a game of
Monopoly that I'm used to. </garnt>
<connor> - I like to do the mind games </connor>
<connor> just let my opponents know immediately </connor>
<connor> from the get-go how I'm playing them, </connor>
<connor> and maybe they give up. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe it would end faster </joey>
<joey> if it wasn't for the free parking rule. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, probably. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's probably why,
- Probably why nothing happens </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, "Oh, shit,
I've got 50 bucks left. </garnt>
<connor> Thank god I landed on free parking." </connor>
<joey> $2,000 comes to me and then it just </joey>
<joey> keeps repeating over and over again. </joey>
<joey> - There shouldn't be a way for someone </joey>
<connor> who has no properties
to get back in the game. </connor>
<connor> They should be out, they
deserve to be out for their </connor>
<joey> poor financial decisions.
- So maybe if we do play it </joey>
<joey> on the podcast or whatever, </joey>
<connor> then we should just completely
get rid of that rule. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> - And free parking is just a white spot. </joey>
<joey> - We'll get Maylene on as well, right? </joey>
<joey> and then we can play Monopoly. </joey>
<connor> - Maylene, do you wanna play Monopoly </connor>
<joey> with us for an episode? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, She says yes.
- She said yes. </garnt>
<joey> She said, "Absolutely, boys!" </joey>
<joey> - Going back to pool though, </joey>
<joey> what are the rules when you foul? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I swear there's a different </joey>
<joey> fucking rule in every country. </joey>
<garnt> When you do a foul, do you
get control of the white ball? </garnt>
<joey> Do you get two shots? </joey>
<joey> What is the rule? </joey>
<joey> - So my understanding, I don't know </joey>
<joey> what the official rules
are, but my understanding is </joey>
<joey> if you sink the white
ball, then you can place- </joey>
<garnt> - Put it wherever you want. </garnt>
<joey> - You can place it </joey>
<joey> wherever you want.
- But is wherever you want </joey>
<joey> past a certain line? </joey>
<joey> Or is it whenever you want- </joey>
<garnt> - That's what I thought it was! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> But apparently it's not. </joey>
<connor> - Isn't that snooker? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's a different gamer form. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck, dude, I don't wanna say anything </joey>
<connor> 'cause I'm gonna be wrong
no matter what I say. </connor>
<garnt> - We're probably wrong here </garnt>
<garnt> and there's gonna be someone
in the comments that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I know the
international rules of pool. </garnt>
<garnt> You are all wrong." </garnt>
<connor> - If you pot two in a row,
multiball happens, where there's, </connor>
<connor> no, I'm joking. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I'm chatting shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought you were serious there! </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, "Multiball? What's that?" </connor>
<joey> Just sweating. </joey>
<joey> - Like pinball, right? </joey>
<connor> When all the, it's like
the best part, man. </connor>
<joey> - No, I think, like yeah,
because every single person </joey>
<garnt> I've gone to Baggis with to play pool, </garnt>
<joey> they're just like, "Oh,
it's two shots, right?" </joey>
<joey> It's like, "No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> It's behind this white line </joey>
<garnt> and then you have to shoot it forward." </garnt>
<joey> No, you can place it anywhere. </joey>
<joey> It's different every single time, </joey>
<joey> it's just like whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - People just make up their own rules. </garnt>
<garnt> There's always house
rules, and I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> America works in its own system, </garnt>
<garnt> Asia works on another system, </garnt>
<garnt> and Europe works on its own system. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fucking know,
I just go with the flow </garnt>
<garnt> most of the time. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because recently
I found out with Uno. </joey>
<joey> Do you stack the plus two cards? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's a rule. </connor>
<joey> - No, it's not. </joey>
<connor> - That's not a rule? </connor>
<connor> - The official rule is you can't stack </connor>
<connor> plus two.
- That's so fucking boring. </connor>
<connor> - I know! </connor>
<connor> - That's so lame.
- I looked it up because </connor>
<connor> there were so many people who were like, </connor>
<garnt> "No you can't stack plus two,"
or "You can stack plus two." </garnt>
<garnt> And everybody thought yes, </garnt>
<garnt> of course you can stack plus two. </garnt>
<joey> That makes the game so
much more interesting. </joey>
<joey> I looked up the official rules, </joey>
<joey> you can't stack plus twos. </joey>
<joey> - But that's not fun! </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - And also Joey, fuck it, </connor>
<connor> and I remember this pissed me off, dude. </connor>
<connor> There was a 30 minute game of Uno </connor>
<connor> and I just wanted it to end, right? </connor>
<connor> And what I normally do in
Uno is that I will save </connor>
<connor> the all color cards until the
end so that I can just win </connor>
<connor> when I get Uno. </connor>
<connor> And Joey was like, "Oh,
no, you can't do that. </connor>
<connor> You can't put down, it
has to be a solid color." </connor>
<joey> - That is an official rule. </joey>
<connor> - On the Uno game on
the PC, you can do that. </connor>
<garnt> Explain that, Joey, yeah, yeah, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - PC's not canon. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, what do you mean?
- We were also very drunk then </garnt>
<joey> when we were playing that game. </joey>
<joey> - We were also shouting
out a different Stand name </joey>
<joey> for the different colors. </joey>
<connor> - I was just asleep by the end of it, </connor>
<connor> and Joey was the only one who wanted </connor>
<connor> to drag on the suffering. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like, 2:00 AM or something, </garnt>
<connor> we were all heavily drunk. </connor>
<connor> I was struggling to keep </connor>
<connor> my eyes open.
- I wanted to go home, </connor>
<connor> I wanted to sleep.
- And when you ended the game, </connor>
<garnt> I was secretly like, "Yes,
yes! It's finally over." </garnt>
<joey> Then Joey goes, "Um, excuse
me, that is not a rule. </joey>
<garnt> You cannot end the game like that. </garnt>
<joey> - Look, if you're gonna put me </joey>
<garnt> through a 30 minute fucking
Uno game, I wanna win! </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna win on the proper rules! </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Uno, who gives a fuck, man? </garnt>
<garnt> It's not even a skill-based game. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] It's not, it's not. </garnt>
<joey> - I just had fun, just every
time there was a red card </joey>
<garnt> just being like fucking, what was it? </garnt>
<joey> it's like Magician's
Red every single time. </joey>
<connor> - The people in the other room </connor>
<garnt> must've though what the
fuck is happening in there? </garnt>
<garnt> They're just screaming,
"Magician's Red every two seconds." </garnt>
<joey> - Hierophant Green every
time we dropped a green card. </joey>
<garnt> - Before we move on to the
actual topic of this podcast, </garnt>
<connor> though, you were talking
about what was it, Miniclip? </connor>
<connor> Just reminded me of like, all
the, did you guys ever play- </connor>
<connor> - I spent my whole life on
Miniclip when I was growing up. </connor>
<connor> - Do you guys remember the
good old-fashioned flash games </connor>
<connor> that you have to play
on your school internet, </connor>
<connor> because actual games wouldn't work. </connor>
<connor> - I remember being in the
lunch break, being like, yo, </connor>
<garnt> "I know which website
Bloons Tower Defense is on." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Come, come on, I'll show you. </garnt>
<garnt> Type in this code. </garnt>
<connor> Bloons Tower Defense Two is available </connor>
<connor> on this URL, I know. </connor>
<garnt> - It's all about helicopter game, man. </garnt>
<connor> Remember that helicopter game, </connor>
<garnt> which was like pre-Angry Birds? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I remember that one. </connor>
<joey> - It was the most difficult gameplay </joey>
<joey> with just the space bar. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - When that, when what,
somehow one of those websites </connor>
<connor> with all of the games
got through the filter </connor>
<connor> it was like opening the flood gates, </connor>
<connor> and you were like, "Holy shit!" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah because I remember
in my primary school, </joey>
<garnt> Miniclip was immediately banned. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Miniclip was banned.
- Oh, yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then someone was like </garnt>
<garnt> "I know a website called Albino Sheep, </garnt>
<connor> and it's not blocked on the firewall. </connor>
<connor> But don't tell the teachers! </connor>
<joey> It's got all the games!" </joey>
<connor> - Did you ever have someone like, </connor>
<joey> 'cause in the schools, right? </joey>
<joey> All the PCs are hooked up
to like, the main admin one. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - One of the kids in my school changed </joey>
<garnt> the background of all the things </garnt>
<garnt> and it was the funniest fucking shit. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it was like, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause the teacher left
the room for one moment, </joey>
<joey> and he changed all the
backgrounds to Alien vs. Predator. </joey>
<garnt> But, </garnt>
<garnt> the predator was just like, a priest. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And so, a bunch of 13 year old kids </connor>
<connor> are just doing their thing
and then they minimize like, </connor>
<connor> Word document or the fucking PowerPoint, </connor>
<joey> and they just see like,
fucking one of the popes </joey>
<joey> holding hands with the predator, uh, </joey>
<joey> with the alien, or something. </joey>
<joey> And it was just the
funniest fucking thing ever, </joey>
<connor> I remember being so amused by this. </connor>
<joey> - That, that is just
peak 12 year old comedy. </joey>
<joey> - I love it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I remember just 12 year old me thought, </connor>
<connor> "Man, nothing's ever gonna
live up to this moment, bro. </connor>
<connor> That was the funniest shit ever." </connor>
<garnt> - This is the best prank of all time. </garnt>
<connor> - This is just giga-brain,
bro, I can't imagine it. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember like, IT
class back in the day. </garnt>
<connor> In school, IT class was just
like a second playground. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, dude, everyone just fucked around. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was, it was, nobody
actually did the work, </connor>
<garnt> and I remember like, if
you had to do the work, </garnt>
<garnt> it was a five minute job. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because they
were teaching you stuff </connor>
<connor> that you were probably already using. </connor>
<garnt> Like, They used to teach us
Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, </garnt>
<garnt> not even like Excel. </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone, everyone at age 10 </garnt>
<garnt> already knows how to use PowerPoint. </garnt>
<garnt> At least, at our age they did. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know about now, it
might just be different. </garnt>
<connor> But when I was growing up, </connor>
<connor> everyone knew how to use PowerPoint. </connor>
<connor> Everyone had made a PowerPoint </connor>
<connor> for like, every other class that they had. </connor>
<joey> - But they had to go above
and beyond by being like, </joey>
<joey> "Do you know a thing called transitions?" </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> They'll really spice up a presentation. </connor>
<connor> - Word art. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, Word art. </garnt>
<connor> - Clip art.
- Oh, god. </connor>
<connor> - God, I remember first
discovering transitions </connor>
<connor> on PowerPoint and you would just use that </connor>
<garnt> for every fucking slide </garnt>
<garnt> and you thought you were the fucking shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Every single letter had a transition. </connor>
<joey> - There was that one kid
who would just do, like, </joey>
<joey> okay, bear in mind, this
transition is 30 seconds long. </joey>
<joey> Just watching each single
letter just bouncing </joey>
<joey> into the screen. </joey>
<joey> - The star shaking the middle, </joey>
<joey> and the last little moment </joey>
<connor> would take fucking forever to lock in. </connor>
<connor> I remember that one, man. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember this one time in my IT class, </garnt>
<joey> we had to create a website, right? </joey>
<joey> So we could choose a
website on whatever topic </joey>
<connor> we wanted to create. So, at the time, </connor>
<garnt> - Why aren't we sponsored by Squarespace? </garnt>
<connor> - I know, this would be
perfect for Squarespace, but, </connor>
<joey> Yeah, I chose to make a website
on the original Nintendo DS. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, very specific. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I was a Nintendo kid back then. </joey>
<joey> And I remember I was
doing a really good job. </joey>
<joey> My teacher was, at the time, </joey>
<joey> really impressed at the
website I had created </joey>
<joey> because I was actually putting effort in </joey>
<joey> unlike the other kids who
were just dicking around </joey>
<joey> like you do in IT class. </joey>
<joey> And then he was asking me, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, so what are you gonna name it?" </joey>
<joey> 10-year-old me, I was
nine or 10 years old, </joey>
<joey> was trying to think of
the coolest name possible. </joey>
<connor> I was like, how about DS Dominator? </connor>
<connor> No, no, I got a better one. </connor>
<connor> How about DS Dominatrix? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was like dominator, domina, </connor>
<garnt> like dominatrix for a nine year old </garnt>
<garnt> who doesn't know what it means sounds </garnt>
<garnt> like a cool fucking word! </garnt>
<joey> - It's like dominator and "The Matrix." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That was like, exactly my mindset. </garnt>
<joey> And I just remember the the
teacher's face being like, </joey>
<connor> - Um, probably sh-
- That's great, but- </connor>
<connor> - Probably shouldn't call it that. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, why? </garnt>
<garnt> It's such a cool word! Dominatrix! </garnt>
<connor> - Tell me why!
- I'm gonna call it Dominatrix </connor>
<garnt> and he refused to let
me call it dominatrix. </garnt>
<garnt> And nine year old me was so fucking pissed </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I thought of a
fucking brilliant name. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - You don't understand me! The genius! </connor>
<garnt> - Have you seen "The Matrix?" It's epic! </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, that's going
back to GCSE IT class </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever, whatever it was back then. </garnt>
<joey> - I had a similar thing where, </joey>
<connor> I also had to make a website
as well for my IT class. </connor>
<connor> You didn't have to do that? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay, because I- </connor>
<connor> - I don't even think my teacher
knew how to make a website. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't think he was gonna teach us. </connor>
<connor> - Because I had to make a website, </connor>
<connor> but it was when I was like 16 years old, </connor>
<joey> so I wasn't 10 years old. </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, "Okay, I gotta think </joey>
<joey> of a cool name for my website. </joey>
<connor> How about The Anime Man?" </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, does this still exist? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it does exist. </connor>
<connor> - What's the domain? </connor>
<connor> - It's theanimeman.wordpress.com </connor>
<joey> 'cause we used WordPress back then. </joey>
<joey> - Did you like, do anime
reviews and all that shit? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and that's how I got started. </joey>
<connor> That's how I got started,
and then I was like- </connor>
<connor> - So we can still go on this? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah it should be up there still. </joey>
<garnt> - Garnt, pull it up, pull it up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I went on there like, a year ago </garnt>
<joey> because I did a video where
I was just basically roasting </joey>
<garnt> my own horrible reviews, and
they were absolutely garbage. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was your very first review? </garnt>
<joey> - Ah, "Serial Experiments Lain." </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that's a Herculean- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I wasn't like,
"'Fairy Tail' review! </joey>
<joey> 'One Piece' review!" </joey>
<garnt> - Now I feel bad for just
for reviewing "Bleach" </garnt>
<garnt> for my first video. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No, but I gained so much of, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how the fuck
people like, came back. </joey>
<joey> They were like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> dude, I got to the point
where people were like, </joey>
<joey> "I would like to request
a review from you. </joey>
<joey> Can you review this particular series?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Okay." </joey>
<connor> - Were there many anime reviews </connor>
<connor> at that time though, in English? </connor>
<joey> - There were a lot of like, </joey>
<joey> there weren't a lot of people on YouTube </joey>
<joey> who were doing it, but there
were lots and lots of like, </joey>
<joey> anime blogging websites. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause that's
probably around 2000s, right? </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, it was probably,
- Yeah, it was like, 2010's, </connor>
<connor> - When blogs actually got
views and everything like that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was the 2010s, but then,
then it got to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where someone was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, you should uh, you
should do some video reviews." </garnt>
<connor> I was like, "Okay." </connor>
<connor> And then I did that, and then- </connor>
<connor> - That was the origin story. </connor>
<joey> - And that's the origin story. </joey>
<garnt> - Fucking, dusted off that chopper hat, </garnt>
<connor> You were like, "It's time." </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's time. </joey>
<garnt> - The giant rainbow beanie
as well that I used to wear. </garnt>
<joey> - God, it's so hideous. </joey>
<joey> - Did you guys have that one
really cool teacher in school? </joey>
<joey> Like, For me it was the IT teacher. </joey>
<joey> He didn't give a shit about what we did, </joey>
<joey> but every other teacher,
in my school at least, </joey>
<garnt> was a fucking asshole, but there was just </garnt>
<garnt> the one IT teach for me
that was really cool. </garnt>
<joey> - I had that uh, </joey>
<joey> that was our physics
teacher in high school. </joey>
<joey> He was such a fucking character, </joey>
<joey> and I don't know if he did it on purpose </joey>
<joey> just to be entertaining
because maybe he thought </joey>
<connor> that not a lot of kids would
take physics as a major, </connor>
<connor> but I took physics as I just
found physics interesting. </connor>
<joey> Imagine this middle-aged,
just completely bald dude </joey>
<joey> and him trying to teach you
about like, how electrons move </joey>
<joey> and he's carrying around this giant stick. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm talking twice the
size of a cricket bat, right? </joey>
<garnt> Just as thick as a cricket bat </garnt>
<garnt> and in like marker on it, it's
called the gentle persuader. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he would just
swing this thing around </garnt>
<garnt> and whenever there was a kid
who was asleep at his desk, </garnt>
<connor> he would just get the gentle persuader </connor>
<joey> and just whack it on the table
to get the kids to wake up. </joey>
<connor> - It's always the physics teachers </connor>
<connor> that are like, the fucking nuttiest. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> They're always either the
most passionate about it- </joey>
<connor> - But the absolute clap of a sound </connor>
<connor> that this thing would make, </connor>
<connor> you could hear it probably
from across the school </connor>
<connor> of just this giant piece of wood </connor>
<joey> clapping against another
giant piece of wood. </joey>
<joey> And the kids after a while,
like after two weeks, </joey>
<joey> no kid would fall would
asleep in his class </joey>
<joey> just 'cause he's just
swinging this thing around. </joey>
<garnt> - That's asserting dominance as a teacher. </garnt>
<joey> - The dominatrix. </joey>
<joey> - The dominatrix. </joey>
<garnt> - Asserting dominatrix right there. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No but he was really cool, </joey>
<joey> he made physics really fun for me. </joey>
<joey> And I feel that if I didn't
have him as a teacher, </joey>
<joey> I probably would have
found like, the whole, </joey>
<joey> all the sciences and physics </joey>
<joey> just really fucking tedious and boring. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I remember the first time I
read "Great Teacher Onizuka", </garnt>
<garnt> fucking one of my favorite
manga of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> - So good.
- I haven't read it. </garnt>
<joey> - You should.
- Yeah, to give you </joey>
<garnt> a synopsis, it's about this teacher </garnt>
<garnt> who is a 22 year old delinquent. </garnt>
<garnt> Never finished college, I don't think, </garnt>
<garnt> or like, was a dropout to college, </garnt>
<joey> and basically he takes over
this delinquent classroom </joey>
<joey> and just kind of reforms them. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't teach them the curriculum, </joey>
<joey> he teaches them life lessons. </joey>
<joey> And it's, you know, it's
a pretty simple premise, </joey>
<joey> but what sells it is how
good of a teacher Onizuka is </joey>
<joey> and just, I wish I had a
teacher like that in my own life </joey>
<garnt> that was just, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> Mr. Sullivan, IT teacher,
I'm never gonna forget you, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, you were no Onizuka. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You ain't Great Teacher Sullivan. </joey>
<garnt> - The coolest thing he
did was let us call him </garnt>
<joey> by his first name a few times. </joey>
<joey> That's how you know, </joey>
<garnt> that's how you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how you know.
- Damn, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a special moment
when you're in your senior year </garnt>
<joey> of high school where your teacher's like, </joey>
<joey> "Just call me by my name." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, "Yeah,
all right, all right." </joey>
<joey> - You're the real one, man, </joey>
<garnt> you're the real one.
- We're real bros now. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We're friends, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we're friends,
we're friends, right? </connor>
<connor> - My biology teacher was really nice. </connor>
<connor> She was so cool. </connor>
<garnt> I did so many dumb stuff
that she had my back. </garnt>
<garnt> She was, "No, no, no, I got
this," 'cause of other teachers. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause one time when I got
in a fight a different time </joey>
<joey> from the other stories- </joey>
<joey> - Out of a million fights. </joey>
<joey> - She was pregnant and
she was teaching a class. </joey>
<joey> And this guy, </joey>
<joey> So one of the guys, I was
having a fight with him </joey>
<connor> and I fucking rammed him
through her class door, </connor>
<connor> and the door slammed open, </connor>
<connor> absolutely smacked her
whiteboard and stuff </connor>
<connor> and made so much noise. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, she didn't tell me off. </connor>
<connor> She was like, "It's okay, I understand." </connor>
<connor> She was like, "I know
he's a piece of shit." </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I got you bro, I got you. </garnt>
<garnt> - This kid drove all the teachers insane. </garnt>
<garnt> He was the worst bro and
he always got away with it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the teachers just stopped. </garnt>
<joey> Like, did you ever have that kid </joey>
<joey> where the teachers just gave up? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they were like,
"He's such a piece of shit, </joey>
<garnt> there's no point even
trying to discipline him." </garnt>
<garnt> He was that kid. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure you guys know him. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think we all have
that one kid in school. </garnt>
<connor> - And then, when my phone
went off in an exam, </connor>
<connor> which is not good, </connor>
<garnt> - Which it's just normally an auto fail. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so what happened was </connor>
<connor> is that I was super into
Enter Shikari at this age. </connor>
<joey> - Of course you were. </joey>
<joey> - My second name is C on the exam, </joey>
<joey> so I was right at the front always. </joey>
<joey> And I'd turned my phone off, </joey>
<connor> and I didn't realize my
phone could turn itself on </connor>
<connor> to turn the alarm on. </connor>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<joey> - Is that true?
- Some phones could do this, </joey>
<joey> some phones could do- </joey>
<joey> - What kind of sentient shit is that? </joey>
<joey> - So this is back in the day </joey>
<joey> when the phones had the the
batteries you could take out. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, so flip phone, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so my other friend, </joey>
<joey> I remember distinctly for the exam, </joey>
<joey> he's like, I'm taking the
battery out too, just in case. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like that's dumb, I'm
just leaving mine in, man. </garnt>
<connor> And then obviously, I was
sitting down in my history exam, </connor>
<connor> and I heard some mumble
in the back and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Fucking idiot, whose phone is that? </connor>
<connor> What a fucking loser." </connor>
<connor> I finished the exam comfortably. </connor>
<garnt> It kept getting louder
and I was like whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I go to the back to get, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you put all your bags in the back. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] In the back, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I'm like, where's my bag? </connor>
<connor> Where the fuck's my bag? </connor>
<connor> And then I was like,
"Fuck, was that my phone? </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, it's not right." </connor>
<connor> I got fucking grilled by
the headmaster who was like, </connor>
<connor> "You're trying to cheat? </connor>
<connor> Trying to cheat?" </connor>
<connor> They were like, you know this alarm, </connor>
<connor> and it was fucking Enter Shikari going </connor>
<connor> (mimics shouting) </connor>
<connor> In fucking whatever room it was </connor>
<connor> while I was doing this two hour exam, </connor>
<connor> so it was in the reception
area they were keeping it. </connor>
<connor> They were like, "You
know it kept going off?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Alarms
tend to do that, yeah." </connor>
<connor> - Out of every ringtone
you could have chosen, </connor>
<connor> you choose Enter Shikari. </connor>
<connor> - Because that shit woke you up, man. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I would never, I've tried putting </garnt>
<garnt> my favorite song as an alarm. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you realize after about, </garnt>
<garnt> - A month,
- You begin to hate the song. </garnt>
<connor> - You hate the song. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember in university, </connor>
<connor> I did exactly the same with The Killers </connor>
<garnt> or sometimes Muse, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Well I hate this song now. </garnt>
<garnt> This is not why I picked the alarm." </garnt>
<connor> - It's because this Enter
Shikari song at the time </connor>
<connor> was their most popular and
it just started off with </connor>
<connor> (mimics intense drumbeat) </connor>
<connor> Do you know this one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they were just
immediately screaming and, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I remember I was fucking tearing up. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "No, I'm not trying to cheat!" </joey>
<joey> - I just really like Enter Shikari! </joey>
<joey> - It's just an alarm, bro. </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "Can you prove it?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "It says nine o'clock, man. </joey>
<connor> It's a little alarm bell and everything!" </connor>
<joey> Bear in mind, this school
has 200 kids total. </joey>
<joey> This is a high school with 200 kids. </joey>
<joey> This is a very small school </joey>
<connor> and they have my bag on the
table like at an airport </connor>
<connor> being like, "Open it up. </connor>
<connor> Open it up, what's inside?" </connor>
<garnt> - It's like TSA.
- Yeah, literally like </garnt>
<garnt> it's a bomb, they're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Open it up, what's inside bro? </connor>
<garnt> What's inside?" </garnt>
<connor> And I pull it out, and
it's the phone doing it. </connor>
<connor> And then, yeah, they asked me what was it </connor>
<connor> and can you prove it's an alarm? </connor>
<connor> I show them it's an alarm and
then they're like, "Okay." </connor>
<connor> And then just let me go. </connor>
<joey> - Well imagined if they grilled you, </joey>
<joey> being like, "It's a shit song." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Enter Shikari? What are you? </joey>
<connor> - I think I stopped listening
to Enter Shikari after that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think every time
I got, 'cause bear in mind, </connor>
<garnt> as a 16 year old thinking
that you're possibly </garnt>
<joey> gonna be kicked out of
exams is traumatic as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like "Fuck, dude,
my mum's gonna kill me. </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna be destroyed for life." </joey>
<connor> But luckily they gave
me a slap on the wrist, </connor>
<connor> although I'm pretty sure
they should've disqualified </connor>
<connor> that exam result, but they didn't. </connor>
<joey> - I purposely chose a song that I knew </joey>
<joey> I was going to hate, </joey>
<joey> because, that just,
especially if it was an alarm </joey>
<joey> to wake me up, because you
can't listen to an alarm </joey>
<joey> of a song that you hate for too long. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's actually really clever. </joey>
<garnt> - It further incites me to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I gotta turn this shit off immediately." </garnt>
<garnt> So I chose fucking "Nyan Cat." </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No, I like "Nyan Cat." </joey>
<joey> - I did not. </joey>
<garnt> - I could not listen to that
for more than five seconds. </garnt>
<joey> - And that's exactly why I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "This is perfect alarm material", </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the moment, imagine 8:00 AM, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just having a nice sleep, </garnt>
<joey> and then just from
downstairs you just hear </joey>
<joey> (mimics song in high-pitched voice) </joey>
<joey> It's like, shit, I gotta (laughing). </joey>
<connor> - Songs like that help me
get in the zone, though. </connor>
<connor> Like when I'm gaming, it's repetitive. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What, "Nyan Cat?" </connor>
<connor> - I could, man. </connor>
<connor> I remember I got four hours in- </connor>
<connor> - It's his is fucking brain, man. </connor>
<garnt> It's the fucking brain. </garnt>
<connor> - What's the "Dance
till You're Dead" song? </connor>
<connor> You know the one? </connor>
<garnt> ♪ Dance till You're Dead ♪ </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, the 10 hour compilation. </garnt>
<garnt> In one gaming session,
I got six hours into </garnt>
<connor> the Deku "Dance till You're Dead" thing. </connor>
<garnt> - To be fair, that song is sick. </garnt>
<garnt> I have gone through a few
hours of that 10-hour mix. </garnt>
<garnt> - That song, when you're gaming, dude, </garnt>
<connor> it's like you're in the fucking zone. </connor>
<garnt> And then you check over,
you see Deku head banging, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, "Nice." </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause that song is
just like audible crack. </connor>
<connor> - You, you just, especially
when you're gaming, </connor>
<joey> - It's hacking your brain, bro. </joey>
<joey> - It just hacks, it just
properly gets you in the zone. </joey>
<joey> "Nyan Cat", on the other hand, </joey>
<garnt> is just the complete opposite of that </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just this really annoying noise </garnt>
<garnt> that you just can't pinpoint. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, "Nyan Cat" is like audible heroin. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> It just doesn't do anything for you, </connor>
<joey> it just makes you feel sluggish. </joey>
<joey> - Audible heroin? </joey>
<joey> Does heroin not do anything for you, Joey? </joey>
<connor> What are taking bro?
- It's more just like </connor>
<joey> the more you take, the
more you're just like, </joey>
<joey> "I can't function." </joey>
<garnt> - This is obviously coming from an analogy </garnt>
<garnt> from three people who have
never taken heroin before. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like that "Office"
joke where it's like, </connor>
<connor> why do they always talk
about it's like crack? </connor>
<connor> They've never tried crack. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's actually one of the few jokes </connor>
<joey> I love from "The Office." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I remember one time I was hanging out </garnt>
<joey> with Geoff from Mother's Basement. </joey>
<joey> Sorry, Geoff, I'm gonna
call you out for this. </joey>
<joey> But I remember we were, I
think it was an AX party </joey>
<joey> and we were talking about how much, </joey>
<joey> some crazy shit that we've done. </joey>
<joey> And he was talking about, </joey>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, it's like
downing a pint of cocaine." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Geoff, that's
not you do cocaine." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It was just the blinking
meme, it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Geoff that's not how cocaine is done. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't down a pint of cocaine. </garnt>
<joey> - Have you downed a pint of anything? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - So yeah, thank you for that, Geoff. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm definitely gonna be
using that in the future. </garnt>
<joey> - And the subreddit's definitely
gonna be using that too, </joey>
<joey> I guarantee it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like downing a pint of cocaine! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Talking about downing things- </garnt>
<connor> - Snorting a line of heroin. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - To get to the actual topic </garnt>
<garnt> that we were gonna talk about </garnt>
<garnt> before we went on this massive tangent, </garnt>
<garnt> as we always do, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess we wanted to talk
about food, right guys? </garnt>
<connor> - I love food. </connor>
<connor> - I love food, who doesn't love food? </connor>
<connor> - I only exist </connor>
<connor> for the next meal.
- I love consuming things </connor>
<garnt> in my mouth. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That came out really wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I'm glad you prefaced where you do it. </connor>
<connor> - Perhaps a pint of cocaine. </connor>
<joey> - I love when a pint of
cocaine is in my mouth. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess the reason I
wanted to bring this up is, </garnt>
<joey> Joey, you recently chose
to become a pescatarian. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, but let me explain- </joey>
<garnt> - Pescatarian in inverted commas. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes, I didn't decide
to fully transition, </joey>
<garnt> because I like meat too
much, but I figured just </garnt>
<garnt> for about a month, Aki and I were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Let's see if we can be pescatarian", </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel if there's any country </garnt>
<garnt> that is perfect to be a
pescatarian, it would be Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Because pescatarian, if you don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> means it's basically vegetarian,
but you can also eat fish. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Fish aren't animals,
they don't have souls. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, that's not real meat, </joey>
<garnt> fish aren't real meat. </garnt>
<garnt> So I figured just as, </garnt>
<garnt> not so much as a morality thing, </garnt>
<garnt> but more just to better my diet </garnt>
<garnt> and just eat a little bit healthier. </garnt>
<garnt> We were like, "Okay, let's
try and be pescatarian </garnt>
<garnt> for one month." </garnt>
<joey> Because it's gonna be the last, </joey>
<joey> So basically, my last
month of my 25th year </joey>
<joey> is gonna be me as a pescatarian, </joey>
<joey> and then on my 26th birthday
at the end of September, </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna be like, "Give me all the meat!" </garnt>
<garnt> - Give me every meat!
- Give me everything meat! </garnt>
<joey> I don't want to see a piece
of greenery on my plate! </joey>
<connor> - Dude, when I was like,
I feel like was raised </connor>
<connor> where if the meal didn't have
meat in it, it's not a meal. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's, that's how I feel. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe that's a, is that
a British thing maybe? </connor>
<joey> - I don't think so, I think
it's an Asian thing as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember, still to this day, </joey>
<connor> I cannot get full unless
I have some kind of meat. </connor>
<connor> - Give me a crumb of
chicken, a crumb of chicken. </connor>
<garnt> - I do count fish as meat,
but if I just have no meat- </garnt>
<connor> - There needs to be
something dead on my plate. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, that's how it is though, </garnt>
<garnt> I need something dead on my plate, </garnt>
<garnt> unless like, 'cause I've
tried having vegetarian meals </garnt>
<connor> and then I get filled up, </connor>
<connor> and then I get hungry an
hour later, without fail. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know if that's a mental thing </connor>
<garnt> where my body's like, bruh. </garnt>
<connor> - There's probably some diet expert </connor>
<garnt> watching us who can explain. </garnt>
<garnt> We're just gonna go off
all anecdotal evidence. </garnt>
<connor> So don't take anything we say seriously. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so basically, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I figured I like fish a lot </joey>
<joey> and Japan is such a seafood-heavy country </joey>
<joey> where you can walk down
the road and get some sushi </joey>
<connor> or go to the supermarket
and buy pre-cooked fish </connor>
<connor> or stuff that, and all of
it tastes so fucking good! </connor>
<connor> - It's also you don't have to
worry about it here, I feel. </connor>
<connor> Like I, dude, </connor>
<connor> Whenever someone ordered
like, oysters or shit </connor>
<connor> in a not-extremely
expensive place in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I'm like bro, all right. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, oysters are like, </garnt>
<garnt> you never order oysters unless you trust </garnt>
<garnt> the place you're ordering oysters from. </garnt>
<connor> - Also, if the curry place,
the Indian curry place, </connor>
<garnt> don't fuck with shrimp. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's always a coin
flip, no matter what. </garnt>
<garnt> - At least in the UK,
that is a fucking gamble </garnt>
<garnt> unless you have a place, </garnt>
<connor> and even if you have a place you're like, </connor>
<connor> "But do they treat the seafood correctly?" </connor>
<connor> They've probably got it- </connor>
<joey> - I need to have seen
this fish die in my face. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like there's
some certain cuisines, </garnt>
<joey> like Indian cuisines.
- In the UK especially. </joey>
<garnt> - Not just in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> In Thailand, especially
street food in Thailand </garnt>
<garnt> tastes amazing, but would you trust it </garnt>
<garnt> for like, to pass hygienic tests? </garnt>
<connor> Not exactly! </connor>
<connor> But it doesn't stop it from tasting, </connor>
<connor> you take that risk and some
of the dirtiest-looking places </connor>
<connor> taste the best. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's true, it's true. </connor>
<connor> - But it's like at AX when
you're walking down AX </connor>
<garnt> and those hotdog stands are there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And they've had these hotdog </connor>
<connor> in this cardboard packaging </connor>
<garnt> and it's been out there all fucking day, </garnt>
<garnt> and then they just
chuck them on the grill. </garnt>
<garnt> And sure, it looks amazing on the grill, </garnt>
<garnt> but those have been soggy for eight hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Dude, they smell </garnt>
<garnt> fucking amazing.
- They do, </garnt>
<garnt> they smell amazing, </garnt>
<connor> But what is it, it's like the
succubuses on all the stories. </connor>
<connor> They look amazing, right? </connor>
<connor> It's too good to be true. </connor>
<connor> Don't, your stomach's gonna hate you. </connor>
<connor> The only people, every
time someone gets sick </connor>
<joey> at a convention, it's always 'cause- </joey>
<joey> - It's always the hotdog!
- It's always the hotdog! </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause they always one of
those things, and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "Why did you do it?", and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "It just looked so good." </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I couldn't help myself, </connor>
<garnt> and it's like, you dumb
fuck, there is a Denny's, </garnt>
<joey> there is everything around here. </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying actually- </joey>
<joey> - There's literally
Chick-fil-A down the road. </joey>
<joey> - I say that, but Denny's
is probably a gamble as well </joey>
<connor> in the US, I'll be honest.
- In America, definitely. </connor>
<connor> But I kinda had a similar
thing in the Philippines </connor>
<joey> with street food because, </joey>
<joey> 'cause the one time I
went to the Philippines </joey>
<joey> to go see Aki's family, I was like, </joey>
<joey> there's all this
amazing-looking street food, </joey>
<joey> but I feel if I don't
make the right choice, </joey>
<garnt> I'm probably just gonna die on the road. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's really weird, I did, </garnt>
<joey> like get, not food poisoning, </joey>
<joey> but I definitely got some bad diarrhea </joey>
<garnt> from one of the street foods, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was from a mango. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow! </garnt>
<joey> - Which is weird, you wouldn't expect- </joey>
<garnt> - A fruit really do you like that, man? </garnt>
<joey> - It was like of all the- </joey>
<connor> - That's just why I wanna eat meat, </connor>
<connor> that's why I wanna eat meat, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I had fucking
balut that I just bought </garnt>
<connor> off a random woman on the street. </connor>
<connor> Balut is a duck fetus. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, dude, that shit looks nasty, bro. </connor>
<connor> - You would think that
that would get me sick, </connor>
<connor> but no, it wasn't the fetus,
it was a fucking mango. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I can understand if you've
grown up with food like that, </connor>
<joey> but can you, as an
Australian-Japanese dude, </joey>
<joey> see a fucking bird and just be like, </joey>
<connor> "Yo, fucking that looks
tasty, give me two of those." </connor>
<joey> - Hey man, Aki's dad was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, that shit tastes good." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "All right, I trust you." </joey>
<joey> And so I bought two. </joey>
<garnt> - Is that the weirdest thing you've eaten? </garnt>
<joey> - It's probably the weirdest
thing I've eaten, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I trust people when they say that, </connor>
<joey> but I'm looking at them the whole time </joey>
<connor> like I do not expect anything from this. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna eat it just to entertain you, </connor>
<connor> but I'm expecting this to taste like shit. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, I've filmed
a video on it as well. </joey>
<connor> It's on my second channel,
because apparently Aki told me </connor>
<connor> that this is one of the, you
know "Fear Factor", right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- The American show. </connor>
<connor> Apparently she said that this balut stuff </connor>
<connor> is one of the last foods that
they eat on "Fear Factor." </connor>
<connor> If you can eat this then
you can eat anything. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, but it's just a duck fetus. </joey>
<connor> - I'll eat it, I'm just not
gonna be happy about it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I looked at that
motherfucker dead in the eyes </joey>
<connor> while eating it, so I was like- </connor>
<connor> - Wake up, wake up! </connor>
<joey> - I was like, "Yes, you
are going into my stomach!" </joey>
<joey> - It's like in Japan, they have this </joey>
<connor> at the sushi restaurant,
normally fish restaurants, </connor>
<joey> they have the sperm sack
and this shit is disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, shirako? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, dude,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And even when you speak
to Japanese, they're like </joey>
<garnt> you either just despise
that shit or you love it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's an acquired taste.
- It is acquired. </garnt>
<garnt> - It looks like a brain
that has lost all the water. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's fallen apart,
it's all untangled, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> And then when someone's
like, "Oh, what is it?" </garnt>
<joey> Oh, no, just try it, hee-hee. </joey>
<joey> And then you try and like,
oh, it's a sperm sack. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, with sperm in it. </joey>
<joey> - And it tastes like how you would imagine </joey>
<connor> a sperm sac would taste. </connor>
<joey> - It does feel like you just
got jizzed in the mouth. </joey>
<garnt> - It totally does, 'cause I
remember the weirdest thing </garnt>
<garnt> I would say I'd had was
in China where it's, </garnt>
<garnt> I was with a friend and their family </garnt>
<joey> and I don't know what it is, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is an Asian thing, </joey>
<joey> but whenever they see a foreigner trying, </joey>
<joey> they always ordered the most exotic food </joey>
<joey> and then try to get them to try it. </joey>
<joey> My parents do exactly the same </joey>
<joey> and their family did
exactly the same to me. </joey>
<joey> So they were ordering all this weird shit </joey>
<garnt> and then they ordered this soup. </garnt>
<garnt> And they told me, "Oh, try the
soup, it's just beef soup." </garnt>
<garnt> So I started chowing
down on this beef soup </garnt>
<garnt> and then I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Mm, this is all right,
this is all right", </garnt>
<connor> and then I get to this really chewy parts </connor>
<connor> that I have to really- </connor>
<garnt> - I think I know what it is.
- Bite my way through. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, what is this?" </joey>
<joey> And it had the most awful
after taste you can imagine, </joey>
<joey> it just stayed in your mouth forever. </joey>
<joey> And then I asked them, "What
the hell was that chewy bit?" </joey>
<garnt> And then my friend asked their family </garnt>
<garnt> and they translate to me, and they said, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh no, that's probably
the bull's testicles." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Bruh.
- I'm like- </garnt>
<garnt> "Hold on a second, what is this?" </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, this is a bull's penis soup. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like why did
you not lead with that?! </garnt>
<connor> - This feels like information </connor>
<connor> I should've been told at
the start of this meal. </connor>
<connor> - They knew exactly what they were doing. </connor>
<garnt> They were like, oh, this is
beef soup, this is beef soup, </garnt>
<garnt> you can have this. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, I'm one of those
people who would not be mad </joey>
<joey> at that kind of stuff,
just because I want- </joey>
<joey> - Free dick, bro. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna try all the weird shit. </joey>
<connor> Because I know- </connor>
<connor> - I do as well, I do as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because I know if I
went to a restaurant like that </joey>
<joey> by myself and I looked at the menu </joey>
<garnt> and I saw bull's penis,
testicle, bull's penis soup- </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my god, Joe, that
was a fountain, bro! </joey>
<garnt> - Joey's salivating at the thought. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Bull, bull, bull penis. </garnt>
<joey> - Sorry, that was like let's
just taste this one meat. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - See, people like that, I'm
like, yeah, order it, order it. </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna look you in the
eye, I'm gonna eat this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I want you to know that I'm gonna eat it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm gonna tell you
it tastes like shit. </garnt>
<connor> I'm not gonna give you the
satisfaction of going like- </connor>
<joey> - Again, if I saw that on the menu, </joey>
<connor> I probably wouldn't order it myself. </connor>
<connor> - No, you're gonna go for like, </connor>
<connor> - the beef burger.
- There's no way. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I'll get something
that I'm familiar with. </connor>
<connor> So I would rather someone
just order me some weird shit </connor>
<connor> and then trick me into eating
it so that could be like, </connor>
<connor> well, I may not- </connor>
<connor> - Anthrax, yeah! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, well, I
may not have enjoyed it, </garnt>
<joey> but hey, now I can say that
I've eaten bull's testicles. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think I'd be very
happy if someone had been like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, that's a dick",
and I'm like (sighs). </connor>
<connor> - To be fair, they disguised it very well. </connor>
<garnt> - You know, sometimes-
- Is it gay? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Am I gay? </garnt>
<garnt> - It didn't look like a dick </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was all minced up into a ball- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think they
would just chop it off </connor>
<garnt> and be like there we go. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a full dick. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like a full dick on a plate. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what is this? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, it's just bull meat. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What kind of bull meat? </garnt>
<garnt> That looks very much like a testicle." </garnt>
<connor> - I think the problem is
with stuff like this for me, </connor>
<connor> and I'm sure a lot people
can relate to this, </connor>
<connor> I don't want my fucking meals </connor>
<connor> to be a fucking adventure
game for someone, dude. </connor>
<connor> I just wanna eat, bro. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I just wanna enjoy
my meal, have a nice time. </connor>
<joey> - You just wanna skip the story. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And not turn it into a
fucking Bear Grylls TV show </connor>
<connor> in the middle of this restaurant. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I hate it when people try and do that, </connor>
<connor> like, try this, try this awful thing. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Why would I
try that awful thing? </connor>
<connor> You've just told me it's awful. </connor>
<connor> Why are you trying to make me </connor>
<joey> eat something awful?"
- Oh, no I'm the </joey>
<joey> complete opposite, I will
happily be like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, Joey's that guy in the restaurant </connor>
<garnt> who just orders the weirdest shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you and Aki both do it. </connor>
<garnt> We're sitting down, they'll be like, </garnt>
<connor> "So who ordered the slime
shit? Who ordered that?" </connor>
<garnt> Oh, Aki will go, "Oh, I like that." </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, "That's a
lie, you don't like it. </connor>
<connor> You're just ordering it
to make yourself look </connor>
<connor> like you're fucking Bear
Grylls at this izakaya. </connor>
<connor> Just admit it, okay? Admit
it, no-one likes it." </connor>
<garnt> - I love the fact that every
time we get to that moment, </garnt>
<garnt> every time without fail, you're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Do you guys wanna try some?" </connor>
<connor> And every time we just say, </connor>
<connor> "No, Joey, that doesn't look appetizing." </connor>
<connor> - But I want you guys to try it! </connor>
<connor> - So then Joey finishes, </connor>
<connor> what is this goop shit you
always get, what is it? </connor>
<joey> You know the goop- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, takowasa? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's fucking awful. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like octopus, </connor>
<joey> and wasabi, and you put it in a blender. </joey>
<connor> - I've never seen any Japanese
person order it around me. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean? I know
plenty of Japanese people </joey>
<joey> who eat it! </joey>
<joey> Why do you think it's a
staple menu at izakaya? </joey>
<joey> - Nah, it's on the bottom dude. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then after that,
there's just other fish </connor>
<connor> that I don't know how they prepare it, </connor>
<connor> but it's just got the
consistency of a tire </connor>
<garnt> with no taste. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, the fish-
- It's like a toenail. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's
like the toenail thing. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It tastes and looks like a toenail. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it feels a toenail. </garnt>
<connor> - It's ray, it's stingray. </connor>
<garnt> - Stingray fin, right? </garnt>
<joey> - It's the kind of thing where it's like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, sure, when I'm drunk enough, </joey>
<joey> I'll chew on it and
I'll have no complaints. </joey>
<joey> But when it's like I wanna have a meal, </joey>
<connor> why would I fill myself up with something </connor>
<connor> that doesn't taste like anything </connor>
<connor> and takes me 10 minutes to eat </connor>
<connor> and just frustrates me? </connor>
<joey> - You had that the other day, </joey>
<connor> when we went to a
restaurant and I ordered, </connor>
<connor> I ordered tokoroten. </connor>
<connor> You know, the rubbery stuff? </connor>
<joey> - Joey was like, "It's zero calories." </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "So what
if it's zero calories?" </connor>
<joey> - Well, because you're always on about </joey>
<joey> how many calories does this have? </joey>
<connor> - I'm just thinking sometimes,
in a meal you're like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, I don't wanna kill myself." </connor>
<joey> - My dad described that at
once as eating an eraser. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like that.
- That's pretty much </connor>
<garnt> what it looks like. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like sometimes when
you hear zero calories, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "Oh, that's gonna taste bad." </connor>
<joey> 'Cause celery has zero calories. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if you've
eaten celery on its own, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course I have, I love celery. </joey>
<joey> - On its own?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, bro, celery tastes
like shit on its own. </garnt>
<garnt> - No!
- Yeah, it does </garnt>
<connor> taste like shit.
- What the fuck?! </connor>
<connor> - It tastes like paint- </connor>
<garnt> - That's not even an acquired taste. </garnt>
<connor> - It just tastes like paint
remover in vegetable form. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like Brussels sprouts. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I love Brussels sprouts.
- I love Brussels sprouts. </connor>
<garnt> - Get the fuck out! </garnt>
<garnt> Brussels sprouts is like F-tier vegetable! </garnt>
<garnt> Why do people put it on roasts? </garnt>
<joey> Everyone's just, it's a massive
lie, it's a massive lie. </joey>
<joey> - I love Brussels sprouts,
man, they're great. </joey>
<connor> - Get rid of those fucking
Brussels sprouts on my roast. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they have such a really nice, </connor>
<connor> distinct flavor to them- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it tastes awful, it's bitter. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, I don't know, </garnt>
<connor> It's just like, anti-umami. </connor>
<garnt> - Wait, do you like broccoli? </garnt>
<connor> Do you like broccoli? </connor>
<garnt> - Broccoli's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you have to keep in mind, </garnt>
<joey> we're talking to someone
who doesn't like ketchup. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, before we go into
more in-depth food discussion, </connor>
<connor> Garnt doesn't like condiments, basically. </connor>
<garnt> - I just like the way
things are meant to taste. </garnt>
<connor> - So barbecue sauce, no?
- No, no. </connor>
<connor> - Ketchup?
- I just, I just like, </connor>
<connor> - No, we're gonna go through
all the condiments here </connor>
<garnt> just to make sure.
- Mustard? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, mustard, no?
- Mustard, if it's not, </garnt>
<connor> if it's just like, the beans. </connor>
<connor> - Mayo? You don't like any mayo. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I don't like mayo. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tabasco or anything like that, maybe? </garnt>
<connor> - Tabasco, I don't really
see that as a condiment. </connor>
<connor> It's something like if
I need an extra kick </connor>
<garnt> to make it more spicy. </garnt>
<connor> - So when you eat fries, it's just plain? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's just salt and pepper. </garnt>
<connor> - That's so sad. That's so sad
- Just salt and pepper fries. </connor>
<connor> No, that's why I like my thin fries, </connor>
<joey> 'cause it absorbs the spices. </joey>
<joey> - It's just oil. It's
literally just oil, bro. </joey>
<garnt> - We said that the other day, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we were talking about </garnt>
<garnt> how we like the thick cut fries. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like the thin fries. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but then Garnt was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, I don't like the thick fries, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I taste the potato." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Yeah, that's what a chip is!" </joey>
<garnt> - No, I want to taste you know, the, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) this is gonna sound so bad, </garnt>
<garnt> like it's the oil flavor or the salt </garnt>
<garnt> and all the salt and pepper flavor. </garnt>
<garnt> If it's too much potato,
you're just eating, </garnt>
<garnt> it just feels like you're
eating starch with no flavor. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but sometimes
if it's done perfectly, </connor>
<connor> that starch is just fluffy and beautiful. </connor>
<joey> - And it works so well when
you put it with ketchup </joey>
<connor> or mayonnaise or whatever you put </connor>
<joey> with chips, right?
- Yeah, when you mix </joey>
<joey> the ketchup and mayo together, </joey>
<joey> you get a nice burger sauce. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that's a fries
sauce, oh, it's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - That makes me gag so bad, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking hate ketchup and
mayo, like ketchup and mayo- </garnt>
<connor> - Go eat your dick, bro. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- Go eat your dick. </connor>
<connor> - Ketchup and mayo by themselves </connor>
<connor> are disgusting enough to me, </connor>
<connor> but to mix them together and
they form this pink color, </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, "Get that
shit out of my face, man!" </joey>
<joey> - No, fries sauce is so good! </joey>
<connor> - Can you go into- </connor>
<garnt> - I can't be the only one here, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't be the only fucking one here. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I think with this
case, you are the only one. </joey>
<joey> - When you go into any
normal chain in the UK, </joey>
<garnt> you can't get it 'cause
called burger sauce. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's called Thousand Island Sauce. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it Thousand Island Sauce? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, I love Thousand Island Sauce. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but they don't do it
in McDonald's, KFC or wherever. </connor>
<joey> - That's like ranch with ketchup, right? </joey>
<connor> - I think so, but mayo with ketchup mixed </connor>
<joey> it's just burger sauce in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, it's called fries sauce in US. </joey>
<joey> - And you can't get it unless you go </joey>
<connor> to those dirty chicken shops in London. </connor>
<connor> You go to them and you gotta
fucking haggle with them </connor>
<garnt> just to get the fucking ketchup. </garnt>
<garnt> They're so stingy bro, they
won't give you anything. </garnt>
<connor> And I used to go into
mine all the time, dude, </connor>
<connor> and I felt like I was getting mugged off, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was the only
white guy in this area </connor>
<connor> and I would always go in like, </connor>
<connor> "Yes, I would like um,
five wings, a burger", </connor>
<connor> and then the people would come in, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, what's up bossman?
I'll have the wings set." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Fuck dude, Jesus Christ." </connor>
<connor> I felt so out of place </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just didn't know how to talk. </connor>
<garnt> Do I say bossman to the guy? </garnt>
<garnt> Can I say bossman? Is that weird? </garnt>
<garnt> I feel weird going, "Yes,
I'll just take a fry please, </garnt>
<joey> and a Tango." </joey>
<joey> - I'll take a fry, bossman. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I just felt bad
when there was 12 year olds </joey>
<joey> fighting in the area next to me </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just trying to order the chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I just want the (mumbling). </garnt>
<garnt> Can I have burger sauce, please? </garnt>
<garnt> While the other guys are fucking jumping </garnt>
<garnt> over the counter to grab it. </garnt>
<joey> They would do that, they
would put their hands </joey>
<joey> over the counter and grab the shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and the fucking owners- </garnt>
<garnt> - The fucking audacity. </garnt>
<connor> - I know, the audacity of these bitches. </connor>
<joey> - Actually, there is
one sauce that I do like </joey>
<joey> and it's very specific,
but it's peri-peri, </joey>
<joey> or Nando's sauce. </joey>
<garnt> But are they in the same category? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like a marinade. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like if it's
more on the marinade side </connor>
<joey> of things, I love marinade.
- That's like teriyaki, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you have Nando's in Australia? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah we do, but it's fucking expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> So no one goes to it. </garnt>
<joey> - I fucking I miss Nando's here. </joey>
<joey> I miss it so much. </joey>
<garnt> - Cheeky Nando's for the boys. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, to be fair, I feel UK, </joey>
<connor> I tried Nando's in the UK, </connor>
<joey> and it's infinitely better
than the one in Australia. </joey>
<joey> - People will always chat shit about it, </joey>
<connor> but the thing is, is that it's the perfect </connor>
<joey> in between a fast food
place and a restaurant </joey>
<joey> where sometimes you just want the chicken </joey>
<joey> and you wanna get out. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<connor> - You also don't wanna feel like shit. </connor>
<garnt> - It's one of the few places in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> that we can be proud of in terms of food, </garnt>
<garnt> because when you think
of British cuisines, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, "Well, what
can we be proud about? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh yeah, beans on toast." </garnt>
<connor> That's British cuisine, right? </connor>
<connor> - What's with British people
getting bullied online </connor>
<connor> all the time now, man? </connor>
<joey> Remember when it used to be
British people were cool. </joey>
<joey> in 2012 and Harry Potter was in full steam </joey>
<joey> and Tumblr loved British people? </joey>
<joey> And then now it's just like,
"Haha, he said Chewsday. </joey>
<joey> He said Chewsday, innit?" </joey>
<garnt> - Wa-er </garnt>
<garnt> - [All] Wa-er, wa-er. </garnt>
<garnt> - He likes beans on, </garnt>
<connor> yes, I like beans on toast, okay? </connor>
<connor> I can eat it as many times
as I need to, goddammit! </connor>
<joey> - There's a limit with me with beans. </joey>
<connor> - Baked beans? </connor>
<garnt> Why do you say beans like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's a funny word! </garnt>
<joey> I love accentuating the B in beans. </joey>
<connor> - I can imagine if I
wasn't born in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I would think baked beans are just like, </connor>
<connor> why would you ever eat baked beans? </connor>
<joey> - Well, 'cause in Australia
we eat baked beans </joey>
<connor> quite often as well. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I would eat it on toast, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I would just
fucking crack open a can. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, in university,
I basically lived off </connor>
<connor> just beans in cans and I
would just heat them up </connor>
<connor> and eat them for dinner. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds disgusting to me. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, it was.
- I wouldn't be able </connor>
<joey> to live off it. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't know how to cook, </joey>
<connor> so I would just boil
pasta and put salt on it </connor>
<connor> and eat the pasta. </connor>
<garnt> - I love how the cooking
experience at university </garnt>
<garnt> is just how many ways can I cook pasta? </garnt>
<connor> It's just that. </connor>
<connor> - It took me a year to figure out </connor>
<connor> that you could just pour the pot sauces </connor>
<connor> on top of the pasta. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because I was so content and
I didn't wanna look stupid </connor>
<connor> in front of my uni mates, </connor>
<connor> and I remember my mum offered
to teach me how to cook </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "I don't need that. </connor>
<connor> How hard can it be?" </connor>
<connor> - I got this.
- How hard can it be? </connor>
<connor> So yeah, I was eating plain
pasta and beans for a year. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- It's pretty depressing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like cup ramen, cup ramen- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, cup, the first
day of university I went </connor>
<joey> and bought a crate of pot
noodles and lived off them. </joey>
<connor> That was beautiful. </connor>
<joey> - You can't go wrong
with pot noodles, dude. </joey>
<connor> - We should probably get
back onto Japanese food, </connor>
<garnt> shouldn't we? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, going back to Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> recently, funnily enough, </garnt>
<connor> I just went to the cup ramen
museum in Yokohama this week, </connor>
<connor> which, the only reason we
went to the cup ramen museum </connor>
<connor> was just because- </connor>
<connor> - It's just there.
- It was just there. </connor>
<connor> I was like, whatever,
it's something to do. </connor>
<connor> But it was actually really
interesting and really fun. </connor>
<garnt> It was not someplace I thought to go </garnt>
<garnt> that would be a fun, exciting place to go, </garnt>
<joey> but it was fun to learn about cup ramen. </joey>
<joey> I had no idea that basically, </joey>
<joey> cup ramen exists because of Americans. </joey>
<joey> Because instant noodle was invented </joey>
<joey> in the usual packeted way, </joey>
<joey> and then they tried to sell it to America. </joey>
<joey> And Americans were just
like, "How do we eat this?" </joey>
<connor> Well, you're gonna have
to use a fucking chopstick </connor>
<connor> with bowls, like, that's too inefficient. </connor>
<connor> So they just started putting
it in their soda cans </connor>
<connor> or no, not the soda cans, the soda cups, </connor>
<connor> and just put the ramen
in and put hot water in. </connor>
<joey> And that's how cup ramen was invented! </joey>
<joey> - Oh wow. </joey>
<joey> So cup ramen is an American invention? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well it's- </joey>
<connor> - It was invented in Japan,
the method of doing it </connor>
<connor> with the noodles- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but it was when they tried </connor>
<connor> to sell it to Americans that
he saw Americans doing that, </connor>
<connor> and he was like, "Let's just
put it in the fucking cup." </connor>
<garnt> So, thank you, America, for cup ramen. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and if you're in prison, </connor>
<joey> it's your currency. </joey>
<joey> - Cup ramen currency.
- So you don't want Vox video, </joey>
<connor> it's actually currency in
most prisons, that's so funny. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, in terms of Japanese food, </connor>
<garnt> what are some Japanese
food you want more people </garnt>
<joey> to know about or that you have discovered </joey>
<joey> since moving to Japan that maybe
not many people know about? </joey>
<joey> - Well, you know my answer, right? </joey>
<joey> - I already know your answer, </joey>
<joey> we've talked about this before. </joey>
<joey> Go on, Joey. </joey>
<joey> Simp for your dish. </joey>
<joey> - I'm simping for a little
dish called tsukemen. </joey>
<joey> It's not ramen, it's tsukemen. </joey>
<joey> So basically, tsukemen, oversimplified. </joey>
<joey> Think of ramen but separate
the noodles from the broth </joey>
<joey> and make that broth thick as a bitch. </joey>
<connor> - I will say when I first- </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> When I was first, I saw it
on the menu, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Why the fuck would I want my noodles </joey>
<joey> separated from the broth?" </joey>
<joey> That sounds like it's
demarinating the noodles. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, an extra step. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it sounded like it was just </joey>
<garnt> making the noodles less flavorful. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just didn't make any logical sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - But somehow, it makes the
noodles even more flavorful </garnt>
<joey> when you dip them into
this and you basically </joey>
<joey> have the broth on the noodles (mumbling). </joey>
<connor> - Because the thing with ramen broth </connor>
<connor> is that it's very liquidy
because the noodle </connor>
<connor> - It's so diluted.
- is gonna be sitting </connor>
<connor> in this broth for a long, long time. </connor>
<connor> - And you can drink it. </connor>
<connor> - And you can drink it. </connor>
<connor> But tsukemen broths, they
have to make it thick, </connor>
<joey> because when you put the noodles in </joey>
<joey> and then you take it
out again, as you said, </joey>
<joey> the broth has to stick to the noodles. </joey>
<joey> And that shit is, </joey>
<joey> the flavor of that is so fucking powerful. </joey>
<connor> - And then when you're
done eating the noodles </connor>
<connor> you can pour a soup into
the broth to dilute it </connor>
<connor> to make it drinkable. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically like concentrated ramen. </connor>
<joey> That's basically the first time, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know, because I
feel no matter what we say </joey>
<garnt> or how much we try to sell it, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't sell it in words. </garnt>
<connor> - Because it just doesn't
look as pretty as ramen. </connor>
<garnt> Ramen is so pretty. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you explain it logically,
and you're just like, </garnt>
<joey> that just sounds like
ramen with extra steps. </joey>
<joey> What makes it so amazing?
- That's exactly what you guys </joey>
<garnt> said when I tried to sell it
to you guys, and I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Trust me, let's go to one of
my favorite tsukemen places </joey>
<joey> in Ikebukuro and you can
just eat it and tell me." </joey>
<garnt> And I took them- </garnt>
<joey> - And I remember we were chatting
the biggest, maddest shit. </joey>
<joey> We were like, "Sure Joey, sure, whatever." </joey>
<joey> And then we got the dish
and we just sat there </joey>
<joey> in silence for a good 10 minutes </joey>
<joey> as we were just eating this. </joey>
<joey> And I remember the second
place you took me to, </joey>
<garnt> I swear, I had an existential
crisis eating the tsukemen. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember you both were eating, </garnt>
<garnt> you were just staring at me, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just looking at his bowl of, </garnt>
<connor> I was just eating this bowl
of tsukemen being just like... </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It's perfect. </connor>
<garnt> - It's perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll tell you what it felt like, </garnt>
<garnt> it felt like that meme
in "Ratatouille" where, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> where I had one bite
and it just took me back </garnt>
<garnt> to my childhood or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I was having a flashback to
this dish grandma made me. </garnt>
<joey> My grandma's never made me tsukemen, </joey>
<joey> but it gave me that same homely feeling </joey>
<joey> that I had when eating a home
cooked meal, back as a kid. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, "What
is happening right now?" </garnt>
<joey> - I've never seen anyone
have a "Food Wars" moment </joey>
<joey> in real life, but that was legitimately </joey>
<joey> the closest I've ever seen to- </joey>
<garnt> - I was this close to fucking crying. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I remember I stopped to, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you were sitting
opposite me and I was eating, </joey>
<joey> and I looked over and you were kinda just </joey>
<garnt> silently staring at it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember I said to him, like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Are your eyes watering? </garnt>
<garnt> Are you really about to cry over </garnt>
<joey> this bowl of tsukemen?" </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That, that is uh, that definitely did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Meanwhile, I was just there in my mind </garnt>
<connor> like fucking Tyler Wall, like "Yes!" </connor>
<connor> Just fucking eating it. </connor>
<joey> - And then I remember the next day, </joey>
<joey> we were talking about whatever the fuck </joey>
<joey> we were talking about,
and Garnt just texted, </joey>
<joey> fully serious, being like, </joey>
<joey> "I had a dream about
that tsukemen last night. </joey>
<joey> I actually had a dream
about that tsukemen, </joey>
<joey> because it's that fucking good." </joey>
<connor> - As well because they have the meat </connor>
<connor> and all the veg in the broth, </connor>
<connor> when you bite into the veg or the meat, </connor>
<connor> they've absorbed this intense
broth and it just bursts, </connor>
<joey> and it's so fucking good.
- And the meat is so soft </joey>
<connor> and just breaks apart.
- Yeah, it's so tender, </connor>
<connor> so tender. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I'm not
gonna say that the ramen </connor>
<joey> in Japan is bad or anything, </joey>
<joey> there's some fucking
fantastic ramen out there. </joey>
<joey> But I just feel that
tsukemen is such an underdog </joey>
<joey> because people just, as you say, </joey>
<joey> people just think that it's
just an inferior ramen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, that's what I thought </garnt>
<connor> and I didn't even know about
tsukemen until I moved here </connor>
<joey> and you told me about it. </joey>
<connor> And I feel like people only come here </connor>
<joey> and they only know ramen. </joey>
<garnt> Because when I came here,
I only knew ramen as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I totally don't blame
people who are like </joey>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, I just wanna eat sushi </garnt>
<garnt> and I just wanna eat ramen." </garnt>
<garnt> But it just frustrates me when there's, </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a ramen shop,
and they usually have </garnt>
<garnt> tsukemen on the menu as well. </garnt>
<joey> And yet they just completely ignore that </joey>
<joey> and just go for the basic veg ramen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I feel like you do
get a better ramen experience </garnt>
<garnt> here than you do anywhere
else in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just frustrates me
when people are like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm gonna go to Ichiran Ramen", </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like, you can
have an Ichiran in America! </garnt>
<garnt> Why did you fly all the way to Japan </garnt>
<joey> to have something you can have in America? </joey>
<garnt> - I do not understand
why people come to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and they try, what's the curry place? </garnt>
<joey> - CoCo curry.
- Is it CoCo curry that's </joey>
<joey> like the international one? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, CoCo Ichiban. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why they come here </connor>
<garnt> and just try the CoCo curry here. </garnt>
<connor> - In defense of both those chains, </connor>
<connor> I'll be devil's advocate, </connor>
<connor> I went to Ichiran Ramen maybe a month ago. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was pretty fucking good. </connor>
<joey> I thought it was like- </joey>
<joey> - It's not bad. </joey>
<connor> It's just mid. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It is. </connor>
<connor> - If you don't live here, right? </connor>
<connor> And you don't wanna fuck around </connor>
<joey> with going down these alleyways,
looking on Google Maps </joey>
<joey> trying to find shit, I can
understand where you're like, </joey>
<joey> "I want a good ramen that delivers, </joey>
<joey> and I don't have to talk to anyone. </joey>
<joey> They have an English menu." </joey>
<joey> I get that, 'cause sometimes
these ramen places, bro, </joey>
<joey> no pictures, only Kanji. </joey>
<connor> You've gotta give your ticket to the guy, </connor>
<connor> you've gotta hope that he calls you out </connor>
<connor> and you know that it's you, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's a little, you know, you know- </garnt>
<garnt> - You've gotta figure
out if he's asking you </garnt>
<garnt> if you want extra veg or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause you hand it to
him and he'll ask what size </connor>
<connor> and you'll be like, what? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Or, do you want rice? </connor>
<garnt> Rice they ask some and sometimes, </garnt>
<joey> and 'cause the word for rice
and meal is the same, gohan- </joey>
<joey> - Gohan.
- And so one time </joey>
<joey> they asked me "Gohan?", </joey>
<joey> I just completely forgot that it was rice. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Yeah, I want a meal, </joey>
<joey> I just gave you my tickets you dumb fuck. </joey>
<joey> Take my ticket!" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know that's Goku's son. </joey>
<connor> (laughing drowns out speaker) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so I get it with Ichiran Ramen. </joey>
<joey> Okay, it was a little expensive though. </joey>
<joey> I'll give you that. </joey>
<joey> - It is. </joey>
<joey> - The, the noodles were
thin though, it was good. </joey>
<connor> I wanna start a series where I go </connor>
<connor> around reviewing ramen chains. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's the
problem I have with Ichiran </joey>
<joey> is that it is the thin noodles, </joey>
<joey> and I don't have a problem
with the thin noodles </joey>
<connor> but I like my noodles
like I like my women. </connor>
<connor> I like them thick. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I was wondering where
you're going with that. </connor>
<garnt> - Joey's like the inappropriate uncle </garnt>
<connor> that has to mention something
sexual every 10 seconds. </connor>
<connor> - Of course! </connor>
<joey> It's the only way people relate to me. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> But yeah, that's what I
love about tsukemen though, </joey>
<joey> is that those noodles
are so fucking thick. </joey>
<garnt> - So there's, so there's like, okay- </garnt>
<garnt> - But I remember the first
place you took me to. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like trying to go to
an all-you-can-eat buffet </garnt>
<garnt> with this one little noodle dish, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it was so thick. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember I saw you guys finishing it </connor>
<connor> and I wasn't even halfway through. </connor>
<connor> I'm like (slurps) </connor>
<connor> I can do more, I can do this, guys. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't take all the thickness. </garnt>
<connor> - With tsukemen, you cannot pause. </connor>
<connor> You have to keep going. </connor>
<joey> If you stop for a moment, you
will think, "Shit, I'm full." </joey>
<connor> - You can't let your brain catch up </connor>
<garnt> to your stomach.
- No, don't let it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like doing the
big bang burger challenge </garnt>
<garnt> in Persona 5, do you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> That was kind of what I felt like. </garnt>
<garnt> I got what </garnt>
<garnt> the main character felt.
- You didn't have enough </garnt>
<garnt> determination points, man.
- No, I didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> I needed to upgrade more points. </garnt>
<connor> - Weak. </connor>
<connor> Okay, in Japan there's what,
three main types of noodles? </connor>
<joey> There's the soba noodles,
the udon, and the ramen. </joey>
<joey> Okay, and the difference
between these are the soba ones </joey>
<joey> are typically healthy, quite thin. </joey>
<joey> - Soba is buckwheat. </joey>
<joey> - Buckwheat, so quite healthy for you. </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely the healthiest, yes. </joey>
<connor> - Is ramen the least healthy for you? </connor>
<joey> - Ramen? I mean, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - There's a lot of calories </garnt>
<joey> in ramen.
- Yeah, ramen I'd say </joey>
<joey> is probably the least, the most unhealthy. </joey>
<connor> - And there's udon, so ramen's
kinda like in the middle. </connor>
<connor> Soba's really thin. </connor>
<connor> It tastes healthy, so make
of that what you want. </connor>
<connor> And then udon is the
real fucking thick boy. </connor>
<garnt> - The thick white one. </garnt>
<connor> - Why does soba taste healthy? </connor>
<connor> I don't understand. </connor>
<garnt> - Because it is healthy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know it is, but I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> what is the big difference
between soba and ramen? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to put it into words now. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's maybe
because a lot of soba dishes </joey>
<connor> aren't sitting in this very </connor>
<connor> oily broth.
- Soba doesn't hit back, bro. </connor>
<joey> Soba just goes down. </joey>
<joey> Ramen fights you as it's
going down your stomach, bro. </joey>
<connor> It's a challenge, you gotta
beat that shit in your stomach. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Also, I've noticed- </connor>
<garnt> - Ramen is soba with attitude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's soba with attitude. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think because ramen
is so heavy in calories, </garnt>
<garnt> even the shitty cup ramen's
taste fucking good here </garnt>
<connor> but if you go and get
the supermarket soba, </connor>
<garnt> that shit tastes awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it does. </garnt>
<connor> - It tastes really bad. </connor>
<connor> - You need to go to a good soba place </connor>
<connor> to really appreciate it.
- Yes, soba restaurants </connor>
<connor> are amazing! </connor>

<joey> and thank you to Grand Summoners </joey>
<joey> for sponsoring today's episode. </joey>
<joey> - Back to the video. </joey>
<garnt> So yeah, in soba restaurants, </garnt>
<garnt> they give you the choice
of cold soba and hot soba. </garnt>
<garnt> And as someone who's grown up </garnt>
<joey> with noodles my entire life, </joey>
<joey> I've grown up with the idea that you have </joey>
<joey> to have noodles as a hot dish. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't know, is
it weird for you guys, </joey>
<garnt> especially you, Connor, the
idea of eating a cold main dish? </garnt>
<connor> - If there's options,
I'm always gonna go hot. </connor>
<garnt> I went out the other day and it was, </garnt>
<garnt> this is from two weeks
ago I went to a place </garnt>
<garnt> and the AC wasn't working, it
was 35 degrees, feels like 40, </garnt>
<garnt> the person asked me, "Do
you want hot or cold?" </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, hot. </garnt>
<garnt> No one else in this restaurant- </garnt>
<garnt> - The absolute mad lad! </garnt>
<garnt> - No one else in this restaurant had hot. </garnt>
<joey> I could easily see that,
'cause it comes in a bowl </joey>
<joey> when it's hot and when
you get the cold it's </joey>
<joey> on this little bamboo thing. </joey>
<joey> And dude, I'm sweating my
ass off in this restaurant </joey>
<connor> but still, I was like,
"I'm glad I got hot." </connor>
<connor> - Hot soba has its place though. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when I first moved here, </connor>
<joey> I was like hot soba,
hot soba, only hot soba. </joey>
<joey> And then I tried cold once and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this is really refreshing." </joey>
<joey> It tastes so totally different, </joey>
<garnt> but it still gives me a good feeling </garnt>
<connor> - I've had it cold, it's not bad. </connor>
<connor> To me, cold thing, cold
noodles don't feel like a meal. </connor>
<connor> It feels like a leftover. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Hot noodles feel like a meal. </connor>
<joey> - I kinda get what you're saying, </joey>
<joey> but its' also very monkey brain. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like you
found it in your fridge </joey>
<connor> and you're like, (sighs)
"Okay, let's eat it." </connor>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<connor> Is the logic then that
you can't be bothered </connor>
<joey> to eat it after that? </joey>
<connor> - When you order cold or hot soba as well, </connor>
<joey> so when you get hot soba,
you just get the noodles </joey>
<joey> and the broth that it comes in, </joey>
<joey> but I always feel jealous
of the cold people </joey>
<connor> who get the little dipping sauce. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so with the cold soba, </garnt>
<garnt> you have a tiny little bowl. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is the sauce? </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a shoyu base. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought so, like a
soy, and it's really good. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not a broth, it's just
like a sauce, and then you- </joey>
<garnt> - You dip it in.
- You take out the soba, </garnt>
<garnt> you just dip it in,
whip some wasabi in it, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you just- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, cold soba is just
the tsukemen of hot soba. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<joey> - It is just the tsukemen, oh my god! </joey>
<joey> Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - And that further proves my point </joey>
<joey> that tsukemen is superior! </joey>
<garnt> - Figured it out. </garnt>
<connor> - I just wanna, and then
there's the final noodle </connor>
<garnt> which is udon, my least favorite. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do not like udon. </garnt>
<garnt> - I really like udon. </garnt>
<garnt> - It genuinely feels like you're </garnt>
<connor> in a tentacle hentai every
time you're eating that shit, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you gotta, dude, you
can have two in your mouth </connor>
<connor> and you're like (gags), trying
to force that shit down. </connor>
<connor> It's awful, you can't, it's so heavy, </connor>
<connor> it's like swallowing a brick, bro. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's not that bad. </connor>
<garnt> - It is.
- It feels like the vanilla </garnt>
<connor> of the noodle world where it just, </connor>
<garnt> it hit the same every time. </garnt>
<garnt> What can I say, man? </garnt>
<connor> - And also because ramen
is somewhat thin, right, </connor>
<garnt> the sauce that it takes
on to the ratio of noodle </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm eating is perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> Udon, it's this thick in my mind. </garnt>
<joey> That's how thick it feels. </joey>
<connor> It's like a coating of sauce. </connor>
<connor> I can't get into that. </connor>
<connor> - But here's the question though? </connor>
<connor> Do you guys like mochi? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I like mochi.
- Yeah, I like mochi. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm not talking about fucking </connor>
<connor> mochi ice-cream bullshit,
I'm talking about- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no,
- Yeah, like actual mochi. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, because it's like,
I feel a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> who don't like udon are the
same people who don't like mochi </garnt>
<garnt> for the exact reason. </garnt>
<garnt> Because when you eat a block of mochi, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like eating a brick, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's hard to get that shit down. </garnt>
<joey> Udon is just like the noodle equivalent. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I like that
because it's kinda like a sweet </garnt>
<joey> a lot of the times. </joey>
<garnt> I like mochi sweets, 'cause- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, so you've never
had savory mochi, then? </connor>
<connor> - I've had savory mochi. </connor>
<joey> - Okay.
- I probably wouldn't like it. </joey>
<joey> - It was very like... </joey>
<joey> Fucking like a brick, </joey>
<joey> but I was prepared for it to be a brick. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it's still dessert, right? </connor>
<connor> So, I was different, </connor>
<connor> but when we went to that
soba place a while ago, </connor>
<connor> oh, no, udon place, sorry; </connor>
<connor> it was like we had this broth </connor>
<connor> and the udon just didn't
stick any of the broth to it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what's the fucking point? </connor>
<joey> - Well, because it's
supposed to be a light taste. </joey>
<connor> It's supposed to be a
really thin, flavorful, </connor>
<joey> umami taste.
- Nah, dude, it aint it, </joey>
<joey> it aint it. </joey>
<connor> - I don't wanna say it's an acquired, </connor>
<joey> I didn't think udon was
gonna be an acquired taste. </joey>
<connor> - Do you think udon is
the worst of the three? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I feel like I like soba and udon equally. </garnt>
<garnt> But ramen, or rather tsukemen
is definitely above the two. </garnt>
<garnt> But I like udon. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna opt for
udon every single time, </garnt>
<garnt> but if I went to an udon place, </garnt>
<joey> I'm not gonna fucking complain. </joey>
<garnt> - If I had the choice, I would never go </garnt>
<garnt> to the udon place. </garnt>
<garnt> I would always be more in
the mood for soba or ramen. </garnt>
<garnt> There would never be point where, </garnt>
<garnt> udon's where I go to where
there's no other places around. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "I guess I'll settle for udon." </garnt>
<joey> - There are just some
winter days where I'm like </joey>
<joey> "Man, I could really go for a hot udon." </joey>
<connor> - I really just want
bricks in my stomach, dude. </connor>
<garnt> I just want warm bricks in my stomach </garnt>
<garnt> with the sauce not sticking to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then you drink the soup afterwards. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but sometimes it's too rich then, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? Like, come on. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, udon broths are never rich. </joey>
<garnt> It's always really watery.
- They're way too light, </garnt>
<joey> which is what I don't like about it. </joey>
<joey> It's a thick noodle with a light broth. </joey>
<joey> - I like my ramen and tsukemen </joey>
<garnt> that have a really thick flavor. </garnt>
<joey> It just completely sticks
to you no matter what, </joey>
<joey> but some days I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna feel like I'm getting </joey>
<garnt> all this sticky flavor on me. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes I just wanna get
something down that'll warm me up </garnt>
<joey> and is nice and light and will fill me up, </joey>
<joey> but won't make me feel like shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Because sometimes when you have, </garnt>
<garnt> as much as I love tsukemen,
it's like Five Guys, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, man, this
flavor is so powerful, </garnt>
<garnt> it sticks to me the entire time, </garnt>
<joey> but then the moment it starts to settle </joey>
<joey> in your stomach, you're
just like "Kill me!" </joey>
<connor> - Five Guys is that thing
where you're just like, </connor>
<joey> "I'm out for the count
for the rest of the day. </joey>
<joey> Don't talk to me, don't
expect me to do anything." </joey>
<connor> - I never thought food could knock you out </connor>
<joey> until I had Five Guys. </joey>
<connor> - The opposite of that I
feel is sushi and sashimi. </connor>
<garnt> I also had no fucking
clue what sashimi was </garnt>
<garnt> until I first came here. </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of people don't.
- Seriously? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, seriously. </garnt>
<joey> - A lot of people don't. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I didn't know
if there was a choice </joey>
<connor> where you could just get rid of the rice. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I guess it's like a
steak without the sides. </joey>
<joey> Like you could just have a steak, </joey>
<joey> and I thought, oh, I mean, yeah, I guess. </joey>
<joey> I will admit, I wanted to be that guy </joey>
<joey> who immediately loved sashimi
and sushi and was like, </joey>
<joey> "Dude, I fucking love this." </joey>
<joey> But it took me a while to get used to it </joey>
<connor> and really get into it and
appreciate the taste of it. </connor>
<connor> Because when I first
had sashimi, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, it doesn't taste good." </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It was definitely
something that grew on me, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I remember I went most
of my childhood hating sushi </garnt>
<connor> and hating sashimi 'cause I was like </connor>
<connor> "Raw fish? Why do I wanna eat raw stuff?" </connor>
<garnt> - And in the UK, they
do that shit dirty, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> Your sushi sucks dick. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - True.
- Fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - I had this one day where I just, </joey>
<connor> for some reason I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, that kinda looks appetizing. </connor>
<connor> Let me, let me give that shot." </connor>
<connor> And then after the first
time when I was an adult </connor>
<connor> and I tried sushi again I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I fucking love this shit." </connor>
<connor> I love the taste of raw
fish, tastes amazing. </connor>
<connor> And having sushi in
Japan is just the quality </connor>
<joey> of the fish is just so damn good </joey>
<joey> that even if you go to
one of those dollar places </joey>
<joey> where you can order a small
plate of sushi for a dollar, </joey>
<joey> that still tastes way better than some </joey>
<garnt> of the best restaurants
that you can find in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's true. </connor>
<connor> I mean, the quality of like, </connor>
<joey> because most of the fish that they serve, </joey>
<joey> we obviously don't have in the UK, </joey>
<joey> but even when you get
the salmon, you're like, </joey>
<connor> "Holy shit, I didn't know salmon </connor>
<connor> could just fall apart like
this when you bite into it." </connor>
<connor> Normally in the UK, you know,
you get something salmon, </connor>
<joey> you gotta fucking tug away. </joey>
<garnt> - You gotta Bear Grylls that shit. </garnt>
<connor> - I've had salmon where
I'm literally fucking, </connor>
<garnt> trying to sever it. </garnt>
<connor> But in Japan, you eat it
and it just falls apart, </connor>
<joey> and it works so good with the rice, </joey>
<joey> But man, if I ever have a workout, </joey>
<joey> sushi is what I'm always craving. </joey>
<joey> It's the best post-workout meal, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's like it's
just filling enough </joey>
<joey> where it's like I don't wanna go too hard, </joey>
<joey> but so healthy and so good for you, </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Man, I really,
I feel healthy doing this." </joey>
<joey> - But I remember you were once saying </joey>
<joey> that you can't have sushi for dinner. </joey>
<connor> Which is weird because
I'll take any excuse </connor>
<joey> to take sushi for dinner.
- Yeah, same here, same here. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, whenever these guys
when we're out, they're like, </connor>
<connor> "You guys wanna get sushi for dinner?" </connor>
<garnt> I'm like- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, it's always "What
do you guys wanna eat?" </garnt>
<garnt> And Connor's like, "I'm easy." </garnt>
<joey> And I go, "Do you feel like sushi?" </joey>
<garnt> - No sushi.
- No, no don't want sushi. </garnt>
<joey> - Then you're not easy.
(laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - You are not!
- That is not easy! </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a fucking lie! </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, okay, I'm easy. </connor>
<connor> If you wanna go to sushi, we'll go sushi. </connor>
<joey> I'm just gonna be like,
"It's not it, chief." </joey>
<joey> - Well, then we don't wanna
do that to you, right? </joey>
<joey> - For dinner, 'cause
for dinner I feel like, </joey>
<joey> okay, sushi is great, don't get me wrong. </joey>
<joey> But for lunch, I don't
mind having one flavor. </joey>
<joey> But for sushi I feel
like 'cause it all tastes </joey>
<joey> like fish still at the end of the day; </joey>
<joey> yes, the fish are different
and they taste different, </joey>
<joey> but it still feels I'm
just eating fish and rice </joey>
<connor> Which is fine, but for some
reason it's sushi to me, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't feel like a full meal. </connor>
<joey> - But you know you can get- </joey>
<joey> - Other stuff, I know. </joey>
<connor> But like, when you order fried
chicken at a sushi place, </connor>
<garnt> that shit is so fucking awful. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like the fucking chicken
has been abused and beaten up. </garnt>
<garnt> It's all muscular and shit, </garnt>
<garnt> like it's been in a fucking
fight club before it was killed. </garnt>
<joey> You maybe get one ounce of chicken breast </joey>
<joey> and the rest is this
black bone with veins. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Holy shit, what
did they do to this chicken?" </joey>
<joey> And then you're like, what's the point? </joey>
<joey> - It's like 'roided up chicken. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, and I'm
hitting up the miso soup </connor>
<connor> like no tomorrow and I'm stocking up on it </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's normally free. </connor>
<joey> Not that I care, I mean, it
just normally tastes amazing. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause sometimes they leave
some of the fish in there </joey>
<connor> and they let it cook and
it's so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> But I don't know, it doesn't
feel like a proper meal. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, 'cause
I fill up so fast on sushi </connor>
<connor> and then 30 minutes later
when I've left the restaurant, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Shit, I'm hungry again." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I get that with
sushi as well sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> where you feel like your
stomach's about to explode, </garnt>
<garnt> then somehow, an hour or two later, </garnt>
<joey> you don't get hungry. </joey>
<joey> You just like, you get, you get peckish. </joey>
<garnt> I can eat a little more,
I can eat a little more. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's just the rice that expands </joey>
<garnt> in your stomach.
- Probably, probably. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then once it finally settles down, </garnt>
<joey> you're just like, "Oh, all
right, time for more food." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. I never
understood why you can eat sushi </joey>
<joey> for lunch, and yet you can't eat </joey>
<connor> sushi for dinner.
- Breakfast, lunch. </connor>
<joey> I mean, normally- </joey>
<joey> - You can eat it for breakfast! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Normally my lunch or breakfast is sushi. </connor>
<joey> - See, I can't eat sushi for breakfast. </joey>
<connor> - Why not?
- I can't eat sushi </connor>
<joey> for breakfast. </joey>
<joey> - I can't eat fish for breakfast. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - It's just weird. </joey>
<garnt> - But why is it weird? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're Japanese, bro! </garnt>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing)
I know. </connor>
<joey> - Can we talk about
the Japanese breakfast? </joey>
<joey> Not just the Japanese breakfast, </joey>
<joey> very specifically, the- </joey>
<joey> - Ryokan breakfast. </joey>
<garnt> - Ryokan breakfast.
- But that is </garnt>
<joey> the traditional Japanese breakfast. </joey>
<joey> - That is the traditional
Japanese breakfast. </joey>
<joey> - My first time hearing
this was Chris Broad saying, </joey>
<connor> "Don't ever ask for the Japanese breakfast </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's shit." </connor>
<connor> And I thought, oh, he's just
being pessimistic Chris. </connor>
<connor> I was a fool, I should've
listened to you, Chris. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking garbage! </connor>
<connor> Okay, it's not. </connor>
<connor> No, I think the problem is </connor>
<connor> that it's the complete
opposite of garbage. </connor>
<connor> It's too much, it's too good. </connor>
<garnt> - It's, there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> you get about 50 different
dishes, I swear to god, </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Dude, it's breakfast. </garnt>
<garnt> Just give me a bowl of the cereal." </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a worthy contender
with an American breakfast. </joey>
<garnt> Where it's just like
that's just too much food. </garnt>
<connor> - It's actually even more
than the American breakfast. </connor>
<joey> - It's way more than
an American breakfast! </joey>
<joey> Yeah, because there's,
with an American breakfast, </joey>
<joey> you can fit everything on
one fucking plate, at least. </joey>
<joey> With Japanese breakfast, you have like- </joey>
<garnt> - It covers like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It covers this entire table. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And then as you're eating,
they bring out more dishes, </garnt>
<garnt> more small dishes in between the fish, </garnt>
<garnt> the tofu, the soup, the,
I can't even name it all. </garnt>
<connor> - There'll be like a
salad, there'll be a potato </connor>
<joey> that's been marinated in
a different fucking way, </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> There'll be two different types of salad, </joey>
<garnt> probably a plate of
just single tiny things </garnt>
<garnt> that you have no idea what the they are. </garnt>
<garnt> They're probably gonna be radish, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause everything seems to be radish. </garnt>
<connor> Like everything is a fucking
radish in these ryokans! </connor>
<garnt> - Every time I see a Japanese
breakfast in front of me, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Why am I
eating an art exhibition?" </garnt>
<garnt> That's just what it feels like. </garnt>
<garnt> It just like this looks really pretty. </garnt>
<connor> It looks really pretty, but man, </connor>
<connor> for one, I've never finished
a Japanese breakfast- </connor>
<connor> - And then rice as well,
they give you rice. </connor>
<connor> - Of course, yeah, they give you rice. </connor>
<connor> This is like a five course meal </connor>
<garnt> that I'm having just as I've woken up, </garnt>
<garnt> and I've never, ever
finished Japanese breakfast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I don't mind the fish, the cooked mackerel </connor>
<connor> that they normally bring
you, I don't mind that. </connor>
<connor> Mackerel doesn't really
taste like anything. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know about that one. </garnt>
<connor> - I disagree about that. </connor>
<garnt> Mackerel has probably the most taste- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's my favorite fish, mackerel, </garnt>
<connor> but it's just so clean. </connor>
<garnt> You never get any like, </garnt>
<joey> there's no aftertaste to mackerel, </joey>
<joey> it's just a pure, it's like the chicken. </joey>
<joey> - No, I get an after taste with mackerel. </joey>
<joey> - Mackerel is the chicken of fish. </joey>
<garnt> - No, that's salmon. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's salmon.
- Salmon! </garnt>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<joey> - Salmon is the chicken of fish! </joey>
<joey> - Salmon's the pork, salmon's the pork. </joey>
<connor> - You can do so much with salmon, </connor>
<connor> and people do do so.
- And that's why </connor>
<connor> it's the pork! </connor>
<joey> - No, that's the chicken! </joey>
<garnt> That's the chicken. </garnt>
<joey> - Mackerel's just salmon with attitude. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I'm just recalling
all the food items </connor>
<connor> they might make you. </connor>
<connor> They'd probably give you eggs, </connor>
<connor> but then you'd probably want fried egg, </connor>
<joey> scrambled eggs, maybe a poached egg. </joey>
<joey> They give you some fucking egg roll </joey>
<joey> that's been rolled up and
steamed, and I'm like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, tamagoyaki? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's fucking cold. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "Why is it cold?! </connor>
<garnt> Give me a hot egg, please!" </garnt>
<garnt> - Most of the dishes are actually cold. </garnt>
<connor> - They're all cold, and I don't
know if it's a Western thing </connor>
<connor> but I want something hot to wake me up, </connor>
<connor> and the worst part is you're
eating this and you're like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, it's filling and
something's missing. </connor>
<connor> Can I have coffee, perhaps? </connor>
<connor> Do they have an espresso
machine back there, please? </connor>
<connor> I bring my own pods, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> Just give me a fucking coffee, please! </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's what the green tea's for, </joey>
<joey> it's the hot green tea. </joey>
<connor> That's the hot, that's the
only heat you're gonna get </connor>
<connor> out of a Japanese breakfast, </connor>
<joey> Or the miso soup. </joey>
<joey> - I would kill for a coffee, man, </joey>
<joey> and even when we're here
with Japanese friends, </joey>
<connor> sometimes they're like,
"Man, I just want a coffee." </connor>
<garnt> - Japanese breakfasts are way
too extra for my own liking. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But, I mean, I guess that's why </garnt>
<connor> it's a very infrequent occurrence. </connor>
<connor> It's that special thing that you get </connor>
<joey> - It's for the ryokans.
- At a ryokan. </joey>
<joey> - If you go to a hotel, </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be the shitty
continental breakfast </joey>
<connor> that you reluctantly eat </connor>
<connor> 'cause you don't have
really got much choice. </connor>
<connor> Oh my god, those are depressing. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno, I like that
for the first two days. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause, I don't know, it's
just a recognizable meal </connor>
<connor> and you have it for
two days and afterwards </connor>
<joey> you're just like, "Okay, this
is getting really boring now </joey>
<joey> and I want something different." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's like one Japanese dish that, </joey>
<joey> I don't really not recommend it </joey>
<joey> but I don't really recommend it either, </joey>
<joey> is when people come here
and they try the curry. </joey>
<joey> Because I don't know about you, </joey>
<joey> but no matter where I've had curry </joey>
<joey> whether it's home cooked,
abroad, whatever chain, </joey>
<joey> it all tastes as good as each other. </joey>
<joey> Like, I've never had a bad curry, </joey>
<joey> but I've never had a curry
that just blows me away. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I can agree with that. </garnt>
<connor> - Every single time I
have a curry I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "This would be great if
it was an Indian curry." </connor>
<connor> An Indian curry could do this better </connor>
<connor> and it would taste better. </connor>
<garnt> It's just, it's too one noted, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And they put curry </garnt>
<garnt> in so much fucking things here. </garnt>
<garnt> There's so many side dishes, </garnt>
<garnt> like the one place we had ramen </garnt>
<connor> and the side dish was
just curry with rice. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah!
- It's like why? </joey>
<connor> Why is this a side? </connor>
<connor> - Because curry goes with everything. </connor>
<garnt> That's their logic, they're like, </garnt>
<connor> "curry goes with everything!" </connor>
<connor> Everyone likes curry. </connor>
<connor> You'll be happy to eat it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, are you talking
shit about CoCo Ichiban? </connor>
<garnt> I do like CoCo Ichiban, because
I know what I'm gonna get. </garnt>
<connor> It's like such a sterilized process. </connor>
<garnt> - It is, you get the
same thing every time, </garnt>
<garnt> and it really is no different </garnt>
<joey> whether you have CoCo
Ichiban abroad or here. </joey>
<connor> - I've never had it
abroad, so I can't comment. </connor>
<joey> - I had it in America, I've had it in- </joey>
<connor> - Is it the exact same? </connor>
<connor> - It's the exact same. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, it's one of the only
places where I can get spice </connor>
<connor> that actually makes me feel alive, bro. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, except you
choose the level of spice </joey>
<joey> that is YouTuber material. </joey>
<garnt> - I dunno if this is the same abroad, </garnt>
<garnt> but in CoCo Ichiban here, </garnt>
<garnt> you can choose the spice
level of the curry, </garnt>
<connor> and 10, as a certified Thai
man who loves Thai food </connor>
<connor> and spicy food, it is
fucking insanely spicy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's a lot. </garnt>
<joey> - Except you willingly are like, </joey>
<joey> "Yes, I will have the 10",
and every time we've gone </joey>
<connor> to CoCo Ichiban together and you say, yes, </connor>
<connor> I'll have a level 10- </connor>
<connor> - Do you? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they're like blinking me. </connor>
<garnt> Are you, sure, 10? </garnt>
<garnt> That's the spiciest. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But one thing I don't
like about the spice level </garnt>
<connor> in CoCo Ichiban is it
feels like fake spice. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, like there, </connor>
<connor> - It tastes real. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, when I was having it- </garnt>
<connor> - I'm crying there, so I mean, </connor>
<connor> are those fake tears, Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - What I mean by fake spice
is that it just feels like- </garnt>
<connor> - It's added, it's artificial,
- It's just artificial spice, </connor>
<connor> it's not truly a dish that
was meant to be spicy. </connor>
<garnt> Like, you have an Indian curry </garnt>
<garnt> or you have a Thai dish
and you remove the spice, </garnt>
<garnt> you feel like it's missing something. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, I think that in a
normal CoCo Ichiban spice, </connor>
<joey> it's mainly a throat thing. </joey>
<joey> But in a normal curry, it's
a whole mouth meltdown. </joey>
<connor> Those chilies get all over. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, CoCo Ichiban </joey>
<joey> it's just like my throat is on fire. </joey>
<garnt> I love pain when I'm eating. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love pain when I'm
eating things as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - People are like, "Oh,
it ruins the flavor!" </garnt>
<garnt> No, you don't understand. </garnt>
<garnt> When you're like, in severe pain, </garnt>
<garnt> - It's euphoric, it's euphoric, it is. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my god. </garnt>
<connor> - The pain makes the flavor
so much more prominent. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a different
kind of pervert, isn't this? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it is! </connor>
<joey> - I love the pain, so
I don't understand it. </joey>
<garnt> - I know it's not an
attractive thing to be around, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not something you do
on a date or something. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm there and I'm
like fucking (sniffles). </garnt>
<connor> So tasteful. </connor>
<joey> - I remember the very first
time I felt euphoric from spice, </joey>
<joey> and it's on camera. </joey>
<joey> If you watch my Domestic Girlfriend video </joey>
<joey> where I eat a ghost pepper, </joey>
<joey> there's there's a point in there </joey>
<garnt> where I'm explaining it,
I'm trying to be a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> explaining it in a funny way, </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's a point
where I'm just lying there </garnt>
<garnt> for a good few seconds,
and I'm just like (gasps). </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And at that point, my brain
was just rushed with endorphins </garnt>
<garnt> and I was literally high at that point </garnt>
<garnt> that literally, I couldn't think. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it was painful, but it
was a good kind of painful. </garnt>
<joey> It's so difficult to explain. </joey>
<joey> - It was like downing a
pint of cocaine, right? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, that's exactly what it was like! </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, it's so, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> is it euphoric.
- I don't understand it. </connor>
<joey> I don't understand it at all. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you freak out when you, </connor>
<connor> 'cause Joey will try, he'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay I'll try it, I'll try it." </connor>
<connor> He'll put an inch on
his spoon, he'll try it </connor>
<connor> and he's like (coughing). </connor>
<joey> - I just don't like, like, </joey>
<connor> - When you stop freaking out </connor>
<joey> and just accept it, it's so nice. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, but to be fair
I used to not be able </connor>
<connor> to handle spice at all. </connor>
<connor> So if we're talking Coco
Ichiban levels of curry, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel that's the
easiest way to quantify it, </connor>
<joey> I would always used to just
pick zero, like no spice. </joey>
<joey> - Lemon and herb Nando's sauce. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> The real- </garnt>
<connor> - What dressing would you like? Water? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, water, please. </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, I used to be
just zero spice at all, </garnt>
<connor> but then the more I would try to, </connor>
<connor> the more, because I will always be </connor>
<connor> that one guy who'd be like,
"Oh yeah, I'll try this thing </connor>
<connor> that I'm probably gonna hate" </connor>
<connor> and spicy stuff was always one of them. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah, I know I'm
probably gonna die from this, </connor>
<joey> but I'll just eat it because why not? </joey>
<joey> And spicy stuff, I
think that's how I built </joey>
<joey> my spice tolerance now, so now I can do </joey>
<joey> a level two Coco Ichi and be like- </joey>
<joey> - Real man shit now! </joey>
<joey> - And be like, "All right,
I can still eat this </joey>
<joey> and enjoy it." </joey>
<garnt> But I've once tried a level
three, I was like, no, </garnt>
<garnt> this is to the point where the spiciness </garnt>
<garnt> and the pain just completely
negates all flavors for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause for me, moving to
Japan, the one thing I miss </garnt>
<connor> the most is spicy food.
- Spice, spice man, </connor>
<connor> - Because you get a CoCo Ichiban 10 </connor>
<garnt> because you can't get any
other spicy food anywhere, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause wasabi? </connor>
<connor> - They have hot on the
menu and it's never hot. </connor>
<joey> - It's never hot.
- It's hot for me. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, go on wasabi, I have
a whole rant about wasabi. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, wasabi is the closest
thing you get to spice, </garnt>
<joey> but it's a totally different feeling. </joey>
<joey> - It's in the nose.
- 'Cause it's the spice </joey>
<connor> in the nose, and I really
like that feeling, I do, </connor>
<connor> but it's just not the same
as the burning sensation, </connor>
<connor> the burning, tingling sensation </connor>
<connor> around your mouth.
- Yeah, whereas normal spice </connor>
<connor> is pleasant, I feel like
eating too much wasabi is like </connor>
<connor> you're in a fucking trench in World War II </connor>
<connor> and the chlorine gas has just landed. </connor>
<connor> Do you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> You do feel like you're being gassed. </connor>
<connor> It's not spicy or like, "Ooh, it tingles." </connor>
<connor> It's like (coughs) </connor>
<joey> (screams) </joey>
<joey> - See, it's so weird because I can't do </joey>
<joey> a level three CoCo
Ichi, but I love wasabi. </joey>
<connor> - I think people saying
wasabi is spicy is wrong. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it is suffocating. </connor>
<joey> - It's not spicy, it's just, </joey>
<connor> painful.
- It's disgusting. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, it's p- (laughing) </joey>
<joey> A tiny bit, a tiny bit
mixed in with the soy sauce, </joey>
<joey> okay. We're good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But the moment you put
a little bit too much </joey>
<connor> on your sushi- </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, I love just dumping
a whole load of wasabi </connor>
<joey> into my soy sauce. </joey>
<garnt> - I've stopped putting
wasabi in the soy sauce, </garnt>
<connor> and now sometimes, if I'm having a mid </connor>
<connor> sushi,
- Right up the nose. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like ball of wasabi
on the sushi, let's fucking go. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking animals. </garnt>
<garnt> - I take that directly now. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need it diluted by soy sauce. </garnt>
<connor> - Next "Trash Taste" in the
veins, directly in the veins. </connor>
<garnt> Brings his the needle to the restaurant </garnt>
<connor> and heats up the spoon. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like downing a pint of cocaine. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's go. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You know how I became to like spice? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause obviously if you haven't
noticed guys, I'm white. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I can see that. </joey>
<joey> - It might not be a
surprise to some of you. </joey>
<joey> I'm very white and my mum
cannot handle any spice at all. </joey>
<joey> My mum will have like, something </joey>
<joey> that has actually zero spice in it </joey>
<joey> and she'll be at the dinner table like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's kind of spicy, isn't it?" </joey>
<joey> Mum, it's paprika. </joey>
<joey> It's paprika, mum! </joey>
<joey> It's not spicy, </joey>
<joey> It's paprika, for fuck's
sake, it's a spice! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this water's a little spicy. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - So naturally, I was never
raised with spicy food ever. </connor>
<connor> And what ended up happening was is that </connor>
<connor> I started doing those
fucking YouTuber challenges. </connor>
<connor> I would start with a ghost pepper </connor>
<connor> 'cause I saw Rhett and
Link do it when I was 15. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "I want a
ghost pepper, that sounds fun." </connor>
<connor> So we started doing it in school. </connor>
<joey> We'd all do it. </joey>
<joey> - You ate a ghost pepper at school? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh wow. </joey>
<joey> - You could buy it at the
Tesco's and bring it in, </joey>
<joey> so we used to buy them
and just (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> I guess torture each other. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> And so I got into it, </garnt>
<garnt> and then when I started doing live streams </garnt>
<garnt> I kept making donation goals, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll eat a Carolina Reaper, which is, </garnt>
<connor> is it still the world's hottest one? </connor>
<connor> - Probably isn't,
- Probably someone's made </connor>
<connor> some giga chad pepper.
- Yeah, this is </connor>
<joey> spiciest one now. </joey>
<connor> - Some abomination that's just pure gas. </connor>
<connor> But I must've done it
seven or eight times, </connor>
<joey> and by the end of doing it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause every single 24 hour stream, </joey>
<joey> I would at least do it twice. </joey>
<joey> And so I started just being like, okay, </joey>
<joey> it's actually kinda fun now. </joey>
<joey> I would actually look forward to doing it. </joey>
<joey> And so then I noticed after doing that </joey>
<garnt> where it was just pure pain, </garnt>
<garnt> when I went back to eating
normal curry, I was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't go back.
- There's no spice, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no spice. </garnt>
<garnt> Once you hit that </garnt>
<connor> spice level
- it's 'cause you're </connor>
<connor> desensitizing yourself to it, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - This is how people get into dominatrix. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> (speakers talking over one another) </connor>
<joey> - It hurts at first, </joey>
<joey> but it's kinda starting to feel good now. </joey>
<connor> - It's literally like drugs. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It is drugs! </garnt>
<joey> - It is a drug, spice is a drug! </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I remember when I
first started dating Sidney, </joey>
<joey> she could not handle spice at all, </joey>
<garnt> And I remember what got
her to start liking spice </garnt>
<joey> was basically when I
introduced her to my parents </joey>
<joey> and every time we'd have a family meal, </joey>
<garnt> mum would be like, "Oh, I didn't
make it so spicy for you." </garnt>
<garnt> But in Thai, what less spice means </garnt>
<garnt> is just they take one chili </garnt>
<garnt> out of the fucking the 50
they put in this curry. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what less spicy means. </garnt>
<garnt> You've had the exact same experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was when we stayed
over at Garnt's place, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause Aki can't take spice at all. </joey>
<joey> And she was like, "Oh no, I'm gonna die." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause your mom was making
Thai noodles or something, </joey>
<garnt> which is usually hella spicy, </garnt>
<garnt> I had to make a really weird
request to your mom to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can you just take all the spice out?" </garnt>
<garnt> And she-
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> the way your mum looked at me, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like I was
speaking another language. </garnt>
<joey> She was like, "What? No,
that doesn't make any sense." </joey>
<garnt> - Like, can you take all the spice out? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, okay, so you want one less chili? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no.
- No, all, all chili's gone. </joey>
<garnt> - It just does not compute. </garnt>
<garnt> And she's like "This is the first time </garnt>
<garnt> I'm ever doing this for anybody." </garnt>
<joey> I felt like I offended the
Thai people by saying that. </joey>
<joey> - She was just confused,
'cause she was like, </joey>
<garnt> "What do you mean no spice?" </garnt>
<garnt> Less spice? More less spice? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what does no spice mean? </garnt>
<garnt> That does not make sense to me. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, because Sydney would always </garnt>
<garnt> have to eat this Thai food, </garnt>
<garnt> at first she was crying every meal. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, as the more she ate,
the more she got used to it, </garnt>
<garnt> and then now she can handle spice better </garnt>
<garnt> than a lot of Thai people. </garnt>
<garnt> We have this dish called
in Thailand called pakimao, </garnt>
<garnt> which translates to drunken noodle. </garnt>
<garnt> And the reason it's called drunken noodle </garnt>
<garnt> is that you have to be truly pissed </garnt>
<garnt> to be able to handle the
spice, how much spice this has. </garnt>
<garnt> And she eats that on the daily, man. </garnt>
<joey> - See, because I'm sure that if I was put </joey>
<garnt> in the same position as you or Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> I would probably get used to it too. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't want to! </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna enjoy my meals.
- It's good, man, it's good! </garnt>
<garnt> Get some spice in your
life, it makes the meal, </garnt>
<garnt> it gives this extra kick to the meal </garnt>
<garnt> that you just can't get. </garnt>
<joey> - But that's the problem, </joey>
<garnt> is that because I grew
up eating Japanese food, </garnt>
<garnt> there isn't any Japanese dishes
that have spice like that. </garnt>
<joey> Because wasabi is, as we've established, </joey>
<joey> a completely different type of spice, </joey>
<joey> and we don't really use chilies
in a lot of Japanese food. </joey>
<connor> So there isn't, I
guarantee there's probably </connor>
<connor> a lot of Japanese people who can just </connor>
<connor> not handle spice whatsoever. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, I definitely feel that as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Should we open the wine? </connor>
<garnt> - Before we move on guys, </garnt>
<garnt> we've had this bottle of
wine just sitting down </garnt>
<garnt> that we were going to open this podcast, </garnt>
<garnt> because we've hit a new
milestone, of course. </garnt>
<joey> - We've hit three milestones, technically. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, three milestones at
almost the same time, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So we reached 100-
- Wait, what? </joey>
<garnt> - (laughing) wait, what? </garnt>
<connor> - What are the three milestones? </connor>
<connor> - Well, let me tell you, first of all, </connor>
<connor> we hit half a million subs- </connor>
<connor> - At the time of recording
- at the time of recording, </connor>
<connor> it's probably more by this time. </connor>
<connor> So that's one of them. </connor>
<connor> We hit a 100,000 followers on Twitter, </connor>
<garnt> and we hit 50,000
followers on the subreddit. </garnt>
<garnt> All on the like, it's all on the same day. </garnt>
<garnt> - All on the same, within
a few days of each other. </garnt>
<joey> - Yay!
- Thank you, guys. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you for fucking supporting us </joey>
<joey> and watching what we do. </joey>
<connor> - And now we have a Drops of God wine. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, this is a Drops of God wine. </connor>
<connor> I don't know which Drops
of God Wine this is. </connor>
<garnt> - Ah, that's fucking good. </garnt>
<connor> - So I'm just gonna pour that. </connor>
<garnt> - He swooshed it around. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I know.
- Can you believe that, man? </connor>
<connor> The gall of this man. </connor>
<connor> - There we go. </connor>
<connor> - I would to talk about
Japanese bread for a moment. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Japanese bread! Okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we've already talked about it. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, I would
like to add something. </connor>
<joey> I would like to add something
to my Japanese bread rant </joey>
<garnt> from the previous time. </garnt>
<garnt> So, Japanese bread doesn't
serve the same purpose here </garnt>
<connor> as it does in European countries. </connor>
<connor> That's a problem. </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding, no. </connor>
<connor> - No, you're not kidding. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Bread is a staple in European countries. </joey>
<joey> It's something I need, I
need it, I just need it. </joey>
<joey> - (laughing) I knead. </joey>
<connor> - And in Japan, it's like
a fucking dessert project. </connor>
<connor> It's like a fourth grader's
like, ooh, let's spice it up. </connor>
<joey> Let's put custard in the bread, </joey>
<joey> let's do all this weird shit. </joey>
<joey> Let's put hotdogs in the croissant. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, "What? Stop." </joey>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair though,
they're all pretty bomb. </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't want custard, dude. </joey>
<joey> And then like I, okay,
so, I like this bread. </joey>
<joey> Don't get me wrong, I like this bread, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like something's gone wrong. </joey>
<joey> So next to our house, there's this bakery </joey>
<joey> and they sell this really
fucking good bread. </joey>
<joey> It's amazing, it's bread that is so good </joey>
<joey> that you can just eat
it with nothing on it. </joey>
<garnt> And I put stuff on it, like
I put tuna and toasted it </garnt>
<garnt> and it made the bread taste worse. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like,
- Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're in the way of the bread. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the bread's time to shine. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I ate this whole loaf of bread. </garnt>
<garnt> Problem was the loaf costed a thousand yen </garnt>
<garnt> which is like $10. </garnt>
<garnt> $10 for a loaf of bread?! </garnt>
<garnt> Holy shit, dude! </garnt>
<garnt> This better be diamond
encrusted, Jesus Christ! </garnt>
<garnt> - If it's the main star
of whatever you're eating, </garnt>
<connor> I can see why it cost $10. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, I've never been, </connor>
<garnt> personally, you know, I've
never been blown away by breads. </garnt>
<connor> - You ever been to Germany, bro? </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, there you go that's why. </garnt>
<garnt> German people, man, say what you will, </garnt>
<connor> they've got bread figured out. </connor>
<connor> All the Germans watching this
are like, "Hell yeah, we do." </connor>
<connor> You go to Germany, you get
anything in their bakeries, </connor>
<connor> it's fresh as fuck and it's amazing. </connor>
<connor> It's so good! </connor>
<joey> - Well then it just makes
me want to go to Germany. </joey>
<connor> - So I'm gonna move to Germany
when I'm done with Japan. </connor>
<joey> Hi Germany, please welcome me. </joey>
<joey> - Just to eat the bread? </joey>
<joey> - Pretzels alone, holy shit,
their pretzels are good. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, German food's fucking- </connor>
<joey> - Holy fuck!
- It's so good. </joey>
<joey> - I feel pretzels and uh, bread, for me, </joey>
<garnt> always need to be, they
are like the side dish </garnt>
<garnt> to whatever the main
thing is between them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, he said it! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I need to have something with my bread. </garnt>
<connor> - You haven't had a good pretzel, man. </connor>
<joey> A good pretzel will change your life. </joey>
<joey> - A good, fat, hot German
pretzel with mustard... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, mustard's good. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, you don't like mustard </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - You can put cheese on
it if you want, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's exactly it, I need cheese on it. </garnt>
<connor> - I was about to finish
my sentence, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Let me finish! </connor>
<connor> A pretzel on its own,
just salted lightly, man, </connor>
<connor> with little salt chunks in there. </connor>
<connor> Man, you get a nice, ooh, you
get a nice bite of that salt, </connor>
<joey> it goes perfect with your beer, man. </joey>
<joey> And even in the morning, it's great. </joey>
<joey> It's it's light, you can
have half the pretzel. </joey>
<joey> Leave it, it's gonna be great later. </joey>
<joey> It's just, pretzels, </joey>
<joey> amazing.
- We're not talking about </joey>
<connor> the tiny fucking principles. </connor>
<connor> - The big boy ones.
- We're talking about </connor>
<joey> the big German pretzels. </joey>
<connor> - Tiny pretzels fucking suck. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they do. </joey>
<connor> - They suck, dude. </connor>
<joey> - It's airplanes food. </joey>
<connor> - It's a shitty cookie, is what it is. </connor>
<connor> - It all hits the same. </connor>
<connor> - No it doesn't. </connor>
<garnt> I've seen a lot on YouTube, at least. </garnt>
<garnt> Bread is a huge, it's
becoming a huge culture here </garnt>
<connor> of like, experimenting
with it and pushing it </connor>
<garnt> to make it more dessert-like </garnt>
<garnt> and what you can do with it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've noticed there
are a ton of bakeries </garnt>
<garnt> that none of them do normal bread. </garnt>
<connor> It's just like what weird fucking thing </connor>
<connor> can we do with bread? </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, no, I put
life on the edge, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> I'm not gonna do that, </garnt>
<garnt> I think someone said that on
one of the episodes as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, every time I see it-
- Now I've noticed it, </connor>
<garnt> I can't not notice it, I'm just like- </garnt>
<connor> - Fine, I'll put it down. </connor>
<connor> I spilt some, are you happy, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> I spilled some when I moved it. </connor>
<joey> - For fuck's sake, near the TV as well? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<garnt> - That's by your feet. </garnt>
<connor> Why would you put it by your feet? </connor>
<garnt> I can't, I can't. </garnt>
<joey> - One thing though that I will say </joey>
<joey> that I think a lot of people
are gonna find controversial </joey>
<joey> is that the Asian bakeries in America, </joey>
<joey> usually the ones that are
owned by Koreans or Japanese, </joey>
<joey> I feel that the bread
there is way too sweet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's so sweet! </connor>
<joey> - Way too sweet, but they
don't really do that here. </joey>
<connor> - It's like everything is a brioche. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Every normal bread you get
tastes halfway to a brioche. </connor>
<connor> It shouldn't, it tastes too sweet. </connor>
<joey> - It's way too sugary, I don't
even taste the bread anymore. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and I've had a
lot of Japanese people say </connor>
<connor> "Do you think that Japanese
food is too sweet?" </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "Yes, it is too sweet. </joey>
<joey> We have too much sugar in this shit." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I would agree with that. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you eat a melonpan, </joey>
<joey> don't get me wrong, shit's amazing. </joey>
<joey> If you look on the back, you
have a fucking heart attack </joey>
<joey> when you see the sugar. </joey>
<garnt> It's 80 grams of sugar in that melonpan. </garnt>
<connor> And that's like what?
Like two Cokes and a half? </connor>
<joey> Holy shit! </joey>
<joey> What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - But I would rather eat a melonpan </joey>
<connor> than two Cokes and a half. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's like they make this bread </connor>
<connor> and don't get me wrong, </connor>
<connor> it's as amazing as it looks
in the anime, it totally is. </connor>
<connor> In the first week here I
used to eat it non-stop. </connor>
<connor> Because I was like
- Of course you did. </connor>
<connor> - I'm never gonna get fat, </connor>
<connor> and then I had a scare when I looked </connor>
<connor> at the back and I'm like,
"That's sugar, isn't it?" </connor>
<connor> Don't tell me that's sugar. </connor>
<connor> Google translate, </connor>
<connor> oh, shit, it's sugar, fuck! </connor>
<garnt> - The fuck you expecting? </garnt>
<garnt> - Who knew that a sweet
thing would have sugar in it? </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't think when it said 82- </connor>
<garnt> - Surprised Pikachu face. </garnt>
<garnt> - 82 grams? Maybe it was protein. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, maybe it was protein. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) Maybe it was protein. </connor>
<connor> Maybe the bread was very heavy in proteins </connor>
<joey> - All these Japanese
waifus are getting swole, </joey>
<connor> by the melonpan. </connor>
<garnt> - And then I start thinking to myself, </garnt>
<garnt> I had this bread and I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> "The bread tastes awfully sweet", </garnt>
<joey> and I did think it's kinda weird </joey>
<connor> that the topping is just sugar. </connor>
<connor> Huh? </connor>
<joey> - Who would've fucking thought, hey? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's awfully weird </garnt>
<garnt> - Talking about taking the
bread away from things, </garnt>
<joey> Let's talk about Japanese
hamburgers or hambagus </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's right. </joey>
<joey> It's not a hamburger, it's a hambagu. </joey>
<joey> - An abomination to burgers. </joey>
<connor> - I fucking love them! </connor>
<connor> - I can't fucking stand </connor>
<connor> when you order that shit.
- So to explain Japanese </connor>
<garnt> hambagus is literally just
a hamburger or a burger </garnt>
<garnt> - Patty.
- patty without the bun. </garnt>
<garnt> - What?! What?! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Because it's good, I love it! </joey>
<connor> - The best part of a hamburger, </connor>
<joey> and I'm gonna go on one
of those rants again, man. </joey>
<joey> It's like the pizza thing, dude, </joey>
<joey> It's the synergy
- Synergy. </joey>
<joey> - It's the synergy, bro. </joey>
<joey> There is a way to a burger, man. </joey>
<connor> It's all the accumulation of
the tastes that come together </connor>
<connor> and they strike slightly moderately. </connor>
<garnt> - Because for 90% of burgers, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't give a shit about the synergy, </garnt>
<garnt> You're there for the fucking patty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Uncultured, uncultured.
- You have a brioche bun </garnt>
<connor> with lettuce, tomatoes, and some bacon. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking amazing, but
you get a McDonald's burger, </connor>
<garnt> Who gives a shit, man? </garnt>
<connor> - The McDonald's burger has been </connor>
<connor> more engineered than any
burger in the world, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> That thing has been scientifically proven </garnt>
<joey> to be the perfect-
- And it's been optimized </joey>
<garnt> as well.
- That is why you will </garnt>
<garnt> never say no to a double
cheeseburger at McDonald's, </garnt>
<connor> I guarantee it. </connor>
<connor> - I do because it's got ketchup on it. </connor>
<garnt> - Without ketchup. </garnt>
<garnt> - Regardless of the point,
it's a fucking dry-ass patty. </garnt>
<connor> I don't give a shit about that, </connor>
<connor> it is literal junk! </connor>
<garnt> - No, I love my gourmet burgers, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> I love every kind of burger. </garnt>
<connor> The McDonald's burger has its place. </connor>
<garnt> - That's why, no matter
what hamburger you get, </garnt>
<garnt> you get a gourmet patty
or what what would be </garnt>
<garnt> a gourmet patty on a gourmet burger. </garnt>
<connor> - You always order the
shitty patties though, </connor>
<connor> in these places. </connor>
<joey> You order like the, the shitty hamburger </joey>
<connor> that was made in a factory
probably 10 miles away. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's still 10 times
better than anything you order </garnt>
<garnt> from fucking McDonald's
or even Burger King, </garnt>
<garnt> or most burger joints. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna have to
agree with Garnt on that. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- what? </joey>
<joey> Don't get me wrong, sometimes I'll wake up </joey>
<garnt> - You're clowns,
- and just be like </garnt>
<connor> - You're fucking clowns. </connor>
<connor> I'll never say no to a double cheeseburger </connor>
<joey> or a whopper right on some days. </joey>
<connor> - A Whopper burger here is great. </connor>
<joey> I'll take it over any </joey>
<joey> of those shitty burgers.
- Sometimes you're just like, </joey>
<garnt> "I just wanna eat some shit today." </garnt>
<garnt> But then other times you're like, </garnt>
<joey> "I really just want meat." </joey>
<joey> I just want a hamburger,
I just want the patty. </joey>
<joey> - It's just the patty. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck the synergy, I just want the patty. </joey>
<connor> - In my eyes, if you're going
to just order a hamburger </connor>
<connor> just with veg and maybe fries,
just get a fucking steak. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - It's totally different from steak. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's hitting me. </garnt>
<connor> - I will never eat a fucking
steak over a hamburger, never. </connor>
<garnt> - What?! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I just don't like steak! </joey>
<connor> - I will take the inferior, worst-tasting </connor>
<joey> piece of the cow.
- I don't like steak! </joey>
<connor> - Oh my god, bro. </connor>
<joey> - I think steak is fucking mid. </joey>
<connor> - No man, okay. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, okay, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - I think steak is like eating cardboard. </garnt>
<connor> It's just a fucking piece of meat. </connor>
<connor> - To me, eating a hambagu, right- </connor>
<connor> - What is going on?! </connor>
<garnt> What are these takes right now?! </garnt>
<connor> - I'll let him freak out. </connor>
<connor> Eating a hambagu, it's like a kid's meal. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't look right, it looks like- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt And Joey] What
are you talking about?! </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's like, "Oh,
little Garnt can't handle </connor>
<connor> the tomatoes and the bread? </connor>
<joey> Oh, we'll just take the
burger out for you." </joey>
<garnt> - It's just a different way
to enjoy a part of the meal. </garnt>
<garnt> - When you get the veg in a bag </garnt>
<garnt> with your little milk and your juice. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a different way to have it. </garnt>
<connor> - You talked about pizza,
it's like, oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> I can only eat cheese when it's on pizza. </connor>
<connor> - Who said that? </connor>
<connor> - Huh?
- Who said that? </connor>
<connor> - No, that's, that's
- There's probably someone, </connor>
<garnt> - By the same logic, you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I can't have mozzarella by itself." </garnt>
<garnt> - Why would you have mozzarella by itself? </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause it's fucking great! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it tastes good. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - It's great with a salad. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> That's not by itself, Garnt! </garnt>
<connor> By itself means on its own! </connor>
<garnt> - A hambagu is not- </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you know what by itself means?! </garnt>
<garnt> - A hambagu is not a patty by itself. </garnt>
<garnt> You got like, potatoes,
you got vegetables. </garnt>
<garnt> - You got eggs, you got sauce,
- You can put some cheese, </garnt>
<joey> You put it on a fucking curry, </joey>
<garnt> you can put it on so many things </garnt>
<garnt> that just is not bread
and lettuce and tomatoes! </garnt>
<connor> - When you have a steak
and it comes with fries, </connor>
<connor> is the steak by itself? </connor>
<connor> - What? Say that again? </connor>
<joey> - If you order a steak
and it comes with fries, </joey>
<joey> is it by itself? </joey>
<joey> - No, it's with the fries, </joey>
<joey> but I don't give a shit about the steak. </joey>
<connor> - You, but what you're saying is </connor>
<connor> is that because it's taken out, </connor>
<garnt> it's not by itself or something? </garnt>
<connor> - The patty's not by itself
- Whoa, Whoa, what I'm, </connor>
<connor> - What I'm trying to say is </connor>
<garnt> you don't have to have steak with fries, </garnt>
<garnt> you can have steak with
a lot of other things! </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - If the patty is just a singular thing </connor>
<connor> and there's veg next to
it, the patty's by itself. </connor>
<connor> That's just a fact, bro. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) What? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you talking about? </garnt>
<connor> - Because, right, that is not
part of, a burger, it's a meal </connor>
<connor> all put in one.
- The patty is a </connor>
<garnt> fucking ingredient to a bigger whole, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can take the ingredients </garnt>
<garnt> and you can do other things
with the ingredients. </garnt>
<connor> - If you have all the
ingredients of a soup, </connor>
<connor> next to each other, it's
not a fucking, it's not, </connor>
<connor> You can't just be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's not by itself, it's
a soup. What do you mean?" </connor>
<connor> You're chatting out of your ass, bro. </connor>
<connor> It's a burger on its own, just left there! </connor>
<connor> It's depressing! </connor>
<connor> Put some fucking lettuce and tomatoes </connor>
<connor> and bread on that shit, man! </connor>
<garnt> - But it's on the side. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's on the side! </garnt>
<garnt> You can have other stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> You can eat a burger in more than one way. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can eat the hambagu, you take a bite </garnt>
<garnt> of that shit.
- You uncultured fuck! </garnt>
<joey> - You can eat the burger on the side. </joey>
<connor> - Why don't you just go
to fucking McDonald's, </connor>
<connor> order a burger and just pry it apart, </connor>
<connor> take the hamburger out and eat it? </connor>
<connor> Garnt, you fucking animal! </connor>
<garnt> - Because the patty is shit! </garnt>
<connor> That is why! </connor>
<connor> - The patty is garbage. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Joey] The patty is garbage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but so is this
burger that you get- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Joey] No, it's not! </garnt>
<garnt> - The beef that they give you, </garnt>
<connor> The beef that they give you </connor>
<connor> that isn't A5 beef here is pathetic beef. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's not!
- It's so sad. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a fucking great burger. </garnt>
<connor> - As I was informed by a friend of mine, </connor>
<connor> whose whole job is to manage
exports of meat into Japan, </connor>
<connor> he informed me that all the beef </connor>
<joey> that isn't the top grade
stuff is just imported </joey>
<joey> from other countries.
- Well, then fuck him. </joey>
<joey> - And it tastes like shit! </joey>
<connor> - Fuck him! </connor>
<garnt> - You're acting like
that Reddit comment now. </garnt>
<connor> - I am, I am, I don't give a shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt, excuse me, I am a beef expert. </garnt>
<joey> - My dad works for Nintendo. </joey>
<garnt> - I've heard from a friend
who works in the industry. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, listen. </connor>
<connor> When you grow up,
basically, next to farms, </connor>
<connor> and you get that beef,
you get it fresh, man. </connor>
<joey> You can't give me this
shit of this air-sealed bag </joey>
<joey> of a beef carcass flown across a country. </joey>
<joey> It tastes like shit. </joey>
<joey> - Well, what if I didn't grow
up up next to a fucking farm? </joey>
<connor> - Well, that sucks to be you, Joey. </connor>
<connor> Go and eat your hamburger. </connor>
<garnt> - But by that same logic, </garnt>
<garnt> why can you still enjoy McDonald's patties </garnt>
<garnt> or burgers then? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because that as a
burger is a great burger. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a fucking great- </garnt>
<connor> - It's not! It's trash! </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not even the best
burger in the fast food joint. </garnt>
<garnt> If you take a fucking Burger
King over a McDonald's burger </garnt>
<connor> any day of the week- </connor>
<connor> - It depends on the mood. </connor>
<connor> - You're such a liar! </connor>
<joey> - What fucking mood?
- Who would actually? </joey>
<joey> - Explain to me the mood </joey>
<joey> that you need to be in.
- Who would we take </joey>
<garnt> a McDonald's burger over </garnt>
<garnt> a Burger King?
- When I am absolutely </garnt>
<connor> plastered, there's nothing more I want </connor>
<connor> than double cheeseburgers from McDonald's. </connor>
<connor> They have this- </connor>
<joey> - That just sounds like
your fucking prerogative. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But also, I just think that McDonald's, </connor>
<connor> in the UK at least, was
the best fast food chain. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, probably, but there
weren't many to pick from, </garnt>
<joey> I would say. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Bu there's way more to pick from here. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean like, okay,
- At the end of the day, </joey>
<connor> - If you could take a Burger King burger </connor>
<connor> with McDonald's fries, </connor>
<connor> that would be the perfect
fast food restaurant for me. </connor>
<connor> As it stands, I either have to pick </connor>
<connor> between a shitty burger and good fries </connor>
<connor> or a less shitty burger </connor>
<garnt> and worse fries. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm convinced all the fast food places </connor>
<connor> have an agreement of who's
gonna have the best what, </connor>
<connor> because why does not one
of them just figured out, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, those are the good fries? </connor>
<connor> Why don't we get those fries?" </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, true. </joey>
<connor> But I guarantee if I blindfolded you </connor>
<joey> and I made you eat both of them- </joey>
<connor> - The fries? I could
tell, a hundred percent. </connor>
<joey> - No, I don't think-
- We're doing it. </joey>
<connor> (laughter drowns out Connor) </connor>
<joey> - I reckon you could do
that with a burger as well </joey>
<joey> and you wouldn't be able to tell. </joey>
<connor> - Oh dude, with fast food chains? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Hundred percent I can tell. </joey>
<joey> I'll bet my life on it. </joey>
<joey> - We gotta do it now. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> We gotta fucking do that.
- Order Uber Eats right now! </garnt>
<connor> - We gotta do it now. </connor>
<connor> - Talking about beef though, </connor>
<garnt> let's talk about actual Japanese beef </garnt>
<connor> and Japanese steaks because like- </connor>
<connor> - A5 or nothing. </connor>
<connor> - A5-
- or nothing. </connor>
<connor> - A5 is like, I thought- </connor>
<connor> - It's not that much more expensive. </connor>
<connor> - It's so weird living in a country </connor>
<garnt> where you can go to your
local local supermarket </garnt>
<garnt> and get A5 beef. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is the type of beef </garnt>
<garnt> that gets shipped over
and you pay 50 bucks </garnt>
<joey> for a fucking hundred
grams of something abroad, </joey>
<garnt> and then you can just get
it here at your supermarket. </garnt>
<joey> As much as I don't rate steaks, </joey>
<connor> A5 steaks, they do the
striking comparatively. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I had a Wagyu burger yesterday
and it was fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> And I'm so glad that there was bread, </connor>
<connor> lettuce, and tomatoes and cheese, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Don't start this again. </joey>
<joey> We just steered away from it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just saying, I just felt good. </joey>
<joey> I mean a burger and a steak </joey>
<joey> are two different things in my mind. </joey>
<joey> But okay, Wagyu steak is amazing, </joey>
<joey> especially when they
fry that shit in butter </joey>
<joey> like, so much that it absorbs it. </joey>
<joey> And you bite into it, it's like (gasps). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know though. </joey>
<joey> Like for me, steak is just like, </joey>
<joey> how often do you have a steak? </joey>
<joey> - Not often, that's why I- </joey>
<connor> - You can't have steak often, it gets old. </connor>
<connor> - I would understand, coming
from your perspective, </connor>
<connor> why you hate steak, but to
me, steak is the best meal </connor>
<connor> or the best meats you can get if it's- </connor>
<connor> - False,
- prepared well. </connor>
<connor> - Which is false. </connor>
<connor> - What's better than a good steak? </connor>
<connor> - I think pork is the best meat. </connor>
<garnt> - Get the fuck out of here! </garnt>
<garnt> - Like a pork steak? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, not a pork steak. </connor>
<connor> I just think, well, pork steaks are good. </connor>
<garnt> Like Gammon chops are fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right.
- No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, here's how the tier list goes, okay? </connor>
<connor> Here's how the fucking tier list goes. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, it goes like an
amazing steak at top. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't eat a steak every day, </garnt>
<joey> but as a one off meal, steak is my- </joey>
<connor> - I admit, it's up there,
it's up there, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Then after that comes chicken, </connor>
<connor> 'cause chicken you can do so much with, </connor>
<garnt> and you can never get bored of chicken. </garnt>
<connor> - I could eat fried chicken
every day of the week </connor>
<connor> and be real. </connor>
<connor> - And then below that is pork. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no.
- Below that is pork </connor>
<garnt> because I would never, </garnt>
<garnt> anything you cook with pork, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like you can do
something similar with chicken. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I feel like pork has, </connor>
<connor> it's the in-between, whereas
beef is really heavy, </connor>
<joey> pork is the in-between, </joey>
<joey> and I feel like you can
do so much with pork. </joey>
<joey> I love sausages, man! </joey>
<connor> Sausages are amazing </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but you can also
have beef sausage as well. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> I've never had a beef sausage in our life. </connor>
<garnt> - There's nothing you can do with pork </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't do with
either chicken or beef </garnt>
<garnt> and have it taste better. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, do you like hotdogs? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - He acts like a guy who
doesn't like hotdogs. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - How do you not like hotdogs? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause the dude who's talking about- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's because you don't
like fucking condiments, </connor>
<connor> that's why! </connor>
<connor> - And also, the people who talk so highly </connor>
<joey> about steak are like, </joey>
<joey> "No, no, no, hotdog are for
peasants. I couldn't possibly." </joey>
<joey> I love a good hotdog. </joey>
<joey> - Hotdog, does this have dog in it? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I love hotdogs, man. </garnt>
<connor> I know they're absolute
garbage and probably cancerous- </connor>
<joey> - Okay, you have to have a
beef sausage hotdog though. </joey>
<joey> Because you've never had
a beef sausage, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, wait, tell me the
difference between a hotdog- </garnt>
<garnt> - And a sausage? </garnt>
<connor> - And a sausage. </connor>
<connor> Okay, if you're ever gonna
take a hotdog over a sausage, </connor>
<garnt> I don't think we can be friends. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> But you know when you're at a barbecue </garnt>
<garnt> and people are being kinda cheap, </garnt>
<joey> they don't wanna bring the
big sausages, you're like, </joey>
<connor> "Fine, I'll eat four hotdogs, fine." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I would never pick a
hotdog over a sausage. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no, never. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a double cheeseburger, right? </garnt>
<connor> If it's there, I'll eat it. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, with a sausage
hotdog like a thick boy, </connor>
<connor> you can only put one of those away. </connor>
<connor> With a hotdog, I feel like you
can put three or four away. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, 'cause
they're so fucking thin. </joey>
<connor> - And they just taste like... </connor>
<connor> A sausage, a good sausage is heavy. </connor>
<garnt> The reason I don't like hotdogs is that, </garnt>
<garnt> or the reason I would never
take it over the sausage, </garnt>
<connor> is that it just tastes so processed. </connor>
<connor> - That's 'cause it is! </connor>
<garnt> - There's something about
highly processed food </garnt>
<connor> that my brain is (laughs goofily) </connor>
<connor> - Question, do you like spam? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, you're gonna laugh now </connor>
<connor> and my mum's gonna feel so bad. </connor>
<connor> My mom used to make this meal
and I fucking loved it, dude. </connor>
<connor> I would always ask my mum to make it. </connor>
<connor> It was literally mashed
potatoes and spam, just mashed. </connor>
<connor> And I fucking loved this shit. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, with no flavoring on top of it? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, just mashed potato in spam. </connor>
<garnt> Imagine a giant fucking
pan of mashed potato, </garnt>
<garnt> and I would just take a
giant plate full of this shit </garnt>
<connor> and I would gobble that shit up, man. </connor>
<connor> I would eat that for days. </connor>
<joey> - That's like cancer in a plate. </joey>
<connor> - Because spam is one of those things </connor>
<connor> where it's like if I'm
offered spam on its own </connor>
<joey> and I can see it, I'm like,
"Get that away from me. </joey>
<joey> Get that shit away from me." </joey>
<joey> But when it's in something,
disguised, I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "Yo, this shit claps, what is it?" </connor>
<connor> Oh, it's spam. </connor>
<joey> - Spam fried rice is- </joey>
<connor> - Spam fired rice is pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - I used to fucking hate spam. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Ew, get
that shit away from me." </joey>
<joey> Give me real meat. </joey>
<connor> - Isn't there a spam in Hawaii? </connor>
<connor> They make a spam sushi or something? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's either Hawaii or Okinawa. </joey>
<joey> I think it's an Okinawa
dish with spam nigiri. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't fuck with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Spam nigiri is fucking dope. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't fuck with spam, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I used to not fuck with it, </garnt>
<garnt> but spam is such a huge
thing in the Philippines. </garnt>
<garnt> So going to Aki's parents' place, </garnt>
<joey> every second meal had spam in it, </joey>
<garnt> so I couldn't avoid the shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Spam is what I eat to remind me </connor>
<connor> what good meat tastes like. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What do the peasants eat nowadays? </connor>
<connor> I must know. </connor>
<garnt> Oh, spam, is it? </garnt>
<joey> - Hotdog and spam? </joey>
<joey> - I suppose I could give a
hotdog and spam a trial too. </joey>
<joey> Oh, rather distasteful. </joey>
<joey> I wanna know, when you go to the combini, </joey>
<joey> what's the top three
food items that you get? </joey>
<garnt> - It depends on the combini. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I always get, yeah it
depends on the combini, </joey>
<joey> but say if it's Family Mart, </joey>
<connor> I always get the fucking tuna bread. </connor>
<connor> Do you know the brand? </connor>
<connor> - Oh the- </connor>
<connor> - The long boy, yeah.
- Yeah, that shit's good. </connor>
<joey> That shit's good.
- The long boy tuna bread, </joey>
<joey> that shit always claps. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, anything with mayo in here, </joey>
<joey> in Japan is so much better. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so the tuna bread- </joey>
<connor> - Mayo is god tier. </connor>
<garnt> - The tuna bread with the mayo on top- </garnt>
<garnt> - As someone who hates
mayo, I gotta admit, </garnt>
<connor> Japan is the only place where
I can kind of be okay with it. </connor>
<garnt> - That's saying a lot,
that's saying a lot! </garnt>
<garnt> - I will never eat mayo by itself, </garnt>
<garnt> but when it's in a nice
potato salad or something, </garnt>
<connor> yeah, I'd fuck with that. </connor>
<connor> - I thought that egg sandwiches </connor>
<connor> were the most depressing
fucking thing in the world. </connor>
<garnt> - I agree, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - In the UK, they're like this white mush </connor>
<garnt> that looks disgusting, it
smells vile, it's just gross. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you have it in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like this yellow,
bright color, it's inviting, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, oh, eat me. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> - Eat me. </joey>
<joey> - I just might
- Eat me. </joey>
<joey> - I just might, and I had it and I had it. </joey>
<joey> I had it and my mind was blown </joey>
<joey> and I cannot stop eating the
egg sandwiches here, man. </joey>
<joey> - The egg sandwiches
are fucking godly here. </joey>
<connor> - I can never eat an egg
sandwich anywhere else now, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I'm gonna be thinking, dude- </garnt>
<garnt> - Japan has ruined eggs for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Eggs and mayo are just god tier here. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember the concept </garnt>
<garnt> of just going to my first yakiniku place </garnt>
<garnt> and just having the dips,
for some dipping sauce </garnt>
<joey> in yakiniku, which is, </joey>
<joey> how do I explain yakiniku? </joey>
<joey> It's just like grilled meats basically. </joey>
<joey> - It's like Korean barbecue- </joey>
<joey> - How do I explain it? It's meat. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like Korean barbecue, </garnt>
<garnt> but replace Korean with Japanese. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's on a skewer basically. </joey>
<garnt> So for some dishes, they
give you just an egg </garnt>
<joey> as a dipping sauce, the
egg yolk, a raw egg yolk; </joey>
<joey> which firstly, the
concept of eating raw eggs </joey>
<joey> was really, really weird for me </joey>
<joey> until I tried it for the first time. </joey>
<joey> And raw egg here tastes fucking great. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's safe. </connor>
<connor> - Our producer, Maylene,
is obsessed with eggs. </connor>
<joey> - You can't get salmonella
here from the eggs. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty impossible, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When I did one of my videos,
I drank a bunch of egg, </joey>
<garnt> all the comments were
like, "Oh my god, Connor- </garnt>
<garnt> - He's gonna die </garnt>
<garnt> - "You're gonna get
salmonella, you dumb fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> I know more, I got told
eggs give salmonella. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like reverse Uno card in this. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, hit me up with that. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think it's a
hundred percent unlikely. </connor>
<connor> I have heard of a couple of- </connor>
<connor> - It's worth the risks,
it's worth the risk </connor>
<connor> - I've heard of a couple of my friends </connor>
<connor> get very mild salmonella
from the eggs here, </connor>
<joey> but it's really, really rare. </joey>
<joey> Like it's not as easy to get
salmonella like in America. </joey>
<connor> - It's because I think in America </connor>
<connor> and the UK and most of Europe,
I think we wash the eggs </connor>
<connor> and we get rid of the
protective film, or the coat. </connor>
<connor> And I think it's also something
to do with how we feed them </connor>
<joey> certain drugs to make
them immune to diseases. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, 'cause like, what is
it, shabu-shabu and sukiyaki? </connor>
<connor> - Sukiyaki. </connor>
<connor> - That's one of my favorites, actually. </connor>
<joey> - Sukiyaki, is like, yeah,
I put you onto that, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that shit's- </connor>
<joey> - Sukiyaki's the best fucking hotpot. </joey>
<connor> - Shabu-shabu is like, </connor>
<connor> they boil this meat and veg in this broth </connor>
<connor> and it's kinda weak, it's like (sighs) </connor>
<connor> - I don't rate shabu-shabu. </connor>
<connor> - It's like they always
advertise themselves </connor>
<connor> as shabu-shabu places,
and then they might have </connor>
<connor> the sukiyaki on the menu,
but they never advertise it. </connor>
<connor> It's always yo, we got shabu-shabu. </connor>
<connor> And it tastes like shit! </connor>
<connor> It's like water. </connor>
<garnt> It's like bathwater for your meat. </garnt>
<garnt> - I still think the best hotpot for me </garnt>
<garnt> is Chinese hotpot. </garnt>
<joey> Chinese hotpot, it's way more flavorful. </joey>
<joey> And it's a heavy broth. </joey>
<joey> - Have you had sukiyaki though? </joey>
<connor> - Have you had it? </connor>
<garnt> - I have, I have had it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so sukiyaki, if
you don't know at home, </garnt>
<connor> what's the broth that they cook it in? </connor>
<connor> It's like a rich... </connor>
<joey> - It's soy based with a little
bit of, fuck, what was it? </joey>
<joey> It's like dashi, it's dashi. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how to explain dashi. </joey>
<joey> - It's this really rich broth, </joey>
<connor> and to mellow it out
and enhance the flavors, </connor>
<connor> you dunk it in egg yolk. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so you crack a
raw egg, you whip it up, </joey>
<joey> and then you dip that shit in. </joey>
<joey> - So you cook everything in the broth </joey>
<connor> and it's all covered in soy, </connor>
<connor> all the veg has absorbed
it, you dunk it in the egg, </connor>
<connor> and then you eat it and
it's fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - So good.
- It's so good. </connor>
<joey> And Chinese hotpot is good, </joey>
<connor> but I think sukiyaki's better. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I rave Chinese hotpot. </joey>
<joey> Every time I've had a Chinese
hotpot, I'm like, hell yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Also, Japanese hotpot's pretty good too. </connor>
<joey> We've had it at our place. </joey>
<joey> - Abe, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - We had like a, I
don't know which hotpot- </connor>
<connor> - We had that on Christmas </connor>
<garnt> 'cause Connor didn't want a fucking roast. </garnt>
<garnt> - None of us have an oven! </garnt>
<connor> What are we gonna roast, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> How are we gonna fucking roast a chicken </connor>
<joey> in a tiny little fish grill? </joey>
<joey> You get a grill in your
stove top, oven top, sorry. </joey>
<joey> Oven top, and you get this grill for fish </joey>
<joey> and it's like this wide. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you have to </joey>
<joey> pull it out.
- It can literally fit </joey>
<joey> just one fish. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You wanna roast a potato? </joey>
<joey> Good fucking luck, dude. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta cut that bitch in the third. </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna have to pan fry the potato. </joey>
<joey> He's like, I want a roast, </joey>
<joey> How are we gonna have a roast, Garnt? </joey>
<connor> Explain the logistics behind this. </connor>
<connor> The logistics, Garnt,
I'm bringing it back. </connor>
<garnt> - Now I have an oven and I think you- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I have an oven as well, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So yeah, next time- </garnt>
<joey> - Sorry that we can afford an oven. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Why would I need an oven </connor>
<connor> when I eat out every fucking day? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Connor, you're so lazy,
why do you eat out? </connor>
<connor> Sometimes, I meal prep, </connor>
<connor> meal prep, this sounds so fucking lame. </connor>
<connor> I meal prep, bro. </connor>
<connor> I'll make a curry for five days </connor>
<joey> and I'll eat the curry over
five days, like a Thai curry. </joey>
<connor> That's about it, that's as
far as cooking goes for me. </connor>
<joey> - But that's the thing,
I'm pretty sure we touched </joey>
<joey> upon this on a previous episode, </joey>
<joey> - But people got so pissed when we said. </joey>
<connor> That they were like, "It's
not cheaper to eat out </connor>
<connor> if you do X and X and X." </connor>
<connor> And it's, yeah, if I ate pasta and sauce, </connor>
<connor> of course it's gonna be cheaper. </connor>
<connor> But if you want to have
something that tastes different, </connor>
<connor> yes, it's gonna maybe be a 100- </connor>
<garnt> - If you want a different
meal every day, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you can't be fucked
to go shopping every day </garnt>
<garnt> because the expire date on
shit is like two days to go! </garnt>
<connor> - And more often than not, </connor>
<connor> when you buy stuff, it's too
much portions that I can't use. </connor>
<joey> Like veg here is normally portioned </joey>
<joey> for more than one person. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like family portion. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I wanted, what was it? </joey>
<garnt> What's the small onions,
like the green onions? </garnt>
<garnt> What are they called? Is it green onions? </garnt>
<garnt> - Shallots. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's shallots in America. </garnt>
<garnt> - Spring onion? </garnt>
<garnt> - Spring onion for us. </garnt>
<garnt> You cannot just get two spring onions. </garnt>
<joey> - It has to be a whole fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's either a whole fucking one, </joey>
<joey> or a giant tub of cut-up ones. </joey>
<joey> And I'm talking more than any one person </joey>
<joey> could ever use in a week. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like that big. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a tub this thick
just filled with these cuts, </garnt>
<connor> and it's like, I'm not gonna use this. </connor>
<connor> I feel bad 'cause I throw
all the ingredients away </connor>
<connor> 'cause I can't use them. </connor>
<joey> - Well, it's because cut shallots are used </joey>
<joey> in literally every Japanese dish, so. </joey>
<connor> - And if I get tomatoes, they
always come in packs of six. </connor>
<garnt> Tomatoes are fucking big! </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need six most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> And 'cause of how we do,
say we record on Tuesdays, </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna eat out,
and then maybe on Monday </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to meet someone for a meeting </garnt>
<joey> or maybe I've got a shoot on Thursday, </joey>
<joey> so I'm gonna eat out, </joey>
<joey> So it's more like one day a week I eat in. </joey>
<joey> And even then I'll just go to the combini </joey>
<garnt> and get the 500 Yen ramen. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is, sure, I could make my own- </joey>
<joey> - Which is technically the top tier ramen. </joey>
<joey> - Which I could make my own ramen. </joey>
<joey> But it'd be more expensive. </joey>
<joey> So it's like, yeah, of course some people, </joey>
<joey> if you want to be picky about
it, yeah, you can save money. </joey>
<garnt> The same way if you eat pasta in the UK </garnt>
<connor> you'll save a shit ton of money. </connor>
<joey> But if you wanna </joey>
<joey> live like a human being,
- If you actually wanna </joey>
<joey> enjoy your food. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, if you wanna not be depressed 24/7 </joey>
<joey> while you're eating, like, yeah, okay. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause going back to the combini thing </connor>
<connor> about foods that we buy, </connor>
<garnt> I go less to the combini now to get meals. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when I first moved here, </garnt>
<garnt> I would go to get a combini
meal every fucking day. </garnt>
<garnt> And the combini fried chicken
here is fucking great. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, with an asterisk. </connor>
<garnt> - With an asterisk. </garnt>
<garnt> FamilyMart fried chicken
fucking sucks, okay?! </garnt>
<garnt> It's way too greasy. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like a layer of like, fat. </connor>
<connor> - You feel like you're eating
death as you're taking a bite. </connor>
<connor> - And I see YouTubers,
I think Chris Broad says </connor>
<connor> that his favorite's FamilyMart chicken </connor>
<joey> and you eat into this thing, </joey>
<joey> and it's the most depressed
things you can eat. </joey>
<joey> - It's as depressed as he is. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - You take a bite into this thing, </garnt>
<garnt> it is pure water and oil. </garnt>
<joey> That chicken was probably
anemic in its real life </joey>
<joey> and they pumped that
shit with water and oil </joey>
<joey> and they're like, dude do it. </joey>
<joey> Lawson's fried chicken on the other hand. </joey>
<garnt> - Nah, nah, nah. </garnt>
<garnt> Seven fried chicken at the top. </garnt>
<garnt> - Seven fried chicken.
- I think Seven fried chicken </garnt>
<garnt> is in the middle, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Lawson's do this sweet and sour, </garnt>
<connor> it's salty and sweet, like
teriyaki fried chicken. </connor>
<joey> It's fucking good,
dude, it's fucking good. </joey>
<connor> It hits different, it
hits back. It hits back. </connor>
<connor> You bite into this thing,
it's fighting you, bro, </connor>
<connor> in the good way. </connor>
<connor> It's like, damn, there's so
much flavor in this thing, </connor>
<connor> it's like, oh shit, oh shit. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Holy shit, I just wanted the
fired chicken, not a fight. </connor>
<joey> Also when you first come to Japan, </joey>
<joey> you're like onigiri, bro. </joey>
<joey> Jelly-filled donuts immediately. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's new, it's
exciting, it tastes good. </joey>
<joey> And then when I moved here,
I was eating it and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "This kind of tastes
boring, really boring." </joey>
<joey> And then I thought who would
have a sandwich in Japan? </joey>
<garnt> I don't want a, I can get a
better sandwich in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you start
experimenting a little bit, </garnt>
<garnt> and I had the egg and
my go-to sandwich combo. </garnt>
<garnt> I cry if this isn't available. </garnt>
<joey> In Lawson's they have a god
tier tuna mayo sandwich, </joey>
<joey> and the other one is the egg one. </joey>
<joey> - The egg and ham? </joey>
<connor> - It's beautiful, it's beautiful, man. </connor>
<connor> I cry every time I eat it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that is definitely my
favorite sandwich combination. </joey>
<connor> - It's so good because you
have the tuna and you're like, </connor>
<garnt> "Ooh, a little salty, a little fishy." </garnt>
<garnt> You have the egg and
mayo one, you're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Fuck, dude, this is good." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm actually the opposite. </garnt>
<garnt> When I'm first moved here, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like why would I
want a fucking onigiri? </garnt>
<garnt> And now it's just like
a very nice casual snack </garnt>
<garnt> where you don't want a
full meal, you just want- </garnt>
<connor> - Onigiri's quite filling though, I find. </connor>
<garnt> - That's it, </garnt>
<garnt> You have that as a snack
and it fills you up </garnt>
<joey> and you don't need anything else. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - For a while.
- I guess, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I always, when I go to the
combini in the morning, </joey>
<joey> sometimes I can't be
bothered to make a breakfast, </joey>
<joey> so I go to the combini in the morning, </joey>
<joey> and I always get my breakfast </joey>
<garnt> and then some kind of onigiri. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I know the breakfast
is gonna fill me up, </garnt>
<connor> but then I know a couple of hours later, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna be feeling a little bit peckish, </joey>
<joey> And the onigiri is just perfect </joey>
<joey> to fill in that little spot it creates. </joey>
<connor> - My problem with onigiri is sometimes, </connor>
<garnt> it's like a coin toss. </garnt>
<joey> You might get one where they're
generous with the fillings, </joey>
<joey> and sometimes you bite into that shit </joey>
<joey> and there's one shred of tuna in it. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, "Where's the flavor, bro? </joey>
<joey> I just ate into to seaweed and rice." </joey>
<joey> There was one piece of tuna
with a slap of mayo on it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It sucks, man. </joey>
<joey> If it was consistent, maybe I'd like it. </joey>
<joey> - But you only eat the tuna onigiri. </joey>
<joey> - No, I like the salmon
and the cod roe one. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the cod roe one's fine, </joey>
<connor> but cod roe is kind of intense, so. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you tried some
of the other flavors, </garnt>
<garnt> like the flavored rice flavors? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you mean like the fried rice ones? </garnt>
<joey> The fried rice ones are fine, but again, </joey>
<joey> I'm always thinking like- </joey>
<joey> - They're situational for me. </joey>
<joey> - I would rather them warm. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Got back to this shit again. </joey>
<connor> - I want it warm. </connor>
<connor> - You can warm it up! </connor>
<garnt> Just put that bitch in the microwave! </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't feel right. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna microwave
rice, that's depressing, man. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, would you rather cold rice </connor>
<joey> or microwave rice? </joey>
<joey> - Cold.
- Well, then stop </joey>
<joey> fucking complaining (laughing). </joey>
<joey> - But I would rather it be freshly- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but that aint gonna
happen at a fucking combini. </garnt>
<connor> - For you, as a white person, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) who grew up- </connor>
<joey> - That's really situational. </joey>
<joey> - As a white person.
- As a white person. </joey>
<joey> - As a white person. </joey>
<joey> - The point I was trying to make here </joey>
<joey> is how did it feel going from eating rice </joey>
<joey> every now and again to eating
rice for almost every meal? </joey>
<joey> Because I've had a
conversation with people </joey>
<garnt> who grew up grew up in
America, grew up in England, </garnt>
<connor> they've moved to an Asian
country and they're like, </connor>
<garnt> "Man, I really it at first
and then I just got bored </garnt>
<garnt> of eating rice for every meal." </garnt>
<garnt> But I grew up with this
shit, so I'm used to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wears you down a little bit, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like you
really do get used to it. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, maybe some
people, they like it at first, </connor>
<connor> and, like you said, they start to hate it. </connor>
<connor> But for me it was like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> rice has just always been there. </connor>
<garnt> It's like bread, but in a
different format for me. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's like if bread is the hard drive, </connor>
<garnt> then rice is the SD card in my mind </garnt>
<garnt> They all do the same thing. </garnt>
<connor> They just fill you up and they're carbs. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think most of the time
here, it's not just plain rice. </connor>
<joey> Sometimes it is, like
when you go to ryokan </joey>
<joey> and it's just plain fucking rice in it. </joey>
<joey> And it's so starchy and
sticky, you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck, dude, I'm eating
fucking Play-Doh here." </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> But when you go to my
favorite place in the world, </connor>
<connor> Matsuya, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - Here we go again. Here we go again. </garnt>
<garnt> - I must look like a freak when I do this. </garnt>
<connor> So when they cook the pork, </connor>
<connor> pork, by the way, Garnt, not beef. </connor>
<garnt> Beef tastes like shit. </garnt>
<garnt> They cook the pork, right. </garnt>
<garnt> There's like juices, and
normally you just kinda </garnt>
<connor> pick up the pork and put in the rice, </connor>
<connor> put some mayo on it and then eat it. </connor>
<connor> In the restaurant, I hold
up my plate and pour all </connor>
<connor> the fats and stuff on the rice. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I can agree with that. </connor>
<joey> - Tastes so fucking good, dude,
'cause it makes it so rich. </joey>
<joey> - But it's just the fucking the audacity </joey>
<joey> to go into a beef bowl place
and order pork (laughing). </joey>
<connor> - This guy. </connor>
<garnt> - This guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, you go to Matsuya, man, </garnt>
<joey> I'm telling you, man,
that pork and ginger. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, I've had it, it's great. </joey>
<connor> - We were smashed one time and I was like- </connor>
<garnt> - But it's like vanilla beef. </garnt>
<garnt> Why would I have a- </garnt>
<garnt> - Vanilla beef! Are you out of your mind?! </garnt>
<connor> Don't start this again! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Vanilla beef, really?! </connor>
<joey> Oh my god, man. </joey>
<joey> - If I walk into a Matsuya,
I'm ordering a beef bowl. </joey>
<garnt> - It's beef without attitude. </garnt>
<joey> What can I say? That's pork, that's pork. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, pork is like beta beef. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing)
- Nah man, I don't know man. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I already know this is gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest comment war
in the comments section. </garnt>
<garnt> Out of any shitty opinion on anime- </garnt>
<connor> - We have mainly Americans watching us </connor>
<garnt> and I feel that Americans
will side with beef, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause beef is way more prevalent, </garnt>
<garnt> - And they're right. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, they're not right, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> They're not right. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what's an underrated meat? </garnt>
<connor> - What?
- Lamb, lamb is </connor>
<connor> pretty fucking good. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, here's the thing about lamb, </garnt>
<joey> is that has to be really
good quality lamb. </joey>
<joey> Because if it's not,
the after taste in lamb </joey>
<garnt> can be so overpowering that
it just tastes horrible. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, lamb fucking sucks here, bro. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, sometimes it's like
eating leather, essentially. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we went to a restaurant once, man, </connor>
<connor> and it was like a roulette
wheel on this lamb. </connor>
<garnt> For some reason, some of these lamb chops </garnt>
<garnt> were perfectly cooked. </garnt>
<garnt> You had another one, it's like trying to </garnt>
<joey> - Eating a boot.
- Chew through a tire, man. </joey>
<garnt> It was like (breathes loudly) </garnt>
<joey> And it's like when do I
just swallow it and give up? </joey>
<connor> When do I just admit- </connor>
<connor> - It's like I had a chiseled
jawline by the end of it </connor>
<joey> 'cause from all the fucking
chewing I was doing. </joey>
<connor> - It's either my jaw
dislocates or I'm done, bro. </connor>
<joey> - Or I'm choking on this
fucking tire piece of lamb. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's just some meats like that. </joey>
<joey> And especially coming from
Wales where, you know, </joey>
<connor> they fuck sheep, that's the stereotype, </connor>
<connor> that's what everyone does. </connor>
<connor> I mean, lamb is fucking
great, you get great lamb </connor>
<garnt> - I guess another question I have for you, </garnt>
<connor> which is a conversation I've
had with a lot of people </connor>
<connor> who have never been to Asia. </connor>
<connor> - Go ahead. </connor>
<connor> - Who have never been to
Asia or lived in Asia, </connor>
<connor> is this concept of cooking your own meal </connor>
<connor> in a restaurant. </connor>
<garnt> Like going to a Korean barbecue
or going to a shabu-shabu, </garnt>
<garnt> and having to cook your own
meal and cook your own meats. </garnt>
<garnt> What's your opinion of that? </garnt>
<garnt> - As a colonial white man? I'm joking. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - As a upper class white man.
- Because I really like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I really like the social part. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, the first time I
went to a Korean barbecue </garnt>
<garnt> was with you and I was like,
"I'ma just let Garnt do this." </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Let the Brown boy do it! </connor>
<garnt> - Because I really like
the social aspect of, </garnt>
<garnt> one, being able to
control how, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> how cooked your steak
is, to do that yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, sure. </garnt>
<garnt> We have Gordon Ramsey, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - He's a white man who can
cook, that's an anomaly. </connor>
<connor> White people can't cook, man? </connor>
<connor> I'll give it to every other culture. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause there's cause there's
a chain of pubs in Australia </joey>
<joey> where inside of the pub there's
literally just a butcher </joey>
<joey> of just rows and rows of
steaks and meats and whatever. </joey>
<joey> And you pick out whatever
steak you want, you pay for it, </joey>
<connor> they give it to you, and
then you have to take that </connor>
<joey> over to the barbecue and
just make it yourself. </joey>
<connor> - The reason why I don't like
cooking it myself is, one, </connor>
<joey> I wanna pay the other
person to do that, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna pay you so I
can fuck up this piece of meat. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'll go and do that at home. </joey>
<joey> I'll go and fuck this up- </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna embarrass
myself in public. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the worst part is, </joey>
<joey> is when you go to a Korean barbecue, </joey>
<joey> you take someone there. </joey>
<joey> When you take someone to Korean barbecue </joey>
<joey> or any kind of barbecue like that, </joey>
<connor> you're the one who has to cook,
'cause you took them there. </connor>
<connor> It's on you. </connor>
<connor> And they just sit back and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Go ahead, go ahead." </connor>
<connor> And then I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck dude, how do I know this is cooked?" </connor>
<connor> And the worst part is they're
like, "Let's get chicken." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like fuck! </connor>
<connor> Fuck! </connor>
<garnt> When is chicken cooked? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause personally, I will just
let the chicken get black. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, all right, it's safe to eat. </connor>
<connor> It's safe to eat, dig in kids! </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like you're okay
with going to a barbecue </garnt>
<garnt> and having someone cook for you, </garnt>
<garnt> so why, why can't you put that
in a restaurant experience? </garnt>
<garnt> Right? What's the difference? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, 'cause it's like we're
all bringing our own meats. </connor>
<garnt> - Or you can just order
good quality meat, I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - Why would I do that in a restaurant </connor>
<connor> when I can just do that at home? </connor>
<connor> You get the exact same experience. </connor>
<garnt> - But then why do you go to a barbecue? </garnt>
<garnt> Why do people do barbecues? </garnt>
<connor> It's 'cause it's a social experience. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's the exact same
thing with a Korean barbecue. </connor>
<connor> - That's exactly the same thing with going </connor>
<garnt> to a shabu-shabu or going
to a Korean barbecue. </garnt>
<connor> - If you gave me the choice, you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Connor, you can have Korean
barbecue where you cook it </connor>
<connor> or Korean barbecue where
the guy who works here </connor>
<garnt> and often comes on." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause they see you fucking
burning the meat anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> and they come in like no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> And they start like, they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> they come and fix it for you. </garnt>
<connor> So, just save the embarrassment
and just do it for me right. </connor>
<garnt> - But it's just like an activity, </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like- </garnt>
<connor> - Then go and do an activity! </connor>
<connor> Why you gotta make your fucking meal </connor>
<connor> into an adventure, bro? </connor>
<connor> - Because like, okay, here's the thing, </connor>
<connor> especially when, I
remember going to America </connor>
<connor> where the only reason you, </connor>
<connor> especially hanging out
with Sydney's family </connor>
<connor> deep in the Midwest, they only
go to a restaurant to eat. </connor>
<connor> And that's just it. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's how it should be. </connor>
<garnt> The only exception to me is hotpot </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you can't fuck a hotpot up. </garnt>
<joey> You just throw everything in. </joey>
<joey> Just throw it all in. </joey>
<connor> - I dunno man, I've seen
people fuck up a hotpot. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's true, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can fuck up a hotpot. </garnt>
<joey> But to me, a restaurant can be </joey>
<joey> like an entire experience
where you catch up </joey>
<garnt> with friends and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like in the West,
you don't go to a restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> for anything else but the purpose </garnt>
<garnt> of just having a meal and eating. </garnt>
<connor> - I disagree, I think it's
changing a little bit now. </connor>
<garnt> At least it was the UK, before I left. </garnt>
<garnt> It was very much becoming
an experience kind of thing </garnt>
<connor> over whatever the restaurant was serving. </connor>
<joey> - Some of the quietest
restaurants I've ever been </joey>
<joey> to have been in America
where no-one is talking </joey>
<joey> and they're just silently eating. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you could do this at home, </joey>
<connor> - I don't like to make my meal </connor>
<connor> that I look forward to all
day into a stressful thing. </connor>
<connor> If every time I took a shit </connor>
<joey> I had to put in the input
code and it's flashing </joey>
<joey> on the bidet, dude, that's
gonna, I don't wanna, </joey>
<joey> yeah, it's a fun activity at first, </joey>
<joey> but that's gonna get
old real fucking fast. </joey>
<joey> Like if you're adding steps- </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if that's the same thing. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I just feel
like you're adding steps </joey>
<connor> to something which doesn't require steps. </connor>
<joey> - But it does, that's where
the enjoyment comes in. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - What?
- It's like a group activity. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, shout out to the
people who get anxiety </garnt>
<connor> with cooking, I'm sure you can relate. </connor>
<connor> You're like, "Why would
I wanna fuck this up </connor>
<joey> when I can just pay someone to do it?" </joey>
<connor> - In my defense, I can't
cook to save my life. </connor>
<connor> I fuck up a toast,
that's the kind of like- </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> that's the kind of like fucking- </joey>
<connor> - And you will cook your own
food in those restaurants? </connor>
<joey> - And yet, I love going to a yakiniku </joey>
<joey> and being the one to be
like, "I'll cook the meat." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- No. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's the one and only time </joey>
<joey> I'm in front of food where I have control. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a power move. </garnt>
<joey> - It is a power move. </joey>
<garnt> - Let me fucking handle
this. Let me cook the meat. </garnt>
<joey> - Let me show you how it's done. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - If you get impressed by
someone putting meat on a grill, </connor>
<connor> I mean fair play to you, man,
I'm not really buying that. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Go and work in the kitchen." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Get out of my seat. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I love about
yakiniku and Korean barbecues </joey>
<joey> is that it's literally you
just have a fucking meal </joey>
<garnt> of just grilled meat. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like having the
burger without the bun. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's my main problem- </garnt>
<garnt> - Cut out the fucking middle man </garnt>
<garnt> and just give me the good shit, man! </garnt>
<joey> - I love yakiniku,
don't get me wrong, man. </joey>
<joey> I love yakiniku. </joey>
<joey> There is a fundamental
problem with yakiniku. </joey>
<connor> - Go on. </connor>
<connor> - I hate the loading times for the meat. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - You can't skip the loading time. </joey>
<connor> - You can't skip the loading. </connor>
<connor> Okay, at a good restaurant, </connor>
<joey> what would a good restaurant do? </joey>
<joey> They prepare all the foods so
it comes out at the same time? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Sign of a good restaurant, </joey>
<joey> because everyone can start
eating immediately, right? </joey>
<joey> With a yakiniku place, </joey>
<joey> especially if you go with fucking Maylene, </joey>
<joey> I wanna chuck all the
meat on straight away </joey>
<joey> so that we can start eating everything </joey>
<joey> and we have a constant
stream of meat coming in. </joey>
<joey> Maylene, when I went with her, </joey>
<connor> she wanted to put one tiny
fucking piece of beef on it </connor>
<connor> and wait five minutes. </connor>
<garnt> - Well that's Maylene's problem. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- You know? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That's why you don't go to
a restaurant with Maylene. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I like to eat, I wanna keep eating. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's why you
gotta fucking optimize it. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have- </garnt>
<garnt> - He's got the strats now!
- You can fucking optimize </garnt>
<garnt> this because you have the meats on it, </garnt>
<garnt> and then as the meats getting
done, you put more meat on it </garnt>
<joey> and you put this on the side, </joey>
<joey> - Speed run yakiniku. </joey>
<joey> - And then as you're eating the meat, </joey>
<connor> then the other meat is cooking </connor>
<garnt> and there's never a down period. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, that's not
true, that doesn't happen, </connor>
<garnt> In a realistic world,
Garnt, that doesn't happen. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is how it happens.
- That is how it happens. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've just not optimized your Korean </garnt>
<garnt> barbecue experience.
- You don't like yakiniku </garnt>
<joey> because you've just been to shit yakinikus </joey>
<connor> - Also, right, here's
another awkward scenario. </connor>
<connor> I hate this. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Four of you go to a yakiniku restaurant, </connor>
<joey> The A5 beef comes out. </joey>
<joey> It's in six pieces. </joey>
<joey> What do you do, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> Who decides who gets how many A5? </joey>
<joey> This is the A5 beef, Garnt, come on. </joey>
<garnt> This is 8,000 Yen for these six slabs. </garnt>
<garnt> Who gets what, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause personally, I'm
not gonna lie, I want two. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - How do I argue? </connor>
<connor> - That just goes down
to the Asian experience </connor>
<garnt> of sharing your meals
and sharing your dishes. </garnt>
<connor> - How the fuck do we turn
six into eight, Garnt? </connor>
<joey> Because someone- </joey>
<joey> - Cut one of them in half? </joey>
<joey> - No, that's depressing,
that's depressing, bro. </joey>
<joey> You can't do that, man. </joey>
<joey> It's already precut. </joey>
<joey> - Asian families can do it no problem. </joey>
<connor> - I need to do Monopoly mind games </connor>
<garnt> at my fucking family dinner </garnt>
<garnt> to make sure I'm getting the most meat. </garnt>
<connor> - Let me tell you how to solve this. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Go, go. </connor>
<connor> - Because this happens every time. </connor>
<connor> You have the four pieces, </connor>
<garnt> you have the two pieces left. </garnt>
<connor> And the Connor's like, "Is
nobody gonna eat these? </connor>
<connor> Okay, I'll just take them." </connor>
<connor> That is the experience
hanging out with Connor. </connor>
<garnt> He is that guy who's just like- </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, you know what's more stressful </connor>
<connor> than when you're hungry
and there's one piece left </connor>
<connor> and nobody seems to give a fuck </connor>
<joey> that there's one piece left on the table? </joey>
<joey> It's like, are we gonna eat this or not? </joey>
<joey> Because if no-one's gonna
do it, I'm gonna do it. </joey>
<joey> - Then just do it. </joey>
<joey> - No, because I also, </joey>
<garnt> okay, with you guys, I don't
give a fuck, I'll do it. </garnt>
<garnt> But maybe when we're first
getting to know each other, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't want you guys
to go home and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Why's Connor always fucking
talking all our food, man? </garnt>
<garnt> He's always going for it straight away. </garnt>
<garnt> He's going for the kill." </garnt>
<garnt> Right? This is a real social problem, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause if I'm getting dinner, </garnt>
<garnt> every single time I have my
peace, I'll chat a little bit, </garnt>
<garnt> and I look to go and get my next piece </garnt>
<garnt> and the fucking fat ass over
there is taking it every time. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to know that there's
at least a cool-down period </garnt>
<garnt> between him eating one piece </garnt>
<garnt> and there's at least a
two-minute cool down to wait. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so stressful, there's
so many social issues </garnt>
<garnt> with meat being cooked on its own! </garnt>
<joey> Just let us all order </joey>
<connor> our own shit!
- I feel like you're </connor>
<joey> way too over complicating this, man. </joey>
<connor> - Listen, because you
don't realize it, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - You're creating problems out of nothing. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, 'cause
Joey, your social skills </joey>
<joey> are perfectly normal human beings. </joey>
<joey> You just glide through it,
you don't worry about it. </joey>
<garnt> Joey just dances through, man. </garnt>
<garnt> For me it's like a science, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a science. Social situations, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You gotta make sure you don't do anything </garnt>
<joey> for a new person that
could make you seem weird. </joey>
<joey> - All right.
- So that includes </joey>
<joey> not eating too much. </joey>
<joey> If you go home, they
think you're a fat ass, </joey>
<joey> oh, get a load of this
guy eating all our meat </joey>
<connor> that we split the bill on! </connor>
<joey> He ate the most! Connor
should've paid the money. </joey>
<garnt> - In my mind, if you're not gonna eat it, </garnt>
<garnt> you guys know we're splitting this meal. </garnt>
<connor> So if you're not gonna eat it, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna just fucking take it. </joey>
<connor> - But sometimes that
hasn't been made clear. </connor>
<connor> Who's splitting? Are we
splitting this, are we not? </connor>
<connor> We don't know. </connor>
<connor> This is the awkward social situations </connor>
<connor> that you encounter often, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Right, but I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> this opportunity of taking
this last piece of meat </joey>
<connor> is here right now. </connor>
<connor> I don't give a fuck about what percentage </connor>
<connor> are we gonna split this
based on how many pieces </connor>
<joey> of meat we ate.
- I'm jealous of you, Joey, </joey>
<connor> that you can throw caution
to the wind like that </connor>
<joey> and just take the meat. </joey>
<joey> - If people think I'm a fat ass, </joey>
<joey> well, then that's their problem. </joey>
<joey> I have the full stomach, not you. </joey>
<joey> You missed the opportunity,
I take that opportunity. </joey>
<joey> I am an opportunist in that sense. </joey>
<connor> - You say that like you're the one </connor>
<joey> who always takes the
last piece, when it's me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is you. </joey>
<joey> And in my head I'm just like,
"Look at fucking fat ass!" </joey>
<joey> - What I do is I wait, you gotta wait </joey>
<connor> until you're pretty
confident that everyone </connor>
<connor> has just decided they
don't want this anymore, </connor>
<connor> and then you go in for the kill. </connor>
<joey> - See, I've been in
way too many situations </joey>
<joey> where it's such a Japanese thing, </joey>
<joey> especially when you go to
a business dinner in Japan, </joey>
<garnt> there's always, it's like a
rule, it's like a social rule </garnt>
<garnt> to leave one piece of </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the fuck it is.
- Why? Why?! </garnt>
<garnt> That's so annoying! </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's this whole idea of- </garnt>
<garnt> - The Japanese culture
of "You go, no, you go, </garnt>
<garnt> no, you go." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the crowd before me. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the whole collective mentality. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I've been in so many
of those situations where, </garnt>
<connor> in the end, no one takes the piece at all. </connor>
<connor> - And they just take the food back? </connor>
<joey> - And then they just take the food back. </joey>
<connor> - Ah, no dude, take me back to the kitchen </connor>
<joey> Give me all the one piece leftovers. </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna eat them, bro.
- So that's why, now, </connor>
<connor> because I've been in so many
situations where I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Why is he taking that away? </garnt>
<garnt> There's still one piece left on it." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, let me use my gaijin card </garnt>
<joey> for a second hand here and
just give me that piece. </joey>
<joey> - Think of all the
wasted food that happened </joey>
<connor> because of socially awkward situations. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Wasn't it better if we all
just figured out a system? </connor>
<garnt> - It's just a piece of meat, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not just a piece of meat, Garnt. </garnt>
<connor> That's A5 beef you're </connor>
<garnt> talking about.
- She meant something to me! </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, if it's A5 beef, fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - Get a load of this guy,
this guy doesn't eat hotdogs, </connor>
<garnt> - If it's like a piece
of pork or something, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like fucking- </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - See what I mean? This
guy's is so fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - Those are fighting words. </garnt>
<connor> - This guy gets two million subs, </connor>
<connor> he changes, man. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> No more hotdogs!
- You used to be </garnt>
<connor> humble, Garnt.
- No more spam for Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Can I talk about one
thing that I'm not a fan of </connor>
<connor> in Japanese cooking culture, </connor>
<connor> which is not really widespread? </connor>
<connor> But okay. </connor>
<connor> So, we're in a ryokan, okay? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And we have this mini grill </connor>
<connor> and we have this mini grill next to us. </connor>
<connor> Right, okay. </connor>
<connor> And they put a shell fish on the grill. </connor>
<connor> - Abalone.
- Abalone. </connor>
<garnt> They put the shellfish on this grill </garnt>
<garnt> and we're all sitting next to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the fish, the shellfish
starts dancing and turning </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, hmm, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Are shellfish meant to do
that when they're dead? </garnt>
<connor> And then it, it looks like it's trying </connor>
<connor> to crawl off this grill. </connor>
<connor> And then it goes from, </connor>
<connor> I slowly start to realize
that shit's alive. </connor>
<connor> I'm watching something being burned alive </connor>
<garnt> in front of my eyes, and you
expect me to eat this shit?! </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because you
know this shit's fresh. </connor>
<joey> - That shit was amazing. </joey>
<connor> Isn't it like $50 apiece?
- Yeah, do you know </connor>
<joey> why it was amazing? Because
it was alive two minutes ago. </joey>
<joey> - There's fresh food, and
then there's witnessing </joey>
<garnt> a fucking murder before I'm about to eat. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a fucking abalone, who cares? </garnt>
<connor> It's not like you knew this abalone. </connor>
<joey> It's not like watching a friend die. </joey>
<joey> - This man's a meat eater and
now he's fucking complaining </joey>
<joey> that a shellfish dies in front of him? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, I'm like, I'm fine. </garnt>
<garnt> Would you kill every animal that you eat? </garnt>
<garnt> Would you kill a cow? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like- </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a fucking lie! </garnt>
<garnt> You're sitting here, being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh no, this shellfish died."
- This poor abalone! </garnt>
<garnt> - You telling me that you'll
kill a cow and eat it? </garnt>
<garnt> You would kill a cow? </garnt>
<garnt> - I need to be mentally prepared. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mentally prepared?
- Yes, yes! </garnt>
<garnt> - For a fucking shellfish?! </garnt>
<connor> - You eat all of this meat
like it's nothing, bro. </connor>
<connor> You never think about it, bro. </connor>
<connor> You can't just sit here
and then pick and choose </connor>
<garnt> when you see a little thing squirming </garnt>
<garnt> in front of you, being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, well, I guess now I
have a problem with this." </garnt>
<connor> Someone should do something about this. </connor>
<connor> - I know an animal needs to be killed </connor>
<garnt> in order for me to eat and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> If I need to kill an animal
to eat it, I'll fucking do it. </garnt>
<garnt> But I need to be in the mental headspace, </garnt>
<garnt> but when I'm sitting down at a restaurant </garnt>
<connor> or something like that- </connor>
<connor> - Fuck it, we're getting the chicken, bro. </connor>
<connor> I wanna see him kill it. </connor>
<connor> - It's not the only time it's happened, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause a few weeks ago, I
went to this teppanyaki place, </garnt>
<garnt> which, teppanyaki is like a flat grill </garnt>
<garnt> and a chef cooks the food. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, I like that, I like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Great that someone
else cooks it for you. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But I remember I was
sitting there with Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> and on the opposite side, </garnt>
<garnt> the other people had
just ordered lobsters. </garnt>
<garnt> And so what happens is that
they get the freshest lobster. </garnt>
<joey> They have the tank with
just lobsters in it. </joey>
<joey> And they pick a lobster </joey>
<joey> and the chef puts the
lobster in front of them, </joey>
<garnt> and it's fucking trying to crawl around. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, this is a fresh fucking lobster. </garnt>
<garnt> Now I've seen lobsters being prepared </garnt>
<garnt> by fucking Gordon Ramsey and shit. </garnt>
<garnt> He puts the knife in the spinal
cord and kills it instantly. </garnt>
<garnt> But not at this fucking restaurant. </garnt>
<garnt> This fucking restaurant
presents the lobster, </garnt>
<garnt> it's crawling around,
and the customer's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yes, this is a fresh
lobster, this looks amazing." </garnt>
<garnt> And the chef goes like, "Okay, brilliant." </garnt>
<garnt> Puts the lobster on the grill </garnt>
<garnt> and you just see it being fucking cooked </garnt>
<garnt> and it's trying to fucking crawl away! </garnt>
<connor> - To be fair, I'd rather see that, </connor>
<connor> than when you go in
those shitty restaurants </connor>
<joey> with those obviously dead
lobsters in the tank, </joey>
<joey> that are barely fucking alive </joey>
<joey> 'cause they've been
suffocated in their own shit. </joey>
<joey> I would rather the lobster probably </joey>
<connor> have quite a painful death, </connor>
<connor> but it's over and pretty fast, you know? </connor>
<connor> It probably tastes better too </connor>
<connor> and it's not poisoning its friends. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause when a lobster
dies in that tank, bro, </joey>
<connor> all those lobsters are contaminated. </connor>
<joey> - I see the lobster
squirming really rapidly, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, "Okay, this is
a healthy, young lobster." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - That's a healthy boy. </connor>
<garnt> - What are you gonna do? </garnt>
<connor> Fucking take it out back and
put a bullet in its head? </connor>
<connor> Garnt, what do you want? </connor>
<connor> - Yes, please! </connor>
<garnt> - No!
- Kill it first, kill it! </garnt>
<connor> - No! Who cares? </connor>
<connor> - Kill it before you
fucking burn it to death </connor>
<garnt> and give it a few minutes of agony. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - This is how vegans are born. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> This really is how vegans are born. </joey>
<joey> - This guy is the same guy who
would sit there and be like, </joey>
<joey> "It doesn't taste fresh enough. </joey>
<connor> Let me murder the cow myself. </connor>
<connor> Let me grab the meat
from inside its loins." </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> If I know that I'm just
gonna witness a murder </garnt>
<garnt> before a meal, I'm like,
okay, let me prepare </garnt>
<garnt> myself for this.
- I'm pretty sure </garnt>
<connor> they can't feel pain though, or anything. </connor>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure they can't feel pain. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know if they
can feel pain or not, </garnt>
<garnt> That's beside the point
that I'm trying to make. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know if they feel pain, </joey>
<garnt> but I'll still always remember, </garnt>
<garnt> more than the flavor
of that abalone we had </garnt>
<garnt> at that ryokan, is his face. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It was incredible. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like you witnessed
a box of kittens die. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just a fucking abalone! </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I have never seen
any fucking living being </garnt>
<garnt> just squirm right in front of my face </garnt>
<garnt> as I'm about to eat it, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> You can see the realization
on my face when I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Ha-ha, we're grilling meat. </garnt>
<joey> Oh, it's moving. </joey>
<joey> Why? Why is it moving?" </joey>
<joey> I remember asking you guys,
"Why is this thing moving? </joey>
<joey> Is this alive?" </joey>
<joey> - And then I straight up
said, "Yeah, it's alive." </joey>
<connor> - I'm just like, "Oh, it's alive." </connor>
<connor> I'm just watching something being killed. </connor>
<connor> - It didn't look very
appetizing, I will say. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause isn't it referred to as a pussy? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause it looks like one. </joey>
<joey> - It does look like a
bit of a vagina, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It does, yeah, 'cause they- </joey>
<joey> - Abalone just does look </joey>
<joey> like a pussy.
- They have a nickname </joey>
<connor> for in Japan where like,
men call it something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, really?
- Yeah, I think some Japanese </connor>
<connor> told me that, yeah, it's
famous for looking like it. </connor>
<connor> So it doesn't look appetizing enough. </connor>
<connor> And then it dies in front of you. </connor>
<connor> - Imagine a squirming vagina on- </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> on a grill. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna get monetized, Joey, goddammit. </connor>
<joey> - You're the one that brought
up the fucking vagina, </joey>
<joey> I didn't even know that shit! </joey>
<connor> - But two of those words together </connor>
<joey> in combination sound disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - What, squirming vagina? </joey>
<joey> - Joey, stop! </joey>
<connor> Sabrina, can you fucking
sensor that shit, please? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Do we have any other food
topics? Anything else? </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to think of,
there's gotta be something else </connor>
<joey> before we end this. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of Japanese food out there </joey>
<joey> that I feel just gets
completely swept under the rug. </joey>
<joey> Because, again, the
whole Western perception </joey>
<joey> is ramen and sushi, that's it. </joey>
<joey> That's all Japan has to offer. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okonomiyaki is okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Okonomiyaki is like- </garnt>
<garnt> - You take that back, motherfucker! </garnt>
<connor> You fucking take that shit back! </connor>
<joey> - Okonomiyaki is like a
good pasta in Elsewhere. </joey>
<joey> It's like a carb, filling and it's very, </joey>
<joey> you can't really get mad
at pasta most of the time. </joey>
<connor> That's okonomiyaki. </connor>
<joey> - You're saying a lot of shit </joey>
<joey> for someone in slap distance. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> At least Garnt is on the
other side of the table, </garnt>
<joey> but I can just fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Okonomiyaki, which is, how
do I explain okonomiyaki? </joey>
<joey> - It's a savory pancake. </joey>
<connor> - That's exactly my point,
it's just a savory pancake. </connor>
<connor> And it looks better than it tastes. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you see okonomiyaki </connor>
<garnt> and it's like the fucking
"Shokugeki" food porn. </garnt>
<garnt> You could, you could watch this thing </garnt>
<garnt> and jack off to it, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> But when you actually
eat it, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Ah, this is... </garnt>
<garnt> This should be up on a fucking painting." </garnt>
<joey> - I'm offended, I quit this podcast. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> just because I've never heard anyone, </garnt>
<connor> every time I've taken
someone from overseas </connor>
<connor> to an okonomiyaki place, </connor>
<connor> they've had the "Food Wars" experience. </connor>
<connor> - It's just street food though. </connor>
<garnt> - It is a street food, but it's probably </garnt>
<connor> the best street food you can have. </connor>
<connor> I will happily take an
okonomiyaki over a yakisoba. </connor>
<connor> In my opinion. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe...
- No, I'd take a yakisoba. </garnt>
<garnt> - As much as I love yakisoba as well, </garnt>
<connor> don't get me wrong, all
street food is great. </connor>
<joey> Okay, so then, I will- </joey>
<connor> - It's all kind of meh-tier for me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because it's B-grade food. </joey>
<connor> It's street food, of course
it's not gonna be like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh my god, this is the
best meal I've ever had." </joey>
<joey> It's just there to fill your stomach. </joey>
<connor> - In no world, if a Matsuya is nearby, </connor>
<connor> am I not gonna choose- </connor>
<joey> - Matsuya is the
definition of B-grade food, </joey>
<connor> what are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> It's the king of </connor>
<connor> B-grade.
- The only difference between </connor>
<joey> Matsuya and street food is
that Matsuya has a logo. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> That's the only difference! </connor>
<joey> - It's comfortable, man, it's comfortable. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, sure, I saw a cockroach run </joey>
<joey> across the floor one time. </joey>
<connor> I don't give a fuck,
the food tastes amazing. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so then if Matsuya
started making yakisoba </joey>
<connor> and okonomiyaki, would you eat it? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - Well then what the
fuck's the difference? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause dude, the beef bowls. </joey>
<connor> If we're talking B-grade food in Japan, </connor>
<connor> beef bowls and pork bowls are the king. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> But you're not gonna get </joey>
<connor> a beef bowl-
- I rest my case, gentlemen. </connor>
<garnt> - But you're not gonna get
a beef bowl and a pork bowl </garnt>
<connor> at a fucking summer festival. </connor>
<connor> You're gonna get an okonomiyaki </connor>
<joey> or a yakisoba or teppenyaki. </joey>
<joey> - When I get to summer festival, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, this is sick. </joey>
<connor> Google maps, where's the nearest Matsuya?" </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I never want to go to a
summer festival with you. </garnt>
<garnt> We're just gonna end up
in a fucking Matsuya. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I remember when we went, </connor>
<joey> I think Aki got all the
fucking weird seafood? </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh, that's cool, that's cool." </garnt>
<connor> Let's go to a restaurant. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - As the certified
Japanese person here, Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I am now. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm the certified Japanese
person of "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<joey> That's all I am. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, why is anyone taking
my opinion on food, I'm white. </connor>
<garnt> - What are the Japanese
dishes that people should know </garnt>
<garnt> outside of just ramen and sushi and, </garnt>
<garnt> now we've mentioned tsukemen? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel that,
again, it's a lot of like, </joey>
<connor> I mean, we've already
touched upon a lot of them, </connor>
<connor> like tsukemen is one, sukiyaki
is definitely another one. </connor>
<connor> - Yakitori? </connor>
<joey> - Yakitori, just a lot of, oh
shit, a lot of street food. </joey>
<joey> Just B-grade street food. </joey>
<joey> You know, as much as you
guys say that it's mid, </joey>
<joey> I reckon not enough
people try okonomiyaki- </joey>
<joey> - Here's the thing
- Oh, I will, I will, </joey>
<connor> - I will destroy an
okonomiyaki, don't get me wrong, </connor>
<connor> but I'm not gonna feel happy about it. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's the thing, right. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like moving to
Japan has just completely </garnt>
<garnt> shifted my perception
of what good food is, </garnt>
<garnt> because you gave me this shit
when I come from England, </garnt>
<garnt> everything's S-tier. </garnt>
<connor> Everything in Japan is S-tier compared </connor>
<connor> to what you can get England,
and then you live here, </connor>
<garnt> you're like, "Man, there's
different tiers of S-tier." </garnt>
<joey> - There's like a single S-tier,
there's a triple S-tier. </joey>
<joey> - I saw an article
shared around on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> It was basically why does
Japan and Switzerland </joey>
<joey> have such a high baseline
for what should be standard? </joey>
<joey> In terms of just everything in life? </joey>
<joey> Especially food, just public
transport, daily living. </joey>
<joey> Just everything in life has
such a high minimum requirement </joey>
<joey> in Japan. </joey>
<joey> In the UK, it's like I
could pay a 100 pounds </joey>
<joey> and get a fucking garbage meal. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - In Japan, it's just not gonna happen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- If you pay more </joey>
<joey> than normal here, you will
just get something good. </joey>
<joey> - You'll get an experience. </joey>
<joey> - I've never gone to a restaurant here </joey>
<joey> where I paid more than the
baseline and been disappointed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And even then, like I said,
the Matsuyas and the chains </joey>
<joey> and the really average stuff, it's so good </joey>
<joey> that anywhere you go in Japan
if you're not from here, </joey>
<joey> you'll probably be
really satisfied with it. </joey>
<joey> And fuck, it must be awful being Japanese </joey>
<joey> and traveling overseas and being like, </joey>
<joey> "Wait, this restaurant was shit. </joey>
<joey> I just paid a 100 pounds
and it was garbage." </joey>
<joey> - How is this legal? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> They know it's shit, right? </joey>
<connor> Yeah, of course they do. </connor>
<joey> - They don't give a shit though. </joey>
<connor> They don't give a shit, they don't care. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know, it's
just really interesting. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, that is the
baseline I think of why, </connor>
<connor> when anyone asks you what
is your favorite thing </connor>
<garnt> about Japan?, I'm sure
we can all agree that </garnt>
<garnt> it's probably top three of food. </garnt>
<garnt> - The food, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The food is amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - I knew I was gonna like
the anime or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<connor> And yeah, is hambagu on its own </connor>
<garnt> a devastation to hamburgers worldwide? </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, it is, but is it
still gonna be better </joey>
<joey> than any other country that does it? </joey>
<joey> Honestly, yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it will. </joey>
<connor> - It's gonna be better,
I'll admit that much. </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing is that
I think a lot of people </joey>
<joey> who haven't come to
Japan will know nothing </joey>
<joey> about the Japanese food culture here </joey>
<joey> think that when people say the
food is just better in Japan, </joey>
<joey> I think people just quick to be like, </joey>
<garnt> oh, they think Japanese
food is better in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Of course it is. </garnt>
<joey> No, no, every food is better in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Let me just tell you like this. </joey>
<joey> It just don't miss, okay? </joey>
<garnt> No matter where you go in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter where you go
in Japan, you don't miss. </garnt>
<connor> - And even foreign foods, </connor>
<connor> Italian food has such
a unique flavor here, </connor>
<connor> but in a really good way. </connor>
<joey> The way I see it is Italian food in Japan </joey>
<joey> is the way that New
York pizza is to pizza. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's a totally different take on it </joey>
<connor> that's still really good.
- It still works, </connor>
<connor> it still works.
- It's really good. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like it's the same way </connor>
<joey> with a lot of the food
that they have here. </joey>
<joey> And so when people ask,
"Oh, can you get authentic?" </joey>
<joey> It might not be authentic,
but who the fuck gives a shit </joey>
<connor> if it's authentic? </connor>
<joey> If it tastes good, it's
amazing, who cares? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, we've recently found
an Indian curry restaurant. </joey>
<connor> - It's very authentic. </connor>
<connor> - It's authentic and it was
also still really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - Amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Destroyed my fucking stomach, </connor>
<connor> like a proper Indian should. </connor>
<connor> - The naan was perfect naan, amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - If I'm waking up the next day </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm not destroying my fucking toilet, </garnt>
<connor> that's not a proper Indian. </connor>
<connor> - It's not a good curry. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not a proper Indian. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna be doubting
it every single moment </joey>
<joey> til it's in my mouth. </joey>
<connor> Then I'm like, I made the right decision. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, if I wake up in the morning </joey>
<joey> and I don't know if
it's a fart or a shart, </joey>
<joey> that's how you know it's
a good curry, right? </joey>
<connor> - And that's been that episode of </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Hey, let's say
thank you to all the patrons </joey>
<joey> who help make this show come to life. </joey>
<garnt> - I will say if you ever do come to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> please get a hambagu, just so
you can finish this debate. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Honestly, just
give anything a go. </joey>
<garnt> - Maylene pointed something
out to us before we end, unagi. </garnt>
<garnt> Unagi is god tier.
- Eel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god, oh my god. </garnt>
<joey> Something we all agree on. </joey>
<garnt> Do we all agree on? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, eat the unagi, eat the unagi. </garnt>
<joey> - Unagi is, you explain. </joey>
<connor> - Unagi is like a boiled
eel and then it's grilled </connor>
<joey> in this beautiful sauce. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't even know how to describe it. </joey>
<joey> And they just serve it on the rice and, </joey>
<connor> don't get me wrong, it's
very expensive, it is. </connor>
<connor> - But it is worth the price. </connor>
<connor> - It's a summer food and it is, </connor>
<connor> you eat it and you feel clean, </connor>
<connor> you feel happy, but you're
getting that fillingness </connor>
<garnt> that you get from other stuff. </garnt>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so weird, 'cause eating Unagi </garnt>
<garnt> is in the middle of eating fish and meat. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't explain it. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels like a fish, but
it is filling like a meat. </garnt>
<garnt> - It sits like a meat. </garnt>
<connor> - It sits like a meat. </connor>
<connor> - Eel sounds like something that </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of Westerners,
I know if you told me eel, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, "I don't wanna eat eel." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it, it falls apart, it
doesn't taste fishy at all. </connor>
<connor> It's so good and yeah,
okay, it's expensive. </connor>
<connor> I think when we went to one- </connor>
<connor> - We went to a really fancy one </connor>
<joey> where you paid 60 bucks for one. </joey>
<connor> - I paid fucking 68 bucks for an eel. </connor>
<connor> I know that's too much,
I know that's a lot. </connor>
<connor> But my brain just turned off. </connor>
<joey> I didn't look at the price, </joey>
<joey> I wanted the large one,
give me the large one. </joey>
<joey> It was two and a half eels
of this and I was like </joey>
<joey> (moans)
- It was really fucking good. </joey>
<connor> It was really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - And this rush is so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> And if you come here during the summer, </connor>
<connor> I highly recommend it. </connor>
<connor> I think it is by far the
best summer food in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Easily.
- I don't think there's </garnt>
<garnt> anything close to it. </garnt>
<connor> Winter food, a lot of
heavyweight contenders, bro, </connor>
<connor> but in the summer, I
think unagi's the king. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I agree.
- So in summation, </garnt>
<garnt> if you ever come to Japan,
apart from the usual </garnt>
<garnt> of ramen and sushi that
you're gonna try anyway </garnt>
<garnt> regardless of what we said- </garnt>
<connor> - You can still get it in the winter. </connor>
<joey> - Get unagi, you can never
go wrong with that; tsukemen. </joey>
<joey> - We need more people
in the cult of tsukemen. </joey>
<garnt> I need to build this cult! </garnt>
<garnt> - The cult of tsukemen! </garnt>
<connor> - Sashimi, get sashimi. </connor>
<joey> - This is the only cult that
you'll thank me later for. </joey>
<garnt> - For me, don't get curry, no
matter where you get curry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you can get curry.
- Try it, try it, just try it. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you've never tried
curry before, try it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Japanese curry.
- Japanese curry, </garnt>
<connor> but if you've have tried Curry before, </connor>
<garnt> to me, it's gonna taste exactly
the same as everywhere else. </garnt>
<garnt> - Soba, try soba, some health noodles. </garnt>
<garnt> - Try soba. </garnt>
<connor> - Udon, just to confirm you don't like it. </connor>
<joey> - Bottom line, there's
way more to Japanese food </joey>
<garnt> than ramen and sushi. </garnt>
<garnt> There's so much more </garnt>
<joey> and I guarantee everything you'll try here </joey>
<joey> is either gonna be some
kind of positive experience </joey>
<joey> or just something life changing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, before we end it, </connor>
<connor> I wanna say that when you eat food here, </connor>
<connor> you almost wanna cry because you just feel </connor>
<connor> like someone cares. </connor>
<connor> You feel like someone really cared. </connor>
<garnt> - I almost did cry when
I fucking ate tsukemen! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> We've already talked about that! </garnt>
<garnt> - All the food you're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Fuck man, someone really fucking </connor>
<connor> cared about the quality here." </connor>
<connor> And if that doesn't make you
tear up every single time </connor>
<connor> you have a bite of food, I
don't know what will, man. </connor>
<garnt> - I never thought I fucking
almost cry over fucking noodles, </garnt>
<garnt> but here I was. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and it's the
same thing like fruit. </connor>
<joey> They have that saying of the
reason why it's so expensive </joey>
<joey> is because so much love is put into it. </joey>
<joey> You do really feel, I
know it's cheesy as fuck </joey>
<joey> and I think it's dumb as
fuck when they say it, </joey>
<connor> but when you eat that food, you do feel </connor>
<connor> like every single step of
the process, everyone cares. </connor>
<connor> - For some reason it's just </connor>
<connor> a marketing ploy everywhere else, </connor>
<joey> but in Japan, you actually
genuinely feel like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, yeah, it might be." </joey>
<connor> - You feel the love. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you feel like it's pride. </connor>
<garnt> There's so much pride in
every single piece of food </garnt>
<garnt> that you eat and you can just taste it. </garnt>
<garnt> And just honestly, when you
come here, go on Google Maps, </garnt>
<garnt> If it's over four stars,
it's gonna be amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> I guarantee it, just go
everywhere, trust me. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause they are fucking </garnt>
<connor> strict with their ratings.
- 'Cause when you compliment </connor>
<garnt> the chefs, they actually appreciate that. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the only place
where I've actually </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to be like do the
meme where it's like, </garnt>
<joey> can you call the chef over? </joey>
<joey> - I need to shake his hand </joey>
<joey> or something.
- I gotta shake </joey>
<garnt> this mans' hand, man. </garnt>
<connor> This man's done a masterpiece. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like if I ever
get the opportunity, </garnt>
<garnt> I thank the chef, like, </garnt>
<joey> (speaks Japanese) </joey>
<garnt> I think that's everything
we wanted to talk about. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't believe the most
heated podcast we've ever had- </garnt>
<joey> - Was about fucking meat. </joey>
<joey> - Was about meat. </joey>
<garnt> - Remember how this conversation started </garnt>
<joey> with me being pescatarian? </joey>
<garnt> - This made the school days debate </garnt>
<garnt> like baby mode, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I just feel like it should
never have been a debate, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just not even a point. </connor>
<connor> - Hey, you know what? </connor>
<joey> You can start the debate
over in the comments. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna love looking through those. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Or you can do it on our
Twitter or subreddit, which is, </joey>
<joey> as always, down in the description below. </joey>
<joey> So meme the fuck out of
our heated meat argument. </joey>
<connor> - Will you beat our meat argument? </connor>
<garnt> - That was awful, I feel bad for laughing. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you for all the
Patreons, you are amazing. </connor>
