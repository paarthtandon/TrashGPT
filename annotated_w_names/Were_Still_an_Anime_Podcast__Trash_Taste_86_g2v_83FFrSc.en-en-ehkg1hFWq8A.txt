<connor> - Dinosaur before. - We never </connor>
<connor> - got to taste a dinosaur. </connor>
<connor> Like a T-Rex probably tasted great. </connor>
<connor> - Nah, T-Rex would be gamey as (beep). </connor>
<garnt> Are you (beep)ing kidding me? </garnt>
<garnt> - Velociraptor is like... </garnt>
<joey> - Good sized, you know, too muscular though. </joey>
<joey> - That's true, that would be too tough. </joey>
<joey> - What's the (beep)in' long neck (beep) that, uh... </joey>
<joey> (engaging tones) </joey>
<garnt> Gamers, gamers, gamers. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember whenever that like message came up </joey>
<joey> in the cinemas, it like always just scared me. </joey>
<connor> - What message? </connor>
<garnt> - That you wouldn't steal a car. </garnt>
<connor> - Why would that... - Cinemas? </connor>
<garnt> - Why would that become like the standard? </garnt>
<garnt> Why did everyone use that one? </garnt>
<joey> - What, that you wouldn't steal a car? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that one, why did that become the one that... </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that's the argument that, </joey>
<connor> 'cause it was the easiest to like, explain. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like why did everyone </garnt>
<garnt> just take that exact video clip </garnt>
<connor> and use it in everything, like why? </connor>
<joey> - No, because, did you, were you grow... </joey>
<joey> Did you grow up in the Blockbuster era, or like the... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I got games mainly from Blockbuster. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so basically why that became a meme </joey>
<joey> is because at the start of every movie </joey>
<joey> that you rent from, like Blockbuster or anything, </joey>
<joey> that one message would show up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I know that, but then like, what? </connor>
<connor> It was also in like non-Blockbuster things, </connor>
<garnt> like why did that video, that thing, </garnt>
<garnt> get just used everywhere? </garnt>
<garnt> Why did everyone agree this was </garnt>
<garnt> the best? - Wasn't it </garnt>
<connor> Blockbuster videos? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, it was... </connor>
<garnt> - Because for me, it played </garnt>
<garnt> before every movie at the cinema. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, every movie ever had it, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I didn't see it in movies. </garnt>
<garnt> - I only know it from the cinemas. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, I only know it from like rental stuff. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> "Twilight Zone" </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to subject of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> That's a strange topic that we didn't mean </connor>
<joey> to get on, but welcome. </joey>
<connor> I'm your host Connor with the boys, Joey and Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Hello, as we've established, the host means nothing now </joey>
<joey> as someone on the Trash Taste, Reddit pointed out. </joey>
<connor> - I explained to them, I was like, on my last show, </connor>
<connor> I was like, listen, you don't understand. </connor>
<garnt> You get power when you're on the solo seat. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get space. </garnt>
<garnt> - You do, yeah. - You do. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how to explain it. </garnt>
<joey> You just get like a feeling that your like, </joey>
<joey> I'm the host. - I'm in control. </joey>
<connor> - I'm in the conversation. </connor>
<connor> - Like every time when I hosted before </connor>
<connor> and there was a guest on, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, well that's my hosting privileges gone </connor>
<connor> 'cause I gotta take care of the guest. </connor>
<connor> I'm on babysitter mode now. </connor>
<connor> - Now you're in the beta seat. </connor>
<connor> I hate that seat the most. - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I'm furthest away from everything. </connor>
<connor> Hi, guys, hi, host, hey, like across, you know. </connor>
<joey> - It's not that bad. - I know, I know. </joey>
<joey> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </joey>
<joey> A part of me just feels like I like these two seats. </joey>
<joey> - I like that seat. - I like this seat, too. </joey>
<joey> (talking over each other and laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'm the only one that's literally never given a (beep). </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, we're still sitting at the same table. </garnt>
<joey> - Something about it just, you know, feels different. </joey>
<garnt> - It's differently. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like getting like the front seat in the car, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> You are the alpha male. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you, five years old. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, you are. - Shotgun! </connor>
<garnt> - Gotta get - Every time we go on </garnt>
<garnt> - the booster seat, too. - a road trip, </garnt>
<connor> Joey's the one that shotguns </connor>
<joey> the front seat every (beep)in' time, I swear to God. </joey>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Appreciate it because he can read the signs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm doing it for the driver, all right. </joey>
<connor> - There's more responsibility for me. </connor>
<garnt> You can chill in the back of the car. </garnt>
<connor> - The front seat's only good if the driver </connor>
<garnt> is also really confident because if the driver's confident </garnt>
<garnt> then he's not gonna bother you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but if the driver's not confident, </garnt>
<garnt> then he's gonna bug you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can you look at the map? </garnt>
<joey> Actually, can you change the song? </joey>
<garnt> Can we can stop? It's like, no, </garnt>
<garnt> but if the driver chatty, he's like... </garnt>
<connor> - But even if... - I drive. </connor>
<garnt> - But even if it's a confident driver, right, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna be the one guy who's like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> someone in the back's gonna be like, </garnt>
<garnt> can you turn up the AC? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, fine, I'm (beep)in' in a hurry, whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - This is why I feel sorry for any short person </joey>
<joey> who is on a group road trip, right, </joey>
<joey> because here's the thing, here's the thing. </joey>
<joey> No matter what, no matter what we think, </joey>
<joey> no matter what we think is the best seat in the car, </joey>
<joey> we can all unanimously agree that the worst seat </joey>
<joey> is the middle seat in the back, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - And who always gets that? </joey>
<joey> It's the short person because they take up the least space. </joey>
<joey> Cause I can always be like, look guys, I'm a bit tall. </joey>
<joey> Can I get at least get one of the side seats? </joey>
<joey> And everyone's like, all right guys, I understand. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like... </joey>
<garnt> - I love how the people throw in that argument </garnt>
<connor> as if like the one that is in the middle seat </connor>
<connor> has more leg room or something. </connor>
<garnt> We all have the same amount of leg room, so it's like... </garnt>
<connor> - You're like worrying about invading two people's </connor>
<garnt> leg rooms as opposed to just regarding your own. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, is that the loathe? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so, but also it doesn't really have to do </garnt>
<garnt> that much with height, surely it's... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's about width, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah </garnt>
<joey> - You could be like... - What if it's like </joey>
<joey> Eric Cartman, right? </joey>
<joey> Eric Cartman is like wider than he thought, like... </joey>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<connor> - Like where's he gonna sit? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and for me it's always like </connor>
<garnt> it's it's whoever has like the smaller stature </garnt>
<joey> that sits in the middle. - The stature, </joey>
<garnt> - Which a lot of the times </garnt>
<joey> happens to be the shortest person. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's true. - Right? </joey>
<garnt> - But there are some like short, </garnt>
<joey> thick people out there in the world, </joey>
<garnt> so like where do they sit? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure they are, but I'm just saying </joey>
<joey> every time, because I'm always that person </joey>
<joey> that forgets like shotgun the front seat, </joey>
<joey> so I'm just like, if I can't get in the front seat, </joey>
<joey> there's no way in hell I'm getting the middle seat. </joey>
<garnt> - You'll catch me dead </garnt>
<connor> before I'm in the middle seat. - Yeah, you'll catch me dead </connor>
<connor> before I'm in the middle seat. </connor>
<garnt> - You'll catch me in the mood. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you want me to take the middle seat? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, okay, well, oh I guess these long legs </garnt>
<joey> have no space to sit. </joey>
<joey> Oh, let me just, let me just, </joey>
<connor> lemme just man spread as much. </connor>
<joey> Lemme just man spread as much as possible </joey>
<joey> so you can regret this decision </joey>
<joey> of putting me in the middle seat. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt's polite enough though. </connor>
<connor> If you're like, Garnt, get in the middle seat. </connor>
<connor> Don't be like, all right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But it depends </connor>
<garnt> on the length of a journey. </garnt>
<connor> If it's a short journey, I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> I'll take the middle. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't... - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Even on a short trip, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want the middle. </garnt>
<connor> - Like an hour in the middle. </connor>
<connor> I can do an hour in the middle. </connor>
<connor> - An hour's short? - Yes. </connor>
<connor> I'd say like four hours where it gets like long. </connor>
<garnt> - Four hours, you can throw me in the trunk, man. </garnt>
<connor> I'll have a better time in there. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> Like, it's the middle seat, especially. </joey>
<joey> It's not just like the least comfortable. </joey>
<joey> It's just the one that induces the most motion sickness </joey>
<joey> for me as well 'cause... </joey>
<connor> - No, I don't get motion sickness. </connor>
<connor> - The problem with the middle seat is that </connor>
<joey> it's always got like the (beep)tiest seatbelt, right? </joey>
<garnt> Like, what... - That's the bulk.. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the waist-only one, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's it's the waist-only one </joey>
<joey> so it feels like the top half just like has less, </joey>
<connor> what's the word I'm looking for, like support. </connor>
<connor> It has less support, right? </connor>
<connor> You're nice and snug. - And that </connor>
<joey> makes you motion sick? </joey>
<garnt> - Kind of like a lot of things make me </garnt>
<garnt> motion sick. - Garnt's one of those people </garnt>
<garnt> who literally needs to be like (beep)in' straight-jacketed </garnt>
<garnt> into the seat to be like no motion sickness for me. </garnt>
<garnt> The other thing as well is a lot of the times </garnt>
<garnt> the middle seat doesn't have a headrest as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So a lot part of the thing that helps me </garnt>
<garnt> with motion sickness is having something to rest my head on. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds like a tall person problem. </garnt>
<garnt> - It very much is a tall person problem. </garnt>
<joey> Either I get motion sickness or I just have like </joey>
<connor> massive whiplash from just like trying </connor>
<joey> to lie like this for like two hours. </joey>
<joey> Then after saying all of that can you really </joey>
<garnt> fault me for shotgunning the front seat, </garnt>
<garnt> clearly so I can avoid (beep)in' sitting </garnt>
<garnt> like this for the entire trip, right? </garnt>
<joey> - That's why short people deserve to be in the middle. </joey>
<garnt> - It is your right as a short person </garnt>
<connor> to take a bullet for the team, no headrest for you. </connor>
<joey> - No headrest for you, you don't need a headrest. </joey>
<joey> You're short enough as it is. </joey>
<connor> I need a headrest, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt hates short people, confirmed. </connor>
<connor> He wants them all to sit in the middle seat </connor>
<connor> for the rest of time. </connor>
<joey> - This is the birth of heightism. </joey>
<connor> - Heightism, is that a thing, is that a thing? </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe, probably, if you're on Tinder. </garnt>
<connor> - You can't call them short. </connor>
<connor> That's gonna end up being derogatory </connor>
<connor> at one point of our lives. - That's true. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause everything ends up being derogatory. </garnt>
<connor> - Also, there's no clear definition </connor>
<garnt> for when somebody becomes short. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly, right. - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Vertically challenged. </garnt>
<garnt> That's that's all we have to start using from now on. </garnt>
<connor> - I hate that, it's so dumb. - Don't call them short. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, at which point? </joey>
<joey> What is the cut-off for short? </joey>
<garnt> Well, it depends how tall you are. </garnt>
<connor> - Also how self-conscious you are. </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] Depends on where you are as well. </connor>
<connor> - Some guys say anything below six foot, you're a dwarf. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but then again, it's like... </garnt>
<joey> - Who says that? </joey>
<connor> - I say that. - Insecure men, I think. </connor>
<connor> They're like... - It depends. </connor>
<connor> I think the definition of short </connor>
<garnt> is dependent on like your point of reference, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Also the country that you are in, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If you're from Netherlands. </garnt>
<joey> - Then everyone here is short. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel like an average sized human being in the UK. </joey>
<joey> And then I moved to like Thailand </joey>
<joey> and like the toilets come up to my shins. </joey>
<joey> That's that's that's like the bigger indicator </joey>
<joey> of when I go to like Thailand, I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> I think Japan's like kind of the same when I go </joey>
<joey> into the public toilets and normally like, </joey>
<joey> it goes up to like my knees. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then the toilets there go up to my shins. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, what, what is this? </joey>
<joey> What is this country? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - There's some Japanese high school kids </connor>
<garnt> that are (beep)in' massive. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've noticed. - Walk on the train. </garnt>
<connor> They'll be like six-foot-five. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh my God. - I've kind of noticed </connor>
<garnt> that like I feel that when I first moved here </garnt>
<garnt> or even earlier than that, </garnt>
<connor> everyone around me was shorter than me. </connor>
<connor> But nowadays, like, as you said, </connor>
<connor> there are like seven feet tall high school kids. </connor>
<connor> - It's nuts. - It's like hat happened? </connor>
<garnt> The entire country just had like a growth spurt. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. - 'Cause I remember. </joey>
<joey> I remember, like... - Anecdotal, but I mean. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, it's certainly anecdotal, </joey>
<joey> but I remember at one point when I was in high school, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I basically, I reckon I stopped growing </connor>
<connor> like around 16, 17, right? </connor>
<connor> - I'm still growing (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> I'm still growing. - Are you? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, I'm not. </joey>
<joey> - I personally stopped growing at around like 16, 17, </joey>
<joey> so right before I graduated high school, </joey>
<joey> and I remember there was one time where I was </joey>
<connor> on an absolutely packed train in Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> and I was like a (beep)in' Q-Tip </connor>
<connor> in a field of like cotton swabs. </connor>
<connor> It was just me and then it's just like a sea of heads. </connor>
<connor> But nowadays I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I get in a packed train and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> everyone around me is the same height as me. </joey>
<joey> Like what happened? </joey>
<joey> - Why am I Beta now. </joey>
<joey> - Is everyone like wearing (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I thought I was the only one. </garnt>
<joey> - Joey thought he was built different, </joey>
<garnt> but he's built the exact same as everyone else. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, I'm exclusively in the six-foot club. </garnt>
<joey> Now everyone is in the six-foot club. </joey>
<joey> - Well, aside from Connor. </joey>
<joey> - Except for Connor. - Aside from Connor. </joey>
<joey> As is evident in like every photo we take. </joey>
<joey> It's surprising about we've taken this many photos </joey>
<garnt> and we still get the same... </garnt>
<garnt> We still get the same three comments </garnt>
<garnt> every (beep)in' time which is... </garnt>
<garnt> - Asians are taller than white people, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't expect Connor to be the shortest, </garnt>
<joey> which Connor's not a short guy. </joey>
<garnt> Connor's not short, that's the thing. </garnt>
<connor> - You're not a short dude (talking over each other) </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like the Mr. Incredible meme right now. </garnt>
<joey> You guys are like happy. </joey>
<joey> I'm like the (beep)in' pain. </joey>
<joey> I'm not short, I'm tall. </joey>
<connor> I'm 5'10". </connor>
<garnt> - But the thing is, but the thing is you're not short. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't really... - Especially in this country. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't feel, I don't feel short. </joey>
<garnt> - No. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like you meet people, you're like, </garnt>
<connor> I am tiny on this earth. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, yeah, every time I go to the Netherlands, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, oh I am literally vertically challenged right now </joey>
<joey> compared to everyone else, but in Japan, </joey>
<joey> it's like, you know, you meet people </joey>
<joey> who are like three feet tall </joey>
<garnt> and they're living their lives normally, so I'm like good. </garnt>
<connor> (talking over each other) </connor>
<garnt> - Your so full, you're like why are you living? </garnt>
<garnt> (background noise drowns out other sounds) </garnt>
<joey> - Is it tough, is it tough? </joey>
<connor> - Why you, why are you doing this here? </connor>
<connor> Why, why give up, give up. </connor>
<joey> - How can you live? </joey>
<joey> - How is hard mode? </joey>
<garnt> How is hard mode going? </garnt>
<joey> - She had pogos for legs. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just kidding. </joey>
<garnt> My girlfriend is literally the shortest person I know, so. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know I don't really give a (beep) about height. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. - Eh, me neither. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's one of those things that people </garnt>
<connor> don't really care about, and when they do, I'm like why? </connor>
<garnt> - I've met people who are like, </garnt>
<garnt> I will only date someone unless they're like X. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the common thing, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, why, why though? </joey>
<joey> What are the privileges of being taller </joey>
<garnt> than a certain? - I get it. </garnt>
<connor> - You have a preference, right, you might like really, </connor>
<connor> I know guys who love taller women than them. </connor>
<garnt> They love women that are taller them, I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nothing against that, but like.. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess it's the wording, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Some girls just, </joey>
<joey> when they word it, I can understand why it hurts </joey>
<joey> some of those guys out there that are like, </joey>
<joey> I just wanted a break, man, </joey>
<joey> and then I'm just not six foot, </joey>
<connor> and I'm like it's all right, man, it's all right. </connor>
<connor> Don't worry about it, don't worry about it. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't get like why is it just that cut-off? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, it's just, I it's, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> It's always weird to me. </joey>
<joey> - I'm yet to meet a woman who was like, </joey>
<garnt> man, I want a man who's at least four feet tall. </garnt>
<joey> It's just every man be like, thank you, thank you. </joey>
<garnt> Inclusive. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> I think six foot sounds nice. </connor>
<joey> - Well, what about like 175 centimeters </joey>
<joey> or something? - No, doesn't have </joey>
<joey> the same ring to it. - 180 centimeters, that's... </joey>
<joey> I dunno, it's around the same, right? </joey>
<joey> What's what's six foot again? </joey>
<joey> - 180, I think. - 181, something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Sorry, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm exactly six foot, so whatever I am. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's start a new standard in metric. </joey>
<garnt> - Joey's like, phew, just made it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, I literally, I was like just scraped by. </garnt>
<garnt> - There is a God. </garnt>
<joey> - I grew two millimeters last year </joey>
<joey> and I just scraped by, what? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] 183 </joey>
<joey> - I'm not even six foot. </joey>
<joey> - I always thought I always thought six foot was 180. </joey>
<connor> - Joey, you're kinda looking mighty short right now, Joey. </connor>
<connor> You're kinda looking mighty short right now. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] It's technically 182.8, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, hold on. </garnt>
<garnt> I know what I am in centimeters, let me ask. </garnt>
<connor> - That's okay, it'll make your dick look bigger. </connor>
<connor> - Hey, Siri. </connor>
<garnt> Hey, Siri, (beep)in' Siri, wake up. </garnt>
<garnt> Hey, Siri. </garnt>
<garnt> What's 181.2 centimeters </garnt>
<joey> in feet and inches? - .2, throw in the .2. </joey>
<joey> I'm desperate. - Shut up. </joey>
<joey> - I'm desperate. - Shut up. </joey>
<garnt> - She picked up all that. </garnt>
<joey> - [Siri] The answer is 100 over 381. </joey>
<joey> - That's... </joey>
<joey> Hey, Siri. </joey>
<garnt> Hey, Siri, what's 181 centimeters in feet and inches? </garnt>
<joey> - Put it put up against the mic. </joey>
<joey> - [Siri] 181 centimeters is 5.94 feet. </joey>
<garnt> - 5.94, which that's what, 5'11", right? </garnt>
<joey> It's it's not 5'9". </joey>
<joey> It's 5.94 feet, which is five, </joey>
<joey> which means it's 5' 11? </joey>
<joey> How many feet, how many inches in a foot? </joey>
<joey> - But it's not... </joey>
<garnt> - But it's not six though. - But it's not six though. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's... - That's all that matters. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the important apart. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not six, which means you must be six. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I am six. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's the Chad kid. - How does that feel? </garnt>
<garnt> - How does that feel? </garnt>
<joey> - You're the real Chad, Joey, you're the real Chad. </joey>
<connor> - I thought you were a brother to me. </connor>
<joey> I thought I was a real Chad, I'm not. </joey>
<garnt> - You could have lied this whole time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I could have, I could've just said 183 </garnt>
<garnt> just to make myself feel better. </garnt>
<garnt> - You could've just spent this whole time lying, </garnt>
<joey> but now you've, now you've outed yourself </joey>
<connor> as not being confirmed six foot. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's all right. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I like my height, it's a comfortable height. </connor>
<connor> I see like people taller than me, and like, </connor>
<connor> I'm at the height where there are some things, </connor>
<connor> especially in Japan where it just gets a bit inconvenient. </connor>
<connor> But like, I like some buildings are like, </connor>
<connor> I need to like, just bob my head down a little bit. </connor>
<connor> I can't imagine what it's like </connor>
<connor> for someone who's like 6'5" or something </connor>
<garnt> like trying to live in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Could you imagine having to duck down </garnt>
<garnt> every time you go into a train? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, remember that toilet we went into in that one bar? </connor>
<connor> We found this toilet in this bar </connor>
<connor> and I posted a video on Twitter, </connor>
<connor> but like, it was like a closet. </connor>
<connor> It was like this tiny little door opened. </connor>
<connor> And you had to, no joke, like duck down </connor>
<connor> to like maybe four foot. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like the, it was like </garnt>
<garnt> (beep)in' Harry's room and (beep)in' forced for (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Where it's under the stairs. </connor>
<garnt> - It was crazy. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a toilet on the wall. </garnt>
<connor> I thought, the (beep), it looks like some, </connor>
<connor> like some kind of old 1800s charcoal storage room. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was like... </joey>
<connor> - It was literally like </connor>
<joey> out of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. </joey>
<garnt> That was like... </garnt>
<joey> - (talking over each other) and (beep). </joey>
<garnt> - The room wasn't that small, the room was quite big. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - It was. </garnt>
<joey> - But the door was comically small. </joey>
<connor> - But I liked that. </connor>
<connor> - That was... </connor>
<joey> - What so you could feel like a Hobbit? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, it just looked cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, it was unusual. </garnt>
<joey> We're talking about it now. </joey>
<garnt> - It was like the bar in Niseko. </garnt>
<joey> Remember the one where it was like </joey>
<joey> the fridge door to get in and you had, </joey>
<connor> everyone had to duck down to get into that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah that was cool though. - That was cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was cool. </garnt>
<garnt> There's something about having a crawl </garnt>
<garnt> to just take a (beep). </garnt>
<joey> It's like Shawshank Redemptionesque. </joey>
<joey> It kinda made me feel like... </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. - It wasn't that small. </joey>
<joey> - It was pretty... </joey>
<joey> I remember I had to like really... </joey>
<connor> - It wasn't a hole. - Like go like this. </connor>
<connor> Like get in and like. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And then I could get in. </joey>
<joey> I thought that was just like really small. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I thought it was like, </joey>
<joey> is there no regulations around door sizes in Japan? </joey>
<garnt> - No, apparently not. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sure in the UK we have some like kind of rule </garnt>
<joey> that's like the doors... - Why would there be? </joey>
<connor> Why would there be? </connor>
<connor> - Just for like, you know, </connor>
<connor> 'cause maybe it gets to the point </connor>
<connor> where you're like, all right, to get to the toilet, </connor>
<garnt> you have to climb through the vent. </garnt>
<connor> By the way, this is a Mission Impossible themed cafe. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, ah... </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it depends what you constitute as a door. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> What is it, like a cupboard? </garnt>
<joey> - What is a door? </joey>
<joey> - I felt like there were stretching </joey>
<joey> the definition of a door. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. - The same way like </joey>
<joey> if I were to open my no, no, no, not my </joey>
<joey> (background noise drowns out other sounds) . </joey>
<joey> Like if you open the fridge, no that's a fridge door. </joey>
<joey> - That's a fridge door. - It's a fridge door. </joey>
<connor> - It was about the same height as a fridge door </connor>
<joey> I would say. - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I would say so as well. </joey>
<connor> - Like a small fridge. </connor>
<connor> - It was just impressive. </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay, why not just like knock a bit </connor>
<connor> of the wall down and make a bigger door, like there's a... </connor>
<joey> - I could get what they, </joey>
<joey> They're just going for like a unique.. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think they would go the bar. </garnt>
<garnt> - To be fair, the bar itself was pretty small. </garnt>
<connor> It was like a, would you describe it like a diner? </connor>
<joey> - Like a diner kind of? </joey>
<garnt> There was one bar top and then there was like two or three, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like two, like three seater, like bar tops. </garnt>
<connor> - But it looked like the classic diner seats. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like the black and white. </garnt>
<connor> - It was just like some random bar </connor>
<joey> cause we were finding a place that was open. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I don't know why the toilet fit into the theme. </joey>
<joey> There was nothing to indicate </joey>
<joey> it was like a Hobbit theme or anything. </joey>
<joey> It was really strange, but you find this </joey>
<garnt> in Japan occasionally, just random places </garnt>
<garnt> with the weirdest toilets or doors. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause there's a diner in Shobara </garnt>
<garnt> that I go to a few times where the entrance to it </garnt>
<connor> is basically the toilet door. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Wow. </connor>
<joey> Well, it's maybe up to like here for me. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - On the street, mind you on the main street. </joey>
<joey> - What? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So people who walk in, you just see people </joey>
<garnt> (beep)in' (audio goes out) in on the main road. </garnt>
<joey> It's so weird. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you do see some strange toilets in Japan. </joey>
<joey> I remember like it's, sometimes it's just a strange layout </joey>
<joey> because I remember that one toilet, </joey>
<joey> I think you also that tweeted this one out as well, </joey>
<joey> which is I think we were like having dinner </joey>
<connor> with people from Netflix or something. </connor>
<connor> And there was this toilet in there </connor>
<connor> that was just in the corner. </connor>
<connor> And the lighting was like so ominous </connor>
<connor> that it felt like you would approach it Jojo-style. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. - You remember that? </connor>
<joey> - It was like diagonal. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was like diagonal. </joey>
<connor> - In this room, it was so weird. </connor>
<connor> - Just leading to this one toilet, </connor>
<joey> and all the lighting was just behind this one </joey>
<joey> this one toilet seat. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the toilet of the promised land. </garnt>
<connor> It's just like, oh. </connor>
<garnt> - Japan has that 'cause I feel like </garnt>
<connor> the restaurant comes first, then wherever the (beep) </connor>
<connor> they can fit the toilet and they do it. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, not that we can really talk. </garnt>
<garnt> We have a (beep)ing toilet over there </garnt>
<connor> that's in the corner as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's weird as well. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a weird toilet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But I know that there's like um, </connor>
<connor> oh, (beep), what is it. </connor>
<connor> Brain, I got... </connor>
<joey> - Brain. - Brain. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Brain commits suicide. </joey>
<joey> - I forgot what I was gonna say. </joey>
<connor> Ah, go ahead, talk. </connor>

<garnt> Back to the show. </garnt>
<joey> - How do you guys feel about just the different like themes </joey>
<joey> of like the restaurants you find here </joey>
<joey> because I feel like in Japan, </joey>
<joey> there are more like you, </joey>
<joey> there are more ways that you can find just like </joey>
<joey> really uniquely done like little cafes </joey>
<joey> or restaurants more than I've seen in like </joey>
<joey> basically where I came from or even London to me? </joey>
<joey> - I think more so bars, there's more themed bars </joey>
<joey> in general. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - There's a lot of bars. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bars and cafes mostly, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you look at some of these bars and you think, </joey>
<joey> how the (beep) do you stay in business, right, </joey>
<joey> because some of these bars are tiny. </joey>
<joey> It's like you think of a bar, at least in the UK </joey>
<joey> and America and you think it's a building, you know. </joey>
<joey> It's a building with a dedicated room </joey>
<joey> with tables and chairs, and that is the bar. </joey>
<joey> And some of these bars are just a countertop. </joey>
<garnt> - You're talking about the one we found the other night? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> The one that was literally the size of a hallway? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That was so weird going into the building. </connor>
<connor> Do you wanna tell a story? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so we basically, it was after </garnt>
<joey> the really short toilet bar, right. </joey>
<joey> And we were like, oh, we're feeling good. </joey>
<garnt> So, you know, it's been a while since the three of us </garnt>
<garnt> had like gone out to go drink and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> So we were like, let's go to this other place in Tokyo </garnt>
<joey> called Yokocho which has like a lot of like </joey>
<joey> small hidden bars and clubs </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that all over the place. </joey>
<joey> And by hidden, we mean like there's one road </joey>
<joey> that is just like covered. </joey>
<joey> There's like buildings that have like, you know, </joey>
<connor> maybe 20, 30 bars in it. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Over like six stories or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there were like maybe some like </connor>
<connor> six to 10-story buildings and they just had like, </connor>
<garnt> the signs were from the top to the bottom, </garnt>
<garnt> all like stacked and... - It's just like </garnt>
<connor> 30, 40... - Bars, bars, bars, bars. </connor>
<connor> - So we just like, let's just go into one of them. </connor>
<garnt> And the one we went into was like really like pristine </garnt>
<garnt> and like very like shiny and very like chic. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is weird 'cause outside of it, </connor>
<garnt> it looks like a normal apartment building. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And like really grimy. - You get off the elevator, </connor>
<connor> I think it was on like the fourth or fifth floor. </connor>
<connor> You get off the elevator and it's just this dark hallway. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like yellowish building color. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the doors are this horrible... </garnt>
<connor> (talking over each other) </connor>
<joey> - Any other country that is like a floor </joey>
<joey> where you would get stabbed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, there was like three </joey>
<joey> or four bars that were open there. </joey>
<joey> It was just like, let's just go into one of them. </joey>
<joey> We went in, it was really pristine, </joey>
<joey> like silver chic looking thing. </joey>
<garnt> And there was this like old lady at the end </garnt>
<garnt> that was like, you know, drinking something </garnt>
<garnt> really expensive, but yeah, the size of this place </garnt>
<garnt> was maybe what four people could sit at the bar? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - I think about six, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I remember there was a lady on one end </joey>
<garnt> and we were on the other end and there were like </garnt>
<garnt> two seats between us and the lady, </garnt>
<garnt> and that's all it could seat and that's it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the width was literally the size of a hallway. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - If that. </joey>
<garnt> - And they had three people running this bar </garnt>
<joey> for a bar that can seat six people. </joey>
<garnt> - There were just as many bar men behind the bar </garnt>
<joey> as there were people sitting at the bar. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - It was really odd 'cause we walked in there </garnt>
<joey> and it was like this woman, </joey>
<garnt> quite elderly woman in like a kimono </garnt>
<connor> Drinking, like Dom Perignon. </connor>
<garnt> - Clearly like a really important person </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. - Yeah, and like these </garnt>
<connor> three bartenders were like all caring for her </connor>
<garnt> like laughing at everything she was saying. </garnt>
<connor> And then we walked in, they kind of went like, </connor>
<connor> "What do you guys want?" </connor>
<joey> And we sat down like, "Can we have a beer?" </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Fine." </joey>
<joey> And they gave us like a bog-standard beer </joey>
<joey> from a glass that cost us $20 each. </joey>
<joey> To be fair though, we did eat like </joey>
<connor> all of their complimentary snacks. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they put out a lot of stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what the (beep) snack that was... </garnt>
<connor> - It was so good. - But it was so good </connor>
<garnt> whatever it was. </garnt>
<joey> - These weren't like your average bar snacks. </joey>
<joey> It was like premium stuff like dried fruits and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And every time we ate them they immediately refilled it. </joey>
<joey> And I started feeling really bad 'cause like we must have... </joey>
<joey> I saw them like opening new packs </joey>
<joey> and like reluctantly pouring more snacks for us. </joey>
<garnt> It was a cool bar, but it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> the atmosphere was like really weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't real weird, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Because then when the elderly woman left, </connor>
<garnt> like two of the bartenders followed her out </garnt>
<garnt> and just... - Yeah, yeah, yeah! </garnt>
<connor> And didn't come back. - And never came back. </connor>
<connor> - They might not even have worked at the bar. </connor>
<joey> They might have just been </joey>
<connor> her personal attendants, yeah. - Lackeys. </connor>
<connor> - Two of them, like one of them was in like a tuxedo. </connor>
<joey> He was quite elderly as well. </joey>
<joey> And he looked like, like the (beep)ing butler from Overlord. </joey>
<joey> Sebas Tian. - Sebas Tian </joey>
<joey> - Literally looked like him and there was this other guy, </joey>
<joey> and they left and then we were like they'll come back, </joey>
<joey> and they never, never came back. </joey>
<joey> But they all left at one point and left us in the bar, </joey>
<joey> just like alone for like five minutes and we were like </joey>
<joey> only in Japan would they leave the bar </joey>
<joey> with the customers still in there just to make sure </joey>
<joey> this like rich customer can go and do whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So strange, so strange. </joey>
<joey> - It was very weird. </joey>
<joey> - But like how do you think some of these bars </joey>
<joey> do stay in business if they... </joey>
<connor> - If there are rich customers that are regulars. </connor>
<connor> I know there's a big like regular, like, </connor>
<joey> what's the word? - Culture? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think it's very common </joey>
<garnt> to find a bar you like and just only go </garnt>
<garnt> to that bar. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I like to just constantly bar hop </joey>
<connor> and just see what else is there. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, me too, because like some of these bars that, </joey>
<joey> you know, you kind of like discover like this one, </joey>
<joey> but this is like one of like basically </joey>
<joey> every time we go out and discover a new place. </joey>
<joey> We go into one of these kinds of bar where it's like, </joey>
<joey> every time we go in the bar is like almost empty </joey>
<joey> or there's just like that one person </joey>
<joey> sitting in the corner like I remember when we went out </joey>
<joey> with Jan as well, it was just like the three of us </joey>
<connor> and one person in the corner, and it just was </connor>
<connor> one bartender who I saw. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, I... - Chill. </connor>
<connor> - He's just chill. </connor>
<connor> He's just enjoying his job, which is just a delight to see. </connor>
<connor> And you know, I get it. </connor>
<connor> That's why like, it's so weird to me </connor>
<connor> that tipping culture isn't a thing, </connor>
<connor> and yet bars like this are able to stay in business </connor>
<connor> because I can't imagine bars like this staying in business </connor>
<connor> if there wasn't a tipping culture, right? </connor>
<connor> Because the drinks were expensive, but they weren't like </connor>
<connor> ridiculously expensive to the point where </connor>
<garnt> one or two people can, in my mind at least, </garnt>
<garnt> run the entire bar economy and keep it afloat. </garnt>
<joey> So it just, it just, it just blows my mind. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I have a mate actually </garnt>
<garnt> who owns a bar in Saitama. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - Yeah, and like, </garnt>
<garnt> my hairdresser at the time was like friends with him </garnt>
<connor> so I got to know him through that, and he was just like, </connor>
<connor> and I was just like curious, 'cause I was like, </connor>
<connor> how many customers do you get? </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's kind of like in Saitama, first of all, </connor>
<garnt> which is like far away from Tokyo, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So there's less of a population to, you know, for customers. </garnt>
<garnt> But I'm like, it was also in like a really like hidden area. </garnt>
<connor> Like kind of similar to the one we went to, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, how many customers a night do you get? </connor>
<connor> And he was like, oh, like three or four on average. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - And I was like, how long are you open for? </connor>
<connor> And he is like, oh, like two days a week. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, and this is your only job? </connor>
<connor> He's like, yeah, all the other days </connor>
<connor> that I'm off, I go skiing. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, how, just like, </joey>
<joey> where does this money come from? </joey>
<joey> And he literally just said like </joey>
<joey> I get three to four customers, </joey>
<joey> but it's usually the same three or four customers </joey>
<joey> that just keep coming back and are there literally </joey>
<joey> from bar open to bar close. - Right. </joey>
<joey> Just because like they're his mates and this is like </joey>
<joey> the only time they get to hang out with him </joey>
<garnt> while he's working kind of thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Kinda kind cool, but sad at the same time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean he's enjoying it and you know, </connor>
<connor> it's still around and everything, </connor>
<connor> but it's just like really fascinating </connor>
<garnt> how you can just make that as a living. </garnt>
<connor> - It goes into like the other aspect of Japanese culture </connor>
<connor> that is very prevalent where they, they like predictability. </connor>
<joey> They like the same thing. </joey>
<joey> They want to know what's gonna happen </joey>
<joey> I guess for bar owner and customer. </joey>
<joey> It's good for that 'cause you get to go </joey>
<joey> to the same bar every day. </joey>
<joey> You get to know what you're gonna get. </joey>
<connor> And then if you're the owner, it's like great. </connor>
<connor> I know my customers. </connor>
<connor> I know they're gonna come and X, X, X. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I do think that like that's a really cool part </joey>
<joey> of bar culture in Japan is that you, like, </joey>
<connor> there are so many small little places </connor>
<connor> and there's like places that you would never be able to do </connor>
<connor> in any other country or at least </connor>
<connor> in any other country that I've lived in. </connor>
<connor> Because that kind of business model just wouldn't work. </connor>
<connor> You know, you have to have that dedication </connor>
<connor> of your regular customers, and even... </connor>
<connor> There has to be like, it's like kinda like </connor>
<connor> a symbiotic relationship, right, </connor>
<joey> that the customers always need to be there. </joey>
<joey> The customers come back knowing that they are the ones </joey>
<joey> that are keeping this bar in business </joey>
<joey> and they are the only ones, but I guess what I wanted </joey>
<joey> to know is like how do you establish yourself with that? </joey>
<joey> How do you? </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's literally just word of mouth at that point. </garnt>
<connor> - The turnover is so fast. </connor>
<connor> Like I know that restaurants and bars </connor>
<joey> close and open very fast in Japan. </joey>
<joey> So I imagine that a lot of them unfortunately fail. </joey>
<joey> Like ramen stores are like incredibly expensive </joey>
<connor> to start and operate. </connor>
<garnt> - It's also incredibly competitive. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - You can get ramen at any street corner. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. And then you just get destroyed by... </connor>
<garnt> (talking and laughing over each other) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you either get destroyed by a turnover </connor>
<joey> like a McDonald's, - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> like one of the mega corporations, but it's like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I literally think it's just like a mate, </connor>
<connor> like, you know, if one of your mates is like, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna start a bar in X location. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You'll be like, oh I'll come and check it out one night </joey>
<connor> and then you go tell your mates about it. </connor>
<connor> And then that friendship forms </connor>
<connor> and then that symbiotic relationship forms. </connor>
<connor> And then if it keeps going well, it'll keep growing out, </connor>
<connor> but I mean with how quick it, you know. </connor>
<connor> - With a bar, is there much expenses to start out with </connor>
<joey> apart from obviously getting the location? </joey>
<joey> I guess all the alcohol. - All the booze. </joey>
<connor> - Probably quite expensive. </connor>
<connor> - Right, you need to like, I mean the bars, </connor>
<garnt> the bars we went to, </garnt>
<joey> some of them were in like an apartment building. </joey>
<joey> They were basically just someone's apartment, right? </joey>
<joey> But the way they renovated this bar, </joey>
<joey> it looks (beep)ing great, you know. </joey>
<joey> There were so many small touches in every bar we go to. </joey>
<joey> So I'm sure a lot of it was also spent on renovation </joey>
<joey> just to make it look like a bar. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think we went to two bars that night. </connor>
<joey> I remember the second one was a lot more themed, </joey>
<joey> but the first one was very chill, </joey>
<joey> very nice. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I think they were reasonably priced </joey>
<joey> because this guy would spend like 10 minutes making a drink. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Could he have been faster, yeah probably, </joey>
<joey> but it was nice watching. </joey>
<joey> I feel like that's part of the experience </joey>
<joey> when you're in these cool bars. </joey>
<joey> Like you just get to watch the guy just go ham. </joey>
<joey> Just like do little things, just... </joey>
<joey> - Make something cool. </joey>
<joey> - And then I taste it and I don't really taste </joey>
<garnt> much difference in other drinks, but that's not the point. </garnt>
<connor> It's that it feels nice. </connor>
<connor> - It's the experience that you get, like </connor>
<connor> yeah, he's making it for you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (talking over each other) </garnt>
<garnt> - Drinking one of the spoons </garnt>
<joey> has like trained my mind into being like </joey>
<joey> I need to get this drink as fast as possible. </joey>
<garnt> You mean your like, I order like a mojito </garnt>
<garnt> and they'd better be serving it in a (beep)ing jug </garnt>
<garnt> because otherwise this time I'm waiting to get this mojito </garnt>
<garnt> could be used to like drink something else, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> So just going into these bars, which are more chilled out </garnt>
<garnt> is such a like different but nice experience </garnt>
<joey> 'cause you'd only normally go to these bars in the UK. </joey>
<joey> If you had like a (beep) ton of money to spend a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I also feel you don't go... </joey>
<joey> I personally don't go into those bars to get (beep)-faced. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, you can't really. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, which, you can if you're there long enough </connor>
<connor> and you're ordering stuff that's like easy, </connor>
<connor> but it's, at the same time, it's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> if you're gonna pay for that experience </connor>
<connor> in that like atmosphere, that chill atmosphere, </connor>
<garnt> then just like go easy on your drinks, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Just go slowly. </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind hard 'cause the atmosphere doesn't really </connor>
<garnt> make you feel like you're like drink, drink, drink. </garnt>
<garnt> Just take your time. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Just take your time. </joey>
<joey> - Let's just relax, let's just talk. </joey>
<joey> - This is like really... - Let's just talk. </joey>
<connor> - Also really thankful that I speak enough Japanese </connor>
<joey> to be able to do those bars like no pressure. </joey>
<joey> Those bars don't require that much. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like if you... </joey>
<joey> If there's any reason to learn Japanese, </joey>
<joey> probably just learn super basic stuff </joey>
<joey> so you can go to those bars. </joey>
<joey> If you don't speak any Japanese, they might be like... </joey>
<connor> - It's also a really good place to practice Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] That's true as well, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - Because every time I go bar hopping, </connor>
<connor> I get to speak more Japanese than I would normally. </connor>
<joey> And the bartenders are normally, well, </joey>
<joey> it's kind of their job to be, way more understanding </joey>
<joey> and, and come... - It's their job </joey>
<garnt> to interact with the customers. </garnt>
<joey> - Basically, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - If you're gonna talk to a bartender, </joey>
<garnt> they're not gonna be like, oh, what the (beep)... </garnt>
<connor> (laughing noise drowns out other sounds) </connor>
<joey> - They might, they might, but they probably wouldn't. </joey>
<joey> They're really nice. </joey>
<joey> I've never been to one of those bars </joey>
<joey> where the bartender's been like rude </joey>
<joey> or anything. - No, no. </joey>
<connor> - They're always super nice and like always interested. </connor>
<joey> - They wouldn't be in business if they were. </joey>
<connor> - That's true, at the end of the day it's customer service. </connor>
<joey> - If there's only like six seats, they better be nice </joey>
<garnt> to every (beep)ing customer that comes in. </garnt>
<joey> - They can't pretend to like, </joey>
<garnt> oh, well what was that you were saying? </garnt>
<joey> Like, go to a different customer, </joey>
<garnt> but you are the only one there. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I've had other customers be rude </joey>
<joey> while I've been in those bars. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I think one time I was with Chris </joey>
<joey> and we were asking a bar, and it was also a bar </joey>
<joey> that made food, and we were ordering a bunch of foods </joey>
<joey> 'cause we hadn't eaten all day </joey>
<joey> 'cause we were like traveling and filming. </joey>
<joey> This one woman was like, 'Don't you think you've ordered </joey>
<joey> 'enough food," to like me and Chris, </joey>
<joey> and we're like never, never enough food. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Shut up. </joey>
<joey> - We were like, what the (beep) is wrong with you? </joey>
<joey> Why would you say that to someone, (beep) off. </joey>
<joey> I think she was annoyed 'cause she was talking with him. </joey>
<joey> I think she was like flirting with him. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> We kept obviously making him like actually like cook </joey>
<joey> and do his job, I guess, and she was like really annoyed. </joey>
<joey> Every time we order anything, she'd be like, chh, you know. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, what's your problem? </joey>
<joey> Oh my God, leave us alone. </joey>
<joey> We drank so much. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] She's trying to get the deed, dude. </joey>
<joey> - I know she, (beep) off, let us eat! </joey>
<joey> It's because we ordered kamome, bro. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we ordering cheese and stuff off, you know. </joey>
<joey> Chris was like more kamome. </joey>
<joey> - So we were drinking so much, we were getting hungry. </joey>
<connor> We were like more, more, more, more. </connor>
<joey> - Imagine trying to give them business. </joey>
<connor> - I know, I was like (beep) off. </connor>
<joey> I thought it was so rude, I was like </joey>
<joey> what the (beep)'s wrong with you? </joey>
<connor> I was in Kochi I think as well, </connor>
<connor> cause this really tiny like. </connor>
<connor> - I bet for her, that's like the only like, you know... </connor>
<connor> - Maybe yeah, that's... </connor>
<garnt> - Solace out of whatever she is living through, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> Clearly she wasn't very happy, she wanted take it out on us. </joey>
<connor> I dunno why, I remember... </connor>
<garnt> - I mean it's Kochi and there isn't </garnt>
<joey> a whole lot else to do there. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there's not much going on, (beep) you. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, it was a nice bar though. </joey>
<joey> I remember that it was like an Irish bar or something </joey>
<garnt> that's the theme of it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> It was really good though 'cause they did like, </garnt>
<garnt> they had Heineken on tap. - Oh, (beep). </garnt>
<garnt> - And I just drank like, and it was... </garnt>
<garnt> They had actual pints of Heineken. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ooh, okay. - I was like, this is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> And I drank way too much 'cause I was like </garnt>
<joey> so excited to finally have a real sized pint. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh, my God, it was good though. </joey>
<joey> Amazing. </joey>
<joey> Sorry, random tangent. </joey>
<connor> - Random tangent. - That's fine. </connor>
<joey> - You guys then been any other like weirdly themed bars? </joey>
<joey> I mean I know you have for a bunch for your videos </joey>
<connor> and stuff. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Or like just outside of that. </connor>
<joey> - A lot of the cool bars, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't want to go film anywhere. </joey>
<connor> I'd just wanna kind of do it. </connor>
<joey> Like there's that bar we went to. </joey>
<garnt> It's like this bar that's like, I don't, I won't say, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I don't want it to become like brammed, </garnt>
<garnt> But it's like they have like live music there </garnt>
<garnt> and that was really cool. - Oh, really? </garnt>
<garnt> It was like dude playing piano, cello, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, violin, and double bass. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that one. - The jazz ones. </joey>
<joey> - Kinda like a jazz bar. </joey>
<joey> There's like, and it's there's like the whole wall </joey>
<joey> is just like wine. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I remember that one. </joey>
<joey> - It was really cool. </joey>
<joey> - And they have like cigars </joey>
<garnt> and like the atmosphere's very chill. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds nice. - Cool, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's super awesome, these dudes are amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> It's super chill just being there </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I really miss going to a bar </garnt>
<connor> that has live music 'cause like all... </connor>
<garnt> - When it's good as well, you're like, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause sometimes when you've got live music, </joey>
<connor> you're like (sucking air through his teeth). </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like, when the music's not too in your face. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, well if it's too loud, I... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, sometimes you go to a bar </joey>
<joey> and the music, the music, like, </joey>
<joey> the music is way too aggressive </joey>
<joey> that you can't focus on anything else but the music. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like this bar is just perfect. </joey>
<joey> The music was just like, you can have a conversation </joey>
<joey> or you can just like admire this guy </joey>
<joey> like tearing it up on like the trumpet or saxophone, </joey>
<joey> or whatever he was playing with the piano. </joey>
<joey> They were (beep)ing insane. - Really cool. </joey>
<joey> Really cool. </joey>
<joey> And you can actually tip them. </joey>
<joey> They had a tip jar. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I assume that's how they make most </joey>
<joey> of their money there, but it's really cool. </joey>
<joey> It was really awesome. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But you get charged for just like sitting down </garnt>
<garnt> for like the music charge. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. - Like $20. </garnt>
<joey> But they're playing for like three hours. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean if the music's good, why not? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's really (beep)ing good. </connor>
<connor> So cool. </connor>
<connor> - I used to go to so many of those places in Australia, </connor>
<garnt> but like they all just got (beep)ing replaced </garnt>
<garnt> by like just standard, like poker machines and (beep)ing... </garnt>
<joey> - What's the Australian bar culture like? </joey>
<garnt> - Um, I'd say pretty similar to the UK </garnt>
<garnt> in the sense that you go in, you have, you know, some food, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, beers and what not, and then you watch </garnt>
<garnt> the footy on the TV kind of deal, </garnt>
<joey> you know? - Yeah, 'cause like to me, </joey>
<joey> like would you count a pub as a bar? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's not the same, but it is in definition still. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess it's... - The OG. </garnt>
<garnt> - It fulfills the same. - It's the OG. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the OG Bar. </garnt>
<joey> - It's only since I've moved out of England </joey>
<garnt> that I've considered a pub a bar, right, </garnt>
<garnt> Because before like, I mean, I get it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a place that you go to drink. </garnt>
<garnt> But to me, like a pub always felt different, </garnt>
<garnt> in the UK at least, to a bar, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> A pub's somewhere where most of the time you go there </garnt>
<garnt> to drink, but you know, you can just have like </garnt>
<garnt> a nice Sunday lunch. </garnt>
<garnt> You can have like a nice breakfast there, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever as well. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - A bar was always like somewhere you would go </garnt>
<garnt> before going to a club, or somewhere where you are </garnt>
<garnt> 100% of the time... - Like spend the night there. </garnt>
<joey> - Getting (beep)-faced. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> A pub you can go to like in the daytime as well. </joey>
<joey> I could never like imagine having gone </joey>
<joey> to a bar before 5:00 PM, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Right, right, or yeah, I guess in that sense </garnt>
<joey> then a pub is more so similar to Izakaya in Japan </joey>
<connor> in that instance, whereas like a bar </connor>
<joey> is just like live music. - People drinking. </joey>
<garnt> (talking over each other) </garnt>
<garnt> - Most people normally go to, at least in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> I've, hmm. - - See because for us, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like everyone eats at the pub. </garnt>
<connor> - I wanna say like 70% of people </connor>
<connor> don't eat when they go to the pub. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I think the older you get, </connor>
<joey> the more likely you are to eat at the pub. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, that, yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> That's true, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's just a thing. </joey>
<garnt> 'cause the older you get, the more you wanna on weekends, </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna go hang out with your mates. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's true. - Oh, yeah </garnt>
<joey> You wanna go meet down for a Sunday, </joey>
<joey> at the, yeah, yeah, maybe, I don't know, but I like pubs. </joey>
<joey> Pubs are interesting in the UK </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's one place where, you know, </joey>
<joey> it's also a (beep)hole. </joey>
<joey> It's also a (beep) ton of historical significance </joey>
<joey> to some of these pubs. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Some pubs have been around for like 800 years in the UK. </joey>
<joey> Isn't it insane? - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's insane. </joey>
<joey> Just some guys pouring drinks </joey>
<connor> that have been there for like 800 years. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like four times the length of Australia. </garnt>
<connor> - Isn't that insane? </connor>
<garnt> Like there are like pubs that are still open </garnt>
<garnt> that have been around for like, like 500 plus years. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's crazy. - Maybe not the same name, </garnt>
<joey> but like the location is the, it's just insane. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, and you go in and it's depressing most of the time. </connor>
<joey> - Well, because it's been around for like 500 years, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Not much has changed. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, pubs are one of those places </connor>
<connor> where it very much reflects the local area, the state of it. </connor>
<garnt> - The state. - The state. </garnt>
<connor> - The state. - Absolute state. </connor>
<connor> - You go into the pub and you're like, </connor>
<joey> all right, we're going on. </joey>
<connor> - If the community's doing well, the pub will be nice. </connor>
<garnt> It's true. - Everyone's happy. </garnt>
<garnt> The pub is nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. - Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it's an area that has been like </garnt>
<garnt> kind of forgotten by the government... </garnt>
<garnt> - Shankings every week. - You know, it's kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> - you know, it's a reflection. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know the pub scene, </garnt>
<joey> it's where you get to see the actual, </joey>
<joey> I'd say culture of the actual place </joey>
<joey> really is probably the most honest way to find out about </joey>
<joey> the culture. - I'd agree with you. </joey>
<joey> It's like if you wanna see what proper British people </joey>
<joey> are like you go to pubs, you go to pubs, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You'll see that there's a difference. </joey>
<joey> Well, I mean, I remember before whether the image </joey>
<joey> was different, but now, you know, if you, </joey>
<joey> it's, it's not all just like either, how can I word this? </joey>
<joey> It's not that we're either like prim and proper people </joey>
<joey> or just whatever the (beep) we're getting clowned on </joey>
<garnt> on the internet. - I remember when I went </garnt>
<garnt> to the UK and you took me to that gaming pub. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know... - Ohhh! </connor>
<garnt> - Don't put that all on me, we both took you. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah, you both took... </garnt>
<connor> - No, I'm pretty sure it was Connor's idea </connor>
<connor> to bring you to that gaming pub. </connor>
<joey> - Connor's like I know a place. </joey>
<joey> - I think it was supposed to be chill, </joey>
<joey> but I think that day specifically </joey>
<garnt> it was 'cause the Overwatch World Final. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. The Overwatch World Finals was happening. </garnt>
<connor> - Really (beep) 'cause it was so busy and you could get on. </connor>
<garnt> - But even, even before the actual final started, </garnt>
<connor> we got there a little bit early </connor>
<garnt> before the finals actually started so we could at least </garnt>
<connor> get a few drinks in then chill and everything. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like in my head, you know, I was like, oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> A gaming pub in the UK, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder what they have. </garnt>
<garnt> They just had a Wii on the window sill. </garnt>
<joey> A single Wii with Smash, that's it. </joey>
<garnt> - And five PCs. </garnt>
<garnt> - And five PCs. - And five PCs. </garnt>
<connor> But the PCs were all taking out </connor>
<joey> 'cause of the Overwatch finals. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> And I'd never been unironically oy oy oyed before </garnt>
<joey> until that night when I was like sitting outside </joey>
<joey> 'cause the Overwatch Finals are happening inside </joey>
<joey> and it was like way too loud and I didn't really care. </joey>
<joey> So I sat just 'cause there were a couple seats outside. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, and this dude clearly like about six pints in </connor>
<garnt> just literally came up, sat next to me, was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oy oy oy? - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing and talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that happens in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, wow, you exist. </joey>
<joey> - I think I was playing in an Overwatch tournament that day. </joey>
<joey> I think, was it that day, yeah, I was. </joey>
<joey> - I think it was that day. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were. </connor>
<joey> - I think you signed up. - Yeah, you did. </joey>
<connor> - I did. - You did sign up. </connor>
<joey> - It was like the winner got a free drink. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> It was like a six-round tournament. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I won the first four matches. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. - But then the fifth match, </garnt>
<joey> I was like six beers deep. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so it was starting to get a lot harder </joey>
<joey> to win these wimpy ones at Overwatch. </joey>
<joey> And then the guy, I remember I got so annoyed, I was like, </joey>
<joey> the guy I'm going against, he was just drinking coffee. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, how is this fair? </joey>
<joey> I'm six drinks deep. </joey>
<joey> And this guy he's just drinking a (beep)ing Starbucks. </joey>
<joey> of course I'm gonna lose. </joey>
<joey> I can barely like (beep)ing sit in the chair correctly </joey>
<joey> and I didn't get my free drink. </joey>
<joey> I lost, I was very salty. </joey>
<connor> I think he was like a (beep) rank as well. </connor>
<connor> I could have easily have beat him. </connor>
<connor> It could have been easy, it's not right. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I do notice that about it's especially like </joey>
<joey> themed bars in the UK, because like UK, </joey>
<garnt> like the UJ bar-themed bar game is (beep)ing weak as (beep). </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if it's changed ever since I moved, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, you know, like you... </garnt>
<garnt> - Back in my day. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have a gaming bar in the UK, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And the gaming bar in the UK, as Joey has just said, </garnt>
<joey> is just like a Wii in a corner and four PCs. </joey>
<garnt> - And the stickiest Wii motes I've ever touched in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, ahhh. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that shut down now? </joey>
<joey> - It might be, I dunno, I can't remember. </joey>
<connor> I can't remember. </connor>
<joey> - Real quick before I lash out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Let me make sure they're not in business before I... </connor>
<joey> - What was it called again? </joey>
<connor> I can't remember what it... </connor>
<connor> - Meltdown. - Meltdown. </connor>
<joey> Meltdown, oh, that was it! - Meltdown? </joey>
<connor> - I think that was shut down. </connor>
<joey> - It is closed. </joey>
<joey> I think it's closed and it keeps reopening and closing. </joey>
<joey> Right. - Okay. </joey>
<joey> It was quite gritty though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - It was all right. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I still had a good time. </connor>
<connor> - It was better than nothing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was better than nothing, but you compare it </joey>
<joey> to some of the gaming bars and some of the theme bars </joey>
<joey> you find... - Some of the gaming bars </joey>
<connor> in Tokyo are like... - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - In the UK, they do have a new one now. </joey>
<joey> I remember... - Is it good? </joey>
<joey> - I went there. </joey>
<joey> - It's called the Meltdown. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's called, ah, </joey>
<joey> I think the one now's called Platform I think. </joey>
<connor> But it was very expensive, like to go on the PC it was like, </connor>
<connor> oh God, it was like paying normal computer costs, </connor>
<garnt> like computer cafe costs in London. </garnt>
<garnt> Like five pound for an hour maybe? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - Or maybe 30 minutes. </garnt>
<joey> It might have been five pounds for 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - It's like $7.00 </joey>
<joey> And you weren't allowed to take </joey>
<connor> your drink up obviously, but that just kind of sucks. </connor>
<garnt> - See, but like that sounds like a gaming bar </garnt>
<connor> where the gaming takes priority over the bar, right, </connor>
<connor> whereas Meltdown was definitely like 92% bar, 8% game. </connor>
<joey> - The thing I liked Meltdown was that it was just, </joey>
<garnt> I don't know, it was just kind of like comfy, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was comfy. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You could do anything in that bar. </garnt>
<garnt> You could like order food </garnt>
<garnt> from like the local pizza place and eat it at that bar. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a cool place to chill out, but in terms </garnt>
<garnt> of just like having like a cool themed bar </garnt>
<garnt> where like, you know, a lot of effort </garnt>
<garnt> has gone into like the theming and the vibe. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I've been to bars in America. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been to bars in like, you know, in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, for example, </garnt>
<joey> you have like an anime themed bar. </joey>
<joey> You have like a Jojo themed bar in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And like, you can tell. </joey>
<joey> You walk in and immediately it's just like </joey>
<joey> you're transported to like a theme park, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. - Thought has gone into like </joey>
<joey> the aesthetic, the vibe, the design. </joey>
<joey> And then you go to like an anime bar in the UK </joey>
<joey> and it's a pub with a docu-marker in the corner. </joey>
<joey> That's basically like, that's what I remember. </joey>
<joey> Like that's the absolute state of themed bars in the UK. </joey>
<garnt> - Mind you, I still had a fun time. </garnt>
<joey> I'm saying all this (beep) about Meltdown. </joey>
<joey> I still had a good time. </joey>
<connor> - No, it was a fun time, but it wasn't exactly, </connor>
<garnt> it wasn't exactly a gaming bar. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's just say that. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the thing about UK bars. </joey>
<garnt> We have fun there, you have fun. </garnt>
<joey> - We have fun. You have fun. </joey>
<garnt> - You have fun. - You have fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just not what you're expecting. </garnt>
<connor> - There's another one. </connor>
<garnt> I don't think we took you there to, </garnt>
<garnt> a board game bar, but it all also has video games, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You told me about it, but we decided </garnt>
<garnt> not to go to it for whatever reason. </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind of far out the way. </connor>
<garnt> We went there. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember we went there, the other, </garnt>
<joey> when I went back to the UK recently just for a drink </joey>
<joey> and it was Rock Band night. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And it was rough. - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Because people were singing. </joey>
<joey> Anyone's allowed to sing. </joey>
<joey> - That's basically a karaoke bar. </joey>
<joey> - Kind of karaoke, but I don't know why </joey>
<joey> Rock Band makes people worse singers, </joey>
<joey> but it was like, I remember it was rough. </joey>
<joey> I remember I was there. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh, you know, I'm not one to judge singers, </joey>
<joey> cause I'm (beep) myself, but I was like, </joey>
<connor> this is, this is hard to drink with. </connor>
<connor> This is like Wedding Singer vibes. </connor>
<connor> Even worse than that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - It was. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think just the problem with having themed bars </joey>
<joey> in the UK especially is that if you are going </joey>
<joey> for like a more delicate theme, that requires more, </joey>
<joey> you know, that requires more thought and more precision </joey>
<joey> is that you have to make everything drunk-proof </joey>
<joey> and not just drunk-proof, </joey>
<joey> but just like UK-people drunk-proof. </joey>
<joey> That's like a much higher level. </joey>
<garnt> - Chaos-proof. </garnt>
<connor> - This board game bar had a bouncer. </connor>
<garnt> So that, that should tell you how much, </garnt>
<garnt> like this state of the UK, </garnt>
<joey> the absolute state, like a board game bar, right, </joey>
<joey> Where you would think that, you know, </joey>
<joey> us nerds would go, right, we're like chill, right? </joey>
<joey> We need a (beep)ing bouncer for it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, hold it right there. </garnt>
<garnt> What's your top score on Scrabble? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sort of that you got a mortgage that property, mate, </garnt>
<connor> Gotta stop you right there, you broke our Monopoly, get out. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you finished your Monopoly game, you can go, man. </garnt>
<joey> - We got someone stabbed over a game of UNO the other night, </joey>
<joey> you know, like. </joey>
<joey> - I gotta do a pat down real quick. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's kind sad. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, like what's wrong with us? </garnt>
<connor> Why can't we just (beep)ing be (beep) for... </connor>
<garnt> - I've heard there's a lot of really fun </garnt>
<garnt> board game bars in Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never been to any of them, </garnt>
<connor> but I know of a couple that I wanna to go to. </connor>
<garnt> - There's a few in London, actually. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] There's one new gaming bar in, in Juku </joey>
<garnt> that actually just (speaking off mic). </garnt>
<garnt> Well there's one next to the Arosa bar, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Arosa Cafe in Akihabara, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a board game bar there. </garnt>
<connor> - Problem is you need one that you'd kind of, </connor>
<garnt> if you can't read Japanese, you need be somewhat familiar </garnt>
<joey> with the game. - Yeah, sure </joey>
<joey> - But that's fine if you know a lot of them </joey>
<joey> or you have someone who can explain. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Most of these games, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna read the manual. </joey>
<garnt> I'll play it with someone who knows. </garnt>
<garnt> They can just explain. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's much better. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like if there is anyone living in the UK </joey>
<connor> that just does legitimately go to a cool themed bar, </connor>
<connor> please, I would actually like to know </connor>
<connor> if the UK, bar game has improved </connor>
<connor> since I've moved out of the UK. </connor>
<connor> - I'd love that, too. Because like, yeah, </connor>
<garnt> compared into what's available internationally, </garnt>
<garnt> it is, it is weak. </garnt>
<joey> I will say that, it is weak, but I mean, I understand it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why, hello, you lovely listeners </garnt>

<garnt> Back to the show. </garnt>
<connor> - I watched more anime. </connor>
<garnt> - I did, too, actually. </garnt>
<connor> - What did you watch? </connor>
<garnt> - I watched "Attack on Titan." </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, me too, me, too. </joey>
<joey> - What is going on now? </joey>
<connor> - Joey's watched as Joey's only, and first anime. </connor>
<joey> - You can't just drop this bombshell on me, guys. </joey>
<garnt> - I tweeted. - Watch anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I tweeted about how the first two episodes were wild. </garnt>
<joey> and then I immediately silenced... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you gotta mute it. </joey>
<joey> - I muted it, didn't see it at all. </joey>
<garnt> But I guarantee all the comments, all like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You don't watch anime." </garnt>
<garnt> - Well after this episode comes out, I think episode six. </garnt>
<garnt> - Something like that. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Only 12 episodes this season. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh really? - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (talking over each other) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's ending. </joey>
<connor> - I had to go back a couple of episodes </connor>
<garnt> just because it really does just like throw you in. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean, it is just a continuation, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<joey> I think I'd completely forgotten about that. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh, it's just the new season, right? </joey>
<joey> So I was like, I was waiting for like the recap. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, where is it? </garnt>
<joey> Where is it, what's happening? </joey>
<joey> - Because like not now anime has this thing </joey>
<garnt> where they call things seasons </garnt>
<connor> but they're really not (beep)ing seasons. </connor>
<connor> Like it's just parts. </connor>
<garnt> - It's Final Season, Part Two. - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Wasn't there a Part Two of Season Three? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there was a Part Two of Season Three as well </garnt>
<joey> - So Season Three, Part One, Season Three, Part Two, </joey>
<garnt> and then Final Season, Part One, Final Season Part Two. </garnt>
<joey> - Cause like the last season wasn't really a season </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was just a story that was cut </joey>
<joey> right in the middle of the story, right, </joey>
<joey> so I wouldn't really call that like a full season. </joey>
<joey> So this was just like the continuation </joey>
<joey> of the Attack on Titan season. </joey>
<garnt> - I completely forgotten about that when I started </garnt>
<joey> the first episode of Part Two. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So weird to (beep)ing say that. </joey>
<joey> - I hate that. - Final Season. </joey>
<garnt> - When I started episode one, Final Season, Part Two. </garnt>
<joey> - Final Season, the actual final season. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the actual final season supposedly, but yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Jajar looks pretty good this season. </connor>
<joey> Jajar looks pretty good this season. </joey>
<joey> - It's all right. </joey>
<joey> - It isn't even that bad actually. </joey>
<joey> The attacks have gotten a lot better. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - In CGI. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno what people... - I haven't actually </connor>
<joey> the new Attack on Titan season. </joey>
<connor> - I dunno if I'm just being like, I'm just used to it, </connor>
<garnt> but yeah, I think the CGI Titans </garnt>
<garnt> look a lot better than they did in the previous seasons. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't really notice it </connor>
<garnt> until I saw on Twitter that people were complaining about. </garnt>
<connor> I was like... - Oh, well, you know. </connor>
<garnt> They complain about anything CGI. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - They feel like detectives. </joey>
<joey> I saw it, I found the CGI, I did it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I saw part. </connor>
<garnt> - If you cross reference the manga panel </garnt>
<garnt> that they took this from. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I saw a guy on Twitter </joey>
<connor> complaining about the CGI in Part Six of Jojo as well </connor>
<connor> the other day where he was literally like, </connor>
<connor> I dunno who it was, where I saw an image </connor>
<connor> where it was like side-by-side comparison. </connor>
<connor> - I saw this one. - Like arrows of just like, </connor>
<connor> this is Part Five, and this is how many CGI things </connor>
<connor> are in the background, and this is Part Six </connor>
<connor> and this is how many CGI things there are in the background. </connor>
<connor> And I'm, we are getting to like </connor>
<joey> the (beep)ing always sunny Charlie meme at this point. </joey>
<connor> Like, you know, it like </connor>
<joey> I can't comment on the Attack on Titan Final Season CGI, </joey>
<connor> but it wasn't too bad. </connor>
<joey> Why do people do that? - Part One. </joey>
<connor> - People just hate CGI, they're just like the 2D style </connor>
<joey> I get it, you know, obviously I would prefer the 2D, </joey>
<joey> but I don't I wouldn't use any sleepover CGI being included. </joey>
<connor> I'm not... - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> I don't really care. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, does it affect the story? </joey>
<connor> - No. - No. </connor>
<joey> - Or the impact of the story? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - I get more annoyed when </joey>
<joey> they just don't even animate stuff. </joey>
<joey> Like I think there was a fight in the previous </joey>
<connor> Part One Final Season that I wish they'd animated. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, what? </joey>
<joey> (talking and laughing over each other) </joey>
<joey> - The Final Season. - Which part? </joey>
<connor> - The Final Season, Part One, there is a fight in it </connor>
<garnt> that I wish that they'd actually done something with, </garnt>
<garnt> but they just kind of didn't show anything. </garnt>
<joey> They kinda like cut to the aftermath. </joey>
<joey> That's when I'm like, well, that's (beep). </joey>
<joey> I'm like, show me something. </joey>
<joey> Even if it's CGI, I'd love to see it. </joey>
<joey> - Perhaps something to do with Levi. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. </joey>
<joey> I know the moment you're thinking of. </joey>
<joey> - That one was kind of disappointing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> - Show anything, that's where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> okay, this is (beep) when they're not even showing </joey>
<garnt> the fight. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That's when it bothers me. </joey>
<joey> - The only thing I would say that I think </joey>
<joey> has been a step down is that the story </joey>
<joey> of Attack on Titan Final Season has been amazing, </joey>
<joey> but compared to like what previous seasons did, </joey>
<joey> there wasn't like that epic oh my God fight moments. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like that's the only thing that's really missing </joey>
<joey> from this final season or that has been missing </joey>
<joey> because like, there are some amazing action moments </joey>
<joey> in the previous seasons and this one </joey>
<joey> has just been amazing for the story and for the conflict. </joey>
<connor> - I look forward less and less for the action scenes </connor>
<joey> and more so what's gonna happen, whereas, you know, </joey>
<joey> like Season Three, Part One had that glorious scene, </joey>
<garnt> which you've probably seen all over 'cause the gifs </garnt>
<garnt> are like (talking over each other). </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the Levi one. - That (beep)'s insane. </connor>
<joey> Like anything involving Levi is just like... </joey>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> - It was kinda interesting. </joey>
<joey> So I remember when that came out, you know, </joey>
<joey> everyone was like joking that Attack on Titan </joey>
<joey> Season Two was so boring. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That scene came out in Season Three. </joey>
<joey> - Part One, Part One. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Part One, and everyone </joey>
<joey> was just like a Attack on Titan hype again. </joey>
<joey> Everyone was like that one scene </joey>
<joey> made everyone hype for Attack on Titan. </joey>
<connor> So it was so well done, it was insane. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there were even like some scenes </joey>
<joey> in Season Two though, like (beep)ing incredible as well. </joey>
<connor> - People just didn't care 'cause it took five years, right? </connor>
<connor> Or like four years. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it took like, yeah, five, six years? </joey>
<garnt> - It was also the point. </garnt>
<joey> it was also the point where the story started to get like, </joey>
<connor> had like the political side of it all </connor>
<connor> like in the story and the world... </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, Season Two was slow. </connor>
<garnt> - So it was a lot harder for people to get like hyped over. </garnt>
<garnt> They were gonna be like, yo politics, hype, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> they wasn't gonna. - I think that's just </garnt>
<garnt> because it was like so different from Season One </garnt>
<garnt> because Season One was just like, </garnt>
<joey> it was so fast-paced and so action packed that people like. </joey>
<garnt> - It was so cut and dry and like straight to the point. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Of like </joey>
<joey> this is what's happening. </joey>
<garnt> You're gonna get hyped for this fight, </garnt>
<garnt> this fight, this fight, this fight. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm glad they slowed it down in Season Two </joey>
<joey> and literally like built up the characters, </joey>
<joey> built up as well because now I think </joey>
<joey> it's so much better for it. </joey>
<joey> It's like a much... - It's like a payoff show. </joey>
<joey> for like the action scenes now </joey>
<joey> has just become like so much greater </joey>
<joey> even though part the Final Season, Part Two right now </joey>
<joey> there isn't really any like fight scene that's made me go, </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I've only seen the first two episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> but like there hasn't been a fight scene </garnt>
<garnt> that's made me go like, yo or anything like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Everything's a fight right now. </connor>
<garnt> - If anything, the one thing that's been talked about </garnt>
<garnt> is that (beep)ing face, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh my God, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Mean (beep). </joey>
<joey> - I don't even know the context of that face. </joey>
<joey> I've I've seen it like on my timeline. </joey>
<joey> - That caught me off guard. </joey>
<joey> - That caught me off guard as well, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, whoa. </garnt>
<joey> It's like a horror anime now, what the (beep)? </joey>
<joey> - I guess it'll be interesting to see </joey>
<joey> how our opinions change when it's over </joey>
<joey> and to see our final thoughts on it. </joey>
<joey> That would be interesting. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that would be interesting. </connor>
<joey> - Following it now for like, I don't know, six... </joey>
<joey> - Do you think, do you feel like this is the anime that has </joey>
<connor> like just defined this modern generation of anime fans? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This is gonna be the show for the next 10 years that when </joey>
<connor> someone was like, well I wanna watch anime, what do I watch? </connor>
<connor> I watch Attack of the Titans. </connor>
<garnt> - You go back on the greats of the two thousands </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like, well Attack on Titan, obviously, </garnt>
<connor> - you know? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It is, like as much people wanna be like, </connor>
<connor> no it's (beep), whatever 'cause they wanna have like </connor>
<joey> a counter opinion, like, no it is, </joey>
<joey> it is a good show. - It's a great show. </joey>
<joey> - In this generation. - I'm interested to see </joey>
<joey> how the ending is gonna go down because </joey>
<joey> whether it is good or not, 'cause I don't know </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm not a mind reader, whether it's good or not, </joey>
<joey> the anime community is probably gonna explode </joey>
<connor> one way or the other, right, through discussion. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know how I've like (beep)ing dodged </connor>
<connor> all these spoilers, I don't know anything. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because whenever you even like </garnt>
<garnt> utter the word Attack on Titan ending, </garnt>
<joey> all the (beep)ing mongerators come out of the shadows </joey>
<joey> like war veterans being like, ah... </joey>
<joey> You'll soon see one of these... </joey>
<joey> - All I know is it's divisive. </joey>
<joey> That's good, that means it's gonna be interesting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I'm excited. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if everyone agreed, like it's decent, </joey>
<joey> I'd be like (beep). </joey>
<joey> Now that I know it's divisive, </joey>
<connor> I know that I'm I'm in for something good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like preparing a nuclear shelter </joey>
<joey> for a (beep)ing Twitter that's... </joey>
<joey> When the ending comes out I know that Twitter </joey>
<joey> is gonna be like a (beep)ing landmine, you know. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] I'm hyped, I'm hyped for it, I'm hyped. </garnt>
<garnt> - Any opinion will be shattered by the opposite party. </garnt>
<joey> - It's gonna be one of those shows where you just need </joey>
<joey> to watch it just so you can have a take on it. </joey>
<joey> You know like your personality is going to be defined </joey>
<joey> on whether you on what take you have </joey>
<connor> on the Attack of Titan... </connor>
<connor> - Match.com will be asking what you felt </connor>
<connor> about the ending of Attack on Titan. </connor>
<garnt> - So my credentials for a boyfriend over six feet </garnt>
<joey> thought the ending of Attack on Titan was good. </joey>
<garnt> If you don't fit these, get out. </garnt>
<connor> - That's how you know, man, it'll be interesting. </connor>
<connor> I'm really, really hyped, and also it's probably </connor>
<joey> the longest anime that I've been following, right. </joey>
<joey> It's like, okay, it's finally like an end is in sight. </joey>
<joey> And like an actual ending, not a oh they (beep)ed up </joey>
<joey> the production, oh, it's gone now, it's never coming back. </joey>
<connor> It's like an actual wrap up of a long running thing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I can't even remember the last time I experienced </joey>
<joey> something like this where I was just watching an anime </joey>
<garnt> and it was like, it just ended </garnt>
<garnt> and I had to wait years for it to end. </garnt>
<garnt> Actually, I know it's even (indistinct), </garnt>
<garnt> but aside from that, I just realized it's just... </garnt>
<connor> (talking over each other) </connor>
<joey> - I wasn't there from the start. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> Like for me, it's like, 'cause I've been there </joey>
<joey> from like the beginning, </joey>
<joey> - You've lived through this. - I'll lived through </joey>
<joey> - the initial hype, every single phase </joey>
<joey> of Attack on Titan hype and controversy and everything. </joey>
<joey> I've been through it all. </joey>
<joey> So having it come to an end is gonna feel so weird </joey>
<joey> 'cause even like, if you were like, all right, </joey>
<connor> well One Piece, yeah, but One Piece was around </connor>
<connor> before you were around, right? </connor>
<connor> - Started in '96, '98? </connor>
<garnt> (talking over each other) </garnt>
<garnt> Like imagine if you're like a 50-year old </garnt>
<joey> Japanese salary man who's been reading One Piece </joey>
<joey> since your 20s, it must be like really weird </joey>
<joey> to think that one day it's gonna end. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Unless you've been around </joey>
<connor> forever and conscious around every single phase of it. </connor>
<garnt> - That's what a bunch of 50-year old salary men </garnt>
<connor> were like when Naruto ended, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, true. - They were like, </joey>
<joey> like bleach, right, it was like, oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> - It was crazy. - (Beep)in' over. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. Like to me Naratu ending got </joey>
<joey> so soured by the fact that Boruto, I think, </joey>
<joey> was like announced rightly even like before it ended. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, well it's an ending, I'm emotional, </joey>
<garnt> but I know it's not really ending... </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause there's more of it. </garnt>
<joey> - Cause like there's already more of it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - I wish I could go back and watch Death Note, </joey>
<connor> like what episode one, through like 30 seconds, </connor>
<connor> - Just log onto Twitch. </connor>
<joey> - I know I oh, (laughing and talking over each other). </joey>
<garnt> Hunter as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but like going in... - Join the anime... </garnt>
<garnt> - Could you imagine if you were around when Death Note </garnt>
<garnt> was, if it was an anime only, and it was like week by week. </garnt>
<garnt> Holy (beep), that would have been crazy. </garnt>
<connor> I wish I was there. </connor>
<garnt> - I was there during the second half of when </garnt>
<joey> the manga was serializing. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And even that was (beep)ing crazy </joey>
<joey> 'cause like it obviously started </joey>
<garnt> before I started reading Shonen Jump. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had to like do a quick catch up to like keep up </garnt>
<garnt> with everyone, and even then that was (beep)ing crazy. </garnt>
<connor> - Only imagine the levels of hype </connor>
<garnt> that it would have reached nowadays </garnt>
<connor> if something like that dropped today. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was weird because I was one of the guys </joey>
<joey> who was watching like Death Note when it aired, </joey>
<joey> and it was just a different vibe because rather than people </joey>
<joey> discussing it weekly, you just had people </joey>
<joey> be like, watch Death Note, it's amazing. </joey>
<joey> So you could only get like discussions of the entire show </joey>
<joey> after it had finished. - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - As opposed to, yo, did you catch the newest episode? </joey>
<connor> (Beep)ing... - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I letter got removed from the alphabet. </connor>
<joey> Well, that was (beep)ing insane, man. </joey>
<connor> - This is true though. </connor>
<connor> I wish I could have been around with something like that. </connor>
<connor> It's so, I guess, I don't know what the next show is </connor>
<connor> that's gonna be like that one, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Maybe Mushoku Tensei, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Maybe. - I hope so. </garnt>
<connor> I mean... </connor>
<connor> - It's a hard shoe to fill just because it's, </connor>
<joey> you very rarely see anime that literally appeals </joey>
<garnt> to everyone and has everything that everyone likes. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Everything is... </joey>
<garnt> - I do hope the next one is Mushoku Tensei </garnt>
<garnt> because they literally created a studio </garnt>
<connor> just to make this one show, but they kind of need to </connor>
<joey> because of how long the story is. </joey>
<joey> It follows like his entire life. </joey>
<joey> - How many episodes do you think? </joey>
<connor> - Probably need like six seasons. </connor>
<joey> - Six seasons, that's not that many </joey>
<connor> compared to like One Piece or something. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, that's true. </connor>
<joey> But like, in terms of that many high quality episodes, </joey>
<joey> that's like a lot. - Right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> That's true, too. </connor>
<connor> - It feels like more like an autobiography </connor>
<connor> or like a biography of a fictional character </connor>
<joey> kind of like you guys ever seen, </joey>
<joey> like Boyhood, or that movie? </joey>
<connor> - Ah, that sounds so familiar. </connor>
<joey> - That was an movie that like took 15 years to make </joey>
<joey> because it basically is the story of this kid </joey>
<garnt> and how they did it is that they filmed every year </garnt>
<garnt> for 15 years, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's pretty cool. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, so they, yeah, do you remember that? </joey>
<joey> I think, didn't it win an Oscar? </joey>
<garnt> - You'd (beep)in' hope so. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - After 15 years. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was sort of a lot. </joey>
<joey> Was it Boyhood, I can't remember if that was... </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Boyhood, there was a movie like that with it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, now you can just go on YouTube </joey>
<joey> and watch those family channels just raise their kids. </joey>
<joey> - I watched (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - I can just, who needs that now? </joey>
<joey> That groundbreaking thing </joey>
<joey> has now been turned into ad revenue. </joey>
<joey> So now a compelling piece of media </joey>
<connor> is just film farmed on YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> - Why condense it into a feature-length film </garnt>
<connor> when you could make multiple seasons </connor>
<garnt> of that (beep)? - So much more ad revenue </garnt>
<garnt> if you're doing, you know, day by day uploads. </garnt>
<connor> You know, my kid (beep) himself vlog, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - Like episode 4700. </garnt>
<connor> - If you don't seen those, they're like </connor>
<joey> the kid gets called up by the principal and they film it. </joey>
<joey> They're like filming picking the kid up from school </joey>
<joey> after he's been like kicked out of school. </joey>
<joey> It's insane. </joey>
<joey> - No. - That (beep) is insane. </joey>
<joey> - Family vlog channels are so weird to me. </joey>
<connor> - It's the most scariest part of the internet for me. </connor>
<connor> That's what scares me. </connor>
<joey> - I can't imagine. </joey>
<joey> It scares me because I can't imagine. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's the complete opposite of like </joey>
<connor> a healthy environment to raise children in, right? </connor>
<joey> - I know it's awful. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine you're a kid and you are just like growing up, </joey>
<joey> just thinking that everything you're gonna do </joey>
<joey> is gonna be filmed and you have to like permanently </joey>
<joey> be on entertaining mode. - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> We are only years away from like the first influencer </connor>
<joey> who was raised in an influencer, like, house. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean they're probably all ready born. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, as in like, what I'm saying is like, </connor>
<garnt> there's probably, there must be one of those kids </garnt>
<joey> on one of those family channels that's gonna be like </joey>
<joey> the first big like YouTuber or something </joey>
<joey> where his whole entire life has been documented </joey>
<joey> willingly, awful. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Awful, awful, just not black mirror (beep) right there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it really is. - Literally just Truman Show </joey>
<joey> right. - It is Truman Show. </joey>
<joey> - Terrifying, terrifying stuff. </joey>
<joey> The kid is raised, not, not, not on his, </joey>
<joey> what he should be taught in school, </joey>
<joey> but how to use Google Analytics and Google Trends. </joey>
<joey> What a terrifying thought, what a terrifying thought. </joey>
<garnt> Awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - So scary. </garnt>
<joey> What did you wanna say, Ashley? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] What do you wanna know about Boyhood, it won... </joey>
<joey> - How long did it like take to make. </joey>
<joey> - 2002 to 2013, so. - So 11 years. </joey>
<joey> - 11 years. </joey>
<joey> I know it got like canceled, almost got canceled </joey>
<joey> 'cause the cast members just wanted to stop doing it. </joey>
<joey> Like imagine being tied to a project for like 11 years </joey>
<joey> and having to do this one thing every year, </joey>
<joey> even though you never know if the film is gonna be </joey>
<joey> even be finished and released. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean that's, yeah, that's 'cause like 11 years </garnt>
<garnt> is literally, you know, a kid just starting school </garnt>
<joey> to almost graduating school. </joey>
<joey> That's a long time. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean. - Especially for a kid. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that is the entire point of the movie </joey>
<joey> 'cause you literally get to see this kid grow up. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. - A lot of it wasn't scripted. </joey>
<joey> A lot of it, I might be talking my (beep), </joey>
<joey> but like I think I had a rough plan, </joey>
<joey> but because they didn't know what would happen in life. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes they had to change the script every year, </joey>
<joey> depending on what happens, so I mean, I highly recommend </joey>
<joey> you guys watch it, it's a (beep)ing amazing film. </joey>
<joey> - Sounds good. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because like it's rare to see </joey>
<joey> a project that lasts for a long time </joey>
<joey> and you get to see the end of that project. </joey>
<joey> I think some some things like Attack on Titan </joey>
<joey> is such a rarity that we should cherish it whenever </joey>
<joey> we do get to see something like this. </joey>
<connor> - I guess I had a normal anime weekend </connor>
<joey> cause I also watched the new season of Demon Slayer. </joey>
<garnt> - Ah. - Oh yeah, how is that? </garnt>
<joey> I've been meaning to start it. </joey>
<joey> - It's so good, it's crazy, man. </joey>
<joey> So I watched the movie </joey>
<joey> right before I watched the new season, </joey>
<joey> and the animation in the season </joey>
<garnt> was like way better than the movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - I'm not kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I was watching the trailer thinking, </garnt>
<connor> waiting for some like insane, you know, </connor>
<connor> movie budget animation kick in. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh it's not really that much different </connor>
<connor> from the episodes. </connor>
<garnt> - I would say the last fight scene was pretty crazy though. </garnt>
<connor> - It was pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - The last fight scene was... - But nothing like that </connor>
<connor> - they didn't already do in the TV show. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess, yeah, the bar of quality was pretty high. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know who's in charge of the animation there, </connor>
<connor> but holy (beep), how do they even step it up more? </connor>
<joey> Like there was a... </joey>
<joey> - Man discovers Euphoria Tape. </joey>
<joey> (talking and laughing over each other) </joey>
<joey> - There is another level. - Yeah, I know. </joey>
<connor> It was just like how do they keep doing this? </connor>
<connor> How do they keep getting away with it? </connor>
<garnt> - It's like Mapper as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like every year they just step it up somehow. </garnt>
<connor> - Generally the new season of Demon Slayer is really good. </connor>
<garnt> And I hate to be that normally guy who's like, </garnt>
<garnt> yo, I just heard of this amazing anime </garnt>
<garnt> (background noise drowns out other sounds) </garnt>
<garnt> It's good, it's really good. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Really (beep)ing good. </connor>
<garnt> - I've been meaning to start it just </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I did actually finally get around to watching it, </garnt>
<joey> you know, after all those years. </joey>
<joey> And I really enjoyed it, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's ironic, I wanna watch it. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't seen the new season of Demon Slayer, </joey>
<garnt> and it's one of those shows where I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> I'll watch it when I feel like watching anime </joey>
<joey> with no pressure to like make a (beep)ing video about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - You'll know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because like to me, like Attack on Titan </joey>
<joey> and Demon Slayer, everyone always knows these shows. </joey>
<joey> I don't need to make another video about them yet. </joey>
<connor> - Think about it, the effort. </connor>
<garnt> (talking over each other) </garnt>
<connor> Come on, it wraps up, gotta do another attack. </connor>
<connor> - I'll do I'll do another one when it ends. </connor>
<connor> - You have to. And then that'll be it. </connor>
<joey> I think I've made like (beep)ing four videos. </joey>
<garnt> - Attack on Titan is still a masterpiece. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't form an opinion unless Garnt also agrees with it </connor>
<garnt> (talking over each other) on his video about it, you know. </garnt>
<connor> If he says it's a masterpiece, it's a masterpiece. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's a strong nine to a light 10, you know. </joey>
<joey> Like okay, there we go. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, would you say Demon Slayer, like, </joey>
<joey> would you say it's as good as the first season </joey>
<joey> or is it like even better? </joey>
<connor> - When did the last season come out? </connor>
<connor> How many years ago is that now? </connor>
<joey> - 20... - 2019. </joey>
<joey> - Right before we moved to Japan then, right? </joey>
<connor> - Was it 2019, I thought it was before that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I feel like, (talking over each other) </connor>
<joey> like I'm forgetting, but I feel like it's better </joey>
<joey> than the first season. </joey>
<connor> I feel like I've been enjoying it a lot more </connor>
<connor> and they got like right into it, it was nice. </connor>
<joey> No (beep)ing around. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - It was good, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the first season, </connor>
<connor> it did take a lot of time to get going. </connor>
<joey> I felt like it was just like the first half </joey>
<connor> of Demon Slayer, Season One is, I mean, </connor>
<connor> it was just very standard Shonen stuff, you know? </connor>
<connor> It was like, it was nice. </connor>
<connor> It was like comfort food, you know. </connor>
<connor> You knew what you were getting. </connor>
<joey> It was only until like the (beep)ing spider rock </joey>
<connor> where I feel like it actually got... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, kicked off. - Really, really good. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like this season so far I've I'm on episode seven. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, really impressed with it so far. </joey>
<garnt> Not a single episode I thought was boring. </garnt>
<connor> Pacing's really good, animation is just God tier. </connor>
<garnt> I must say like one aspect of Demon Slayer </garnt>
<garnt> that I've just like never really understood is like, </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno, it's a good show, right, </garnt>
<garnt> but do you think it deserves as much of like an insane hype </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan as it does? </garnt>
<joey> - what do you mean in Japan, it's worldwide. </joey>
<garnt> - No, but like, I feel in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> it's on another level. - It's hard to explain </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't live here like how insane </garnt>
<connor> the hype (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - Like everyone knows Kimetsu </garnt>
<connor> is (beep)ing popular everywhere, right? </connor>
<connor> Like everyone's watching the new season. </connor>
<connor> Everyone went to go see the new movie, </connor>
<connor> but like in Japan, when I say so when something </connor>
<joey> is inescapable that I feel Kimetsu in Japan </joey>
<joey> perfectly suits that word because everywhere you look, </joey>
<garnt> some product or some store or something </garnt>
<garnt> is doing something with Kimetsu. </garnt>
<connor> - Even like five year olds to like 80 year old grandfathers. </connor>
<garnt> - Like my entire Japanese side of the family has like </garnt>
<connor> a favorite, like a top three characters in Demon Slayer. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird like, </connor>
<joey> so I have like a four year old cousin, right, </joey>
<joey> who obviously loves Demon Slayer, right, </joey>
<joey> because (beep)ing every kid loves Demon Slayer right now. </joey>
<joey> So like for Christmas I was like </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Breathing young. </joey>
<joey> - So for Christmas I was like, I'm gonna get him something </joey>
<joey> Demon Slayer-related, right? </joey>
<joey> So I asked his mom, my cousin, just being like, </joey>
<joey> what is his favorite a character, right? </joey>
<joey> And she just lists off like two or three characters. </joey>
<joey> I was like, all right, cool, easy. </joey>
<joey> And then she was like, oh, by the way, </joey>
<joey> I like this character, your uncle likes this character. </joey>
<joey> Your aunt likes this character. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, what? </joey>
<garnt> Imagine my 60-something year old uncle being like, </garnt>
<joey> yeah, I (beep)ing love Shinobu, dude. </joey>
<joey> She's just like my (beep)ing favorite character. </joey>
<joey> I'm like that's so weird. </joey>
<joey> It's so weird how in Japan literally every one of every </joey>
<garnt> age generation is watching Demon Slayer or has watched it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's intense. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think it's the movie that's got it this big </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I didn't realize how big it was. </joey>
<joey> - No, I think... - It was already big before. </joey>
<joey> - I think. - Oh, yeah </joey>
<joey> How big it already is was the reason why the movie's like </joey>
<garnt> the (beep)ing like highest grossing from all time. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause like that one year where it beat out </joey>
<garnt> One Piece by manga sales like tenfold or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was, yeah. - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Before like, it was like the years before that, </garnt>
<garnt> the top selling manga was like One Piece, </garnt>
<garnt> One Piece, One Piece, One Piece, One Piece, One Piece. </garnt>
<joey> Well like a long shot, and then Demon Slayer came out, </joey>
<joey> and it was just like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> let me like 10 times like your previous sales. </joey>
<garnt> It hilarious when you saw the graph </garnt>
<joey> 'cause it was like all these other's shown in jump stuff, </joey>
<joey> and then it's like One Piece. </joey>
<garnt> It was like Demon Slayer. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Because within 2019, </joey>
<garnt> the rankings for like (speaking off mic) </garnt>
<garnt> rankings, like Demon Slayer was like every week. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every, yeah it was every week. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Jujutsu Kaisen came out (speaking off mic) </garnt>
<joey> It was like second and first, and then like </joey>
<joey> it's a fight between Demon Slayer. </joey>
<joey> - I was going to say Jujutsu Kaisen seems almost equally </joey>
<connor> as inescapable recently </connor>
<garnt> 'cause of the new movie. - 'Cause of the new movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause of the new movie, but even before that, </garnt>
<garnt> like after he got released, it just seemed like </garnt>
<garnt> it had such a big explosion, and I'm not sure like, </garnt>
<joey> I haven't been living in Japan long enough to see </joey>
<joey> like how big or how fast trends come and go. </joey>
<joey> But like it was way bigger than I thought </joey>
<joey> it was going to be. - Yeah, I mean like, </joey>
<garnt> in Japan trends come and go so quickly </garnt>
<joey> because I feel once something trends in Japan, </joey>
<joey> Japan just milks the absolute (beep) out it like, </joey>
<joey> you know, throw it back, if you can remember PPAP, </joey>
<joey> for instance back in the (beep)ing day, right? </joey>
<joey> For you kids, that's Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen. </joey>
<joey> When that was (beep)ing big, like three or four years ago, </joey>
<joey> however longer it was. - It was longer than that. </joey>
<joey> - I think it was longer than that, right? </joey>
<connor> Like that was (beep)ing everywhere in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> And it's crazy, like... </garnt>
<connor> - So when you go to the supermarket, they play it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, right, like it still has staying power, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what it is about Demon Slayer specifically </connor>
<connor> when it comes to like a trending anime in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Because every, I feel there's all always that one series </connor>
<connor> that is trending everywhere in Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> Like during the different periods, it's like, </connor>
<garnt> it's nothing new to Demon Slayer, I feel, in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> But I was like, what is it about Demon Slayer specifically </garnt>
<garnt> that it's literally appealing to every single generation? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. - I don't get it. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird. - It's a good show. </connor>
<connor> - Doesn't really have like the family- friendly appeal. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I can't imagine a four year old </garnt>
<garnt> watching these demons, like heads getting cut off, right? </garnt>
<connor> Being like, ha ha ha, ha. </connor>
<connor> - It's not the same as like Beauty and The Beast, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, right, it's not like a Disney IP </garnt>
<garnt> or, you know, like a Pixar IP or anything like that, right, </garnt>
<garnt> where it can appeal to the family. </garnt>
<joey> - Even comparing it to like other anime or other Shonen. </joey>
<joey> It's it's good, it's good. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a good show. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every time I make this argument, people just think, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, you're just a Demon Slayer like hater. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I'm not, I enjoy the show, </garnt>
<garnt> but I just don't understand what about this show </garnt>
<garnt> specifically that is literally inescapable. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't even think it's like my top three Shonen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, it's definitely not in my top three Shonen, it's not. </garnt>
<joey> But the animation is just so good. </joey>
<joey> It makes it so easy to watch, right? </joey>
<connor> Oh, this is just amazing, it's insane. </connor>
<garnt> - But the thing is it's not only </garnt>
<joey> because of the anime though, </joey>
<joey> but because you know, like the manga sales, </joey>
<connor> (talking over each other) </connor>
<connor> so it's something like fundamental about Demon Slayer </connor>
<garnt> that is somehow appealing to everyone and I don't get it. </garnt>
<garnt> And yet, the run time of the manga was so short. </garnt>
<joey> - Someone needs to write </joey>
<garnt> a (beep)ing dissertation on this man. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it is genuinely, really interesting </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I like, as good as Demon Slayer is, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how unique it is. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not... - Right? </garnt>
<joey> - It's not exceedingly unique in any one aspect at all. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's not like One Piece that's been around </garnt>
<garnt> for, you know, a hundred volumes, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I think Demon Slayer only has like 23, 24 volumes </garnt>
<garnt> or something, which for a Shonen Jump manga is really short. </garnt>
<joey> - Are there just this many mouth breathers in the world? </joey>
<joey> Just like... </joey>
<joey> - Just, it's only mouth breathers </joey>
<joey> - Maybe they were just lying in wait. </joey>
<garnt> - They come out from their basements. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like finally representation, all rise! </garnt>
<connor> - The total concentration technique </connor>
<joey> is breathing through your nose. </joey>
<garnt> - Take that ball gag out. </garnt>
<joey> - My nose has been blocked for like two weeks. </joey>
<joey> I've been a mouth breather for two weeks. </joey>
<joey> That's why I watched it. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Finally I can relate. </joey>
<joey> - I can relate to this anime. </joey>
<joey> - Hello gentlemen. </joey>

<joey> What is even like the top character in Demon Slayer </joey>
<joey> in terms of like popularity? </joey>
<garnt> - In terms of popularity? - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's gotta be Tanjiro, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Is it Tanjiro? </joey>
<connor> - It's... - No, it's not Zenitsu. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's... - No, it's not. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, this... - I can see it, man. </joey>
<joey> - There is a lot of Zenitsu fans. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, it depends because I think </joey>
<joey> the top five definitely is like Tanjiro, </joey>
<joey> Nezuko, Zenitsu, Agatsuma, and Shinobu </joey>
<connor> as like the top five. </connor>
<connor> But like hardcore fans, and there's a lot of hardcore fans </connor>
<connor> in Japan, all love all of the Hashiras. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the Hashiras are pretty cute. </connor>
<connor> - That's you know, like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if that's like their way of being like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, I'm a true fan. - Yeah, 'cause like </garnt>
<joey> with some shows you immediately know </joey>
<joey> what the most popular character's gonna be, </joey>
<garnt> like Jujutsu Kaisen, it's easily gonna be Gojo. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. - That character was built </garnt>
<garnt> to be the most popular character. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But like in, Demon Slayer, you just don't know </garnt>
<joey> who is gonna like, I can't think who it's gonna be. </joey>
<joey> And if it's Zenitsu, then... </joey>
<joey> - I've lost hope with Zenitsu. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm glad I'm not the only one </garnt>
<garnt> who can't (beep)ing stand Zenitsu. </garnt>
<garnt> - Saemi's so much cooler than Zenitsu. </garnt>
<connor> I (beep)in' hate Zenitsu. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't understand Zenitsu fans. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, it's, I mean, it's like I said, </joey>
<joey> it's, </joey>
<joey> it's a good show. - She's relatable. </joey>
<garnt> (talking and laughing over each other) </garnt>
<joey> - I wish they wish they had some power </joey>
<joey> that could make them useful. </joey>
<joey> I'm joking, I'm joking. </joey>
<joey> - I know why the cast is popular. </joey>
<joey> 'cause you can call every character a cinnamon bun. </joey>
<joey> - That's... - Why, why can you do that? </joey>
<garnt> - I dunno. - I hate you guys. </garnt>
<connor> Don't say that (beep). </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, Kamchacha. </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to like understand this myself, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - It's such an interesting social study, </garnt>
<garnt> just because we've seen the anime market. </garnt>
<connor> - (beep) your, your ENTP type, whatever the (beep) it is. </connor>
<connor> Tell me your favorite Hashira. </connor>
<joey> That's how I know if you're a real dealer. </joey>
<joey> - (Beep) your star sign. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You're a Zodiac cringe, bro. </joey>
<connor> Tell me your favorite Hashira and why. </connor>
<garnt> - Update that match.com for a profile. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, put that in the match.com profile. </joey>
<joey> - Before Demon Slayer, what would you say was like </joey>
<joey> the biggest like kind of cultural trend in terms of anime? </joey>
<joey> Has there been like an anime? </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there must have been like other animes </joey>
<garnt> that have... - Yeah in terms of like. </garnt>
<joey> - Call the Japanese public </joey>
<joey> as much as Demon Player is doing now? </joey>
<garnt> - Slam Dunk back in the day was definitely like... </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] That was Japan though mainly, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, in Japan, was like Slam Dunk </connor>
<garnt> was so big it became a cultural phenomenon. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you asking in Japan or like the world? </joey>
<joey> - I'm not asking in Japan. </joey>
<connor> I don't think in the world there has been one yet. </connor>
<connor> - No, not really. - No, not yet. </connor>
<joey> - One Punch Man was for a little bit while it was out. </joey>
<joey> - I look at One Punch Man and I'm just like... </joey>
<connor> - It was a big deal when it came out. </connor>
<joey> - It was a big deal, but I see </joey>
<joey> Attack on Titan, Season Four being </joey>
<joey> a bigger deal now. - That's 'cause it's had </joey>
<connor> more time to brew. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's had more time to like relish it. </connor>
<joey> - But even then comparing like Attack on Titan, Season Four </joey>
<joey> to some like other mainstream stuff, it's not there yet. </joey>
<joey> - It had hype, but it didn't really create like </joey>
<garnt> a cultural like shift or anything. </garnt>
<joey> - Whereas like sometimes you see in Japan, </joey>
<joey> there is a show that comes long that does create </joey>
<garnt> a cultural shift, like Slam Dunk back in the day. </garnt>
<garnt> - My Hero, maybe? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't, My Hero? - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It's hard to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] My Hero was really big here. </garnt>
<joey> - It is really big here. - It is really big. </joey>
<joey> I feel like... </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like Demon Slayer was just 1,000,000 times bigger. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like the My Hero hype train, </joey>
<joey> like we thought the My Hero hype train was big </joey>
<joey> and then Demon Slayer came out. </joey>
<connor> Even though I think they're like in terms of show quality, </connor>
<connor> they're around about the same... </connor>
<connor> - No, they're not. </connor>
<connor> - When we're all getting into this, Connor. </connor>
<joey> We are not getting into this, Connor. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just saying, I'm just saying. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, which, which side are you on? </joey>
<joey> - I think Demon Slayer is much better </joey>
<garnt> than My Hero. - Okay, I agree with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree. </garnt>
<joey> - How are you comparing them, (beep) off. </joey>
<connor> - I, I, I, I... </connor>
<connor> Okay, in the grand scheme of things </connor>
<joey> I think that's they're of like comparable level </joey>
<joey> of quality in terms of like if someone wants to say, </joey>
<joey> - I'm looking forward to the song right now. </joey>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> - What I'm trying to say is that </joey>
<connor> if they prefer My Hero Academia over Demon Slayer, </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna lose my (beep) unlike a lot of people </connor>
<connor> in the community, right. </connor>
<connor> - My Hero fell off, bro. </connor>
<connor> My Hero fell off, man. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing and talking over each other) </garnt>
<connor> Bro, My Hero took the (talking over each other). </connor>
<joey> - Look, everyone's telling me that My Hero's gonna come back </joey>
<garnt> and see Season Six with the My Villains Academia Arc, </garnt>
<garnt> which I've heard it's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> It might be amazing, it's Shonen. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what Black Clover fans </garnt>
<joey> have been seen for years now. </joey>
<joey> And it literally hasn't escaped out of the manga fans. </joey>
<garnt> We all know this. </garnt>
<joey> - I dunno what happened with My Hero on Season Three. </joey>
<connor> It just became like a snore-fest. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't even get to that point. </garnt>
<connor> - I couldn't believe I did. </connor>
<connor> I watched like Season Three and I was like </connor>
<connor> bored out my mind watching it. </connor>
<connor> I was like, this is so boring. </connor>
<connor> Just do something then, have something happen. </connor>
<joey> - Be heroes. </joey>
<joey> - Leave school or something for (beep)'s sake. </joey>
<joey> This is why Hunter Hunter was good </joey>
<joey> 'cause they (beep)ing moved, they actually did something. </joey>
<joey> They like got on with the (beep)ing storm. </joey>
<joey> - Until they didn't. </joey>
<joey> - Until he stopped writing it. </joey>
<joey> That's why the story stopped. </joey>
<joey> Not because he just kept going in, like... </joey>
<connor> It was like an I purgatory at this (beep)in' school. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, as an an anime only, </joey>
<joey> I think what drew me (talking over each other). </joey>
<joey> Yeah, as what drew me out of like what made me lose </joey>
<joey> a lot of hype between, in My Hero was, you know, </joey>
<joey> the first few arcs would concentrate on the school kids </joey>
<joey> doing their thing and I'm like, cool. </joey>
<joey> You're getting to see progression. </joey>
<joey> And then they started introducing the wider world </joey>
<joey> of the heroes and like these bigger, </joey>
<joey> these like vast plots that like pertain to the entire world. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, cool, this is amazing, this is interesting. </joey>
<garnt> Let's go back to high school afterwards. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, what? </joey>
<garnt> How can you do this to me? </garnt>
<joey> Like, let's go to, let's go to a concert arc that I, </joey>
<joey> I don't give a (beep) about where you just introduced like </joey>
<joey> the entire villain's world, and I'm just like, and yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It feels torn 'cause you're like, </connor>
<connor> just leave the safety net, you know? </connor>
<connor> Just leave it. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like you clearly have built this world that's interesting. </joey>
<joey> I think everyone likes the world. </joey>
<joey> Just let them get outta school, push them, come on, come on. </joey>
<joey> - Actually expand upon it. - Get on with it. </joey>
<joey> like actually do it, but I get it, it's safe. </joey>
<joey> You can milk it, you can get 10 more years out of it. </joey>
<joey> Stay in the (beep)in' school, never leave it. </joey>
<garnt> - Well isn't isn't the manga ending soon? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the manga's ending soon. </joey>
<connor> Like this year, right? - Right outta high school. </connor>
<connor> - They eventually get out of school? </connor>
<connor> (Ashley speaking off mic) </connor>
<joey> I'm never gonna finish it 'cause I've lost all interest </joey>
<connor> in the anime because I was like. </connor>
<joey> - I can't wait for these clips to get (beep)ing clipped, </joey>
<joey> and put on Twitter out of context. </joey>
<joey> I can't wait for Shonen to Twitter </joey>
<joey> to get on our asses for these clips. </joey>
<joey> - (beep), they're My Hero fans, what're they gonna do? </joey>
<joey> Ask their Mum for more Fortnite or Roblox, like (beep) off. </joey>
<connor> - Mama, cancel my Trash Taste merch! </connor>
<connor> - Come on, it fell off, it fell off, man. </connor>
<connor> - It did, it did, L-Ratio. </connor>
<joey> - No one talks about it, no one talks about My Hero. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's the biggest thing is </joey>
<connor> that I don't even think it's bad. </connor>
<connor> I just think it just... - It got boring. </connor>
<connor> It just got boring. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I didn't hate it, </connor>
<joey> but like no one talks about it now. </joey>
<joey> I feel like there's no point in watching it </joey>
<connor> 'cause who am I gonna talk to about it, no one watches it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I, you know, maybe the hype </joey>
<joey> might get reinvigorated in the new season. </joey>
<joey> Maybe Margaritas are right, maybe, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - If it is that good of a season where everyone </connor>
<connor> gets back on the hype train, fine. </connor>
<joey> I'll be a normie, I'll jump back on that hype train. </joey>
<joey> I'll get back into it, but like I need </joey>
<connor> a promise that something's gonna (beep)in' happen. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but like, it's been like a season </connor>
<joey> and a half of just boring stuff and it's been like </joey>
<joey> two movies of just boring stuff. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I watched the movie in the cinema as well </connor>
<garnt> and it was just like... </garnt>
<garnt> - I heard it was just a milk fest. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, well it was just nothing happened. </garnt>
<connor> It was just like I felt like I went in the loo. </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's what I hate </joey>
<joey> about Shonen movies in particular, right, </joey>
<joey> because like Demon Slayer is like an exception </joey>
<joey> because that actually adapted the manga, right? </joey>
<joey> But to me Shonen movies just feel like </joey>
<joey> very high budget filler episodes </joey>
<joey> where you watch the movie, has pretty animation. </joey>
<joey> - To be in every One Piece movie. </joey>
<connor> - Yes, I mean every One Piece movie. </connor>
<garnt> - That's true, that's why I don't watch anime movies </garnt>
<joey> 'cause there's just big fillers that make money. </joey>
<garnt> - That is true. - But I'm glad to see </garnt>
<garnt> I finally feel like Demon Slayer finally figured out </garnt>
<garnt> how to make a (beep) ton of money whilst also not </garnt>
<garnt> (beep)ing off TV watchers, just release the movie, </garnt>
<joey> make your billion dollars, and then just be like, </joey>
<joey> hey guys, before the new season starts, </joey>
<joey> here are your list in 20 chunk epi-, in 20 minute chunks. </joey>
<joey> You can just watch. </joey>
<joey> I thought that's great. </joey>
<joey> - The thing about the movie is I remember watching it </joey>
<connor> and I remember thinking this just feels like a TV season. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It literally had points where I could feel where </connor>
<joey> it cuts off for an episode, and then it continued. </joey>
<connor> - Get the money of the movie but then keep the TV style. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, so many more series are gonna start doing it </garnt>
<connor> because of how (talking over each other). </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I guaran(beep)ing-tee Attack on Titan's gonna do it. </garnt>
<joey> I have a feeling, I have this like... </joey>
<joey> - In what way? - I have this </joey>
<joey> - Do you think? </joey>
<garnt> - I have this gut feeling. - I don't think they will. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think about the ending </garnt>
<joey> of Attack on Titan is going to be a movie? </joey>
<garnt> - Bold prediction, I think it's gonna be a movie. </garnt>
<connor> - No, they wouldn't. </connor>
<connor> - Because there's no way... - It would be leaked. </connor>
<connor> - Because there's no way, there is no (beep)ing way, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like people in the industry saw how good Demon Slayer </garnt>
<garnt> did financially for the industry and go, </garnt>
<connor> we can do that again. </connor>
<connor> - I bet your tenfold hat on that, Joe. </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's gonna happen. </connor>
<joey> - Attack of Titan Final Movie Part One. </joey>
<joey> - I guarantee. - Of three. </joey>
<garnt> I am. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm going to bold prediction. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't care if this ends up being all like </garnt>
<joey> pull the age things, bold prediction. </joey>
<garnt> I think it's gonna be a movie. </garnt>
<joey> - (Ashley speaking off mic) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but that was a pretty-cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that was a pretty cool, right? </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Yeah, but still it actually pre-tells. </joey>
<joey> You have to know the characters. </joey>
<joey> - Does the Jujutsu Kaisen movie follow any source material? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] They actually release the prequel manga. </joey>
<garnt> - There's a prequel manga that... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] So it kind of follows the same formula as the... </garnt>
<joey> - That's all I care about. </joey>
<joey> I just don't wanna, like when I watch anime movies, </joey>
<garnt> I just wanna know that I'm not watching a filler episode. </garnt>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<garnt> - Like, look, don't get me wrong. </garnt>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<garnt> Don't get me wrong, I've I've seen like almost all </garnt>
<garnt> the One Piece movies and they're fun, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm not (beep)ing on the edge of my seat </garnt>
<garnt> waiting for the next one. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what you're going into with a Shonen anime movie. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, what's gonna happen. </garnt>
<joey> It's gonna be the very bog standard three act structure </joey>
<joey> where you know exactly what's gonna happen </joey>
<joey> and how it's happen, maybe there'll be a slight twist, </joey>
<joey> but you know, at the end of the day, it all gets resolved </joey>
<joey> because the plot needs to be resolved to move on. </joey>
<joey> It can't be exciting. </joey>
<joey> - It's just introduction, conflict, resolution. </joey>
<garnt> - And then we end up in the exactly the same place </garnt>
<connor> that we started. - Because it has to. </connor>
<joey> - All the time. </joey>
<connor> - That's what sucks, and that's why I have no interest in... </connor>
<garnt> - And thus, they continued on their quest. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how it ends. </garnt>
<joey> - Do you think that Chainsaw Man getting released </joey>
<garnt> this year is going to reach the same heights </garnt>
<garnt> as Jujutsu Kaisen? - I would hope. </garnt>
<joey> - I would like it to. - What I want to get... </joey>
<garnt> - As a fan of the manga, I want this </garnt>
<garnt> to be talked about this more. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I have a feeling it definitely has that potential now. </joey>
<garnt> It's been a long time since I've seen people </garnt>
<garnt> hype up this one IP this much. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I remember watching the trailer </garnt>
<garnt> and the trailer just like, you felt like the trailer </garnt>
<joey> just broke the (beep)ing anime Twitter for the day. </joey>
<joey> Like it got like a million views in a day </joey>
<garnt> on Twitter or something like that. </garnt>
<joey> - Less than a day. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It got like a million likes, like the actual tweet. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is (beep)ing nuts for an anime trailer. </garnt>
<connor> - It did not fall off, did not get ratioed. </connor>
<garnt> No, it did not. </garnt>
<joey> It ratioed every other anime trailer. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] That's for sure. </joey>
<joey> - I just hope like the hype doesn't collapse in on itself. </joey>
<joey> and everyone starts watching it </joey>
<joey> and people are just like, oh, this wasn't as good as it... </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I'm really scared of. </garnt>
<garnt> I really hope Map will like actually pull through with... </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't see why we have any reason to doubt Map though. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't doubt that. </joey>
<joey> - For Mapper or just like collecting the infinity stones? </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, they're killing it right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Attack on Titan, did you see Jujutsu Kaisen </joey>
<joey> (beep)in' Chainsaw Man? - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm praying, I'm praying. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that was, that was the anime talk </joey>
<connor> of Trash Taste. - we have a clear </connor>
<joey> just still dislike the quarantine zone for anime. </joey>
<connor> No more anime (talking over each other). </connor>
<joey> No more anime for... </joey>
<connor> - Even enough outtakes for one anime. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like there's, that's really like, </joey>
<garnt> from what I can see, I mean the, the only memorable things </garnt>
<garnt> that people are gonna remember this season </garnt>
<joey> are probably those shows. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And My Dress-Up Darling, </joey>
<joey> and that's pretty much going to be it. </joey>
<connor> - I think that's really good. </connor>
<joey> - The Manga's good. - That's a good show. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I've only seen like two episodes. </joey>
<connor> It's a good show. </connor>
<connor> - This is what happens when those kind of rom coms </connor>
<connor> or not slice of life, but kind of... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I dunno how to describe it. </connor>
<joey> That kind of genre of thing comes out, it always comes out. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's like 10 outta 10, 10 outta 10. </joey>
<joey> Everyone, everyone, everyone hypes it the (beep) up. </joey>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> This is like the best anime, and then no one talks about it. </joey>
<joey> Like right after it's gone, it's like it's forgotten, </joey>
<joey> but like to this day, there's still like </joey>
<connor> Naruto, Naratu, Naratu, right? </connor>
<connor> Like you, it's never gone, like, I don't know why. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you really fault me for not watching anime? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, I guess that's 'cause maybe </connor>
<connor> the characters you can't speculate </connor>
<connor> as much about or whatever, but. </connor>
<joey> - Well, like Naruto is like, </joey>
<joey> was a long running series that were... </joey>
<garnt> - A lot more, more grandiose and such. </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt's girlfriend, that's grandiose, right? </joey>
<joey> It's grandiose. (everyone laughing hysterically) </joey>
<joey> - That's grandiose. </joey>
<joey> - (audio cutting out) you're rooting for, right? </joey>
<connor> Big moments, big (beeps). - Big plot twists. </connor>
<joey> - Big plot twists. - Big plot twists. </joey>
<joey> Am I right, Connor? - NGR? </joey>
<connor> It's got everything you could speculate about on YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - I can't wait for Season Two of Rent-A-Girlfriend. </joey>
<connor> - See, I want those videos where it's like, </connor>
<connor> you know how like in those Naruto YouTube videos, </connor>
<joey> like what if thingy went against thingy, </joey>
<joey> and then they speculate it and it's like, </joey>
<joey> what if the main protagonist </joey>
<joey> from Rent-A-Girlfriend went on Tinder? </joey>
<joey> Let's speculate how well he would do. </joey>
<garnt> Personally, I think he would get a success rate of 95%. </garnt>
<garnt> He'd be slaying, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's just the theory. </garnt>
<joey> - That's just what I'm saying. </joey>
<garnt> Lemme know down below, everyone's like fighting and I dunno. </garnt>
<joey> - How dare he make that speculation? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I mean, I believe when Rent-A-Girlfriend </garnt>
<joey> Season Two comes out that's going to be worth watching </joey>
<joey> because that arc is legitimately going to be good. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it gonna cover that chapter though? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I shouldn't have brought up Rent-A-Girlfriend. </connor>
<garnt> I should have, you know, you were gonna bring it up </garnt>
<joey> so many times. - It's the most excited </joey>
<joey> he's been entire episode. </joey>
<connor> - You're so happy though. </connor>
<joey> - I just not, I, I, I can't hear </joey>
<joey> Rent-A-Girlfriend now without just laughing. </joey>
<joey> - There's some real clown (beep) </joey>
<joey> - If, if you know, you know, like it's like, it's. </joey>
<joey> I feel sorry for anime early watchers </joey>
<joey> because they're gonna watch season two </joey>
<joey> and they're gonna think it's really good </joey>
<joey> 'cause it, it was a really good, it was a really good arc, </joey>
<joey> and they're not gonna know what they have coming. </joey>
<joey> - They'll never know what hit 'em. </joey>
<joey> - They'll never know </joey>
<joey> what what's waiting for them on the other side. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, man. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess we're done talking about anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, stop talking about anime now. </garnt>
<garnt> We, everyone leaves. - This is it. </garnt>
<garnt> This this is your anime talk for the year. </garnt>
<garnt> - Finally played 13 Sentinels </garnt>
<connor> after Garnt's recommendation last week? </connor>
<garnt> - Yep, I beat it in three days. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so obviously you guys watched last week </joey>
<joey> where I recommended 13 Sentinels to these guys. </joey>
<connor> So I thought, you know, I didn't know if they would take </connor>
<connor> my recommendation or not. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt's in the well of recommendations. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was just like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna continue playing it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like playing it at a comfortable pace. </connor>
<connor> And then three days after recording, </connor>
<connor> Joey texts me and goes, I finished 13 Sentinels. </connor>
<connor> What the (beep), Joey! </connor>
<joey> - I literally went home that recording night, </joey>
<joey> downloaded it, started playing. I play. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I'll give it a couple of hours, all right? </joey>
<joey> Just like, like as Garnt said </joey>
<joey> I'll give it a couple of hours just to warm up. </joey>
<joey> See if I even get into the groove. </joey>
<garnt> I got into the groove all right </garnt>
<garnt> because the three days after that, </garnt>
<garnt> it was just me waking up having like six coffees </garnt>
<garnt> just so I could (beep)ing stay focused in this game. </garnt>
<garnt> Playing it for like 10 to 12 hours straight </garnt>
<garnt> and going to bed. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. - It is like, </joey>
<joey> now that I have someone to talk to it about, </joey>
<garnt> I can, without spoiling it. - We can't talk about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - We can't talk about it because like </garnt>
<garnt> I get like now someone finally understands </garnt>
<garnt> that I actually think 13 Sentinels </garnt>
<joey> might be the most insane plot I've ever seen </joey>
<garnt> in a video game and I haven't even finished it yet. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, it is by far one of the craziest like </garnt>
<joey> video game stories or just stories in general, </joey>
<joey> I've like sat through. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like, so Garnt last week made the comparison </joey>
<joey> of it's like Bokurano mixed with Steins Gate, all right? </joey>
<joey> As someone who's finished the game, </joey>
<joey> I can say he's right on that. </joey>
<joey> But only on like a surface level </joey>
<garnt> because it's like, it has elements of Bokurano, </garnt>
<garnt> like with the robots, and it has elements of Steins Gate, </garnt>
<garnt> which is the time traveling aspect. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you combine that with like </garnt>
<connor> Ghost in the Shell and The Matrix. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, God. </connor>
<garnt> - And just imagine all four of those mashed into one story. </garnt>
<joey> - How is that cohesive? </joey>
<joey> - Somehow, I don't know how. - I don't know how </joey>
<garnt> they did it, but it is cohesive. </garnt>
<connor> - Out of 10, out of 10? </connor>
<garnt> - Like strong nine. </garnt>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't finished it yet, but like playing </joey>
<joey> through it now, you get to about the third </joey>
<connor> of the way point, right, and you think like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm gonna say there are twists. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously. - You don't say. </connor>
<connor> - There are... - Don't spoil anything. </connor>
<connor> - There are twists in this story and I remember getting </connor>
<connor> about a third of the way through. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, I know the twist that's gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> I know that's gonna happen, and then sure enough, </connor>
<joey> what I predicted happened, and then that was just like </joey>
<joey> the twist that leaded into another twist </joey>
<joey> that leaded into a (beep)ing bigger twist. </joey>
<garnt> - There were moments as I was playing, </garnt>
<garnt> especially the second half, where you think like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, all right, this same story has been told </garnt>
<garnt> from 13 different perspectives, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So you're like, so you follow everything. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, okay, I think I know what's going on. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think I can predict what's about to happen. </garnt>
<garnt> But there were moments where a character would say one line </garnt>
<garnt> and I literally have to put my controller down </garnt>
<garnt> just to be like, I don't believe you just said that </garnt>
<garnt> because now what I thought I knew about this game </garnt>
<garnt> is completely out of the window. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, enough. - But it's still, </garnt>
<garnt> but it doesn't come outta left field either. </garnt>
<garnt> I genuinely want to know... - What the writing process. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the writing processes is. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so insane how many times you get (beep)in' </garnt>
<garnt> actual physical whiplash for like new plot elements </garnt>
<garnt> that get added that seems that make, </garnt>
<garnt> that it's like bat (beep) crazy </garnt>
<garnt> if you explain it outta context. </garnt>
<garnt> But like in context, it makes the most perfect sense. </garnt>
<garnt> It makes perfect sense. </garnt>
<joey> It makes like the (beep)ing Fate Law look like Disney. </joey>
<joey> You know, Kingdom. - I think I said to Garnt, </joey>
<garnt> I texted Garnt saying it makes the Kingdom Hearts Law </garnt>
<garnt> look like Sesame street. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, Kingdom Heart fans are going finally. </joey>
<joey> I can hear a story I can follow along with you know, </joey>
<garnt> like it's like, I can't put into words </garnt>
<garnt> how actual insane in the story is, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's (beep)ing incredible. </garnt>
<garnt> It works, I dunno how it works, but it just does. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, and, and we were saying like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how more people haven't heard about this. </garnt>
<garnt> Even in like the JRPG community </garnt>
<joey> Cause even like the JRPG community </joey>
<joey> is a very tight-knit community where as </joey>
<joey> if something's good, you normally hear about it from about </joey>
<joey> from like five different people in the JRPG community. </joey>
<garnt> - I think the problem is that </garnt>
<garnt> because when I tweeted out about it, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought I was gonna maybe get like </garnt>
<garnt> three people being like, woo, you know, about it, right. </garnt>
<garnt> because again, you don't hear about it, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it just like opened the hatch and like </garnt>
<garnt> all the 13 Sentinel fans came up being like, yo, let's go </garnt>
<garnt> because I got so much (beep)ing support </garnt>
<garnt> for being like, oh, he's finally (beep)in' played the game. </garnt>
<garnt> We've all been trying to get him to play kind of deal. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, I looked in, cause I was curious, </garnt>
<garnt> I looked into it being like, why have I not heard </garnt>
<garnt> of this game until Garnt told me about it. </garnt>
<connor> And it's because Atlas put literally zero money </connor>
<connor> into the marketing, so they kind of just released it </connor>
<connor> and was like, if you find it, here's a gem, </connor>
<connor> but if you don't find it, then you'll never know it existed. </connor>
<connor> And I don't... - Don't do any marketing? </connor>
<connor> - It's because it's literally impossible to explain </connor>
<connor> the story without spoiling it. </connor>
<joey> Actually, scratch that. </joey>
<garnt> It's literally impossible to explain the story, period. </garnt>
<garnt> Even if I did spoil it, I can't explain it. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like considering doing a Twitch stream </joey>
<joey> for this play-through 'cause I was like </joey>
<joey> more people need to like experience the story. </joey>
<joey> But then I was like thinking about what would </joey>
<joey> the experience be like for a viewer? </joey>
<joey> And like, if you switch off for like five minutes, </joey>
<joey> you go, you go make a cup of tea or something. </joey>
<joey> You're completely (beep)ing lost again </joey>
<joey> 'cause then you've missed a piece of information </joey>
<joey> that's important to someone else's plot somewhere. </joey>
<connor> - How long is the game total? </connor>
<connor> - I'd say around 30 hours? </connor>
<connor> - I think I put in like 32, 33 hours. </connor>
<garnt> - I'd say that's... - Which is short for a JRPG. </garnt>
<connor> - I was gonna say that's probably </connor>
<garnt> not a bad length to stream a game. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say any game that takes like over, like, </garnt>
<joey> If you're doing a full-time shift, right, </joey>
<garnt> let's say eight hours, if it takes more than a week, </garnt>
<connor> it's probably too long for Twitch. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean I tried to stream The Opposite of Seven, </garnt>
<joey> and that's a really, really long game. </joey>
<joey> And a lot of people fell off like </joey>
<garnt> maybe like after like stream six, stream seven. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, which is understandable. </connor>
<connor> - People do like those types of games to watch, </connor>
<garnt> especially people who have played it. </garnt>
<joey> They (beep)ing love those streams </joey>
<joey> 'cause they're like, I wanna see </joey>
<joey> - The reaction. - Someone else, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Reaction to the bits that I thought was insane. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So that that's cool, </joey>
<joey> but also, I don't know, it's easier. </joey>
<joey> It's normally easier to stream those kind of games as well </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're like, you're so invested that, like, </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't feel like you're alive almost. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just so into this. </garnt>
<connor> - I think as well, the problem I, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I thought about it too. </garnt>
<connor> I was like maybe I should stream it. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, but I thought about it and like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm glad I didn't because the reason why I played it </garnt>
<joey> back-to-back three days in a row is because I thought </joey>
<joey> to myself, if I don't play this game for more than a day, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to forget everything. </joey>
<joey> - Have you forgotten everything now? </joey>
<joey> - A lot of it, yeah, but like, I remember how it ends, </joey>
<joey> but like it's the build up to how to get to that end </joey>
<garnt> which is what makes it so interesting. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like you have the beginning and the end, </joey>
<connor> and the beginning's just like this, </connor>
<joey> and then some way it just goes whoosh! </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you're just like, I, we're here. </garnt>
<joey> - We made it here somehow. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how we got here, but we got here. </joey>
<joey> - We got here. </joey>
<joey> - And it was a bat-(beep), insane journey, </joey>
<joey> but it's like one of the, most, it is... </joey>
<garnt> - It is literally the sourced intro to the game. </garnt>
<joey> It's just like you, like, in this game, </joey>
<garnt> you follow as this protagonist, or do you? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have tempted to play </garnt>
<joey> 'cause you guys have hyped it up so much, </joey>
<joey> but I'm like, I would have to stream it. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't justify playing a game that much </joey>
<connor> and not, not monetizing it </connor>
<joey> That's crazy. - God forbid. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna, okay, the thing is I wanna see you try and do it </garnt>
<joey> just to see, no, no, no, no, just to see </joey>
<garnt> if your audience can even keep up. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't even know if I can keep up, bro. </connor>
<garnt> Is there a skip option for the cut scenes? </garnt>
<joey> - It's all cut scenes. - Oh, (beep). </joey>
<joey> - That's gonna be hard to not. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you're basically... </joey>
<connor> - Do they give you options to skip? </connor>
<connor> - No, okay, let's get that... </connor>
<joey> - There is a fast forward option </joey>
<joey> for dialogue you've already experienced, </joey>
<joey> but like... - Because you experience </joey>
<garnt> the same scenes most of the time. </garnt>
<joey> - I say this with like zero irony, you need the dialogue. </joey>
<connor> - You need the dialogue. </connor>
<joey> - I know you do, that's the thing is it's hard </joey>
<joey> 'cause if I'm like, the skip buttons there. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's just say it's not a game I can see you playing. </garnt>
<connor> - No. Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's probably why I think it would be funny </connor>
<connor> to play it as well cause I'm just like... </connor>
<connor> While you spent three days playing that, </connor>
<connor> I spent three days, four days playing Jump King. </connor>
<joey> - Four days playing Jump King? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, how was that experience? </joey>
<garnt> - Hell. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Awful. </garnt>
<joey> - It looked like it, </joey>
<garnt> while I was enjoying myself in my own space, </garnt>
<garnt> you were being ridiculed by tens of thousands of people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know, I, yeah, it was tough. </garnt>
<garnt> It's tough, it's really like soul destroying. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a really good game though. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna play it. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how to describe it. </joey>
<joey> It's like when Calli was on and talking to us about it, </joey>
<joey> I don't think you can appreciate this game </joey>
<connor> and how difficult it is until you play it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I certainly didn't because looking at it, </joey>
<connor> it looks so simple that it... - Yeah, it looks easy. </connor>
<joey> - It looks so simple. </joey>
<joey> - How hard can it be to - Just jump in it. </joey>
<joey> - Jump, just jump </joey>
<joey> - Like how hard can it be to judge the jump, </joey>
<joey> but then you're like, oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> Well the only instinct that gives you, </joey>
<joey> like, you cannot see any indication of how long </joey>
<joey> this jump is gonna be other than your muscle memory. </joey>
<joey> How long you hold the space bar or controller </joey>
<joey> and how long are you gonna jump? </joey>
<joey> And it is soul crushing because there are some jumps </joey>
<joey> where it's like, it is like... - Pixel perfect? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's like a 1/10th of a millisecond window </joey>
<joey> where you have to get it precise, and if you (beep) it up, </joey>
<joey> you have to go back and do 50+ perfect jumps </joey>
<joey> to get to the opportunity to (beep) that one up again, </joey>
<joey> which you'll probably (beep) up again. </joey>
<joey> So it's really soul destroying and yeah. </joey>
<joey> At the first game, I beat it, </joey>
<joey> I did it in one eight-hour stream which was long, </joey>
<joey> but it was fun 'cause, you know, I left </joey>
<joey> text-to-speech things on so people were just insulting me. </joey>
<joey> They were like Connor, you can't stream. </joey>
<joey> You can't keep streaming this. </joey>
<joey> You'll get a DM save for streaming </joey>
<joey> White Men Can't Jump and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> And they were like, Connor, </joey>
<joey> just turn your monitor upside down. </joey>
<joey> You'll be making good progress, and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> Just insulting me, and it was really fun. </joey>
<joey> I think it made for a really good stream. </joey>
<joey> And then I decided, 'cause Calli said </joey>
<joey> that she think I could do the DLC, </joey>
<joey> and I regret doing the DLC. </joey>
<connor> The DLC was so much. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I remember you finishing the original Jump King </connor>
<joey> in like one day and everyone's like celebrating. </joey>
<joey> I was like good for you, 'cause I remember </joey>
<joey> tuning in the morning and tuning in the night </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like Connor's still (beep)ing on this. </joey>
<joey> He was all on this bull(beep). </joey>
<joey> And he was like, finally, you've done it. </joey>
<joey> And then when I saw Calli told you to do the DLC as well, </joey>
<connor> I was like, oh, so it's just a little extra </connor>
<connor> that would take like half the time. </connor>
<connor> - Extra bonus. - An extra bonus stage </connor>
<connor> that will take half the time. </connor>
<connor> And I remember tuning in one day </connor>
<joey> you were doing it tuning in the next day, </joey>
<joey> you were still doing it. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like, (beep) this guy really likes this game. </garnt>
<connor> - Cruel man, the DLC is so much harder than their base game. </connor>
<joey> So I think, I dunno how many people have beaten </joey>
<joey> the base game, but I know that only 2% of the people </joey>
<joey> who have it on stream beat the second DLC. </joey>
<joey> And there's a third DLC, which is even harder, </joey>
<connor> which I'm too afraid to attempt. </connor>
<garnt> - Didn't Ludwig beat like all three of them in like an hour. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Ludwig's insane, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think Ludwig's first run of it though did take 40 hours </connor>
<joey> of the last DLC, so just like. - Built different. </joey>
<joey> - He's crazy though, he is insane. </joey>
<joey> I'm like you can't appreciate these games </joey>
<joey> and how good Ludwig is at them until you do them yourself. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, this is insanity. </joey>
<joey> Like this is insane. </joey>
<connor> Like the sheer amount of muscle memory required </connor>
<connor> for this game is just absurd. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a frob software game, right? </garnt>
<connor> (talking over each other) </connor>
<garnt> Muscle memory. </garnt>
<joey> - If you die a dog soldier, you go back to the swamp point, </joey>
<joey> which could be far, but in this game it's like, </joey>
<connor> you can lose like two hours of progress. </connor>
<garnt> - There's like no checkpoint anywhere, right? </garnt>
<connor> - No, so the base game, there's points where you can get </connor>
<joey> to where you're kind of safe. </joey>
<joey> You can't fall too far, </joey>
<joey> but the second DLC, there's points </joey>
<joey> where like you can fall massively. </joey>
<joey> And there's never any safe points. </joey>
<joey> And in the third one again, there's another, </joey>
<garnt> even harsher jump, and it's just brutal. </garnt>
<garnt> I recommend trying it. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of - Yeah, I wanna try it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I wanna try it as well. </joey>
<joey> - Although, you know, there's rage games. </joey>
<garnt> There's like not, not like getting over it, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, there's like Cat Mario games back in the day. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like those flash games </garnt>
<joey> where they just like troll. </joey>
<joey> It was just (beep)ing with you. </joey>
<garnt> This game was, it feels like you never blame </garnt>
<joey> the game when you fail. </joey>
<joey> Like it's always you. </joey>
<joey> You were the one who didn't do it right. </joey>
<joey> You never feel like you were unfairly played. </joey>
<joey> There are some sneaky things they do here and there. </joey>
<joey> But it's a very rewarding experience. </joey>
<joey> However, I do not wanna do it again for a long time. </joey>
<joey> I had horrible anxiety on the last day </joey>
<joey> because I was getting to the end. </joey>
<joey> I just wanted it to be (fuck)ing over with </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was so close and if I fell, </joey>
<joey> I would go all the way back down. </joey>
<joey> And it's just horrible. </joey>
<garnt> I think my heart rate was like resting </garnt>
<garnt> at like 110 or something 'cause it was just, </garnt>
<garnt> it was nerve wracking 'cause you know </garnt>
<garnt> if you (beep) up this one jump </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta redo it for three hours. </garnt>
<joey> So that's one point during the DLC on the 2nd day </joey>
<joey> where halfway through the stream, </joey>
<joey> I'd gotten into the final part. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Somehow, like I was stuck on this one stage for hours, </joey>
<joey> and then I just started going through </joey>
<joey> all the stages perfectly, and I was on the very last stage </joey>
<joey> and I was like, oh my God, I'm gonna do it. </joey>
<joey> Like my heart is like 120. </joey>
<joey> I'm like (beep)ing holding the space bar </joey>
<garnt> and then I'd do one big (beep) up, </garnt>
<garnt> and I lose like half the progress I'd made. </garnt>
<garnt> And I couldn't, and the rest of the stream, </garnt>
<joey> I couldn't get back to where I was. </joey>
<joey> I was just so miserable, I went to bed just so sad. </joey>
<joey> I was like, this is horrible. </joey>
<joey> I just couldn't do it, I couldn't do that. </joey>
<joey> I'm a fake gamer. I couldn't do it. </joey>
<joey> - Why would you do that to yourself? </joey>
<joey> - Because that, that... - Content, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - It was the content, fantastic Twitch content. </joey>
<joey> People love watching a man go insane and be miserable. </joey>
<joey> - Of course they do. - You know. </joey>
<joey> I dunno why anyone would ever play those games just for fun. </joey>
<joey> - On all hours straight. - I only did it... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I was gonna ask would you ever consider </connor>
<connor> playing a game like this if you didn't </connor>
<connor> stream it? - Absolutely not. </connor>
<joey> No you couldn't, but why would you do, </joey>
<joey> because there's absolutely no reason to do it, right? </joey>
<joey> If I do it on Twitch, it's like, okay, </joey>
<joey> well, it's great content. </joey>
<joey> People, it's really easy to understand, you know. </joey>
<joey> You played 13 Sentinels. </joey>
<joey> It's like hey, so here's the 15 characters. </joey>
<garnt> You need to know all the in depth law about, by the way, </garnt>
<joey> miss 10 seconds of dialogue, that changes everything. </joey>
<joey> - Jump King, it's like my Mum can understand it. </joey>
<joey> If you fall, that's bad. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] You're a king who jumps. </joey>
<joey> - You literally go up and if you fall, </joey>
<joey> you can sometimes fall really far. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And that's bad, you know. </joey>
<joey> It's super easy to get people invested in. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, it's just fun watching someone go insane. </joey>
<joey> I think, I don't know, I would never do it off stream. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. - Ever, why would you? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand why people have done it. </garnt>
<garnt> What compels you to keep going? </garnt>
<garnt> What compelled me to keep going. </garnt>
<garnt> - Self-satisfaction, right? - Yeah, right. </garnt>
<garnt> What compelled me to keep going is that I don't want people </garnt>
<garnt> to call me a little bitch for quitting. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, I've gotta keep going. </garnt>
<connor> Everyone's gonna call me a little bitch. </connor>
<connor> - Basically. - I also am very stubborn, so. </connor>
<connor> Oh, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Callie's still going. </joey>
<joey> - Callie is still going right now. </joey>
<joey> Is that the 3rd DLC? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> But I mean, by the time this has gone on </connor>
<joey> I'm sure Callie's beating it, right? </joey>
<joey> I'm sure. - Let's hope so. </joey>
<joey> - Hope you, hope you... </joey>
<joey> - Callie's insane, Callie also is like insane on it. </joey>
<joey> Callie beat the base game in like an eight-minute speed run. </joey>
<joey> Very insane. </joey>
<joey> - Holy (beep). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, really good stuff, real insane. </joey>
<joey> Again, I've much more appreciation </joey>
<joey> for anyone who beat that game now. </joey>
<joey> - Would you ever consider speed running? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was about to ask, would you ever want.. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I would the base game. </joey>
<joey> Base game is like easy mode now. </joey>
<joey> Like that's, there's only a few jumps </joey>
<joey> that scare me in the base one. </joey>
<joey> The rest of it's like super easy </joey>
<connor> 'cause there's like there's margin of error </connor>
<connor> 'cause like, if the platform's wider, </connor>
<connor> you can obviously move a lot, but sometimes </connor>
<connor> they do like just like a little pole. </connor>
<joey> and you have literally like, </joey>
<joey> you have to get the arc perfect. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> And sometimes there's ice on the platform </joey>
<connor> so you can fall off or they're rounded, so you can... </connor>
<garnt> - It just sounds like those like really punishing, </garnt>
<connor> like NES and like Super Nintendo games. </connor>
<garnt> I feel that's like kind of becoming a trend again </garnt>
<garnt> especially in the gaming like e-world, I feel. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like, but sometimes those NES games </connor>
<garnt> were just bull(beep). - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like unfair. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like this was an experience that is very challenging, </joey>
<joey> but also very rewarding weirdly. </joey>
<connor> Like I've never felt more accomplished about a video game. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I felt that when I streamed Hollow Night </garnt>
<connor> a while back, like that game is like (beep)ing unforgiving </connor>
<connor> in some ways, and to this day I haven't beaten it </connor>
<connor> just 'cause this is one ball stone </connor>
<garnt> where I'm just like, this is bull(beep). </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<garnt> Those are the types of games that when </garnt>
<garnt> we finally overcome it... - But when you beat it, </garnt>
<garnt> when you finally beat it, (beep), yeah, let's go. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, I feel like I learned </garnt>
<joey> a lot about myself in those 30 hours. </joey>
<joey> I learned an awful lot about me and who I am by just. </joey>
<connor> - You kind of have to, right. </connor>
<connor> You play a game like that for that long, </connor>
<garnt> which I don't know how the (beep) you do it. </garnt>
<garnt> Respect to you for being a true gamer. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't even play game. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't even play a game that has like more than five inputs </garnt>
<garnt> for like more than three hours, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> (Beep)ing just pressing one space bar </garnt>
<garnt> and just jumping for like 10 hours. </garnt>
<joey> I can't (beep)ing do that. </joey>
<garnt> I was sweating playing 13 Sentinels </garnt>
<garnt> and you literally just press soak for awhile. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure I'm getting, I'm pretty sure I'm getting </joey>
<joey> repetitive strain injury, repetitive, what is it called? </joey>
<joey> - Ah, RSI? - RSI. </joey>
<joey> - RSI. - I was pretty sure </joey>
<connor> I was getting that after a while 'cause I was like... </connor>
<connor> It's mind-numbing. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's good though. </connor>
<connor> I really do recommend trying it. </connor>
<garnt> - I definitely wanna stream it. </garnt>
<connor> - Just to, you should, I really wanna see you stream it. </connor>
<garnt> - We should race. - Huh? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you guys should do a stream together. </garnt>
<joey> - We should race it. - I'll commentate. </joey>
<garnt> - That's stressful. </garnt>
<connor> - No, it's fun, 'cause if you, no one expects you </connor>
<garnt> - I don't wanna do it on my own. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, the first time. </connor>
<connor> - So you want me to suffer more, Joey. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't want to be alone by myself </garnt>
<connor> with Chad just (beep)ing doing this, right? </connor>
<connor> - I want someone to be there with me. </connor>
<garnt> - People would love that. </garnt>
<connor> People would love that, you gotta do this now. </connor>
<connor> This is a brilliant idea. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, come on, let's do it. </garnt>
<connor> - If you go in... </connor>
<garnt> Yes, Garnt, do it. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm dragging you in. - It's easy. </connor>
<joey> Just press the space bar. </joey>
<joey> - I'll (beep)in' do it, I just love the way Joey's like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I'll do it, right, Garnt? </joey>
<connor> You're with me, right? </connor>
<joey> - Don't say you're gonna beat it. </joey>
<joey> Just say you're gonna just gonna play it. </joey>
<connor> Let's see what happens. </connor>
<joey> - If I play, I'm gonna beat it. </joey>
<joey> That's the thing, right, if I start... </joey>
<connor> If I start, I'm saying it. </connor>
<joey> If I start, then that's my commitment. </joey>
<joey> - Well now we can't (beep)ing do it with you </joey>
<connor> 'cause I have to finish it now. </connor>
<joey> [Connor] - You don't have to, you don't have to. </joey>
<joey> No, you don't, you don't, you don't have to. </joey>
<connor> You don't have to, you can do it. </connor>
<joey> - You know what, Mama didn't raise no quitter. </joey>
<garnt> - Mama didn't raise a bitch. </garnt>
<connor> - It's in 4K, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - She raised someone who was so afraid of failure </connor>
<garnt> that if you don't start something, you don't need to quit. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're gonna play it, you're gonna play it, </garnt>
<garnt> both, you should do it. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - But no, like yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it looks fun, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - Big air quotations in fun. </garnt>
<joey> - Like you completing it looked fun. </joey>
<joey> I didn't like see... </joey>
<garnt> - It didn't look fun, it looked satisfying. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's very satisfying. </garnt>
<joey> - It's very satisfying. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's got a good soundtrack too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Meanwhile, like Joey's doing his best to try </joey>
<joey> and like convince me to not pick up </joey>
<joey> Final Fantasy online because... </joey>
<joey> - Shut up! (background noise drowns out other sounds) </joey>
<connor> I'm doing this man a favor right now. </connor>
<joey> - I'm saving a life. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Whoo! </joey>
<joey> - It was like a (talking over each other) game, apparently? </joey>
<joey> - So last week, I off, like me and Sydney </joey>
<joey> off-handedly mentioned that we maybe were interested </joey>
<joey> in getting into Final Fantasy Online, </joey>
<joey> and Joey like, Joey perked up, like we just mentioned </joey>
<joey> that we wanted to try crack or heroin or something. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, Garnt, what did you just say? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I'd be more understanding </garnt>
<joey> if you said you wanted to try heroin, you know. </joey>
<joey> I think doing heroin is less life-threatening. </joey>
<joey> - Is it that addictive? - I guess. </joey>
<joey> I've had friends who have started it since day one </joey>
<joey> because they're big, Final Fantasy fans, </joey>
<connor> and myself, I was like, okay, I'll give it a go. </connor>
<connor> But then I remember, but then like 'Nam flashbacks </connor>
<connor> came back to me of like times where I used to be </connor>
<connor> like heavily addicted to MMOs, right? </connor>
<connor> Where like, I would literally, what, </connor>
<connor> basically think of my three day streak with 13 Sentinels, </connor>
<connor> but over the course of like three years. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right, right? </connor>
<connor> That was my experience with MMOs, right? </connor>
<connor> - Right, that's why I don't touch them. </connor>
<connor> - And so I tried it. </connor>
<joey> I did the trial for Final Fantasy 14 'cause you could do </joey>
<joey> like a trial period without actually purchasing the game. </joey>
<joey> And I did that, really fun, but I was, I stopped myself. </joey>
<connor> I was like, no, I cannot, I cannot do this. </connor>
<connor> - You've got some willpower. </connor>
<connor> - I, dude, I must, I unlocked 100% of my brain </connor>
<connor> to be like, Joey, you are not doing this now, </connor>
<garnt> not during the busiest year of your life. </garnt>
<garnt> You are not gonna upload for a year straight </garnt>
<garnt> if you start this right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I didn't notice, like </garnt>
<joey> I didn't know what you were doing in the, like the past </joey>
<garnt> the days that you were playing 13 Sentinels, </garnt>
<garnt> but I did notice, normally Joey uploads, </garnt>
<garnt> like every other day on his Joey channel. </garnt>
<joey> Suddenly he stopped uploading. </joey>
<garnt> Dude, I didn't even tweet for three days. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I was literally shut out from the world. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it the gamer thing where you wake up </garnt>
<garnt> and immediately start playing until you fall asleep </garnt>
<connor> for three days? - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I love those, love those. </connor>
<joey> - That was me for three days with 13 Sentinels. </joey>
<joey> But like, but like 14, Final Fantasy 14, </joey>
<joey> I was like, I'm going to be that way. </joey>
<joey> I just know it because I love Final Fantasy games. </joey>
<joey> I love MMOs, and like every around me is playing it as well, </joey>
<connor> right, so I'm like there's no better feeling </connor>
<joey> than playing an MMO with a bunch of mates, right? </joey>
<joey> That's true obviously. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, no, I have to stop myself. </joey>
<joey> I wanna be a responsible adult </joey>
<garnt> that actually does what he needs to do and what's important. </garnt>
<joey> - You need to be a functioning adult. </joey>
<garnt> - I need to be a functioning member of society </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm not going to do this. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, you know, and (beep)ing all my friends are like, </garnt>
<connor> so when are you gonna start 14 Joey? </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, stop it. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the forbidden thing. </connor>
<garnt> I just don't go near them. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just, I know that they're bad for everything in life. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<garnt> I'm sure I'll have fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - You were you like into WoW and MMOs back in the day? </garnt>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> - You know, looking back, I just think this is insane. </joey>
<joey> I would just sit there clicking on trees for eight hours. </joey>
<joey> - Right? - And I'm like, what is this? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I can't, why did I do that? </joey>
<connor> I'm so emotionally invested. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like, don't get me wrong. </connor>
<joey> If I was a teenager like now and 14 came out, </joey>
<joey> I'd be on that (beep) (beep)ing every day, right </joey>
<garnt> but because I have less responsibilities than I do now. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause when we did the Room Scape stream, </joey>
<joey> like I remember I had a lot of fun </joey>
<joey> and then it dawns on me that whatever we were doing </joey>
<joey> was like twice the speed or like how much faster was it? </joey>
<connor> - Was like 20, 20 or 10 times. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's it was like more than 10 times the speed. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was 20 times speed? </garnt>
<connor> - It was like, yeah, it was like 20, 10 or 20 XP. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - But it took us the whole day </joey>
<joey> just to get to one single boss battle. </joey>
<garnt> - Welcome to Room Scape. - How long would that take </garnt>
<garnt> if we didn't have the XP ball to play with? </garnt>
<connor> - Probably... - A lot, I don't... </connor>
<garnt> - Like a couple weeks. - Yeah, like in Room Scape </garnt>
<garnt> as well, I think like the last few levels </garnt>
<joey> are like the equivalent to the entire like levels before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like getting to like 95, </joey>
<connor> and doing like to 99 is like the same as getting to 95. </connor>
<garnt> - Literally, man discovers how much </garnt>
<garnt> of a grind Room Scape is. </garnt>
<joey> - People say One Piece fans have commitment. </joey>
<joey> Like what? </joey>
<joey> - Well, the thing was, I think the thing </joey>
<connor> that made Room Scape so kind of addictive </connor>
<joey> is that you could kind of just like, kind of hands off it, </joey>
<joey> but kind of not, like you could </joey>
<joey> just kind of it's other monitor (beep). </joey>
<joey> You can just click. </joey>
<joey> I knew people who would do that. </joey>
<joey> They would have their normal life, </joey>
<garnt> but always have, have Room Scape on the other monitor </garnt>
<joey> and they would be like... </joey>
<garnt> - Kinda sounds like a catch game. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm just gonna say it. </connor>
<joey> - Pretty much, pretty much. - But they're never gonna </joey>
<joey> cut you off, they never had sanity or anything. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh, what's the other one? </connor>
<connor> - It's like playing Achmeds with unlimited sanity. </connor>
<connor> This just never ends. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, it literally was like, </garnt>
<joey> it's just, it never stopped you. </joey>
<joey> I think that's what made it so good. </joey>
<garnt> 'cause they never tried to stop you. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> I feel like people probably put more money in, </joey>
<joey> cause it wouldn't stop you, but they never had, </joey>
<garnt> they just had a membership. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Those were the good old days. </joey>
<joey> - Good old days (talking over each other). </joey>
<joey> - So yeah, I'm doing everything in my power right now </joey>
<joey> to stop Garnt and Sydney from getting Final Fantasy 14. </joey>
<joey> 'cause... - You shouldn't. </joey>
<joey> You shouldn't. - You shouldn't. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, we were just like mildly curious, right? </joey>
<joey> We were just like, we were just like, </joey>
<joey> maybe we maybe we'll look into this. </joey>
<joey> And then... - That's how every </joey>
<garnt> drug addiction starts. </garnt>
<joey> - We were just like... - Mild curiosity. </joey>
<joey> - We were just like mildly curious. </joey>
<joey> And then we saw that it had gotten so popular </joey>
<joey> that they literally removed it from the store </joey>
<joey> 'cause I remember we just tried to like download. </joey>
<connor> - So that made you want to have to play. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. - Whoa. </joey>
<joey> - Classic, classic Tinder lover. </joey>
<garnt> If it's hard to get, then he wants it even more. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like Sydney like mentions </garnt>
<garnt> that she's gonna try and download it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, I'm like downstairs playing </garnt>
<garnt> my 13 Sentinels or whatever, and she's like, </garnt>
<joey> "Garnt, I don't know what's wrong, </joey>
<joey> "but I don't, I can't download it." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just (beep) it, "Sydney, come on, come on Sydney." </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Come on, woman! </connor>
<connor> - "Have you never downloaded a game before Sydney? </connor>
<joey> "Come on," and I so I go up and I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> "Sydney, you press the download button." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like trying to scroll down to find out </joey>
<joey> where the (beep) this download button is. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, is this the download button? </joey>
<joey> No, just goes into another pop-up. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like trying to like navigate this site. </joey>
<joey> I like try to go to the steam page. </joey>
<garnt> There's gotta be a download button. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, I'm like so confused. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I realized that </garnt>
<garnt> they had to like take it off the store. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because their servers literally aren't big enough. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because the servers literally </garnt>
<joey> are too small to handle the player influx </joey>
<garnt> that came in with the new expansion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mind you, this is Square Enix, </garnt>
<joey> literally one of the biggest (beep)ing games. </joey>
<garnt> - What's so good about this expansion </garnt>
<garnt> that like... - I don't know, but now... </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the story. - I wanna know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've I've heard it's the story, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - And when we couldn't download it, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, is there any other way to download it? </garnt>
<joey> So I start researching to see if there's any other way </joey>
<joey> to download it 'cause now I really wanna (beep)in' play it. </joey>
<joey> - What, are you like hacking into the streaming server? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Garnt's like where is it? </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, there must be a way. </joey>
<joey> No, they couldn't have just, </joey>
<joey> they couldn't have just taken the file away. </joey>
<joey> Surely there's a way to download the file, </joey>
<joey> but like it's yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You, you literally can't download it. </joey>
<connor> You can't buy it, You can't any, like </connor>
<connor> it's the only instance I've seen in the gaming community </connor>
<connor> where I've tried to give a money company </connor>
<connor> and they've refused to accept my money. </connor>
<connor> - A money company. - Sorry, a company money. </connor>
<joey> I've tried to give a company my money </joey>
<joey> and they refuse to accept it. </joey>
<connor> - Just throw it in the air. </connor>
<joey> Just let the service be broken and still take the money. </joey>
<joey> I'll fix it, we'll fix. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, well, we'll definitely fix it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so I've heard sales are coming back </joey>
<garnt> on the 25th of February, so... - Stop. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, of January, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> So that's that's coming up, so... </joey>
<garnt> - The reason why 16's been delayed for like two years </garnt>
<joey> is because (speaking off mic). </joey>
<connor> - I remember when that game initially released </connor>
<connor> the Final Fantasy Online, but it was terrible. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Right. </garnt>
<joey> It was so bad that they removed it and they built it. </joey>
<joey> They built it up from scratch. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Again. </connor>
<connor> And then the rerelease just (beep)ing exploded. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, well I even remember when it re-released </connor>
<garnt> that wasn't that big, was it, I don't think it was. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was big, but nowhere near as it is now. </garnt>
<connor> - Now it's there, I can't escape it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's been a game where I remember </connor>
<connor> like one or two people talking about it. </connor>
<connor> It wasn't like a massive explosion, </connor>
<connor> but like slowly over time, </connor>
<connor> I just keep hearing it more and more and more. </connor>
<connor> It's it's really, it really just (beep)ing exploded </connor>
<joey> with this new Endwalker expansion. </joey>
<garnt> That's the name, right, Endwalker? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, you know, I've been to a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> themed cafes in Japan, but the most I've ever been </garnt>
<garnt> to one cafe is the (beep)ing Final Fantasy 14 Cafe </garnt>
<joey> just 'cause all my friends like, </joey>
<garnt> "You wanna go to the Final Fantasy 14 Cafe again?" </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I don't even know this game, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you dragging me into this? </garnt>
<joey> (Ashley speaking off mic) </joey>
<connor> Shut up! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know, I mean, I'm sure it's a good game. </joey>
<connor> I'm just never gonna do it </connor>
<connor> because I don't wanna get addicted. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a good game. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, you know, have responsibilities now. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I'm sure it's a good game </joey>
<joey> and I've just been looking for a new game to get into </joey>
<joey> because it's like... - Minesweeper. </joey>
<connor> - Hmm? - Minesweeper. </connor>
<joey> - You know like there's there's games like Jump King </joey>
<joey> where you know, I'll play it for content, </joey>
<joey> but I also want a game where I can just play. </joey>
<connor> - You want a comfort game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I want a comfort game 'cause once 13 Sentinels </connor>
<connor> gets finished, I just dunno what I'm gonna do with my life. </connor>
<connor> - We grow when we leave our comfort zone. </connor>
<joey> We accomplish things when we leave our comfort. </joey>
<garnt> You think they climbed Everest in their comfort zone, Garnt? </garnt>
<joey> - You know what I, I would learn like right now, </joey>
<joey> you know, we fill that void with more work </joey>
<joey> and I would like to know what happens </joey>
<joey> if we just do something fun instead of filling </joey>
<joey> that void with a more work. </joey>
<joey> - Well, certainly not Final Fantasy </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'll never (beep)ing see you. </joey>
<joey> Trash Taste will be on hiatus. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> Like what the (beep) happened to Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> Garnt and Joey are playing Final Fantasy Online. </joey>
<joey> - Remember when they promised like three specials </joey>
<joey> this year or what's happening with that? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't want you to be the Togashi </garnt>
<garnt> of Trash Taste, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> I want you to be present and here, no hiatuses. </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt will be like, he'll break down, like, </connor>
<joey> he'll call in to like Zoom and (beep). </joey>
<joey> He'll be like, I'm doing a raid right now, </joey>
<garnt> but I can Trash Taste. </garnt>
<connor> - If we can talk about Final Fantasy 14. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> (Ashley speaking off mic) </garnt>
<joey> - How long were you? - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - This, yeah (beep)ing Navi, this mother(beep)er like... </garnt>
<garnt> you know how he tried to convince me to play 14? </garnt>
<connor> He was like, they have Mahjongg in Final Fantasy 14. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what do you think, I'm some kind of like, </connor>
<connor> just because there's Mahjongg. </connor>
<connor> - Like no one's playing you for Poker. </connor>
<connor> - Just cause there Marjong in a game </connor>
<garnt> doesn't mean I'm gonna be like that, just give it to me. </garnt>
<joey> - Like what do you think I am? </joey>
<connor> - But like, like you're the dog. </connor>
<joey> This is like the cheese and the pill, swallow. </joey>
<connor> Swallow, swallow the pill, Joey. </connor>
<joey> You like, it's in a layer of cheese. </joey>
<joey> - It's like Pavlov's dog from Mahjongg. </joey>
<joey> - It's like Mahjongg, Mahjongg, Mahjongg, </joey>
<joey> yes, I'm playing it. </joey>
<joey> It's like. </joey>
<joey> - So rude. </joey>
<garnt> I'm looking forward to is the new Kirby game. </garnt>
<garnt> - That looked pretty cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like Kirby 64, but on Switch. </garnt>
<garnt> So it looks (beep)ing amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm I'm looking forward </joey>
<joey> to the new Horizon: Zero Dawn 'cause the first one </joey>
<joey> is one of my favorite games of all time. </joey>
<joey> Like I've been waiting, biding my time, </joey>
<joey> all this, like for like the past two years </joey>
<joey> to like not buy a PS5 or to like to buy a PS5 </joey>
<joey> when the price has finally gone down, </joey>
<garnt> And you're not just buying it from like scrapers </garnt>
<joey> or whatever, right. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, there's now a game I want to play on PS5, </joey>
<connor> but it's still not (beep)ing available. </connor>
<connor> So (beep) my life. </connor>
<connor> - Bottom scrapers, sorry, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Scalpers. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, is that the name? </joey>
<connor> Is that the name? </connor>
<connor> - Scalpers. - Scalpers. </connor>
<connor> - Bottom scrapers. - They are bottom scrapers. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's what I was thinking. </connor>
<garnt> They're like (beep)ing, they are bottom scrapers, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So it looks like I'm going to have to try and buy </garnt>
<joey> a PS5 sometime just to play this game and... </joey>
<garnt> - Get it. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Is there enough games on the PS5 like </joey>
<joey> that are exclusive at the current moment? </joey>
<joey> - No. - Right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause for my rule of thumb with new consoles </joey>
<joey> is I need at least like maybe three games </joey>
<joey> where I'm like, I really wanna play this. </joey>
<joey> That'll get me to finally buy it. </joey>
<joey> Like that's what I did with the Switch. </joey>
<joey> That's what I did with the PS4. </joey>
<joey> Like if it's just like one or two games, </joey>
<garnt> then I'm like, what am I gonna do after I finish that game? </garnt>
<joey> I'm only getting a PS5 </joey>
<joey> just because that's how much I like... </joey>
<joey> Oh, that's not much. </joey>
<connor> I like the original Horizon series Zero Dawn. </connor>
<joey> I need to play this game at launch </joey>
<garnt> - I only bought a PS4 to play Persona Five, so yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - What are the really big games </connor>
<connor> that are available on the PS5? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, Demon's Souls? </garnt>
<garnt> (talking over each other) </garnt>
<joey> - The Spider-Man game. - Oh, the Spider-Man game. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> (Ashley speaking off mic) </joey>
<joey> - FF7 Remake. - Is it actually? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] If I'm mistaken, that's why I got the PS. </joey>
<connor> - It doesn't feel like a true PS5 or like a Next-Gen, </connor>
<joey> and if it's on like the Gen before. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm kinda like, eh. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean two-second faster loaded of time, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Oh, the privilege. </joey>
<joey> (Ashley speaking of mic) </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Oh, we'll increase our sales for PS4s instead. </joey>
<garnt> - Cool, thanks, Sony. - Cool, thanks. </garnt>
<connor> - Cheers for that. </connor>
<joey> - It's 'cause the global chip shortage, right? </joey>
<joey> Can't get any devices. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Can't get GPs, can't get... </joey>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> - Tablets. </joey>
<joey> - Can't get service for FF Online. </joey>
<joey> - You couldn't even get hash browns at McDonald's </joey>
<joey> for a while in Japan, did you hear that? </joey>
<connor> - What, why? - What? </connor>
<connor> We had a hash brown shortage in Japan for a couple of days. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, is it because the potatoes? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because of the potatoes, </connor>
<connor> but it was so bad it was to the point </connor>
<garnt> we couldn't even get hash browns. </garnt>
<joey> Wait, wait, why was there a potato shortage? </joey>
<connor> - Japan doesn't import potatoes. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So they only accept like their potatoes </garnt>
<connor> because they believe that theirs... </connor>
<garnt> - So we had a potato shortage. - We had a potato shortage. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] The french fries, </joey>
<joey> wasn't it because they couldn't get salt, like the imports? </joey>
<connor> - Maybe, I'm pretty sure Japan doesn't import </connor>
<connor> the majority of their potatoes. </connor>
<garnt> - Whatever the issue was, it was all this as a result, </garnt>
<garnt> the pandemic, and then for, I think it was only </garnt>
<garnt> for like two or three days. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause they had this a few years ago </connor>
<connor> with potato chips in Japan, or crisps. </connor>
<connor> They, yeah, they didn't have any potatoes. </connor>
<joey> 'cause there was, I think there was a really bad season </joey>
<joey> and they refused to import potatoes </joey>
<joey> 'cause they saw them as lower quality. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, that's a load of bull(beep). </joey>
<garnt> A potato's a potato, let's be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - You're not gonna lie. </garnt>
<connor> So they didn't have any pizza potato chips </connor>
<connor> and people were really angry. </connor>
<connor> - Of course, like. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] They do import the fries are processed </joey>
<joey> in the US and Canada before being shipped to Japan. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, really, they are? </connor>
<connor> Maybe it's just maybe potato chips then? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Like shipping disruptions in </joey>
<joey> on Vancouver's side so we can get... </joey>
<connor> - Maybe it's just for potato chips then. </connor>
<joey> Japan is like, or like maybe Kelpie is like, </joey>
<garnt> no, we only use Japanese. - We only use Japanese. </garnt>
<joey> - Probably a company thing, not a like nationwide thing. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, it makes sense, really. </connor>
<joey> - And Japan does have this massive culture around their, </joey>
<garnt> you know, vegetables and ingredients and where it comes from </garnt>
<garnt> and it being high quality, and... </garnt>
<garnt> - It needs to come from X Prefecture. </garnt>
<joey> Otherwise it's not right. </joey>
<joey> - And then you taste it and you're like this is </joey>
<joey> just a very good version of X thing that I normally eat </joey>
<joey> anyway for 10 times less the price. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna do a test where we get the same vegetables. </garnt>
<connor> - That's an after-dark strip. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - From different prefectures </connor>
<garnt> and see if we can figure it out. </garnt>
<connor> - Or all of the expensive versus cheap fruits. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> We should do that. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I will say like, you know, </joey>
<joey> there are some fruits where I've had like </joey>
<joey> you have like Japanese strawberries, for example, </joey>
<joey> I don't think I've ever had </joey>
<joey> a bad Japanese strawberry, </joey>
<joey> but like it's more of like consistency. </joey>
<connor> - You had bad strawberries in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, there are some strawberries where you have </joey>
<joey> and it's like, it's just not that sweet. </joey>
<connor> It's like sometimes </connor>
<connor> a bit sour. - It's sour. </connor>
<connor> - It's sour, you know, but it's still a strawberry. </connor>
<connor> But every time I buy a packet of strawberries from Japan, </connor>
<joey> it's like three, four times the cost, </joey>
<joey> but every (beep)ing strawberry </joey>
<joey> is like the sweetest strawberry </joey>
<joey> you would get from a UK supermarket. </joey>
<garnt> - This is the non-brand. </garnt>
<connor> - It's also sad that they probably waste </connor>
<connor> a lot more food as well if they throw away </connor>
<connor> the ones that don't meet the quality standards, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think it's that. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's just the quality of like cultivation </garnt>
<joey> is just like incredibly high here </joey>
<joey> 'cause like I remember, I think I saw this like documentary </joey>
<connor> about like melons, for example. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I saw that one on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the melons one is like the (beep)ing process </connor>
<garnt> of that is like insane. </garnt>
<garnt> Like this guy, this dude in like </garnt>
<joey> in his 50s - He massages them, right? </joey>
<joey> Is taking better care of this melon </joey>
<garnt> then some parents do their children. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, he was taking better care of the melons </connor>
<garnt> than I was myself. - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So it's just nuts to think that like </garnt>
<joey> okay, yeah, now that I see the process, </joey>
<joey> I can understand why it's a little more expensive </joey>
<garnt> and way tastier, but can justify me paying $300 for a melon. </garnt>
<joey> - I just wish there was a cheaper option, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I would be fine with it </joey>
<joey> If there was a natural option that, you know, </joey>
<joey> rival the price of the same ingredients </joey>
<joey> I would pay in like the UK or whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - I think that's the problem. </garnt>
<joey> I remember I used to eat so much fruit in Australia </joey>
<joey> just because like an apple was like less than a dollar. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, exactly, and it's just (beep)ing easy to pick up </connor>
<joey> and it was cheap and it all tasted good. </joey>
<connor> But like in Japan, like the cheapest apple you can get </connor>
<connor> is like 300 Yen or something. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, pretty tough. - And it's just like </connor>
<garnt> I can't justify me spending $3 for an apple. </garnt>
<joey> - Sometimes you want that high quality experience. </joey>
<connor> I get that, with every bite that you take, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes you just wanna eat a (beep)load of one thing </connor>
<joey> and not feel guilty afterwards for spending a lot of money. </joey>
<garnt> - If you eat steak every day, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you want a hamburger, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just how it is. </garnt>
<joey> - I know Japan doesn't grow bananas, does it? </joey>
<joey> I don't think hey can grow here, right? </joey>
<joey> - What? - Bananas. </joey>
<joey> - No - I don't think.. </joey>
<garnt> - I think bananas are all imported from like Philippines. </garnt>
<connor> - I love the banana gacha, you know, </connor>
<garnt> where you are like. - Banana gacha? </garnt>
<garnt> - You crack open a banana and you're like, I have no idea </garnt>
<connor> if this banana is gonna be like (beep) or good </connor>
<joey> - Right. - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Can grow bananas in Okinawa, Kogoshima. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that makes sense. - Oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> - You just never know if a banana's gonna taste </connor>
<connor> like the perfect banana, right? </connor>
<joey> - What is the perfect banana? </joey>
<garnt> - You know when it... </garnt>
<garnt> - It depends, right? </garnt>
<joey> Like some people like are really like brown </joey>
<joey> and like some people, - Oh, I hated brown. </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't like it brown. </joey>
<joey> You know, you want it to be... </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you bite into a banana </joey>
<joey> and it's like fighting back sometimes. </joey>
<joey> It's like kind of tough. </joey>
<joey> - I would... - What the (beep) happened? </joey>
<garnt> - It's got some give. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would prefer a banana be too ripe than too brown to me. </garnt>
<connor> Like I, prefer. - No, too ripe, </connor>
<connor> It's like rock solid. </connor>
<joey> And it's like... </joey>
<connor> - I prefer when it's like a, just, </connor>
<joey> just like a tiny bit of firmness, </joey>
<joey> just like a tiny bit of firmness still there. </joey>
<joey> That's like my perfect banana. </joey>
<joey> It's not like it's, you know, it's not completely green, </joey>
<joey> but it's not like, it's just, just turns completely yellow. </joey>
<joey> That's like, to me, that's like my perfect banana. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't like the green ones, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes even get like a non-green one and it, </connor>
<connor> it still is like rock solid or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like.. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know what I'm gonna get with these bananas, </connor>
<connor> and frankly, I quite enjoy that. </connor>
<connor> I quite enjoy that maybe I'll get that dog-tear banana. </connor>
<connor> that its just like really smooth, </connor>
<connor> kind of little bit sweet, like, ooh, </connor>
<connor> this is just the perfect banana. </connor>
<garnt> - Why would you ever play a Gashu game </garnt>
<connor> when you just, you can.... </connor>
<connor> - Bananas are the OG Gashu world. </connor>
<garnt> You just never know, never know if you need a good banana. </garnt>
<connor> That's what I love about bananas. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so sad though 'cause I really miss eating </garnt>
<joey> like a lot of fruits, but just, I just, again, </joey>
<garnt> I can't justify myself. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like banana is actually </joey>
<garnt> one of the cheaper fruit you eat in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Plus, it's imported. </garnt>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> - Coffee bean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, like you know, maybe like three bucks </joey>
<garnt> for like maybe a five or six pack. </garnt>
<joey> - I eat like three bananas a day </joey>
<joey> because it's just the one fruit I get at every coffee. </joey>
<joey> - Real monkey human. - Huh? </joey>
<joey> - I actually do, you know what I realized the other day? </joey>
<joey> I don't know why, I really, really like bananas. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's 'cause they're like pre-portioned. </connor>
<joey> - Again. - They're like the perfect... </joey>
<joey> - Pre-portioned! </joey>
<joey> - They're like, we as humans, we love portioned food. </joey>
<joey> We love it when something tells us </joey>
<joey> this is how much you're eating. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - And the bananas </connor>
<connor> is the perfect one. </connor>
<joey> - I really, really love bananas. </joey>
<joey> I like eat them every day. </joey>
<joey> - I'm a Jojo fan as well. </joey>
<garnt> - But, but, but. - I gobble bananas. </garnt>
<joey> - But for some reason I hate banana-flavored stuff. </joey>
<garnt> Like I dunno why (talking over each other). </garnt>
<connor> I don't like banana-flavored sweets. </connor>
<joey> There's just something. - It depends for me. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you know, 'cause the banana-flavored stuff </connor>
<connor> is from a variety of banana that is, </connor>
<connor> that we don't use anymore, it's like extinct. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh really? - Totally, 'cause it's... </garnt>
<connor> - The artificial banana flavor? </connor>
<garnt> - There is like this after taste </garnt>
<joey> that tastes so artificial that it just really puts me off. </joey>
<connor> - So it's like, I think it was, I don't know if it's the, </connor>
<connor> if the one we use right now </connor>
<joey> is the cabin dish banana or the one before. </joey>
<joey> I know there's a bunch of YouTube videos about this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, there's the one before </joey>
<joey> apparently is much sweeter, much better flavor, </joey>
<joey> but like a plague wiped out that, </joey>
<joey> like that type of banana. - Species, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So they had to grow another one that was more resistant. </joey>
<joey> Problem is that it apparently doesn't taste as good. </joey>
<joey> So the original banana-sweetened flavored stuff </joey>
<joey> that you taste in stuff, </joey>
<joey> especially that original banana flavor. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Supposedly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - I don't know if it's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't mind the artificial. </garnt>
<connor> - I really like the artificial banana flavor more </connor>
<connor> than the like real banana flavor. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like I've been robbed. </connor>
<joey> - What, you, you like the artificial banana flavor more? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Because I feel like I'm missing out </connor>
<joey> on the OG banana experience. </joey>
<connor> I feel like I'll come late to the party. </connor>
<joey> - This mythical banana. </joey>
<joey> - As a monkey, I feel like my ancestors had it good. </joey>
<joey> They had the OG banana, you know, </joey>
<joey> the sweeter banana, the better banana. </joey>
<joey> - Have you, have you had a... </joey>
<garnt> - Our ancestors were eating good. </garnt>
<connor> - [Ashley] Extinct banana flavor is part myth, though. </connor>
<connor> Banana flavors actually became more popular </connor>
<joey> than bananas because nobody had ever </joey>
<joey> eaten bananas before. - My God. </joey>
<joey> The mythical banana. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that's what I taste </joey>
<joey> when I taste banana-flavored stuff. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't taste like real banana to me. </joey>
<connor> - That's because your concept of real banana </connor>
<connor> is the only like one that we grow. </connor>
<connor> That is your real banana flavor is one... </connor>
<connor> - Is that all a real banana is, Connor? </connor>
<connor> - That's only one variant of banana. </connor>
<connor> There's so many bananas that all taste different. </connor>
<joey> - You're eating a real banana, or are you? </joey>
<connor> - Actually like my... - You are, but there are </connor>
<connor> more flavors than the flavor you know. </connor>
<joey> - I know that. - Resources. </joey>
<joey> - My favorite banana actually is Southeast Asian bananas. </joey>
<joey> I don't like, okay, I dunno you've ever.... </joey>
<garnt> - Like all of Southeast Asia? </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno, but I'm saying Southeast Asian, </garnt>
<joey> because I've only had it in Thailand. </joey>
<connor> - Huh? - What about European bananas? </connor>
<joey> European bananas are the same </joey>
<joey> (beep)ing bananas that we import, right? </joey>
<joey> But Southeast Asian bananas are like. </joey>
<connor> - Really funny out of context though. </connor>
<joey> - I can't wait for the banana edit of this. </joey>
<joey> Jojo fans are talking about dicks. </joey>
<connor> - Only brought to the comment section of this clip, </connor>
<garnt> bananarologist, here. </garnt>
<joey> - So, because like in Thailand you can get like </joey>
<garnt> these really small bananas that are like half. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, the finger bananas. - The finger bananas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I like those. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is like what they taste like if you take, </garnt>
<joey> you take one of the four bananas we are used to </joey>
<joey> and just pack all that flavor in half the size. </joey>
<garnt> - It's getting the big banana in... </garnt>
<joey> - Photoshop the banana. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just a shot of banana. </garnt>
<joey> Like I'm like addicted (beep)ing addicted to those bananas. </joey>
<joey> 'cause like my Dad comes in with a pack of like, </joey>
<garnt> they don't even sell them in like, you know, packeted, </garnt>
<garnt> they don't sell them in like packeted bunches. </garnt>
<joey> You just take like, you just buy them by the bunch. </joey>
<joey> And like, you buy like a bunch of like 10 or 20, </joey>
<joey> and I swear I can get through like 10 in a day. </joey>
<connor> Like I like, I like eat one and I'm like... </connor>
<connor> (talking over each other) </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> Potassium overload. </connor>
<connor> The (beep)ing ape, the (beep)ing ape brain just takes over. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, (beep)ing just gimme 10 right now. </joey>
<connor> - Do, do you think that all apples have the same taste? </connor>
<joey> - No, I don't. </joey>
<joey> - Well then I think that's the same thing with bananas, </joey>
<joey> except we just don't have the... </joey>
<joey> - Don't start this conversation. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just saying, we don't have the other bananas, right? </connor>
<joey> - Where have you had the other bananas? </joey>
<connor> - I haven't, I want to. - - No, one's had it. </connor>
<joey> It's a myth. </joey>
<joey> - It existed. - It's literally a myth. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, you know, all... </joey>
<joey> - We just established all of the apple flavors </joey>
<garnt> are really distinctly different, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah. - It tastes </garnt>
<garnt> very, very different. </garnt>
<connor> That's what's we've missed out on with bananas. </connor>
<connor> - You're speaking about a mythical banana </connor>
<connor> that is artificial tasting. </connor>
<joey> - That may or may not taste like.... </joey>
<joey> - You've never tasted before. </joey>
<joey> so how can you say that this tastes </joey>
<connor> like this mythical banana. </connor>
<connor> You're actually talking out your (beep) right now. </connor>
<connor> - I want to try this banana </connor>
<connor> that I know is gonna taste different. </connor>
<connor> - What if it doesn't exist? </connor>
<connor> What if it just. - It does exist. </connor>
<connor> - It's completely artificial. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] In his defense, it did exist. </joey>
<joey> (talking over each other) </joey>
<joey> - Right, but... </joey>
<garnt> - We can't have it anymore, Garnt, it's gone. </garnt>
<joey> - It did exist, </joey>
<garnt> but have they perfectly replicated that flavor </garnt>
<joey> and how do you know? - How do you know? </joey>
<connor> - Because we don't have science back then, you know. </connor>
<connor> Science was just a guess back then. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. - So how did we know </connor>
<connor> that this mythical banana tastes the same </connor>
<connor> as the artificial flavoring? </connor>
<connor> - You can just, you know, speculate based on our apples. </connor>
<connor> - I can speculate what a (beep)ing dinosaur tastes like, </connor>
<connor> but I know I'm gonna taste a (beep)ing dinosaur. </connor>
<connor> - I bet it tastes like a bear. </connor>
<connor> - If something came out with </connor>
<joey> like a (beep)ing dinosaur-flavored lollipop </joey>
<joey> or steak or something, I'd be like, cool. </joey>
<joey> This is completely bull(beep) </joey>
<connor> because no one's ever tasted a dinosaur before. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't it sad we never got to taste a dinosaur? </connor>
<connor> I wish we could have tasted a, </connor>
<joey> like a T-Rex probably tasted great. </joey>
<joey> We'd be arguing about like a... </joey>
<garnt> - A T-Rex would be gamey as (beep). </garnt>
<joey> Are you (beep)ing kidding me? </joey>
<joey> - What would be the tastiest dinosaur? </joey>
<garnt> (talking over each other) </garnt>
<connor> RosaRaptor? </connor>
<garnt> - Probably the velociraptor. - Velociraptor is like... </garnt>
<connor> - Good sized, they're too muscular though. </connor>
<joey> - Too muscular, that's true, that would be too tough. </joey>
<joey> - What's the (beep)ing long necked (beep), </joey>
<connor> the (beep)ing long...? </connor>
<connor> - (singing tones) Can you pass the mustard? </connor>
<connor> - The brachiosaurus - Brachiosaurus. </connor>
<joey> I bet they tasted delicious. </joey>
<connor> - You know, we missed out on all these foods and stuff. </connor>
<connor> You know, that we could have had. </connor>
<joey> - Trash Taste, we've literally </joey>
<connor> run out of food we can argue about. </connor>
<joey> Let's argue about food that doesn't exist anymore. </joey>
<connor> - Let's speculate about (beep) that doesn't exist. </connor>
<connor> (Ashley speaking off mic) </connor>
<connor> I can just wake up in a cold sweat </connor>
<garnt> and wonder what bananas we've missed out on though. </garnt>
<connor> That does happen, that does happen. </connor>
<garnt> - I just don't know if it's ever crossed your mind </garnt>
<garnt> what the word artificial means. </garnt>
<joey> It means it doesn't exist. </joey>
<connor> - At least I've speculated of the bananas we've lost. </connor>
<garnt> - What if the bananas we lost </garnt>
<joey> just taste like absolute garbage? </joey>
<connor> - I would be able sleep at night. </connor>
<garnt> - Probably does because they gone. </garnt>
<garnt> - If they taste. - Extinct </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they were little and like bitches </garnt>
<garnt> that like Gordon Ramsey didn't like them. </garnt>
<joey> They were extinct because a plague wiped them out, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - What if the plague was... - based on taste. </joey>
<garnt> - We did you a solid. </garnt>
<garnt> We got rid of these (beep)-eatin' bananas. </garnt>
<garnt> We'll give you these other ones. </garnt>
<joey> You can imagine what it tastes like. </joey>
<joey> - (Beep)ing argument that we've had. </joey>
<joey> - Would you ever want to taste a Dodo </joey>
<joey> 'cause man, if... </joey>
<garnt> - [Ashley] They became extinct for a reason. </garnt>
<connor> - They weren't extinct because they got over hunted </connor>
<connor> so I'm just like, (beep), </connor>
<connor> how good do these (beep)ing birds taste </connor>
<connor> - They were over hunted, for what purpose were they? </connor>
<connor> They have like a beak that was special or something? </connor>
<joey> - Ah, no because... - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Do you know why Ashley? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] I can Google it for you. </joey>
<joey> - Google it, I'm going to speculate. </joey>
<garnt> Is it because they were just (beep) weak animals? </garnt>
<joey> - Kind of like, I've heard that dodos </joey>
<garnt> were just like </garnt>
<garnt> (beep)ing stupid. - Just (beep)ing stupid. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They're like really dumb an they were like </joey>
<garnt> if there was a predator that came up to it, </garnt>
<garnt> they wouldn't even know it was a predator. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's how dumb they were supposedly. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Part of the reasons is because... </garnt>
<garnt> - Look, I've seen Ice Age. </garnt>
<garnt> I know exactly what happened. </garnt>
<joey> - Their habitat was almost completely destroyed </joey>
<joey> after people started settling on Mauritius. </joey>
<joey> - Ah, people. </joey>
<joey> - You know, this is why, you know, </joey>
<joey> sometimes I watch those YouTube videos where it's like, </joey>
<joey> like the animal, like there's a tiger eating </joey>
<joey> a (beep)ing deer or something. </joey>
<garnt> And you go in the comments are like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh my God, I wish I could have helped the deer." </joey>
<joey> It's like, what, stop nature? </joey>
<joey> Like, what do you mean, like, what are you gonna do? </joey>
<connor> Like, I hate these comments where they're like, </connor>
<connor> I wish I could've helped that poor Adam. </connor>
<connor> Like this is literally nature. </connor>
<joey> Like just let it do its thing. </joey>
<garnt> - We wouldn't be in this position if it weren't </garnt>
<garnt> for where we are right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah we're a plague, all right? </garnt>
<joey> That's fair enough, we probably not do that (beep). </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] We're the problem, we're the virus. </joey>
<joey> - When you're asking a lion not to like eat it's prey, </joey>
<joey> like no, that's what a lion does. </joey>
<joey> That's like the whole point. </joey>
<joey> That's why, that's why everything exists. </joey>
<connor> Like let it do it, like don't intervene. </connor>
<joey> - What are you gonna do is like go to a lion and be like, </joey>
<garnt> just stop. - Like Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the lion be like, yeah, you're right, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you ever soybeans? </garnt>
<garnt> - Veganism, that's an option. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think David Attenborough spoke about this </garnt>
<garnt> one time as well, and he was like, someone asked him </garnt>
<joey> in interview, they're like, do you ever feel like </joey>
<joey> sorry for the animals that like, </joey>
<joey> I think there was one with like the birds </joey>
<garnt> were falling down, and starve or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, no, you know, it's just unfortunate. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's life. - That's nature. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not our place to intervene, </garnt>
<joey> to get involved and say, who can do what </joey>
<garnt> until obviously we've burn down all the forests. </garnt>
<garnt> - And literally killed the... </garnt>
<joey> - That is kind of on us, we. </joey>
<joey> - We should probably intervene as little as possible. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I hate those comments though. </connor>
<joey> - What is it you wanna say, Ashley? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] There was an animal </joey>
<joey> that was literally eaten to death though. </joey>
<joey> I think it was the giant tortoise. </joey>
<joey> - Most, animals are eaten. - Yeah, that's on us. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Ate the whole species to death. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - That's on us, that's on us. </joey>
<joey> - What animals that? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] I think it was a giant tortoise. </joey>
<joey> - How the (beep) to you eat that? </joey>
<connor> - What, humans? - How do you even start? </connor>
<joey> - What's (beep)ing wrong with us? </joey>
<connor> Well, apparently they make turtle soup and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - That's... - Yeah, but, I dunno. </connor>
<garnt> - I just find it, just the image of just a guy </garnt>
<garnt> looking at a giant tortoise being like delicious. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] It really was delicious. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, stop that. </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna... </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, we've eaten a lot weirder things. </connor>
<connor> - That is true, that's true. </connor>
<garnt> - If there's something that's breathing, </garnt>
<joey> I'm sure humans have tried to find a way to eat it. </joey>
<joey> Maybe humanity just has Trash Taste, feed source music. </joey>
