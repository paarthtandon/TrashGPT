<SPEAKER_01> immersion comes yeah the amount of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> options people can tell like i i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how people are able to tell the timeline </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of when trash chase recordings happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> now based on joey's hair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like because it's like one week i was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> it's your hair and my beard because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one week i just decided i'm gonna grow a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beard and then uh we we are the sundial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm calculating the the shading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of god's face and i can definitely guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it sometime around january i like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> beard on here i think it seems yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> looks good i think i did it literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after a trash taste recording when i </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> jesus but yeah we've just come back from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our christmas holidays which is i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think this was one of the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas holidays that actually felt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a christmas holiday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because uh normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas holiday is like the busiest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time of the year for me because i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to get like my end of year video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out and then i don't know what switched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my mind to make me realize what if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't do that and uh give myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some time off and then i put the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> out sometime next month god discovers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the word no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time it's like taking a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> break yeah i can say that now wait a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minute what you mean the expectations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were just all in my head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and no one really cares if i just delay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the video for like a few weeks never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trust anyone not even yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you mean i was my own worst enemy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel one i'm just recovering from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> being sick so if i'm a little quiet it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't have to cover it don't worry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about it yeah i'm negative boys i'm also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> negative in life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you just described yourself right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> negative person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what happened like you had like a sore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> throat or something yeah i had like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really bad sore throat and then it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of went and that now i'm in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the last days where i still sound sick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i feel totally fine okay yeah uh but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you were sipping that manuka honey up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there though yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's the problem it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like i remember i saw the other day it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like a job this big of manufacturing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that it was like 60 bucks what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> manuka honey it's it's this plant right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there no it's it's a type of honey made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> from a certain i think species of bee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's only found in new zealand i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> new zealand yeah yeah it's it's a key </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a kiwi bee basically and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like halfway between i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember because i saw like a whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> business inside a video on this yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like uh yeah because they did like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pollinated something like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> specific like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the honey that is spunked on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this i'm sure it's something like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bee you know takes the pollen from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a specific plant and only makes honey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of it or something like that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's uh i know it's like a kiwi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing and the reason is because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just the whole process of it is really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long yeah and arduous and also it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> halfway between like royal jelly and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> honey i think yeah that's that's how it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of works i don't know i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i always recommend it it's really hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to recommend because people like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> paying how much for a jar of honey can i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not just buy honey you know that's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normal honey isn't honey it doesn't do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the same thing no more peasant honeybee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like peasant beef </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you when you you know when you pour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honey it pours the like manuka honey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff doesn't pull it's like molasses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a block and like i normally like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i scream a bunch i'm doing a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> voice acting yeah i'll normally just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> take a little teaspoon not fill it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a little bit i'll just eat it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i don't know a lot yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know why because there are a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like products that are very expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'd say that they're not that much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> different from like the base product </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when you honey versus normal honey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but manuka honey i don't know what it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if it is a placebo but it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be people could be a placebo but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like every time every time i've taken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something it's like my sore throat just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately goes away yeah i mean i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's that whole thing of like are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wearing a product or are you wearing a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> brand new thing right when it comes to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like clothes for example yo are these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bees like minted by louis vuitton like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on here if you look really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> close on the side of the body it says lv </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like branded with lv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh [ __ ] the bees coming in with like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> drip jacket like hello they come to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> farm hello i'm here to pollinate you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh directions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not from like a specific bee it's from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the manuka flower yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so it's a specific plant they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> probably confuse you i said plenty sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sorry then joey came in like a wrecking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ball like this and i'm like hold up hold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on pretty sure it's a plus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay it's the plants wearing there you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] drip jacket </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should have should have been more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> aggressive i don't know joey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i disagree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> half this podcast is that doesn't sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right but my my manuka honey knowledge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't enough to dispute you or dispute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you on that yeah people have google </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because because i've tried like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bunch of things like i've tried like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really expensive pink himalayan salt oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's like the most of the cost goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like mining this [ __ ] salt because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like one of the rare assault or one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the hardest salts to mine durian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they shout out my supermarket huh they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sell at my supermarket do they actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i've got something it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if it's probably not really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> probably it's like two bucks it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely not sea salt with pink dye on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah it's probably sea salt and pink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> dye it says himalayan salt on it got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like 150 yen yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i actually tried the second most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive i think it's the second most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's one of the most expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> coffee beans in the world yeah right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is how they harvest this coffee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bean is i believe it it's like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the cat poop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we've seen the bucket list guys we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen the movie we know wait what that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why i became like really popular because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the bucket list there was like a hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this whole big joke in the movie was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fact that he didn't know this expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coffee this rich guy was buying from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> poop down which uh which film was this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the bucket list </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> that one okay i don't know i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why i know that maybe i've never seen it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is why their coffee became so well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> known </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because in this well it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously it it was a thing before right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah it was a massive part of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie it was a big joke that this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like he was like i have to have this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> coffee and he didn't know this whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time that he was eating like cabbage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was pooping it out yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not actually cats it's a kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like an animal right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a big joke in the movie is that he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> eating the the poop beans and he's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hilarious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why i became so alone that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone knows it god i'm what i'm more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surprised of the fact that they talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about that in the bucket list is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fact that you've seen the bucket list </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you mean it's a it's an amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> figure i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know who's seen it jack dickson and </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> interested me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't even know about it until now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very good so how did they react to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it in the movie he was like shocked </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> and then like use letter e </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know how like in the movies right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when they're someone's typed in their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their code on the pc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you blow the dust [ __ ] on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you see the fingerprints yeah basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what happens is that she just farts on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the keyboard and whenever the fart is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like traced on the board she types the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shittiest ouija board yeah maybe she has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe she has a fart scanner where it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> digitizes her farts into bits and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> gets that gets converted to an nft which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can be put on these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean they literally they recently like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> japan just made a screen that you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> taste oh yeah the lickable screen yeah </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> it's like half the the good foods </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because of the textures yeah what i want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to know is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this this screen like the screens are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like dirty enough as it is and you're </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> every time you have like a single have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we not learned anything from this panda </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> of leaking sweat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> jesus christ </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> us can you google can you google fart </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nft yeah how how this works please </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> beldelphine uh was selling her bathwater </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who knew that that was just the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> beginning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was she was trying to warn us of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the future i think a lot of people sell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their bath water now right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god yeah i mean i'm i'm sure a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of people sell bath water now i'm sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah i'm sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no no i'll sell it i'll be honest i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't browse only fans so much so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so much i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you proudest only friends at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't browse only fans so i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> only fans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't know what people are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> selling on only fans i don't know if i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to know what people are saying on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> early fans if this is the kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that gets leaked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i saw the bathwater thing i already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought that was ridiculous but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even before that like there was those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> places that were selling like you ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see those like places that were selling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like cans filled with like air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like the oh this is this is a can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> filled with hawaiian air and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> yeah just open the jar yeah just open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the shop ship them back i guess ups well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess how is that different from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spring water right yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but spring water makes more sense i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> cannot understand why someone might make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> an argument i don't give a [ __ ] i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> drink i i i don't give a [ __ ] i'll i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> put my mouth over the whole tap yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get the full lesson </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want the lime scale and all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know i guess some people picky </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they you know they don't want it but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> normally the whole bottle of water is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like tap water with they just add </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a bunch of [ __ ] minerals right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there's add [ __ ] yeah i mean do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mean minerals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean elements </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah two shots of lead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it's it's like beauty products </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right where the products like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> market </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they market the story to you as like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we got this we we got this product from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the the mountains of the himalayas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like the only like the freshest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tree grows or something like that but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just someone in the in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lab that made it yeah and they put they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> stuck a label on it you know it's pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much it's no different so you know i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't done enough my research on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where spring where bottled water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> actually comes from i don't care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no i don't care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i have no it was the very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> noise of nose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like meh i like i will say you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dismissed that argument any faster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> do you care no i just want to know do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you actually care no before we go down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this argument and start talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this i don't care it's like guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i saw like those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those documentaries where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nestle yeah where they just go into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> towns of america and just take all their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drinking water and then just sell it as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bottled water because they add like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know like a label to it they had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zero milligram of chlorine or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they're like now it's treated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> water it's no longer tap water yeah what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't like a massive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> controversy um in england at least was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the fact that dasani </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um so dasani is still in america if i if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember correctly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in america but the reason the sani is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not sold in england anymore is because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was this massive controversy where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> dasani marketed it as you know fresh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spring water but it got found out that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were just selling bottled tap water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well the tap was coming from a spring or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something anyway yeah but the obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the people in the uk are very i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know how to explain it stuff like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really pisses british people off right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fact that like you would try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sell us something that is just so basic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just wondering if if it's spring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's connected to a tap and that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spring water is coming out of a tap is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it spring water is a tap water it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> spring tackle [ __ ] sage it's just tapped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sprinkles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've entered the water metal right okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm gonna bring you a step deeper in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> water metal okay okay so onsen culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan yeah right are you gonna tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me that every single onsen water is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is is every single onsen we go to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know fresh from the earth or is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how where does that water come from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's from the ground but it's through a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> tap yeah is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you just taking a bath in tap water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like everything no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because tap water has to come from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a spring perhaps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think tap water implies that it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the grid the national system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah not not the [ __ ] thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're taking offset bathroom guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because because i see some onsen uh some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> onsens have like the water get delivered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to them by trucks right yeah not not tap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> water but they get they get it delivered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> by trucks and i think well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the stuff in the water like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minerals from like the whatever they dig </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out so so there's so there's a clear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> difference between an onsen and a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> centaur which is a bath house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right acentor is just hot water it's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no minerals in it it's not it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't have like any of like that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know natural stuff that makes you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know makes it healthier yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then an onsen is the stuff that is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mineralized like from the [ __ ] ground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like onsen water yeah right but i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> most people just assume that like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bath house equals onsen which it doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah it's two different things yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like i i do notice depending on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the onsen we go to like the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> water is like very different depending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on where you go oh yeah there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like 30 different types of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ridiculous yeah yeah it's probably yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah because it's all just different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makeups right yeah like like the acid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one i went i went with chris into an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> acid onsen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the one we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we just went on holiday yeah on a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ski trip which uh we've revealed is not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be a special yeah unfortunately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we do like to hang out with each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh not always happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we hang out outside of context outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though joey joey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which may or may not not be out by now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> by now yeah but uh we went to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh where did we go again you said koi </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> monster that's a manga i i completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just i the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> musical that's that's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the most famous ski resorts in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan probably like top two is the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> famous oh hakama and niska the two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> famous ones oh yeah that's true they're </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> proper ski trip because unlike before i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only went for a day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i was like out of commission </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like every other day so i had like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> your mum ask you how the white person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sport was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so she asked you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was so weird going to that ski resort </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just going to that town and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seeing more people speaking english then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they were japanese i think i heard less </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese like i heard more chinese and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> english than i did japanese oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's only going to increase once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the board is open yeah yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like every single staff member not just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the hotel we stayed at but just in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> town for some reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that spoke english and you know there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are a lot of a lot of aussies there a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and you know if they weren't speaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> english then they were basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speaking you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mandarin or cantonese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you had the very few people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just speaking japanese the japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were literally in the minority </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah from what i could see and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country's closed off so how bad is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the country actually opens up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tourism comes back in because yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember because i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i worked in uh hakuba which is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other famous one nigata that is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like almost 99 percent are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being sorry i'm sorry nagano yes sorry </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> australians </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's actually it's actually scary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like i remember some days being there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like going around to like restaurants </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> because when you're inside the </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> it feels like i'm back home in australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it feels like every country has their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> their national pests yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> australia has the cane toads yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> though but like it's like a smack bang </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of the season as well so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably like the most amount of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> people but it was really good yeah still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very good i would say this was like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> consistently been in because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> throughout my entire life like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coldest weather i've really had to deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with is like minus five minus six right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh god okay so how did you manage huh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how did you manage so so like so like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mind when you guys were telling me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pack winter clothes pack all these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different kind of like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thermal gear and everything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like it's cold i get it i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm going to i know it's going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing in my mind could process really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just how cold it is up there and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how cold it feels because to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it gets to -5 and anything below -5 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like [ __ ] it's cold i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know mother it is cold you know that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how my mind processes it yeah but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't like my body wasn't prepared for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like the different types of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coldness because it just never had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experienced that before at least like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not too not to such a big degree because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been in you know wisconsin in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> winter and it gets [ __ ] cold in in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there but we just stay inside all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time we're not out there [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboarding skiing yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah to put in perspective i think every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day on average it was like minus like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or 11. it was yeah it was minus like 16 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the top as well yeah yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like shot down even lower yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because you'd wear like this um i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what you call it not a battle club </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like just like a cloth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a like a face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mask well it's just like a piece of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cloth that you put underneath your mask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that blocks here so you don't freeze </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> your face off yeah but like the one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the days was so cold that like after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like one run of going down like one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the things i tried to touch it and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was rock solid yeah like it like really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moved it's just like frozen yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> crazy it was so cool though man it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> such a such a cool ski resort it was uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess being in that kind of cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weather or being that in that kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cold place kind of put things into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that if you are like ill-equipped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just to go outside for like a quick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> walk or something you'll probably die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i guess i've never been in an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> environment where i've needed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worry about just having basic gear to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> protect myself from the weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> otherwise my life would be in danger you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know what i mean yeah and i yeah like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets cold but it's like bearable yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets cold but like just runs in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's combing in it just once in there as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tesco's and just warm up you you run a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit more but like um the nearest comedy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like 30 minutes yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's not there was nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and i remember when we arrived </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we arrived to the hotel we got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> greeted by the receptionist and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like that and he said oh you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know um if you want to go into town </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make sure you book a taxi because if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't book a taxi every taxi is going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stop at about midnight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they've had some people that have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gone into town which is a bit further </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> away from the ski resorts and had no way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get back in like minus -10 weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a 20-minute drive it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 20-minute drive yeah it's like it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a two-hour walk yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the ski resort has a bunch of uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different areas around it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah we we went to this village called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hirafu which is technically on the next </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mountain over that just puts into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective how far away that is yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just made me think [ __ ] man if if we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just forgot to call a taxi one day we'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just be [ __ ] because nowhere would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> open we can be we can we can get home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just have to like survive outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the wilderness and like minus 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 degree weather celsius by the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> celsius we went to that one bar and was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> these australian or south african i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think it was australian uh no no no he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was dutch i believe was he really oh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think his eyes wasn't he touched him his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> accent sounded like he's already had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nausea this guy was just like he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like we're like what do we do if we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> miss the cabs i wouldn't know if he was </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> like an hour and 40 minutes an hour and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 40 minutes i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's certainly walkable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would i do it though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in minus 15 degree weather is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> different question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean walkable is a technicality i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'm sure a human would be able to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> walk from one end to the other i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hokkaido to tokyo is walkable </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> hotel like yeah it was one of the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> launchers i've been in being cold all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> day and then just going in the onsen and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ensembles outside as well yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good so you get this but like if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of put yourself in the water maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up to like your chest or like the bottom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of your shoulders you get this perfect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> blend of like your bottom half is nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and warm and toasty in this mineral </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> water and then your top is just getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> colorful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so anime it's it's so anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> especially like having in going in an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> onsen is anime going in an onsen in snow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's pretty animated because you you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally sitting there and you you see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime steam where the way you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you see the steam when it like senses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything that's literally what it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you couldn't see anything like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just so much steam yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't see anything it was amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so it's just like a real life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sensor and so this view we had of just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the snow as well it looked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so [ __ ] aesthetic it was just unfair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it looked like a wallpaper it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unreal engine fire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it literally looked like an unreal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> engine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of not real life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it looks so good that it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> unrealistic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the only part i regret not being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> able to vlog because that was probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like the most aesthetic part i can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take a camera in there i can't take it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on guys yeah [ __ ] dicks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out boys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because it was it was so cold on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> top that as you were like as you were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just staring at the landscape your hair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would freeze yeah so like our hair was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> frozen solid while our bottom halves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like nice nice and toasty it was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> weird because like even though your hair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is frozen and like your shoulders and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head are just like covered in snow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not cold because you're sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in boiling hot water yeah you're sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in boiling water so it's like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect weird balance and it's just yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know what minerals they had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on in that bath but like every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i felt like silky smooth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i felt amazing it was boring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes a bit of bath water just slips </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in god i sound like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i sound like [ __ ] mail-in now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes like my face was like freezing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cold i needed to like warm it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what the towel was for god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh you got that you got the you get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> water on the towel as well you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's true how was your skiing a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> snowboarding gun it was uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you improved a lot i did think i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> improved i think gone improved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely like i definitely my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> confidence went way up from like day one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to day four having said that i think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learned the most on day four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day one two and three i had one goal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> survive right and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] halo music starts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> an objective survive because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go you go down some of these slopes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was having a chat with connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about you know there are like green </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slopes there are like red slopes and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are like black slopes but at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> end of the day it's just a [ __ ] label </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know god's not god's not there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> creating mountains being like i'm going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make this a green slope at exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> these the same angles throughout i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like and the map is like yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he's just like playing like sim city </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the [ __ ] earth or whatever you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know god's not [ __ ] doing that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're you you get what you're given </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the mountains not every mountain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and not every slope even if it's labeled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a green slope there are different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> variations there are different variables </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the red slopes are actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> easier than the greens i would say so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would say so yeah so if you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> familiar with uh snow sports at all uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the slopes normally categorized in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> colors or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> diamonds wherever you're from shapes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah normally it's uh green is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> easiest then some some also use blue in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> europe australia so in europe you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes see green you sometimes don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it depends on which country you're in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's normally blue red black and in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> america you have black diamond japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> also uses black diamond as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's red circle uh sorry green circle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> red square black diamond yeah yeah oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wow yeah because in japan there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> squares like green circle green circle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because normally the the biggest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> variation of difficulty comes in black </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slopes yeah because they're like some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> them are literally just like they're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> treated at all yeah some of them are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just awful and so that's why there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even uh normally a bigger scale but in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> europe it's just all black yeah they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] it it's all so hard yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you've been skiing before yeah so on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> first day we just stayed on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally the baby beginner slope it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally like i did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me and god did because it was like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> warm-up slope yeah me joey and luke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> stayed on the beginner slope the baby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> park slope of this [ __ ] ski resort um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the next day we're like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're feeling confident now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually take the gondola up to like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> top of the mountain and ski down the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> green slopes um so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like no distinction from me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from what was a green slope and what was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a red slope we actually followed connor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we accidentally took a red slope i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't i couldn't tell the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly because they were that was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like me [ __ ] fighting for my life to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go down like the tiniest little slope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's that's like i couldn't tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the difference between like a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> degrees not to mention the weather that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day was so [ __ ] like the visibility was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like five meters yeah yeah so the so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this uh this resort had a beginner slope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i when i said beginner slope this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the most beginner slope i've ever seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it is literally like a flat surface </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sometimes it goes to a one percent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's like a one or two so you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing if you're actually like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> beginners beginners which luke was yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah yeah yeah yeah with a friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who came with us luke who had never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> skied in his life yeah and it was a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> start i mean i think he got confident on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah yeah he did he's like oh i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only fallen over once i can go to the so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you wanted to go and do any other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slopes that were kind of difficult we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had to go all the way to the top yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's where it kind of gets you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't really have a choice if some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> them are difficult or not yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the day before we went up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we went up the day before and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the visibility was awful yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could maybe see like five meters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ahead of you yeah and we go pretty fast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like just like i'm just hoping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't find someone because if i do i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna hit someone and it's like oh god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh god it was really sketchy really bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then but even the second day the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> visible is quite [ __ ] right yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first day was a lot worse i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> literally couldn't like maybe i couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see what that camera oh wow maybe no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe ashley where ashley is that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about where it starts to get blurry and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i couldn't see anything right right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the next day was it was still bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but it was bad so so we went with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> another friend uh ohara he's a youtuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh who lives here and then we were he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chris as well yeah and chris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well all right so to give you to give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you a gauge of like the skill levels i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> guess like what would you put yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what would you put yourself i would say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah so so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh i've like no issue doing like black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slopes or whatever so me and ohara </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we were like the most confident </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> ones you're like alright i was like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go in the front you like direct them and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll go in the back and i'll like if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they fall over i'll help you but i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> help them get back out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> luckily i'm glad i was there because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> luke at one point lost his ski in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really thick snow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and when you're in ski boots you can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really go up the mountain if you're not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> used to it like if you're if you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a beginner it's really hard to like feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> confident running around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i was wearing snowboard boots so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like all right just wait there i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go and dig through the snare and after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like five minutes i've managed to find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] ski buried in the snow it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> had gone underneath the snow slid so you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> couldn't even there was no sign yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah oh [ __ ] it was there so i just had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to like rummage through yeah eventually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> found it so we went down anyway but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we took these guys up and it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a mess because like none of them could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like stand up chris is good at skiing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but chris is lazy right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i did notice that i didn't know chris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chris ken and eric and chris could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> probably do a black slope right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah maybe yeah if chris really tried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah problem is black slopes are really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tiring and take a lot of effort yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chris doesn't want to do that and chris </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also is like he'll do reds but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> really have to convince him he's trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to do greens he's like chris you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> do reds so easily what are you doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because i remember like the third </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or fourth day he came with me gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> luke on a green slope because that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we started to get a little more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> confident and he was like yeah i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll stick on the green too and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] off almost get out of here you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> passed the exam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like [ __ ] skiing past us with no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> problem whatsoever come on boys catch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> second day we tried to take them down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh yeah how long did it take us to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get to them okay so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if if i went from top to bottom without </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> stopping and i went as fast as i could i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could probably do it in five minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah but that's like dangerously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it probably took us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 30 to 45 minutes no it took us like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it took like two hours the first time at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> least the first time because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like we i swear we spent like 15 to 20 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes looking for what you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looking for uh luke's skis and then uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before that as well because this was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right at the start so the visibility was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so poor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i probably would have a hard time seeing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> joey from where from where he's sitting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's how poor the visibility was um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this was also like basically my only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my second full day skiing uh so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's snowboarding so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um i didn't know how to properly control </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my board </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i remember we were trying to stick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> close to a group right we're trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stay close to a group and i'm trying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm fighting for my life just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see where the group was right and so we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so before every hill we all stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before hill um unfortunately my control </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the board was not good enough that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knew how to stop yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so so these guys were stopped waiting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for me and luke and um so i come along </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i try to stop and i realize that i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stopping too late and i'm sliding down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the slope so i start shouting out oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> guys i i'm going now i'm just gonna go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ahead and like and and nobody looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nobody looked nobody looked back and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just started stumbling down this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hill get halfway down and i turn around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to see if anyone's followed wait a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait two minutes wait five minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's nobody and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] where is everybody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i am on this slope at the top of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mountain by myself and i can't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] stop correctly so i had to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like messaging the lion group </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to get their attention luckily um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> luckily i waited long enough for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys to come down because they these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys were waiting for me this entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i thought that garm was behind us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how poor the visibility was um so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we wasted just 20 minutes where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were waiting for me and i was waiting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because we couldn't [ __ ] see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> each other because i was very worried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this uh the way that this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mountain was laid out is that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> basically you have to do like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really big s's to stay on the easy ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if they take if they took any turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at any point they would go down a black </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slope yeah it's just a cliff and i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh they're gonna die if they go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> down a black slope yeah so i was like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> got to do my best to make sure like we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> got i'm like like uh what are they what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are the [ __ ] sheep dogs like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to round them around up all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sheep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come on boys stick together yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was kind of like that uh which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is why i think i learned the most on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> last day because uh on the last day we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just found like this one slope that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect for beginners and had like a ski </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lift take us back up and you just had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the freedom to just do what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want without worrying about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dying or just you know breaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the weather was absolutely good and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> weather was like yeah so we had three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> days of god-awful weather really bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> weather and finally the last day when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we're leaving it's amazing and it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> shame really because the next few days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after that was also really good yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we kind of booked it the wrong time but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was amazing weather really good stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the last day i'm really impressed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that nobody got injured like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because i agree yeah there's six of us i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mean did you guys take any bad tumbles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> during uh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i let's just say i'm really glad i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> rented out a helmet because uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i think about 80 of my falls involved me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just my head just getting [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whiplash back right didn't you like kill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a toddler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i almost did i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i because like like on the first like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two three days i didn't know how to stop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so my technique for stopping uh involved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> falling over um and if i didn't fall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over i would just basically just take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> out whoever like was in front of me this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is this great photo that luke took of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you just like there's this kid right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here and then there's just gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> menacingly behind me like i'm about to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> destroy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i must have decked at least like three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kids on the slope for like the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> three days oh my god god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the kid killer thank god no one got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> injured except for those three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like it was because it was like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> competition because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me and luke just kept [ __ ] crashing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into each other in the first two days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we had zero control yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't know how to control our balls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and i remember uh luke decked joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah [ __ ] legs sweeped me i had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> great pov of this i was like really i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was i was my i was like leading everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down the right slopes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then i was waiting for them at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bottom and i saw joey just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slowly like going down like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then out of nowhere like rko i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just see our friend luke who doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know how to stop she's coming coming and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i see jerry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm like i'm about getting my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> popcorn out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just waiting for this to happen so yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joey's going joey's going doesn't move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his head at all and then suddenly he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just goes doom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right in the back of his legs and joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just flips over like i'm so funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because all i heard was i was i was i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was slowly going down because it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of a narrow stretch and also i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> waiting for luke right yeah so i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slightly going down because i saw you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys there and i i remember specifically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> behind me i could hear luke in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distance going sorry sorry sorry sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is getting louder and louder and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> louder but i thought he was saying that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to other people right that were behind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> me yeah so i was like well luke you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> silly hear me silly him it gets louder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry sorry sorry and then just bam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right in the back of my knees </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's get flipped over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i should have been more concerned but it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was so funny i wish you had filmed that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by the time i realized it was happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was like five seconds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> couldn't have got my phone out but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> wish i did i wanted to see i wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> shut up we should have my gopro on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> permanent yeah right i was too busy like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> falling over myself to really see what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone else was like falling over over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i remember i had a few bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tumbles but actually like some of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> worst tumbles was when i was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually not going the fastest it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like because when you go fast sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you saw you guys saw me do have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some pretty big fours where i did like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] triple backflip or whatever yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever but to me those falls are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fine because you take the momentum and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you just like literally roll with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it right and you hardly feel it some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the worst falls i had was on like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> second day because he saw this one yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these guys were trying to like warn me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not to stop myself with my hands right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes if you have a bad four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you stop yourself with your hands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you uh you could break your wrist you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could snap your wrist or break your arm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something so they were telling me uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've got to you've got to fall on your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arms you've got to do this make sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> make sure you don't try to catch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself you've got to do this i need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like this right and i took that as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm going to do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not realizing the mistake i was about uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to encounter because what happened is i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had a like i was taking a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tumbles i was like this doesn't hurt i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm a [ __ ] pro at falling over with a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a snowboard so there's one time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was going down this really like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this this if the slope wasn't steep at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all it's going pretty slowly but i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> catch the edge and i'm about to fall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> straight to my face so i do what they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell me and i tuck my arms in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately my fists were right in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> front of my face right so what happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is i fall on my arm and i just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> deck myself in the face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i fall over and you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know when you have a bad four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just gotta like lay there yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just question life for a bit that's when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's bad yeah yeah and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> remember i lay there for a few seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i just hear kind of going right on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because i just saw this like because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously it looks like ants in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> background i just saw he can't just fall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on his face and i was like get back up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> get back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get back up and then he didn't get up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm like oh no he hurt himself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like it was a couple of times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like like on the last day i think where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you did that like triple back flip right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah i saw it in the distance and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like oh that that that looked like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it hurt and then god just did a move for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about 20 seconds i was like oh he's dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh he's straight up dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i never seen that one i just saw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like someone doing like flips but not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good i could hear the ssx music playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when that was happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he took so many falls i did i did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think that's when i learned the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> though when you when you do take the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> falls it's not about how many times you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> get hit down it's how you get how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> times you get back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's about the drive it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like the most embarrassing fall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i took wasn't even on the slopes it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the ski lift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah uh yeah because uh well joey was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there because uh me and joey were trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to get on the ski lift together for two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes so two it was a yeah it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two-man ski lift so me and joey line up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> together so we're just gonna have a nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chill ride up on the mountain and so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look back i've done the skeeter for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bunch of times so i'm not even a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> beginner anymore i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i i like know how to get on the ski lift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right so so you think it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it is a lot harder on a snowboard than a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ski yeah also i thought because i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i'm standing there waiting for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ski lift to come around i look back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and in my mind i take a mental note of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the momentum </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of this ski lift right so i know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fast this thing's going yeah and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> uh it gets to uh it gets near us i turn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around thinking it's gonna have the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> momentum not thinking that they're gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slow down slow it down for us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so what i do is i turn around and i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know that feeling where you take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a step where you think there's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stare yeah and then there's just not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i had that i had that feeling where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sit down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i just feel nothing and i'm like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no and like i just i just collapsed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and then the next thing i notice is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like the [ __ ] bump on the back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of my helmet which thank god i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wearing a helmet at this point yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i'm just like they're gonna stop the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ski lift so my instinct uh is just to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> adopt the fetal position well while they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hopefully stop the ski lift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plot twist they don't stop the ski lift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so the ski lift just goes over me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and joey just like joey i guess just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snowboards over me because i look at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i look up thinking what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happening and i just see joey just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> looking back on the skeely being right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're right [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was because it was amazing because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm surprised they didn't stop it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they said yeah they should stop right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like because how i usually do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like skis or snowboards is i wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the the chair to physically hit me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the back of the knees so that's where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know oh it's right underneath kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like bend over yeah just get my butt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ready so i was i was doing that i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking back you know just waiting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting waiting waiting until it hits me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right here and then i look over look up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sit down thinking it's all good and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i hear like this horrible scraping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sound from somewhere i was like what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's going on i look over and god's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just down there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> under the thing just like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like oh they're gonna stop it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't stop it it's right over gun i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was like all right that's cruel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they finally stop it after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's gone past you yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the woman comes over being like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> alright i'm like what do you mean you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right yeah you should have stopped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why did you why did you check up on him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> after you left the chair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like watching a fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the teachers like watching the kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like when it's over like oh you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're sorry i was like i'll wait for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them to throw a few yeah i'll break it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> up break it up let's bring it over here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> well that was the most embarrassing one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're just like everyone was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just obviously staring at me i stopped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the entire ski lift and yeah that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just just like social anxiety up through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the roof because i'm just like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happens yeah i know it happens they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> can't see your face yeah that's true </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true you're completely coughed up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah aside from that had a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> wonderful time uh my body hurt a lot but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it was worth it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm i'm like just wearing i'm raring to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> go again honestly it's probably some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the best snow i've ever snowboarded or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> skied on my life this is amazing how is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it compared to like european ski resorts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um i think i like european ones more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's normally they're normally bigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way more like options but i mean it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the quality of snow was insane it was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good powder it's it powdered snowed like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so like two meters a day or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah so most of the black slopes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weren't like groomed so we went on one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was literally just like i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like on a cloud yeah yeah and i fell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over on one of them because it's too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deep and it's so hard to turn and it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really bad because i basically just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shoveled a [ __ ] ton of snow into my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jacket and pants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was freezing and i was like in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cold of my my hand trying to scoop this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minus 15 trying to get all the snare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you just leave it in it'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just melt and then you'll be wet yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't even worse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try to get it out like [ __ ] [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i had to like ski for another hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> my my ass was completely numb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i couldn't feel anything it was so bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i i when i got back to the room i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like i can't i can't feel my ass at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all it's been numb for like a good two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone could have smacked my ass and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't know that clip is definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to be taken out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can't kill my mouth i just took such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> beating it's so numb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing too much riding on the board </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so good though it was really cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there's really good ski resorts i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> pain in the ash to get to but good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i think if i if i go there again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'd probably want to like go to sapporo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for a bit or something yeah and then go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there i think i think that's what like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of uh tourists do is they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of maybe dedicate like a week or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> two for like the whole thing because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of out of the way especially if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're coming from tokyo is a really fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> city yeah as far as grace is a really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chill city like all i wanted to do on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this ski trip was just get the basics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> down for my snowboarding and i think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> managed to do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so now i'm like more confident </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thank you came along very well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> improved a lot but uh yeah now i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ready to like tear it down with the boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for real hopefully and try and try and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> keep up with them the real ssx trickies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i want everyone to get better so that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then chris feels obliged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but he has no choice because no one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wants to do greens anymore yeah i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we accidentally went down a reds on our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> second day like like we just said it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't go amazing but we made it down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't go amazing uh but we survived </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the important thing we have yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like there was this um there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically there was this tiny little and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little little sign that was like go this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way if you want to go back to where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> came from on a green yeah and if you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down straight which is like the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing you know you wouldn't it's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard to see this thing because it also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes back in on itself yeah so the slope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes down this way and there's a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> cut off here where it goes down and back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around and then joins off to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> another mountain it's impossible to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> considering and the entire thing is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> white </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the conditions are really bad so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just everything explains and then i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last because i was making sure everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was all right and then i i was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> no the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> luke who i was with at the time because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm pretty sure he was last he went down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the red and i was like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> moments before a disaster he just went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then i'm like oh my god they've all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gone down the green and then we're stuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here and it's like lunch time yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we was already it was like 1 1 30 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i was like oh we probably would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> eating by now like we're [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we want to go meet have lunch with them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> as well so how do we get back like but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then luckily all these [ __ ] idiots </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> went down the red as well turns out we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all missed it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so we all met up yeah yeah but then this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> green was really annoying as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was like you had it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a flat really really flat and i told the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy i was like guys you got to make sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get as much speed as you can on your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboards yeah like walk anywhere we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like got it put snowboards on two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> seconds later falls on our ass all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> taking it off walking the whole way yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm going as fast as i can as i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like getting low to the ground like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get out of aerodynamics i get i get over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there and i'm like oh my god i made it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right nice i'm waiting i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll come any second now like 10 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes later they come around the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> corner walking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like what is this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay to be fair we did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we did attempt to snowboard to to me it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't a case of getting to the end to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me it was a case of how far can i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> before i fall over because like i knew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once i fought i fell over that was it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> momentum was going i gotta take off my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] it is hard to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh go fast on a snowball much easier on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> skis um i don't know i i just kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again i like i was like i'm i'm all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> self-taught with it yeah so i just you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just kind of get a feeling for it oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah sure yeah by the end of the week we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all i think definitely got a feeling for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it go fast go fast i mean we were going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a hell of a lot faster on the last day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to the first day that's true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like god was [ __ ] blitzing down this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> mountain and i was like oh god he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about to ssx tricky right now i could i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> could feel it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah well we had to get back to like our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ski resort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the they closed their like way of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting over yeah yeah what would you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> call the what's the another brilliant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing what's the it's like a pathway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what's there's a word for this right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well pathway no no slalom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a i've got the word i forgot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what it was there's a word for like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> entrance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that is like a i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an entryway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're literally using all the words i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know i know so there's a path right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it closes at like 3 30. so we had so i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like [ __ ] okay if you don't go back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over as well you have to get like a 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 40 minute bus ride yeah yeah and i'd i'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rather kill myself than your bus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just so depressing when you've got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your ski gear yeah yeah you've got to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sit on this bus and it's like oh no i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why would i do that when i can ski back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah i'm not so i me and ohara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> were going to go back over and then we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asked the guys we're like are you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming and they're like ah no we'll get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the bus because it was like kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tough we had to ski a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly get on a chair lift ski over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then walk over and then ski back down it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is kind of difficult especially if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're tired right yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they weren't doing it and i was like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right no worries we'll do it we'll do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so we were going and then right before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were about to cross it they they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> called us and they were like oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually we'll we'll do it i think we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can do it yeah run like oh [ __ ] it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like mission impossible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta get these boys back i'm trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to start saving private ryan back to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel we've got to get them back over so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had to quickly like rush these guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were like no falling just go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't don't stop just just be good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because they shut it off at 3 30 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason i don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just 3 30 the sun [ __ ] sets so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just can't see anything especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up there like even during the day the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> visibility was so bad right that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty bad yeah yeah i definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand why people will snow and ski </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> board from this trip though especially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the last day where the visibility was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clear and i just kind of realized oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboarding and skiing is just hiking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the fun part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because you're going down yeah go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go you got the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you get like the amazing view but you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't have to put in the effort of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> getting that amazing view isn't it crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you like you're on the ground and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you look up at the mountain and you see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> us steep some of these things yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and you're like [ __ ] i i skied down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there i snowballed down there it's crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i remember on the first day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we stayed on the beginner slope so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the beginner slope had this ski lift to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take us up the beginning slope and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> taking us up because it was so slow it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> took us like what 15 minutes i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like 10 10 10 10 15 minutes so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in my mind i'm like oh we're going up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like half the mountain holy [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then i remember on the second day when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conor was like oh yeah we're gonna go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the top of the mountain today and i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like cool where was the beginner slope </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he points this point which is like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tenth of the way up the mountain and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you mean you mean we were this low </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the view was so good it was already </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> mean i don't [ __ ] know it's hard to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> explain right because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't like the blockchain yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not the blockchain it like it's a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can't easily describe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how you describe kind of like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blockchain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe if god played it he's really god's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really good at giving short descriptions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to stuff i've noticed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why it's my job that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally what i do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not when i play this game it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> well it's kind of like ah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> battle simulation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chess thing you buy units and then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place them and then it plays out on its </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> own the battle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like tower defense but chess but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then every like it's one battle and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you you lose health all don't miss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> health depending on what happens yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like tower defense is kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that right you buy units and then it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> plays away right yeah but you're playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> against another player </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so you're so he's buying stuff and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're buying stuff and you're placing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them on the board right and then you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> against each other and then you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you also get like stuff that comes up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you it's a game gambling but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like rerolling for like more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it is a very boring game when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explain it extremely so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's fun you say that about most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> things it's one of those games again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i wouldn't recommend playing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alone there's uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with friends it's great yeah i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with friends it's really fun yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a lot of ways it's like chill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's not too intense like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can talk like league is too intense i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel league like i never like i've tried </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing league with mates before and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just that silent guy because i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> concentrating too much on the gameplay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be able to communicate with my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends um or like have a good time it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> great there's a lot of down time in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> game yeah you're not doing anything so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can just chat yeah it's you can do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it very casually it's really chill yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> three four hours yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's i mean it's like maybe like an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it there's a lot of dialogue you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to sift through there is a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dialogue a lot of like because okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> here's the thing when you go to newtown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do you talk to everyone [ __ ] no okay i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> talk to everyone i'm like i'm like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is he's a classic jrpg this is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is me this is jrp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being like i have to talk to everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't miss the items right about an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hour and i'm just like this is really </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like 500 pokemon how many potions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like not needed to change my pokemon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once since like my main pokemon yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe uh maybe my experience is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different from my experience as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> childhood because as a child </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just so easy for me to immerse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> myself into a game this is why pokemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like challenges are so good and they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got that's why people love them on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube like it's a way to turn a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pokemon game into a more challenging and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i suppose adult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way more fun i can't i can't play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pokemon vanilla anymore i have to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it a challenge so fun randomizers are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fun because because i i came into this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking i haven't played pokemon since </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pokemon ruby i can just play this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> casually and have kind of the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience i did as i did as a kid yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i don't know if i'm just not far </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> enough into the game yet but i mean to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me like two three hours into a game is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mostly most of the time that's what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give a game before i'm just like do i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stick with this game and fully commit or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do i try another game i don't think you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the game gun maybe maybe i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe i don't maybe you should try a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nuzlocke version of it that'd be more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun what's the mazlock again nuzlocke is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like permadeath basically oh so if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> poke my face you die it dies quote </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> unquote and you have to release it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can only catch one pokemon in one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> area there's lots of different rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really good there's lots of local </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rules as well you can you can kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mix it up with like different other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> rules why wouldn't you just if your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pokemon's gonna die why wouldn't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like grind like crazy well i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some people do but the challenge but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then there's a challenge element of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do i want to grind for 50 hours or do i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just want to like gamble and go for it a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of the time people aren't willing to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grind for 20 hours just to secure that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pokemon well it's more fun and on stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very good it's very good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounds like great stream content that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just sounds stressful to me it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stressful yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that looks a hell stress i saw someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do uh one pp challenge what's that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every pokemon they're only allowed to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> use the move once oh [ __ ] in like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> battle i think yeah yeah unless it heals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> up again right yeah yeah there's there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some pretty [ __ ] obscure challenges </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's the soul link which looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> basically like where you both of you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> another together and like if joey's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> pokemon dies when we caught it at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same time my pokemon dies too yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> do you think pokemon should have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difficulty setting i think they should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just well i don't know why they haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had their own nuzlocke into the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game just call it whatever they want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> call it they'll they'll remove their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> name nozzle because it's pokemon they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> won't they don't give credit to anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah uh but i don't know why they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't put it in the game people do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's at the end of the day it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> still a children's game yeah but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people are doing this to their games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyway and people are going to do it why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not just add the option like it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's a children's game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people but like surely adding like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially like a randomizer right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surely that's easy to add oh yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> helpful go in the code be like random </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all and yeah it should work right super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> easy i know because like for me i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never i never got the pokemon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversation before because i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hadn't played a pokemon in so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long but now that i've now now that i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> started to play i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when does like when does this get fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how long how long do i not need to be on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> autopilot for before this is yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're playing normally i think if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tried another lock on on a stream you'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoy it a lot but i i like if i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> supposed to play it normally as a casual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> player who knows zero about pokemon gold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> am i too old for that connor you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> played too many games you know how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game so i'm not even a gamer i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even a gamer i'm not jrpgs right yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> play like grinding for like 15 hours to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like get one sash or something i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you're too good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're too good at like grinding yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but and pokemon now actually doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> require any grinding you can just do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like you'll start a pokemon stomps when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did that happen i remember in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> original pokemon as a kid i had to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> grind the [ __ ] out like even just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the first two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> first two gym leaders </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's so [ __ ] broken yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what did they have that was such a like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> added that in like x and y i think no it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was before that i think really black and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> white wait no oh no black and white they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't have it i think it was x and y it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was always an item but it always only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gave it to one pokemon yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then now they just they were like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just turn it on for everyone you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> experience by catching pokemon as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which was never a thing yeah you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experienced by catching when you catch a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pokemon yeah the pokemon in your party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get experience yeah yeah as if you as if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you defeated it yeah they just they just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] they're just oprah winfrey and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] the experience like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting xp you hit exp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as as as a gacha gamer i'm disgusted by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the lack of grinding i need to do in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as a gamer i'm disgusted by you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i haven't yeah i have been thinking to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> do maybe like shiny runs or like uh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know like stuff like that where it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a little more challenging you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah the really a really fun one i did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was uh i did like a pokemon emerald mod </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where when and whenever you enter a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> building it teleports you to a random </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part of the map oh yeah i've seen that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one that one was really fun but because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was so [ __ ] hard because you had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like route everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on your own yeah so if you weren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> familiar with the map of the game you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were just [ __ ] true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was really fun though because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it gives on a completely different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> challenge to it yeah it actually becomes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like really entertaining and fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so all new pokemon games just this easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you like they all artificially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> add difficulty to your own run yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd say ever since like black and white </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or x and y is where it's really starts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like hold your hand i honest i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand gamers now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought you guys were being babies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> complaining about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it actually it actually holds your hand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you've played pokemon ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> since the beginning yeah yeah i go from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that which is like if you catch a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pokemon you need to commit to leveling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it up oh dude like kids if i want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> give a kid today who grew up on like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sword and shield yeah like the new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> remakes give them like the original blue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like red and black play this game and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah watch them like have a mental </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> breakdown of how difficult it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to what they get today did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> did you see the uh [ __ ] what was it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> called [ __ ] um i totally forgot no sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah no because i remember as a kid i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know it's it like some things just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> felt rewarding that i don't feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> rewarded with this game for example when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you level up your pokemon every pokemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just levels up automatically yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like an auto leveler </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the pokemon let's go eevee and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pikachu oh yeah yeah yeah they gave your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> starter pokemon like increased stance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the eevee or pikachu and it had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> special move yeah just one shot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everything yeah so they gave they gave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you like a starter they could just one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shot the most [ __ ] part about evie i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really enjoyed evie to be fair but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most [ __ ] part about evie was uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i did an eevee only run on stream once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's just so [ __ ] easy but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in in some of the pokemons you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to there's just this dude who's like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can teach your eevee any move of any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> type for free which one would you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like fire move and it's like and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like really [ __ ] powerful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moves as well so it's like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the catch it's like no catch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because you talked to me i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh good and i did i think i did the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eevee only run in like four hours it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like one of the easiest [ __ ] games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i only did it because i like evie so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's like was it after pokemon ruby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that everything started to just get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> easy the original diamond and pearl was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> still like in that same difficulty range </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i think i reckon it was around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like x and y like 6th gen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they introduced like the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like experience sharing and like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> really like holding your hand element </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> this like ps1 game and it was like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> shrek game </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a shrek picnic game or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm sure shrek enthusiasts can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> inform you about this game right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember the whole point of this game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you were assembling like i i could be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> describing this completely correctly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the parts to your picnic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and you had to go and like beat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bosses and [ __ ] but like nothing worked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the game i remembered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have to look this up okay can we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> communicate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't sound like a real game shrek </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ps1 games google it right shrek i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember it's like a fever dream in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> game the polygons were so it's a shriek </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> treasure hunt that's it that's it this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> game right i played this game oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like one polygon in this whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that looks like arsed what is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's 78 like this video game what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what what what's the synopsis can you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> read the synopsis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> treasure hunt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gameplay oh plot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as shrek is preparing a picnic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with fiona the three blind mice steal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the picnic equipment such as foods </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and drinks so shrek must go on an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adventure doing mini games to get the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> items back before fiona arrives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i remember it was like a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mini games right and these mini games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like all broken up it didn't work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i love games with these kinds of shitty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plots because you can just imagine it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just being like fiona i have to go again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i should've been with the hair the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> camera was like unusable and it kept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> breaking my ps1 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then eventually it like just broke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was so close to the end of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> game i was distraught yeah what's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> last picnic item i couldn't believe it i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember you have to go to like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> castle or something to fight these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] mice or something like that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i was just so angry that i couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> finish it i have to i have to find that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and play it you got to play it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds amazing it's a great game it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] you just stream it i guess i should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i'll stream it if you want me to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want to see it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i actually have a game recommendation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> though that i found okay um it is a jrpg </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> though all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it is called 13 sentinels oh i've heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of that have you heard of that yes so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've found this by like complete [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accident because i'm just like trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look through my game library of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> games that sound interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh i just kind of downloaded it on a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whim because i'm just like anime game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brilliant yeah somehow it's not pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anymore i say that but pokemon's an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but uh yeah i download it and it is got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it has got a really [ __ ] ins </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting concept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so the story how i can best describe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this it's like if you take boca rano </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and mix that with steins gates right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so the reason you have it's called 13 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sentinels is because you have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically you have 13 main characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so the way this story unfolds is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're able to select </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um a perspective of part of this main </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> character and the basis of this is uh at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some point in the future </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um like [ __ ] kaiju come along and try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to [ __ ] destroy the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so these 13 kids have to save the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> world from this kaiju attack right but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think they fail or something um so time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> travel exists right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you're watching you're playing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perspective this game from like 13 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different perspectives and these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perspectives like jump between timelines </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and universes depending on who you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whose perspective you're on um and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think this would be a complete [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mess right yeah like how can you tell a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coherent story when you can choose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between 13 different perspectives well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how how the game works is that you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only progress to a certain amount of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point in one person's perspective before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to play another person's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perspective so one person's story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> root is unlocked by playing a certain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> part of another person's story roots </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right so the way you would get you the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way you get delivered this story is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little by little and you get to piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> together what the [ __ ] has happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this entire [ __ ] timeline it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> actually like insane it's cool yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember yeah i remember my my twitch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chat like telling me all about it be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you'd [ __ ] love this good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ratings it does have good ratings that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's kind of that's kind of why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i like aegis rim 13 13 sentinels aegis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> room oh it's an atlas game of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why it's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so so the gameplay is kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like a turn-based strategy it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the the best way i can describe it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks gorgeous yeah that looks cute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks really cute yeah it is a very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> atlas game i realized because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> basically a mix between a visual novel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but with gameplay elements to break up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the story of that visual novel switch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> versions coming out in april this year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh i i i highly recommend that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that was just a that was that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just something i played on the whim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like i said i give everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two hours or something try and grab me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this one like grabbed me immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it has a very original storytelling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> method and uh i'm about halfway through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like they use like some of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twists and turns i've seen in the story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like [ __ ] insane atlas don't miss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> me yeah yeah you really don't miss yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so except their new catherine game that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i know more about the memes of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> catherine game than actual actual people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that have played catherine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was not that good because it's weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like a lot of atlas games just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hear more about the japanese side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about it but like i'd hardly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever hear anyone in the western </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hemisphere talking about it unless it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> persona yeah that's basically the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> western hemisphere or the western the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> western world the western i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> why i said well i don't know why i said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hemisphere there isn't japan in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> western hemisphere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> technically anywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> depending on where you're working i kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of realized that yeah yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel it's because like in the west </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like very it's it's a very cool fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> base for those games you know yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they are like the jrpg players </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jrpgs a lot of people like anime game no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thank you yeah exactly yeah they take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one yeah rightfully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah they take one look at the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> visuals or like the concept and they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like nope </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd rather play bang bang bang </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a certain kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> expectation that comes with anime games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that in my experience is always the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you always get that same feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah even if the stories are different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gameplay is different something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about it just always comes off as the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same in my mind i don't know why i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't fault people after thinking that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> though that's what i like about it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the consistency yeah i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fault people for thinking that though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's exactly how i feel with a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of fps games yeah where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the concept is different but at the end </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of the day it's still bang bang bang </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah so i i don't it's fine oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no more jrpgs for me but like even like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> western driven story driven games as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well it's just like i don't know i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> guess it's the same reason why i'm into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime versus movies and tv shows right i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean i will always watch a movie and tv </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show but those aren't the core pieces of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entertainment that i like for example </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember playing the last of us and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a great game but i just have like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zero emotional attachment to it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i i play it and i can like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> objectively view as a anime huh because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if they were more anime you'd be like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> care </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i don't know why it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the way western storytelling works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it's it's it's it's got like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different tropes and a different method </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of storytelling but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know why i gravitate more to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the anime style of storytelling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i i do think they do have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> different style oh definitely definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different cultures yeah different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different cultures and everything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that and you know the way joel and ellie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were written as characters were great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're they were great characters i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just i don't know i just didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> emotionally attach myself to either of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those characters even though i could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tell that they were great characters why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you emotionally attach yourself more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to anime characters then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's a weeb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right like what what about the way that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they do their characters is more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> appealing i think it's because they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> unrealistic i i was gonna say because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what bothers me yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i i like the fact that with anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> characters there's like a clear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> distinction between reality and fantasy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and i i like having that easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> separation in my mind where you can have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really well-written anime characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are still clearly like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] unrealistic like just take any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] tsundere for example yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can have great written cinderellas but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the day if you meet a real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] real life singer you're just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to think that they're they're a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why why are they putting like why are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they doing domestic violence on their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like partner or whatever right do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think that the authors who are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> writing these are intentionally making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unrealistic characters or they that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're they're intending to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> real characters but it just comes off as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> unrealistic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's i think it's all based on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like not only like the cultural </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understanding and like norm of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> author but it's also the fact that a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of these authors are also hashing off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other japanese creations and other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese characters right so yes you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know that like i i don't really know of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> many or any like japanese author who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> takes direct influence from like western </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff for instance yeah right like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> only one i can think of is like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> iraqi yeah you know which is why his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> characters are so [ __ ] different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to the traditional norm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manga anime character character yeah not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just like visually but also like as like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a characteristic of that particular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> person right yeah like why why is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so many anime set in high school why is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that like is that a cultural thing it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a cultural thing why why so it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's for a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like high school is kind of seen as like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this basically like golden time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's depressing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like for a lot of people high </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school is like you know the whole thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of like in the west of like high school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like you know usually movies that are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> based in high school in the west are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> based off bad memories yeah you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like oh man my high school [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sucked blah blah blah there were all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these [ __ ] people the jocks the bullies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blah blah blah right that's the norm in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the west in japan it's glorified because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to a lot of people high school was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really fun time with like friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll never get back and like yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> last because it's also the last years of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that person being young and free i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i liked high school but i wouldn't say i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liked my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i think as well in terms of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a storytelling like standpoint as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well like i feel like kids in high </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school or like kids going through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> puberty is just already a really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting like character dynamic like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can like you can get characters to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get away with a lot of [ __ ] just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're in puberty yeah but i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are so many [ __ ] shows and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> many anime where you look at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> characters and they could be in any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] setting oh yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like some of the [ __ ] that these high </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> schoolers go through they like go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> through like two world wars they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they're like like fighting avengers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> level threats when they've reached the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] 13 years old and you're probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not a well-written character yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's clearly just an author being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i like high school settings let's put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them into high school you know but don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually take full advantage of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately but there's a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> authors that take full advantage of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the high school characters and that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whole setting and actually like work it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> into their characters and story mind you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the minority in my opinion a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of them are just like high school rel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> realistic uh relatable with audience am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i right let's just throw them in there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i watched uh the gretzky the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> new season oh it's good that was good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very refreshing depressing as you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always depressing as [ __ ] yes which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great to see because it's like one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only anime out there that will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like commentate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on adult life in japan and be realistic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it also says a lot when it no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> knows about it in japan yeah is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> true it is absolutely it is absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unknown in japan oh [ __ ] yeah like it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not popular at all probably because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> too real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in japan very japanese things in it as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> well it's so japanese but like yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> such a good take on the japanese works </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like awesome how awful it is yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause like i i mean it's ironic that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this has come from the same company that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know made hello kitty yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to put it into perspective like how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> deep they're going so in japan right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they have a thing called say shine right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah which is like an employee for life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you can't you can never fire this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> employee they have to do something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] right they have to leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on their own right but like even the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only way they can get fired is if they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually do something like illegal right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only way they can leave that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cannot it's like going to jail you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> literally do the shittiest job on earth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like you could like not turn up and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cannot be fired right yeah so in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously because they decided job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> security so yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so obviously if you told that to anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in any western country they'd be like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't think that sounds like a good idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and because it's not because it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not like let's just be honest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously job security is good and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know that's that's good but like it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> terrible idea for any business right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you need you need to be able to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rid of employees yeah yeah of course but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously in the west we you know it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in some places they're a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little too happy to fire employees yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah so you know it has to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a balance it's a balance there's a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> arc or like story in the new season i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> won't spoil who it is or what it is but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a character who uh because they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't fire him uh they just relocate him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to some [ __ ] and they don't give him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any work yeah and they basically just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like morally make him want to quit yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and it's a whole thing and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's pretty [ __ ] that's the only way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that says shane can quit yeah so they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they basically just pressure yeah they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bully you yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so so there's a whole thing where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they like just make him [ __ ] off and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like make him you know because obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are people don't want to people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to be valued right when they do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> work right and if you're just not doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything you're going to be like why am </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i here yeah obviously if i was there i'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like fantastic i can catch up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fantastic let's uh let's just play apex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why it works in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like are you telling me i could just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do whatever i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're gonna give me the salary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the latest the great school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right thanks for the paycheck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is where i'm never gonna be hired </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> full-time say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i've said that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this is bad maybe that's for the better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah true true yeah they go to some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really dark stuff and it's a shame that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not being japanese i feel like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could make waves maybe it's too real i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it is i think it's just purely the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fact that you know a japanese person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will look at that and be like i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to see this because it's just going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to remind me of a reality and uh so a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of japanese people that's not the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why they're watching there's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really one [ __ ] dark bit i mean i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sure you can remember it in the new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> season right can i spoil it i won't say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who it is i'll just say what happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no no i know what you're talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about yeah yeah maybe we should you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't say this really is it that bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a it's a bit of a it's a bit of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> twist all right yeah yeah yeah i've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watching this just pretty much just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watch later season it's [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly your great scary is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> killing it i've i've heard mixed mixed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> reviews about the fourth season actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really some people have said that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said everything it's needed to say now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's getting like it's like they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to like bring something new on the table </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> first five episodes really good yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> last first episodes boring [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like completely unnecessary i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like it that's how i felt yeah i felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like they had a good thing going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they just definitely it fizzles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out at the end yeah right right but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> still a salt season though i also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watched uh all of my sugar contents oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll see you watching adam i said i said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i was going to all of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one entrance round </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> be me right first episode right i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching this thing yeah and he gets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> issac as a as a toddler first thing he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does is starts like admiring like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> woman's tits and i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the show that everyone's hyping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this this is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he doesn't he didn't just admire the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tits he like makes a shrine out of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of their panties right yeah so the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whole first like two episodes it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just him being like an insect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i completely forgot about that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that was the one episode of just like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> race because i was like he's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah and i was like are we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seriously just gonna watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another show where an in-cell just gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rewarded with like a massive [ __ ] in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new universe bestowed confidence uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> magical powers the most opie guy and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never has to overcome the fact that he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has really unhealthy views towards women </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and sex and everything yeah but this one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was good because i felt like they he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually at least somewhat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learned that hey maybe maybe the way i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> viewed women was kind of [ __ ] up in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the past yeah and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it can be done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and they can do it not only was this the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first this guy but it was the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> self-realized insult on top of that it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a good show and i was like i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is great this is fantastic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because not only was the world building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing i was really i was really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the world i loved all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters you know even the parents who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they usually could have just been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh it's just [ __ ] parents i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really surprised fill everything up yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was really surprised when the parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> were just characters because normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you see like anime parents are just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> half the time they're not even [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there yeah you know and i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> watching when they are there you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see their eyes yeah i remember like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watching because i'm like so used to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like isaikai speed running this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right where like he gets transported he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> starts like getting the girl starts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beating up the dudes i don't know i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like five episodes into my show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> contestant i'm like what the [ __ ] he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still with the parents what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's going on and then i realized wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a minute so i'm actually getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> invested in the the the family dynamic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and the family story and stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really it's like the slow cooker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everything else is just like a microwave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know can i explore one minor plot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> point it's not a big deal it's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not a big deal but she's spoiled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the moment i knew the show was built </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sitting there you're not watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode six or seven it just starts and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the first thing that happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it's like normal family life is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the husband has cheated on the wife with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the maid yeah and she's pregnant and i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] is this show doing like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] is going on there was like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whole point where he like our 10 year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> old protagonist was diffusing this jerry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> springer episode and i'm like i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was like i was like is this good this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> good right i think this is fun this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then and then they actually get into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like world building later on and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing yeah i mean what i like about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it does take that time to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> build up [ __ ] with like all this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jerry springer [ __ ] just to say like hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dad's kind of an [ __ ] as well he can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do he can do [ __ ] bad things you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he ain't the perfect human being and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then like it helps it just like it all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plays a part into like his journey i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> guess i think the biggest down point was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you finish the first season you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this this the story hasn't even begun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i thought i missed an episode or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something when it ended i was looking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because i thought oh i'm on episode 11. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it must be 12 because it ended so bro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah oh yeah i was like oh where is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's episode 12. and then i was starting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on the new season oh saying i mean that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that i had one less episode you had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hit on me i've only seen first season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sex scene is amazing yeah the second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> season is really good second season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where is where you get so much of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> payoff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of what was like the world building </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's built up from the first season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i would be quite annoyed if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched it and season two wasn't out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because i think yeah i felt i feel blue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah but it was a great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show like again like i wanna i wanna i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can't give credit enough but the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they actually like just something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different did something different and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it worked and the fact that this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first isakai which makes me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like really concerned yeah like why did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they not take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the good parts of this [ __ ] so like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't understand is how they take this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> concept of like the main guy being an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> insult right yeah that's what he is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right i'm gonna keep saying it i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely hate these characters as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right because what was that uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> correct technically the light novels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> were like re-zero and like yeah i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay yeah i was i was going to correct </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him afterwards so it's not the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isekai but it's one of the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prominent isekai's that popularized a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of this popularity okay okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why when okay so let's say this is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the first big ones right if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone is trying to take from this why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do they take all the worst assets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because each kind of me is like like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said earlier it's just dudes who like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't have to ever like address the fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that they were shitty in the life before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they just get a free do-over where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they get everything done for them yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean it's it's weird seeing like because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was weird watching this after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching so many isakai that have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> inspired by this show because with most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> genres you have like the progenitor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right the thing that popularized a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the tropes and by the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> by the time you watch that one right you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've already seen all the tropes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before so you're like well this just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels dated now like i'd like i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get why everyone hyped this thing up in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first place because by the time you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see it everyone's already done all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tropes differently and better yeah right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but with mushokadense it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so many so many stories just missed the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point of why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this isakai is the way it is you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why is it an easter egg in the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> place well it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's transported to another world to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give himself another chance at life and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of stories took that as just oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's just put this kind of fantasy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world and just disregard the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he had a previous life you know that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like there's so many subtle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things about michoacan tennessee as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story that i feel just got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lost over time yeah in like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different iterations of ec </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not to say there's there's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other sky shows that's come after it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that haven't been good but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it seems like yeah they're a dime a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> dozen yeah it's yeah oh yeah like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fact that he had to sorry to go jordan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it just seems like so many stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just took the surface level elements of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this story without really thinking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why those elements were there in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> first place this is like maybe re-zero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did this a little bit but not to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same extent but like this is the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other issue that i've watched i'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there are others have done it where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he actually had to like deal with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trauma and fears that he had in his pr </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> past life carried over into this one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because like let's say you come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into this new life right and you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scared of snakes you're not gonna be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> magically not scared of snakes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've got the same brain right like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's still scared of going outside i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that they had to deal with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like i love that he had to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> work through all of his issues of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wanted the plot to go ahead and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted him to like become op and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kill everything and become the giga chad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i also wanted to see him actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have to work through the [ __ ] you wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it to be believable when it happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah and it's so much better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> payoff when you get to see that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> absolutely because like i was also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at the point where i was like when's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm enjoying this but when's the plot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna happen and then i've slowly come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to realize that whenever an episode is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> labeled turning point i'm just like pack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] put your seat belts on boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because some some [ __ ] is gonna go down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like and i've heard from like like novel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> readers that they're just like oh just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wait till you get like to turning point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four or five or something i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's turning point five what what is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> going on that's so good basically just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> drift course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i love shows that are confident in their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and like they don't need the characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to be the world yeah it's like they they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> assume the world lives independently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the characters it's like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just you just we just happen to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> following some characters in this world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's interesting we could follow any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the characters and you still have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great time i honestly i'll give it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a nine out of ten so far because i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel i feel like like a proud father </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i love it i love it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly it's so good like if you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like me and you're so done with isa kai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i would give this one a shot it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuinely worth it when's this episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up probably the yeah of the month right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> end of the month end of the month of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> february i think early first week of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> february first week of february why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what's up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the first week of every year all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's why i gave me show content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> semi anime of the year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i just didn't want to spoil that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> no i mean i i understand i feel like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> mean i haven't watched like odd taxi or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like that yet but yeah i mean i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was watching it and i'm like god damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's doing everything right yeah i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know i can't complain about anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean the only thing i put it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> above that was arcane uh as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as the best show of this year it's been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> zero days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally arcade okay okay okay okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> movies i don't know arcade's pretty damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good though okay arcane's pretty damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good um but yeah i mean that's uh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm i'm i'm i'm so [ __ ] happy i'm i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so [ __ ] happy about that it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like when your son finally starts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> getting an introduction like football </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the way down gratification feels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're happy i like what if i came in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here guns blazing and [ __ ] can't i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly thought you wouldn't like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because why why why'd you think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like a lot of the characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like i said before they are well written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters but a lot of them are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very tropey you know very awesome yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very trophy but i still think like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're well-written characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um but i just i just i just thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd look at that and just be like not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] cinderella with like red hair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean she was annoying yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> she was probably my least favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> character yeah out of all the characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i felt like you know it's it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hard to look past the trope sometimes i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really like the main character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> much actually i didn't really like him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well well i i kind of liked but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> understand yeah he's not i don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his intention was to make him likeable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i actually think who's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> character i probably the character i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liked the most actually was the spur i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love the spelling the green the snake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the green hair guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah he's sick like you said i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the languages that they actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spoke languages i know right that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cool yeah that was really refreshing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah for once where you're like are they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> speaking a foreign language because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they're always just speaking japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> finally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i remember when they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> speaking i'm just like when are they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna switch to japanese it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> world building man they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make sure like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you know it pays off when he he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> learns how to speak these languages yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh my god oh my god this is what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like to learn a language oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a reasonable boundaries like the real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world it's like the real world holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who would have [ __ ] thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i have so much of an appreciation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appreciation for that knowing what he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> went through to learn that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is one of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> shows where i'm actually glad it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> light novel before it's an anime or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anything because i think that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really going to benefit from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being in uh like a long form written </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so you can hash out the details so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can really get like the world set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know sometimes when shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come this big right they kind of get to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the point with like oh we gotta we gotta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get the seasons out come on people yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the hot [ __ ] come on we gotta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finish it yeah so i'm hoping that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't happen i hope the anime because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not gonna read the light novels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because the anime is so good and why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would i yeah i mean like the anime is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good the production values were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insane yeah um like some of some of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> too the jump from season one to two was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely noticeable i know it's there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it got better like it looked a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> crisper yeah i mean it's just it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> an all-around amazing production watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> watch the show watch my show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll definitely have to watch season two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've been talking about it for [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> uh enthusiasm yeah yeah so yeah i took a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> month off it was pretty chill really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird waking up and not thinking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube videos yeah kind of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking about like oh my stream later i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> play some games go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gym yeah live live life yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have a [ __ ] life for once </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i noticed that you haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean you two haven't really thought so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much about your upload schedule which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you did before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i just want to take a month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> off and get some stuff in on in order </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got a bunch of videos that are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really big that i need to finish yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i know that if i'm trying to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them weekly it'll be a mess so i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to get them i've got like three big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos in the works at the moment okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i'm trying to get them all done and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then hopefully gen uh february will be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> nice roll in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> probably gonna do a bunch more back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you do you feel like after you do the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big projects that you're just gonna go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back to your normal upload schedule or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you gonna focus more on streaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> now maybe i'll miss a week here and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there and not feel too guilty about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll probably try and do three a month i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that'll be my soft target three a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> month yeah i'll probably try and do once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a week but um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just above my upload schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually well i feel like if i miss a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> week it's not a big deal i'm like now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right on my phone i checked i checked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other day because i was like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't uploaded in like two and a half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> weeks i wonder if anyone's saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything no no no one's commenting no of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> course so clearly nobody misses me so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll be all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's exactly what i realized when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realized oh i don't have to do an anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of year video on the new year yeah and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could just wait a few weeks and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were just like great i'll still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch your content who would have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thought that the only ones who care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about our timetable is us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and no one else i mean i feel like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do weekly it does post you a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> more you do yeah of course but you also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel it also limits yourself to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what you should actually be doing right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah which is why like this year for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm definitely going to like slow it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down and just like really focus on like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making each video as big as possible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and for everything else like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know i got trash taste and like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> second channel and stuff like that so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah whatever so what is the main </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> challenge anymore when trash tastes this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the main channel this is let's be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> real this is where the big ideas are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going this is where it's all going we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing more specials this year we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna [ __ ] stream every week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're out of here first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i hope this doesn't become poorly age </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things yeah i really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm saying it publicly so there'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> breaks yeah of course yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah i think i think for all of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like our for this year like definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trash taste is like slowly becoming more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of the priority i think when it comes to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like making cool [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because we enjoy it because we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoy it and uh who knew that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> having a job with your best mates uh is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fun pretty sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> god forbid have a carry every week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> speaking of watching anime i know a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bunch of people who have also been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching anime very publicly uh probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> very old news by the time this episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets really dumb as [ __ ] of 2022 so far </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but somebody twice has just begun we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> already taking an l but yeah basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the time of recording uh pokemane has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been banned for watching avatar the last </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> airbender and also disguise toast has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also been banned for watching death note </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i believe um on their twitch streams </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah uh to their tens of thousands of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> viewers and i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the time this gets released maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more people will be banned maybe not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know but it's definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sparked a discussion about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> copyright and dmca and i think people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> online are calling it the tv matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which uh i couldn't [ __ ] believe was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a real thing polygon wrote this article </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like oh this guy starts he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just testing out the tv matter and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think my favorite comment i saw on a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quote retweet was like calling it the tv </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meta is like shooting yourself in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> head and calling it the gun better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the dumbest argument it's crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like watching stuff like the uh totally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not mark right with like toei yeah just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like nuking his channel yeah for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about one piece yeah for not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even breaking dmca you know and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the twitch stream we should go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and watch the entirety of hunter hunter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i remember like when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first heard about this i thought it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought it was actually just like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> joke yeah i thought i thought it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a parody article i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where's the onion article and then i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then i log on to and then i log on to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then i see you one of like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest streamers on the pla i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna [ __ ] i saw xqc yeah streaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hunter hunter like innocence like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hundred thousand people and i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i was watching because i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that is there a meme like where's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meme come and then i slowly realized oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they weren't joking people are actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing this and then um conor informed me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that ludwig had already made a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it and i think what bothered me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was that people were like calling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like calling him out for calling other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people out for being like yeah why are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you why are you knocking on people or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine you're like broadcasting a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> football match in a football stadium </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you don't own because that's what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the equivalent of it is right they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> broadcasting this to like 90 000 people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one guy's like uh is that is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> allowed and like and people are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like shh don't tell people and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like are you [ __ ] kidding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me there's 90 000 people watching this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how can you snitch on someone when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's 90 000 people watching this one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so dumb and the fact that people trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to argue it's fair use or anything it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just so stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah the theory is ridiculous i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand right because a lot of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> viewers who are watching this probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoyed it they probably loved watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sqc watch hunter hunter yeah of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm sure everyone would love to watch us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch jojo unfortunately we can't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah because one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we're not [ __ ] dumb we don't just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watch [ __ ] we literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally be breaking the law i i did a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> watch along of jojo on my stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh but i didn't show the visuals i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't show audio i should have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> timestamp yeah you can go to your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> netflix and we can watch along yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not as good of course it sucks because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't see it yeah but it gets the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> law to do that yeah and also we live in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan we probably actually throw it in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jail if we did that yeah oh yeah no you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um you know it's just like what what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> annoyed me the most about it was again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to be like it was very like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tribal in a sense they were like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't say my stream is bad for doing it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were just watching you know it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't do any harm so what if they get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> banned it's like yeah but yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that streamer already makes like five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> million dollars a year of course they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't give a [ __ ] if they get banned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but like what about the guy you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know there's other smaller streamers who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe enjoy the the freedoms of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> current copyright system where they can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of you know tell the line a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> safer you know not not watching stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but maybe i can show you a clip yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember you couldn't watch youtube on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch before yeah you know you can now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and even then that's controversial </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just feel like it's selfish of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the bigger creators who already are well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> established don't have to worry about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> income or anything and they can get away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right they'll come back you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll get banned they'll come back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't give a [ __ ] that you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know if anything them getting banned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just more publicity to them yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's why right it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you can get banned and you're a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> headline and people are like oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're banned that's so crazy we'll come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back and like you'll get even more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> viewers and you come back it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just i don't know it just seems selfish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to me it is and the the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's trying to call it a meta and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> play a joke with it and stuff is really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> frustrating when you know you know we we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> work in japan right we talk a lot with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the you know with the anime companies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and try and work with them and try to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> convince them that youtubers and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> aren't psychopaths </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i think that's what like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bothered me the most yeah which is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as someone who does make content that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really does require fair use and a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> strong argument for fair use even i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think like sometimes i'm still like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> touting the line sometimes with how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> companies view my content right because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's such a new concept that it's going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to take time to like convince big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> companies that hey please don't strike </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my stuff because it is under fair use </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you have when you have like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this and then on the other end of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the spectrum you have people just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> broadcasting licensed tv shows movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime whatever it's just what is what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to happen is that it's just going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to make it harder for the [ __ ] 60 70 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> year old guy looking at new content to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like well i guess everyone's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> broadcasting my [ __ ] right well i guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i should strike down everyone what is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is the thing that's going to happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it's going to make it hard for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> big corporations to tell the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between what is fair use and what isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because when there's people who are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> abusing the system because this is an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> abuse of the system then it's just gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be harder for the guy who was actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to stay within the system to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> prove that he is actually staying within </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the system yeah i feel there's just so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many like youtubers on twitch streams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just content creators who are like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know doing our best to like at least try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like yeah as you were saying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show the japanese corporations being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like hey you know fair use is a thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're not using your stuff all the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for malicious intent we do it because we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> genuinely love it we want people to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it yeah and but we will follow the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rules that are laid out as much as we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can but at the same time you know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scratch your back you scratch mine you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know like kind of like forgive me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you know but now with this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> whole [ __ ] tv meta [ __ ] if i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all that effort it's just gone back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> zero yeah especially on twitter if if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not speculating of course but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously like it you know it could it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could really change sometimes right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean like i mean the music industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> did it with twitch eventually they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh [ __ ] uh yeah you shouldn't be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> streaming music it's not good and people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> are like whatever i'm testing out the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> music matter you know yeah because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing though the thing the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing that bothered me is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you can't really feign </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ignorance because there is a precedence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtubers have felt it for [ __ ] years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with their copyright system even twitch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> streamers and i know a lot of twitch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> streamers i complained a lot when they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had their dmca </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> controversy with the music thing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happened right where basically every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> piece of music just got claimed and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't even play some games because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the music was called it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> bound to happen anyway yeah which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about youtube have been dealing with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that for years yeah like it's you know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know it's very entitled you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's what it is it is entitlement </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the the streamers that were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing this yeah just like don't give a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why would they they don't mind yeah they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get the headlines they get the views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they already got paid they already have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these contracts with these companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and they know they'll come back yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay because they get special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> treatment yeah and then you have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people on the other side of the fence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people like totally not mark who like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't know the story behind what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happened with tony not mark i i believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like toei strikes hundreds of his videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over 150. over like 150 videos at once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh some of them not even even like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having any copyrighted material on there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right some of them were just like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> believe his face or like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> some of them some of those were drawings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of dragon ball characters that he yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and so his channel basically got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely like so many of these videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got completely wiped away and he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fighting tooth and nail yeah to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like try to get in contact with toei to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like please toei bring my videos out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of copyright jail please this is fair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> use and i believe that even now it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been sorted no i believe now is he he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just like gave up yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> believe he just is so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> heartbreaking because i think like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> third of his channel just disappeared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly and that's like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> could you imagine that it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> years of work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gone yeah and that to me it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well it's like there's this guy fighting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> tooth and nail to try and prove that his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos are [ __ ] fair use and his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos do deserve to be and they are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> used yeah two to two to like a company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't know the difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fair use not and then on the other side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the spectrum you have other people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are abusing the system to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well you know whatever the ban the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> banham is coming down i think i can i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can take like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two-day vacation a month vacation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever um and the people who feel the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> repercussions are the people who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are like on the load end of the tier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> list with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me rephrase that no end of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> spectrum lower end of the spectrum of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch streamers yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the smaller content creators that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the [ __ ] word i was looking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for the smaller concerts are greatest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know a lot of these the bigger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> content creators you know i know or you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know i i think highly often it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sad seeing them do this and like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of them just not caring and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like this is just sad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know i i also just think you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> should to be a good example yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why not just like make stuff i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know like because what's gonna happen is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the big streamers do it then everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes oh if the big streamer is doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can do it too yeah but of course they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't realize those big streamers if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they get in trouble all they'll get is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slap on the wrist if the smaller creator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> does it they're probably [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> permabanned yeah because i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to preface this i don't this isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like us trying to start drama with any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the content creators that did this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of the content creators i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually respect as content creators you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah um it was like kind of said i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just a bit disappointed that they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah they didn't set a better example uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because they i like i know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know we're all content creators we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we know what's going on here you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we know what the repercussions are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to be or that what they could be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i couldn't understand why they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> poking the hornet's nest i guess some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> them were doing it you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> intentionally trying to get banned as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well right some of them admitted that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they wanted to be banned right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's good for headlines as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah you know if you're if you're a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> bigger name and you have more websites </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know because there are websites that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are just dedicated to you know literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just talking about twitch streamers yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then like post these articles they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get them recommended to me all the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on google oh yeah yeah of course you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> won't believe what ludwig said and it'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> be like ludwig's i i like jump king so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i hate these articles they're so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a little thing called independent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> journalism but it's like how have you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you know at least take a clickbait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and not even made it somewhat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> even more boring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah no because like i i think what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other thing that made me like lose brain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cells when i was like scrolling on my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitter to see what the reaction was was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the amount of people who were calling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out people who were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically saying hey you maybe you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shouldn't you know stream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh or broadcast anime movies to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your audience or whatever and anyone who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically called out to being like for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like a corporate bootlicker or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that you know or just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like why are you defending the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> corporations and it's just like this it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned the argument into something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely different because we all know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dmca is like a decade old [ __ ] law </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is outdated for how the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> works right yeah um we're like we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> content creators we we know that there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are so many things that are broken about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the dmca system we know that but that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a separate issue to what is going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here you know a system can be broken and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> people can also abuse the system at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't have to be mutually uh they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't have to be the same thing they can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be mutually exclusive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and just just seeing people try to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> defend this just like kind of kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just made me [ __ ] lose it was wheels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was really weird seeing how open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone was like yeah no of course it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay and i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because you like it doesn't mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's okay and just because you can't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bothered to go into google and look it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> up yourself it's like like obviously it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would be sick to watch anime with 90 000 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people live oh it would be safe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i would love to do that yeah we can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not allowed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until until again these like ip holders </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> understand that it's okay and we're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying this shouldn't be the case you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what i would say that if a company </SPEAKER_01>
