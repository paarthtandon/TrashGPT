<connor> I guess we sure used to the normal </connor>
<connor> dynamics in anime yeah rather like a hot </connor>
<garnt> girl turns up and he wants to have sex </garnt>
<connor> with her but then he actually just start </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] [ __ ] you know I'm like who </garnt>
<garnt> is this charge like I've never seen such </garnt>
<garnt> a big child in anime that's what the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> welcome to trash taste I'm your host </connor>
<connor> Connor and I'm tired as [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> we just we all just hit a very strong </connor>
<garnt> coffee but I'm again with Joey ah and </garnt>
<garnt> gone </garnt>
<garnt> no no nicknames today oh I just didn't </garnt>
<garnt> think to do that or I'm keeping it </garnt>
<joey> simple I mean that's who we are right </joey>
<connor> I'm very tired every every day before we </connor>
<joey> do an episode I wake up at 7 a.m. to go </joey>
<joey> to a Japanese class for two hours I was </joey>
<joey> like going for you it's going it's going </joey>
<joey> forward sometimes you're too tired to </joey>
<joey> learn things and I remember being like </joey>
<joey> this in university I would be like </joey>
<connor> asleep basis yeah but then they make you </connor>
<connor> talk so I kind of yeah like how's it </connor>
<garnt> going for you cuz like me and Connor </garnt>
<garnt> have gone very different routes in terms </garnt>
<garnt> of our how we've approached learning </garnt>
<connor> Japanese because you've taken classes </connor>
<connor> and I'm like completely like self-taught </connor>
<connor> because I realized in university how </connor>
<connor> classes really like slowed me down in </connor>
<connor> terms of my learning process yeah just </connor>
<garnt> the biggest problem I've encountered is </garnt>
<garnt> self-discipline that's exactly what I </garnt>
<connor> wanted laughs because cuz the way I see </connor>
<connor> it right lessons are like okay if I'm </connor>
<joey> keeping up with these lessons these are </joey>
<joey> like the bare minimum that someone at </joey>
<garnt> any mental capacity can learn Japanese </garnt>
<joey> right so if I'm learning it at this </joey>
<garnt> structured course that anyone can do </garnt>
<connor> right I should learn X amount of </connor>
<connor> Japanese yeah because we know that like </connor>
<connor> everyone who's like homeschooled doesn't </connor>
<connor> actually like do anything and also I'm </connor>
<joey> like a liar dude I lie to myself a lot </joey>
<joey> like when I say I'm gonna learn Japanese </joey>
<connor> I will do everything in my power to like </connor>
<joey> think that I'm learning Japanese like </joey>
<joey> like like during the quarantine because </joey>
<garnt> at this point in the episode it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's pretty much done it's pretty much </garnt>
<connor> open but like during the quarantine </connor>
<connor> because you know Connor you can go to </connor>
<connor> Japanese lessons really you had to do </connor>
<connor> like zoom lessons I hated you and you </connor>
<connor> and you were telling you that like most </connor>
<joey> of the time you were just playing arc </joey>
<connor> night </connor>
<connor> like yes I am listening teachers like oh </connor>
<connor> yeah problem was right is that I was in </connor>
<garnt> a my class is mainly like housewives and </garnt>
<connor> like people who are much older than me </connor>
<connor> yeah right so a lot of them wouldn't </connor>
<garnt> weren't tech savvy so they were all </garnt>
<garnt> spending ten minutes saying hello hello </garnt>
<connor> can you hear me hello meanwhile I'm like </connor>
<connor> already set up I've got my whole YouTube </connor>
<connor> is set up right okay yeah two monitors </connor>
<joey> three mobile phones you know what I mean </joey>
<joey> like you got the green screen yeah the </joey>
<garnt> pro streamer said like you know it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like when when I'm at my PC mmm </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm doing everything but what I'm </garnt>
<garnt> supposed to be doing right so I got two </garnt>
<garnt> monitors right so I can also put my </garnt>
<garnt> webcam over the [ __ ] out one so and </garnt>
<garnt> they're like are you looking and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like a family yeah doing work on the </garnt>
<garnt> other monitor yeah yeah like and I know </garnt>
<garnt> you're like well Connor you're paying </garnt>
<connor> for those lessons why would you not do </connor>
<connor> it I don't know I paid to be in class </connor>
<connor> you know yeah that's like that's like </connor>
<garnt> University in a nutshell yeah I mean </garnt>
<connor> you're you're paying to be here you're </connor>
<connor> paying to learn right oh why do I have </connor>
<joey> to get a class yeah I can just study </joey>
<connor> from home I hate going to the class and </connor>
<connor> having to do that and be back in that </connor>
<connor> environment cuz you know yeah how do </connor>
<connor> they get out of that but at the same </connor>
<connor> time I am learning stuff like it is slow </connor>
<joey> and I do a lot of study a minor in time </joey>
<joey> mainly khan sheikh sayed own teachers </joey>
<joey> kanji yeah it's it's practical japanese </joey>
<connor> so it's all supposed to be for like </connor>
<connor> speaking because it's my to reiterate I </connor>
<joey> when I say classes I think most people </joey>
<connor> will assume like everyday ah I do </connor>
<joey> classes two times a week for two hours </joey>
<joey> that's it yeah so not a lot of time to </joey>
<joey> learn a language </joey>
<joey> really right right so it's better than </joey>
<connor> nothing I guess it's much better than </connor>
<garnt> doing nothing right exactly </garnt>
<garnt> cuz for me like I've tried to focus less </garnt>
<connor> on the reading and just pure </connor>
<connor> conversational for me yeah and actually </connor>
<connor> one thing that's really helped with that </connor>
<connor> is not watching anime actually but yeah </connor>
<connor> but watching virtual youtubers so I've </connor>
<joey> like I've like really gotten into </joey>
<joey> watching virtual youtubers last few </joey>
<connor> months yeah who are you into um hasta </connor>
<garnt> Coco is probably my favorite on earth at </garnt>
<garnt> the time of right now she just had a 3d </garnt>
<garnt> debut I'm sounding like a total [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> determiner is that the one you like </joey>
<garnt> seemed over </garnt>
<connor> yeah we show that all over Twitter was </connor>
<garnt> gone I was very drunk at the time and I </garnt>
<garnt> thought she was like she was having like </garnt>
<garnt> her first 3d debut and I'm like I'll </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] throw it throw like 30 </garnt>
<garnt> bucks whatever and then like as soon as </garnt>
<garnt> I did like my Twitter notifications </garnt>
<connor> imagine getting called simple whatever </connor>
<garnt> virtual you know because like it's </garnt>
<garnt> actually really helped my Japanese way </garnt>
<garnt> more than watching anime because with </garnt>
<garnt> watching anime like I don't know what </garnt>
<garnt> the anime watching experience has been </garnt>
<garnt> for you Connor since you start learning </garnt>
<garnt> but for me I found it a lot more </garnt>
<garnt> difficult to watch anime now that I'm </garnt>
<connor> learning Japanese because you know you </connor>
<connor> know when you like read the subtitles </connor>
<connor> yeah and then you kind of understand </connor>
<connor> what's going on so you want to like try </connor>
<connor> to listen in to what's what's being said </connor>
<connor> but but because you do that you kind of </connor>
<connor> just miss what's what's on the subtitles </connor>
<garnt> that's like been my anime watching </garnt>
<garnt> experience recently and well I imagine </garnt>
<connor> Joey sit on his throne here being like </connor>
<joey> yes tell me more about your struggle </joey>
<joey> what are these subtitles and speak oh hi </joey>
<joey> okay one thing that I noticed that bugs </joey>
<joey> me is that now that I know like I'd say </joey>
<joey> like a very basic amount right very </joey>
<joey> minute yeah like not not enough to watch </joey>
<garnt> an episode and be like yep I understand </garnt>
<garnt> all that but I have to like get some </garnt>
<garnt> sentences right is that when I read the </garnt>
<garnt> subtitles and all supercruise in </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese sometimes the subject at the </garnt>
<garnt> end of the sentence in English right yes </garnt>
<connor> I only the start Japanese so sometimes </connor>
<garnt> you'll see a subtitle that comes with </garnt>
<connor> the other half of the sentence so you're </connor>
<garnt> hearing the it's gonna come out yes like </garnt>
<connor> Johnson Joestar </connor>
<connor> your next line is gonna be yaki and it </connor>
<connor> kind of messes with you and then also </connor>
<connor> like just watching any hentai it's </connor>
<connor> really pretty frustrating because I'm </connor>
<connor> more like I've realized like two minutes </connor>
<connor> in I'm starting to be like okay like I </connor>
<connor> guess though it makes sense to like </connor>
<garnt> watch v tubers though to like learn </garnt>
<connor> Japanese because like you know this is </connor>
<garnt> these are real people like speaking </garnt>
<garnt> right they just look like anime but like </garnt>
<garnt> their mannerisms and their phrasing even </garnt>
<garnt> though you know they might be playing </garnt>
<joey> like a character right yeah it's still </joey>
<garnt> like a real pub cause it feels like </garnt>
<joey> they're having an actual conversation </joey>
<joey> because you know like watching watching </joey>
<connor> an anime and hear conversation you know </connor>
<connor> you're like know what I've never seen a </connor>
<connor> real converse is in a real conversation </connor>
<connor> that's happening right now and I'm like </connor>
<connor> zoning most of it out whereas when I'm </connor>
<connor> watching a youtuber it feels like a </connor>
<joey> genuine like a Japanese conversation </joey>
<joey> like you're actually hearing a story the </joey>
<connor> way like any any person you talk to </connor>
<joey> Japan yeah look like yeah so it's been </joey>
<connor> like way more useful for me in learning </connor>
<garnt> Japanese than it has been watching anime </garnt>
<joey> also because I guess like with features </joey>
<connor> again they're like real people right so </connor>
<connor> like the the speed that they talk at is </connor>
<connor> well is very real yes like not like </connor>
<connor> overly accentuated so it actually makes </connor>
<joey> more sense to like get used to that kind </joey>
<joey> of speech yes speed then like no cuz you </joey>
<joey> know like it's it's like the anime voice </joey>
<joey> I think voice yeah I mean which is which </joey>
<joey> is not how real people talk like and is </joey>
<joey> this is true in like I'd say dub as well </joey>
<joey> you know you hear like a double act ER </joey>
<joey> or like a dub performance and you're </joey>
<connor> like this this isn't how real people </connor>
<connor> talk this is how kids it's very anime </connor>
<connor> you know so yeah so it's like it's it's </connor>
<connor> more like watching a live stream oh so </connor>
<connor> it's been like I'm not gonna say that's </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna I'm not gonna say that's the </connor>
<connor> only reason I've been into you v tubers </connor>
<connor> but it's actually if you're trying to </connor>
<connor> learn Japanese I'd say V tubing is much </connor>
<connor> more useful the learning is educational </connor>
<connor> I swear </connor>
<joey> because watching anime now for me has </joey>
<joey> become a lot harder and you get the joy </joey>
<joey> of finding that 1v2 but you can see </joey>
<connor> that's a little bit annoying to watch </connor>
<connor> anime sometimes but then also now </connor>
<garnt> sometimes I can look away just for a </garnt>
<garnt> second and I can still understand what </garnt>
<garnt> they said roughly because I'll know like </garnt>
<joey> three of the the five words that they </joey>
<joey> say and yeah I had a piece together what </joey>
<joey> was being so yeah that's such a like a </joey>
<joey> gratifying moment it really is and as </joey>
<connor> well like one thing that I found really </connor>
<connor> helpful then I thought I would dread is </connor>
<connor> like learning kanji I think learning </connor>
<connor> kanji is so interesting I know you love </connor>
<connor> your conscience yeah yeah but learning </connor>
<connor> has been so fun because when it slowly </connor>
<joey> starts to make sense it feels like an </joey>
<garnt> RPG where you're unlocking the world </garnt>
<joey> where you live right yeah I can slowly </joey>
<garnt> start to read stuff and then there's </garnt>
<connor> like multiple different like ways to </connor>
<connor> read a kanji and then when you like know </connor>
<connor> both it's like yeah I like that you like </connor>
<connor> that one is Sakai protag right right </connor>
<connor> comes in is like what does this say like </connor>
<connor> twelve episodes in it's like yeah I get </connor>
<connor> it yeah it's been really helpful for </connor>
<connor> like just learning like speaking it in </connor>
<connor> general because a lot of the words have </connor>
<connor> the same pronunciation and then </connor>
<connor> obviously kanji is there like way to </connor>
<joey> differentiate kanji like holds the </joey>
<connor> meaning right yeah yeah and sometimes </connor>
<connor> reading a whole sentence and hero </connor>
<joey> Donner's it's like it is a nightmare </joey>
<joey> it's it's weirdly enough like if for </joey>
<connor> people who'd like to have no idea about </connor>
<connor> Japanese it might be hard to like think </connor>
<connor> about but yeah a full-on like hiragana </connor>
<connor> or katakana sentence is so difficult to </connor>
<connor> read sometimes yeah whereas countries </connor>
<joey> just like oh yeah I know exactly what </joey>
<joey> that means I know exactly how to read it </joey>
<connor> it's the way I see it is that in English </connor>
<garnt> is that how we don't need to read the </garnt>
<garnt> word we know the shape of the wood you </garnt>
<connor> know you can see a word I know the shape </connor>
<connor> of the wood I can read it right and I </connor>
<connor> think that's how kanji is the Japanese </connor>
<garnt> people where they they don't necessarily </garnt>
<connor> read it but they recognize that a shape </connor>
<connor> and they just know what's being said in </connor>
<garnt> the sentence so you see in that video </garnt>
<garnt> where you can read like an entire </garnt>
<connor> paragraph where you fits if it's the </connor>
<connor> word is the first letter is the same the </connor>
<connor> last letter say and you swap all the </connor>
<connor> letters in the middle you can still read </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah just because of how your </connor>
<joey> fluency works yeah and I feel like it </joey>
<garnt> would be the same with kanji as well I </garnt>
<joey> think so yeah yeah it is the same but </joey>
<joey> instead of the first and last letters </joey>
<joey> it's like does this have one line in it </joey>
<joey> or two like you just have to like it's </joey>
<joey> that but just squinting really hard </joey>
<connor> okay yeah there's some where there's so </connor>
<connor> many lines or I'm like how the factory </connor>
<connor> would just like read it this fast like </connor>
<joey> it's I mean the more difficulty is going </joey>
<joey> to start to write it right yeah because </joey>
<connor> I have like an app and then it like it </connor>
<garnt> like vibrates my phone if you do the </garnt>
<garnt> wrong stroke order because whenever I do </garnt>
<garnt> write a kanji out in my class in like </garnt>
<garnt> the right stroke order the teachers like </garnt>
<garnt> like in the TV show what [ __ ] because </garnt>
<connor> like you never really think about </connor>
<connor> something like stroke order you know </connor>
<connor> which stroke order is basically well </connor>
<connor> order </connor>
<connor> you've writes it in yeah cause like I </connor>
<connor> write my asses the wrong way in English </connor>
<garnt> and people freaking tell people how you </garnt>
<connor> write your asses I do push there from </connor>
<garnt> top to bottom </garnt>
<garnt> yeah most people don't yeah I do if I do </garnt>
<connor> from the bottom up </connor>
<garnt> yeah like swish down with the cursive I </garnt>
<garnt> know why I'm like like how did you love </garnt>
<connor> that I I I was like I was so bad at </connor>
<garnt> English in school so to clarify right </garnt>
<garnt> like okay I'll just I'll just start the </garnt>
<garnt> story with this we'll start strong right </garnt>
<garnt> I was so bad at English that they like </garnt>
<garnt> put me with the kids who you know were </garnt>
<joey> not good at anything you know like yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah with I was in like the English </garnt>
<joey> class for one year would like kids with </joey>
<connor> learning disabilities Yeah right and I </connor>
<connor> remember being like dude what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> okay I've always been like really good </connor>
<connor> at most subjects in school and okay to </connor>
<connor> clarify the reason why my English was so </connor>
<connor> bad cuz the only reading and writing I </connor>
<connor> ever did was in Welsh my schools watch </connor>
<connor> today or everything I I spoke in school </connor>
<connor> and read was in watch but I also see </connor>
<connor> knew how to spell English I speak </connor>
<garnt> English obviously and then yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> remember I we did like an English </garnt>
<garnt> spelling test </garnt>
<garnt> I got like everything wrong but bear in </garnt>
<garnt> mind I was like eight and I couldn't I </garnt>
<garnt> remember they said like are can you </garnt>
<joey> spell the word said for us I was like </joey>
<joey> yeah sure </joey>
<connor> and I just put like a CD but like yeah </connor>
<connor> like Zed Edie yeah and and then there </connor>
<connor> and then my parents like oh no mind like </connor>
<connor> I never read anything in English the </connor>
<connor> reading at all it should always video </connor>
<connor> games so so yeah and I've got one was at </connor>
<joey> wider this story come up I forgot </joey>
<joey> saying this is weird yeah so I think I </joey>
<connor> learned how to write because in English </connor>
<connor> is well they they in school they teach </connor>
<garnt> you the stroke order I just I can't </garnt>
<joey> remember this I mean I I learnt it when </joey>
<joey> we had to I don't know if this is only </joey>
<joey> in Australia but like yeah I think I was </joey>
<connor> in like fourth grade also I should have </connor>
<connor> those papers which are half-width and </connor>
<joey> forward yeah yeah I learned how to do </joey>
<connor> when we want to write cursive </connor>
<connor> yeah because we've already incur Civ and </connor>
<connor> it kind of became thing where for some </connor>
<connor> reason I just started writing some of </connor>
<connor> them weirdly and no one ever stopped me </connor>
<connor> and so so I just have always done like </connor>
<connor> I'll go into like the a and then I'll go </connor>
<connor> down and do the s up and then slash down </connor>
<joey> how do you write your little item number </joey>
<joey> five do you go from the bottom or do you </joey>
<connor> from the top it depends I guess like </connor>
<joey> whatever </joey>
<joey> what if it depends yeah I don't know </joey>
<joey> like sometimes how does that time I </joey>
<garnt> would do it from the top but I remember </garnt>
<garnt> distinctively I was doing it from the </garnt>
<garnt> bottom for a while and then I stopped </garnt>
<connor> that but I also used to write my falls </connor>
<connor> like the correct way being for wait do </connor>
<garnt> you how do you learn right for such I do </garnt>
<garnt> I do it this way I do it that's the way </garnt>
<connor> I learn but then I remember I was </connor>
<garnt> playing brain training and they wouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> accept that way of writing for this is </garnt>
<garnt> when I was like eleven so then I started </garnt>
<connor> having to write falls in the </connor>
<garnt> Americanized way which is doing that way </garnt>
<garnt> and then like that that's the </garnt>
<garnt> Americanized way well it's uh well I </garnt>
<connor> think so yeah well you do like if looks </connor>
<garnt> like I'd like a kind of like spiky nine </garnt>
<garnt> right I don't think I write any letters </garnt>
<connor> starting from the bottom no no I'm like </connor>
<connor> always how are you do your force fought </connor>
<joey> like this oh yeah I do it the opposite </joey>
<joey> way I think yeah yeah so you do from the </joey>
<joey> bottom yeah from the bottom and then I </joey>
<joey> go what do you do that I don't know some </joey>
<garnt> weird so in school did you have to learn </garnt>
<joey> English literature and language what's </joey>
<joey> they different like this because they </joey>
<joey> were two different subjects for us in </joey>
<joey> school oh no we just said English Irish </joey>
<connor> it could see I had to learn English </connor>
<connor> literature English language Welsh </connor>
<connor> literature and wash language I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hated doing that man okay cuz I think </connor>
<joey> for us like maybe this is my school </joey>
<connor> maleic it depended on the day of the </connor>
<connor> week so like unlike it was like on </connor>
<connor> Mondays we go through like a literature </connor>
<connor> for like the turn that we have to study </connor>
<connor> and then on like Wednesdays we like got </connor>
<connor> to like do something else like watch </connor>
<connor> them </connor>
<connor> like study a different text for like a </connor>
<connor> certain thing or like how to read an </connor>
<connor> essay and write an essay on Fridays and </connor>
<connor> she like that's a yeah we didn't I think </connor>
<connor> it's because though just my school is </connor>
<garnt> just very small as well so I probably </garnt>
<connor> wasn't enough English teachers in our </connor>
<garnt> schools your the literature one and your </garnt>
<connor> the comprehension one you know yeah how </connor>
<garnt> does it feel like learning a new </garnt>
<garnt> language as your order now though </garnt>
<garnt> compared to when you're a kid because </garnt>
<connor> like I remember we had to learn a lot of </connor>
<connor> other languages when we're when we were </connor>
<connor> in school and then vanish French didn't </connor>
<connor> take any of that Shin arm but it's been </connor>
<connor> like a very different challenge learning </connor>
<connor> Japanese as like a grown adult I would </connor>
<connor> say because I don't know has the fact </connor>
<garnt> that you were very much into Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> culture and watching anime helped you at </garnt>
<connor> all from your perspective definitely I </connor>
<garnt> think it's made it easier but like easy </garnt>
<garnt> with an asterisk right yes like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> easier to understand some concepts </garnt>
<connor> culturally that might explain some of </connor>
<connor> the language right which is great but at </connor>
<connor> the end of the day it doesn't help me </connor>
<connor> like in a crazy amount yeah I think it </connor>
<connor> just helps me understand why certain </connor>
<connor> things are the way they are in a </connor>
<connor> language yeah you know why is it like </connor>
<connor> you know while you can't be direct to </connor>
<garnt> someone why why toy sue my senel yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's never you know and then I guess </connor>
<connor> because sometimes in your learning a </connor>
<garnt> language you're like why can't I just be </garnt>
<connor> like direct yeah that's not a thing you </connor>
<garnt> can't do that that's it that's true yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I think learning Japanese for me I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't realize how much I kind of just </garnt>
<garnt> zoned out Japanese when I watched anime </garnt>
<connor> before yeah you do you filter it out </connor>
<garnt> because you're like that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> nonsense to me I'm yeah yeah you you </garnt>
<garnt> just like absorbing the subtitles and </garnt>
<garnt> kind of just mute out the Japanese and I </garnt>
<connor> didn't realize that until I started </connor>
<connor> learning when I when I actually picked </connor>
<connor> out individual like how the sentence </connor>
<connor> works and how how the language actually </connor>
<connor> works that I realize oh oh this didn't </connor>
<connor> help me a lot at all but I find it </connor>
<connor> really hard in my head to recommend </connor>
<connor> learning language to people because I'm </connor>
<connor> I feel like if you're not gonna like </connor>
<connor> actually do it mm-hmm it's kind of a </connor>
<connor> waste of time I know it takes commit </connor>
<joey> yeah that's what I said to people though </joey>
<connor> about Japanese and it's one of those </connor>
<connor> things where like learning Japanese </connor>
<connor> especially if you're not if you're not </connor>
<connor> going to do it full-time </connor>
<connor> it's like at least a five year thing </connor>
<connor> that you have to commit to and if you </connor>
<connor> quick two and a half years in you know </connor>
<joey> but that's the private rights that like </joey>
<garnt> so many people I get cracking emails </garnt>
<connor> about it all - god damn being what's the </connor>
<garnt> easiest way to learn Japanese there is </garnt>
<garnt> no easy way to learn Japanese no you </garnt>
<connor> just have to sit down and just be like </connor>
<joey> am I about to commit five to ten years </joey>
<connor> of my life to learn this [ __ ] yes it's </connor>
<connor> like any like skill chart right where </connor>
<connor> it's like the first like real getting </connor>
<garnt> over the first real difficult like that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yes the hardest and once you get </garnt>
<connor> past that you've gone through a </connor>
<connor> challenge </connor>
<connor> yeah overcome it normally you can keep </connor>
<connor> going let's say with any craft right </connor>
<garnt> like voice acting as well like </garnt>
<garnt> photography anything right YouTube thank </garnt>
<garnt> you yeah there's always like gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> that that first point where you think </garnt>
<garnt> you're starting to understand it then </garnt>
<garnt> you get to that point we all like [ __ ] I </garnt>
<connor> know nothing about yeah and it's that </connor>
<garnt> point where if you keep going and </garnt>
<garnt> actually like starting you know really </garnt>
<connor> put in the work you'll probably see some </connor>
<connor> results but a lot people quit at that </connor>
<garnt> point cuz like I'm always really </garnt>
<garnt> paranoid and this is true in my life and </garnt>
<connor> whenever I'm like doing a playthrough of </connor>
<connor> the game right when I'm doing something </connor>
<connor> and it's just sub optimized yes like </connor>
<connor> sometimes I like paralyzed myself </connor>
<connor> because I'm just like what if I'm not </connor>
<connor> doing this most optimal ways this waste </connor>
<connor> of time I'm so scared of wasting my time </connor>
<connor> so when I first I'd learning Japanese I </connor>
<garnt> spent more time trying to figure out the </garnt>
<connor> best way to learn Japanese yeah yeah I </connor>
<connor> guess you're the opposite sorry in that </connor>
<connor> sense like I do video games I'm </connor>
<joey> definitely like that </joey>
<connor> I'll maximize the [ __ ] out of video </connor>
<joey> games but everything else in my life I'm </joey>
<joey> like that's kind of the opposite with </joey>
<connor> video games I'm just like yeah you are </connor>
<joey> games just made to be like fun and </joey>
<connor> timely yeah cuz cuz I'll talk to Jerry </connor>
<connor> about videos are both playing and I'll </connor>
<connor> be like you know this is like 2% more </connor>
<joey> efficient to dislike this method right </joey>
<joey> and Jerry's like oh I don't give a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and I've already put CCI learning a </joey>
<joey> language there I'm like as long as I'm </joey>
<garnt> learning something in the language that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I can view is somewhat useful I'm </garnt>
<garnt> sure it's it's not a waste yeah I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> there's Philip there's no route to </garnt>
<garnt> learning a language any bit you learn of </garnt>
<joey> it is like it's putting the jigsaw </joey>
<joey> together like like everyone has a </joey>
<garnt> different path everyone learns </garnt>
<joey> differently and you're not gonna </joey>
<joey> discover the best way you learn unless </joey>
<joey> you actually just go out and fail at </joey>
<joey> like I don't know if I don't [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> know I would waste like a month on </garnt>
<garnt> duolingo there's a lot of time on Julie </garnt>
<garnt> don't use foot like other languages </garnt>
<garnt> European languages I'm pretty sure it's </garnt>
<garnt> pretty good but I took Japanese it was </garnt>
<garnt> not very useful yeah yeah it was very </garnt>
<garnt> can get you right from the get-go light </garnt>
<joey> and not explaining why you need to learn </joey>
<joey> it or why what this has sounds efficient </joey>
<connor> teaching me the kanji for window like </connor>
<connor> like that's one of the first things yeah </connor>
<connor> it was hard and like seat kanji for seat </connor>
<connor> and I thought like why you teach you </connor>
<connor> this [ __ ] like I don't even know the </connor>
<connor> kanji for Monday like like why would you </connor>
<connor> teach me winter I don't need to know </connor>
<joey> this like if I do everything Windows in </joey>
<joey> like the the top 100 most used kanji so </joey>
<joey> why you teach yeah yeah it's pretty </joey>
<joey> uncommon to say like what like I feel </joey>
<joey> that the way it when dueling or went </joey>
<joey> about it I'm at we're never gonna get a </joey>
<joey> Dueling respond to [ __ ] by the way yeah </joey>
<joey> it was yeah not good I mean if we do you </joey>
<joey> can call us our Julie is a wait it like </joey>
<connor> tricks you into thinking you're learning </connor>
<garnt> no no you you know a lot of like this </garnt>
<connor> useless parotid like pieces of </connor>
<garnt> information that you can never piece </garnt>
<garnt> together as a whole to use anywhere </garnt>
<connor> basically yeah and it's a shame cause I </connor>
<connor> feel you don't really realize that </connor>
<connor> you're being marked off by dueling or </connor>
<connor> until like you actually start learning </connor>
<connor> it properly and you like I literally </connor>
<connor> have no use for anything I learn on </connor>
<connor> dueling because it was such it was such </connor>
<connor> a mess </connor>
<connor> I remember distinctively right like I </connor>
<garnt> didn't even know how to say any </garnt>
<garnt> sentences but they were teaching me how </garnt>
<connor> to read the kanji of Kyoto and Tokyo </connor>
<connor> yeah that's cool but like I don't need </connor>
<joey> to know this I genuinely done if you go </joey>
<joey> to Tokyo and Kyoto it's written in fun </joey>
<connor> it's like this is something that I don't </connor>
<connor> need to know what I would like to know </connor>
<connor> is how do I say like oh I recommend this </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah I think it's I think you know </connor>
<connor> like I didn't know how to say I think or </connor>
<connor> anything like that right it's like I </connor>
<joey> don't need to know if this is a pen okay </joey>
<connor> I know this is I know what an apple you </connor>
<connor> know there's some good stuff down also </connor>
<connor> it's all bad but I just felt like the </connor>
<garnt> structure was all over the place yeah </garnt>
<garnt> cuz I remember when we first moved </garnt>
<garnt> before we move to Japan we were on me </garnt>
<connor> and Connor were on duolingo for like a </connor>
<connor> good month month and a half yeah before </connor>
<connor> moving to Japan and then we got there </connor>
<connor> more like oh oh we don't know [ __ ] so we </connor>
<connor> need we need to start off by learning </connor>
<connor> hiragana and cats </connor>
<connor> yeah and I remember we just like I sat </connor>
<connor> down and I googled like what the best </connor>
<connor> memorization techniques were and then </connor>
<connor> ice I found this memorization techniques </connor>
<connor> like I can't remember what it's called I </connor>
<connor> think well link it will link it in the </connor>
<connor> description exordium onyx icon um these </connor>
<connor> i pronouncing shin over and then i </connor>
<connor> learned all of hiragana and katakana in </connor>
<connor> like one day yeah and then I told Connor </connor>
<connor> yo this this this [ __ ] was I don't know </connor>
<connor> about this and then I linked him to say </connor>
<connor> Moscow and he comes back to me like </connor>
<garnt> three four hours later I'm like brah I </garnt>
<connor> can read it was crazy it was like I said </connor>
<joey> earlier like when you go outside and </joey>
<joey> like you've unlocked the world yeah </joey>
<joey> you'd stop suddenly reading McDonald's </joey>
<joey> menus with nerve is that the one where </joey>
<joey> it's is the mnemonics thing where it's </joey>
<connor> like you yeah we shape yeah yeah it </connor>
<garnt> would make you a sign like and and to </garnt>
<garnt> fair this is helic memory champions </garnt>
<connor> memorize stuff they design stories and </connor>
<connor> and shapes and objects to the memory and </connor>
<connor> that way they can recall them much </connor>
<connor> easier so it would say like ku which is </connor>
<connor> the one that's like that they're like </connor>
<garnt> it's a chef's hat yeah give a chef's hat </garnt>
<garnt> when you see this symbol </garnt>
<garnt> they're like cooky it was like yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> was like a sign because then then you </garnt>
<connor> remember that's kind of dumb but then </connor>
<garnt> you remember when you see it oh it's </garnt>
<connor> that dumb thing yeah it's really stupid </connor>
<garnt> but it made you remember it is like </garnt>
<garnt> contra counterintuitive right because by </garnt>
<joey> by remembering more stuff you remember </joey>
<joey> one stuff better as a note is just </joey>
<joey> repeating the same thing over and over </joey>
<joey> but the best way I've heard an </joey>
<connor> explanation of for a is that it's kind </connor>
<connor> of like a your memories that kinda like </connor>
<connor> a filing cabinet right yeah so you if </connor>
<connor> you just have one random piece of </connor>
<connor> information that you just randomly file </connor>
<connor> you know they're very hard to just find </connor>
<connor> that random piece of information but you </connor>
<connor> have if if that information is got a </connor>
<connor> bunch of other information that relates </connor>
<connor> that yeah then it's much easier for you </connor>
<connor> to like find it in your memory so that's </connor>
<connor> why you can just makes all things a lot </connor>
<garnt> easier </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's I definitely feel like that </connor>
<connor> like I find that learning symbols for me </connor>
<connor> is like way easier than learning like </connor>
<connor> anything else like that's why like kanji </connor>
<joey> has been pretty fun so yeah definitely </joey>
<joey> like a person who like for my stuff like </joey>
<connor> visually right yeah yeah when I'm like </connor>
<connor> like if you give me like a set of </connor>
<connor> numbers I can normally remember the </connor>
<connor> numbers like decently well like so </connor>
<connor> learning kanji is great cuz like I love </connor>
<connor> just putting like a hundred symbols in a </connor>
<garnt> like a program and just making it test </garnt>
<garnt> me over and over and I'll do that for </garnt>
<connor> like hours until I can remember all 100 </connor>
<joey> right yeah yeah that's what I do and I </joey>
<joey> find that pretty easy I see at the end </joey>
<joey> of the day that's what is probably the </joey>
<joey> most effective right it's just right </joey>
<joey> yeah you literally just need to like </joey>
<joey> force that [ __ ] in your head I just like </joey>
<joey> doing it doing it doing it and at least </joey>
<connor> the good thing about doing that here in </connor>
<connor> Japan is that if you then force yourself </connor>
<connor> to learn all those symbols is it you </connor>
<connor> just walk outside you're like yeah you </connor>
<joey> can like use it like practically all </joey>
<connor> right yeah yeah yeah like there's some </connor>
<joey> where I'm like I'm never gonna [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like I don't need to know this kanji and </joey>
<connor> then like two seconds later I'm on the </connor>
<connor> train and that the place has one of the </connor>
<garnt> colleges and then yeah I get it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which is like question for you Joey </garnt>
<garnt> which is I have voice man curious like </garnt>
<garnt> how much studying have you done because </garnt>
<connor> a lot of people assume that Joey's </connor>
<connor> Japanese is like a second language right </connor>
<garnt> and it's completely wrong Joey has a </garnt>
<connor> second first language like a lot of </connor>
<garnt> people don't know this but Joey's </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese is better than most Japanese </garnt>
<connor> people yeah it's I had no idea how good </connor>
<connor> your Japanese was I just kind of thought </connor>
<joey> that you were like decent huh yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> I'd like but then I came here and then </joey>
<joey> you were teaching kanji to like 40 year </joey>
<joey> old people and they were like what the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] I was a party and late we had like </connor>
<connor> three people from our company Japanese </connor>
<connor> and I was like teaching them about like </connor>
<connor> different kanji structures in the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> that were like I'd never heard this </garnt>
<garnt> before I'm like yeah um I did a lot like </garnt>
<garnt> write a lot a lot like when I say I've </garnt>
<garnt> said it in videos but like when I've </garnt>
<garnt> said like I've studied my entire life </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm not joking I've studied my </garnt>
<garnt> entire life um just to put it in </garnt>
<garnt> perspective when I was like like maybe </garnt>
<garnt> 10 years old I know what I used to do </garnt>
<connor> for fun whoa I used to read the kanji </connor>
<garnt> dictionary I would literally I was that </garnt>
<connor> one kid I like my parents probably </connor>
<connor> thought I was like borderline autistic </connor>
<connor> cuz like I would like to sit in my room </connor>
<connor> as a ten-year-old and I'm like I know </connor>
<connor> nothing better to do and I would just go </connor>
<garnt> to my mom's bookshelf just take out this </garnt>
<garnt> massive like you know 2000 page country </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah and just open up to a random </connor>
<connor> page and just read it yeah well like </connor>
<connor> hours on in and like I don't know maybe </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how much that actually </garnt>
<garnt> helped me in the long run but definitely </garnt>
<garnt> it kind of got me like - like </garnt>
<connor> familiarize myself with different shapes </connor>
<connor> and you know in that sense I'm </connor>
<connor> definitely a lot like Conaway yeah I'm </connor>
<connor> very good at learning things with the </connor>
<connor> only yeah I need visuals I had learning </connor>
<connor> sentences and stuff doesn't do anything </connor>
<joey> yeah no but like another huge thing for </joey>
<joey> me was probably the fact that like my </joey>
<connor> mom had like this like kind of this </connor>
<garnt> unspoken rule where if I spoke to her in </garnt>
<garnt> English I would usually get ignored and </garnt>
<garnt> that is really cruel especially when </garnt>
<garnt> like a four-year-old is really talk to </garnt>
<connor> their mom about something and like but I </connor>
<connor> quickly picked up on it because like I </connor>
<garnt> was like four or five years old and I'd </garnt>
<connor> like to be like hey mom can I do you </connor>
<garnt> know blah blah should just straight-up </garnt>
<connor> ignore me I'm like all right she's in a </connor>
<connor> pissed-off mood but then but then the </connor>
<connor> more times you experience I'm like oh I </connor>
<connor> have to ask her in Japanese and the </connor>
<joey> moment I also in Japanese she's like yes </joey>
<joey> so that's a genius way to make you yeah </joey>
<garnt> my mom my mom was exactly the same okay </garnt>
<joey> I'm like thank I'm like now she's like </joey>
<joey> you can appreciate with this when you're </joey>
<connor> older but if you are you know you're </connor>
<connor> getting this now mom I appreciate that </connor>
<connor> now that's also because like if she </connor>
<connor> didn't do that then I wouldn't have just </connor>
<joey> like I would have forced myself to learn </joey>
<connor> Thai or to use Thai you know setting </connor>
<garnt> which is very hard when you're not </garnt>
<joey> living in the country that you're using </joey>
<joey> exactly you know like everybody around </joey>
<connor> me spoke English right because I was </connor>
<connor> living in Australia and like I had a few </connor>
<connor> like childhood friends who spoke </connor>
<connor> Japanese but because all my childhood </connor>
<connor> friends were also hafiz like me yeah </connor>
<connor> sometimes we just spoke in English to </connor>
<connor> one another so like I need it away I </connor>
<connor> guess my mom was like all right I need </connor>
<connor> to find like a consistent way my son is </connor>
<connor> you keep speaking the language just keep </connor>
<connor> improving and like it really helps as </connor>
<connor> well because my mom was like exceedingly </connor>
<connor> good at Japanese and kanji and stuff </connor>
<connor> like that especially so like whenever I </connor>
<connor> had like a question or like I learned a </connor>
<connor> new word I always went to my mom and I </connor>
<connor> try to force myself to use that new word </connor>
<connor> in a sentence and she would be like she </connor>
<connor> would either say like oh that's not how </connor>
<connor> you use that word this is how you use it </connor>
<connor> dumb little she tell you how to use this </connor>
<connor> place </connor>
<connor> immediately no when I was trying to like </connor>
<connor> where's like I you just want that word </connor>
<joey> didn't you because she'd be like okay </joey>
<joey> that's not quite how you use it this is </joey>
<joey> how you use it and then I use it again </joey>
<joey> and she'd be like okay perfect and </joey>
<joey> that's just how I learn from </joey>
<garnt> practicality you know one big reason I </garnt>
<garnt> really want to learn Japanese is one </garnt>
<joey> specific series I want to experience </joey>
<connor> after having learned Japanese yeah and </connor>
<connor> that's the monogatari see oh yeah I </connor>
<connor> really really want to experience the </connor>
<joey> monogatari series after learning </joey>
<joey> Japanese because like I love the </joey>
<joey> monogatari series now yeah but I feel </joey>
<joey> like I'm getting like maybe half the </joey>
<garnt> enjoyment I could be guessing and like </garnt>
<joey> all the appreciation I could get there's </joey>
<joey> this video I've been trying to write for </joey>
<connor> the longest time called you'll never </connor>
<connor> understand initiation where because as </connor>
<connor> you said the monogatari series and </connor>
<connor> everything nice uation writes is [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> phenomenon wait he's an amazing author a </connor>
<connor> lot of it translates pretty well in </connor>
<connor> English right but the thing that makes </connor>
<connor> initiation so amazing is the subtleties </connor>
<connor> and the way that he plays around with </connor>
<garnt> the Japanese language and that [ __ ] is </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] impossible to translate yeah and </connor>
<garnt> I wanted to make that video because I </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] love nishu is you know monetary </connor>
<garnt> series like more than anybody yeah but </garnt>
<connor> it's like how do I explain to my </connor>
<joey> english-speaking audience about how </joey>
<joey> you'll never understand it if you're an </joey>
<connor> English speaker you have like a basic </connor>
<connor> understanding of kanji right yeah </connor>
<joey> understand not just kanji it's it's </joey>
<connor> everything he does would play in a way </connor>
<connor> that I have never seen any Japanese </connor>
<connor> author noon and I think that's the whole </connor>
<connor> reason why so many people loved him it </connor>
<connor> was like it's like wow I didn't know </connor>
<garnt> that you could like he makes Japanese </garnt>
<joey> people's Japanese look Tom will read </joey>
<joey> them be like wow it's like I don't know </joey>
<garnt> this language cuz like have you ever </garnt>
<garnt> seen the morning Qatari series yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I was learning kanji the day and I came </garnt>
<joey> across one I got three country is like </joey>
<garnt> four is it like Hana say all oh cool </garnt>
<joey> which kanji czar the one where you it's </joey>
<joey> like to speak or to tell a tale is </joey>
<joey> Holika i'll go yeah yeah go is like one </joey>
<connor> of the meanings is to tell a tale right </connor>
<joey> and so it's I cook and one of the Tauri </joey>
<connor> just means like thing tale yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that's what I saw Alec that's pretty </connor>
<joey> cool yeah because like because like </joey>
<joey> that's the thing right with the Mona </joey>
<connor> Vitara series that even the titles are a </connor>
<connor> play </connor>
<connor> woods right because [ __ ] Momo and </connor>
<garnt> monogatari is two different words right </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] mashes those two words </garnt>
<garnt> together to just turn it into one thing </garnt>
<garnt> okay and like that's that's like the </garnt>
<garnt> brilliant subtlety of any show Asia I </garnt>
<joey> don't want to say the whole thing cuz I </joey>
<garnt> wanna save it for our video okay so I </garnt>
<garnt> was gonna ask how is it reading the </garnt>
<garnt> light novel compared to watching the </garnt>
<garnt> anime because that's something I've </garnt>
<garnt> always been curious about how well the </garnt>
<garnt> anime has been able to translate his </garnt>
<garnt> writing right into a visual format I </garnt>
<joey> think with like that's the one thing I </joey>
<joey> love about shaft right is that they do </joey>
<connor> hold this like really weird appreciation </connor>
<connor> for initiations writing and yeah that's </connor>
<connor> why like you know other doggies like </connor>
<garnt> monologues are way longer than any anime </garnt>
<joey> monologue Hanoi like there's so much </joey>
<connor> that's why I would you know being like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] like we just end like yeah </connor>
<connor> like like acid and ammonia Atari episode </connor>
<connor> is like 95% dialogue yeah but it needs </connor>
<connor> to be because everything that initiation </connor>
<connor> rights is so important to the story </connor>
<connor> because it is really convoluted and it </connor>
<connor> does add a lot of character and like and </connor>
<garnt> you know like if you've seen one of </garnt>
<garnt> Atari episodes you know Holly every now </garnt>
<garnt> and then there were just like these </garnt>
<joey> flashing images oh yeah that's all text </joey>
<joey> ripped straight out of the novels yeah I </joey>
<connor> was really confused no time yeah I've </connor>
<connor> confused a lot during about every series </connor>
<garnt> of the monitor yeah yeah it is it is </garnt>
<joey> very surprised how big monogatari got </joey>
<joey> because it like I remember when I first </joey>
<joey> watched it and I'm like this breaks </joey>
<connor> basically every rule of like filmmaking </connor>
<connor> conventions that I know yeah it was like </connor>
<connor> oh you know show don't tell it what a </connor>
<connor> guitar is like how about we tell </connor>
<connor> everybody and show basically nothing and </connor>
<connor> you're just gonna enjoy this 20 minute </connor>
<connor> long dialogue yeah and you're gonna </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] in and and it's it turns out </connor>
<connor> amazing and I'm like why'd why does this </connor>
<connor> work I have never seen something work so </connor>
<connor> eloquently as the monogatari series and </connor>
<garnt> what surprised me is that it just became </garnt>
<garnt> like for the otaku culture back then it </garnt>
<garnt> kinda mechanic became like a cultural </garnt>
<joey> phenomenon it did especially in Japan </joey>
<joey> because it was just unlike anything and </joey>
<joey> I mean you know caught on a got that he </joey>
<connor> in a sense as well I was gonna say like </connor>
<connor> if I had to if I was a betting man I </connor>
<joey> would have put my money on cut on the </joey>
<garnt> gut that I being way bigger than yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah and it's kind of weird that in the </joey>
<garnt> West it was like the other way around </garnt>
<garnt> and like </garnt>
<garnt> people still don't really watch I think </garnt>
<garnt> capitana got to be because of maybe it's </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't know where you can watch it </garnt>
<garnt> all right </garnt>
<garnt> illegally yeah yeah I have no idea how </garnt>
<connor> you have to buy like a $400 blu-ray oh </connor>
<connor> that's a shame it is it's got nothing to </connor>
<connor> do with the monogatari so you know </connor>
<connor> that's a good thing recently um there </connor>
<connor> was an OVA adaptation of the first novel </connor>
<connor> that initially she never wrote it could </connor>
<connor> be Kitty cycle that's what it was like </connor>
<connor> it was like a four episode of Yale that </connor>
<garnt> that came out and I was like okay it's </garnt>
<garnt> an issue Asian it's essentially the </garnt>
<garnt> series that inspired the monogatari </garnt>
<garnt> series yeah so I'm like this has to be </garnt>
<garnt> be like you know of course every morning </garnt>
<garnt> Atari fans gonna watch it no one [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> watch that OVA </joey>
<joey> and I was really sad because it is </joey>
<connor> screaming monogatari vibes it's it's </connor>
<connor> weird cuz I liked the Monica three </connor>
<connor> series </connor>
<joey> I've watched I don't know which part I </joey>
<connor> got up to her just a lot of it is like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] many and I'm like a monkey when </garnt>
<connor> I watch anime I'm like I don't want to </connor>
<connor> have to like think about like order and </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] and you just put something on </connor>
<connor> right and sometimes you'd like the I </connor>
<connor> don't know what happened in between the </connor>
<connor> series sometimes yeah and because it's </connor>
<connor> so confusing there was so many times </connor>
<connor> where I would start a season of one of </connor>
<connor> that franchise I don't know which </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] one and I was like am I on the </connor>
<connor> right one or am I just confused because </connor>
<joey> it's this series look I didn't like </joey>
<joey> easily the most like that is the number </joey>
<connor> one question I get past probably the </connor>
<connor> most what's the old what order should I </connor>
<garnt> watch even that it's not even that comp </garnt>
<connor> okay but even even though if you're </connor>
<connor> watching in the right order it's such a </connor>
<connor> confusing show that normally you can get </connor>
<garnt> halfway through the first episode like </garnt>
<connor> season two right and you're like season </connor>
<joey> 2 I really like don't know what's going </joey>
<connor> on like what am I guess and I didn't </connor>
<joey> have any idea what's going on the whole </joey>
<joey> time so right that's the thing right is </joey>
<joey> that the monetary series like one season </joey>
<connor> is already confusing enough as it is </connor>
<connor> like in a enclosed story yeah and when </connor>
<connor> you look at it on the grand scale of </connor>
<connor> things it's even more confusing because </connor>
<connor> basically initiation pull the Quentin </connor>
<connor> Tarantino pull fictions yeah we like </connor>
<joey> everything is out of order but it's in </joey>
<garnt> the same universe yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh I mean I don't think it matters that </garnt>
<garnt> much honestly as long as you just get </garnt>
<garnt> like this it's just [ __ ] Google with </garnt>
<connor> the release order it's stressful there </connor>
<connor> man it's I've somehow [ __ ] did I how </connor>
<connor> many times like when I watched the thus </connor>
<connor> Spoke Rohan cachet of EA's yeah for some </connor>
<garnt> reason he Iraqi when he wrote them gave </garnt>
<garnt> them episode numbers in the right of </garnt>
<garnt> thing alright so when you're watching </garnt>
<garnt> the OVA s they don't do them in order </garnt>
<connor> and but Iraqi never do them in order </connor>
<connor> anyway if I remember correctly so your </connor>
<connor> turn episode 1 they'll be like episode 6 </connor>
<connor> and I'm like please stop </connor>
<garnt> you like spacebar right [ __ ] Google </garnt>
<garnt> right which episode is episode 1 </garnt>
<garnt> yeah episode 1 is episode 6 episode 2 is </garnt>
<connor> episode 9 episode 3 is like episode 4 </connor>
<connor> and then you're like why they like full </connor>
<connor> people like a George Lucas Star Wars </connor>
<joey> right it's like episode 4 is the first </joey>
<connor> one yeah at least it's ghost episode </connor>
<connor> what like three four five six one two </connor>
<connor> it's not even that it's just like four </connor>
<garnt> nine to seven </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's like why it's like this not </garnt>
<connor> nothing </connor>
<connor> just how he Suzumiya like did you watch </connor>
<connor> are you sorry when it was airing yes so </connor>
<connor> how he season Mia had like this </connor>
<connor> broadcast order and it was it was full </connor>
<connor> absolutely no reason </connor>
<connor> it was just broadcasted in this random </connor>
<connor> order and people like I remember when it </connor>
<connor> was when I was airing people were like </connor>
<connor> oh this is like a genius move because </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like you're piecing </connor>
<connor> together the puzzle each episode and now </connor>
<connor> that it's like all aired now like I'm </connor>
<connor> pretty [ __ ] sure that they aired out </connor>
<connor> the order because the [ __ ] last </connor>
<connor> episode chronologically was just the </connor>
<connor> most anticlimactic episode of the entire </connor>
<connor> series so they're like are the best </connor>
<connor> episode is episode 6 fix it up just just </connor>
<garnt> mix up the order and people gonna call </garnt>
<joey> that genius crew so it wasn't genius </joey>
<joey> tiny Colnago was just on crew way resist </joey>
<connor> which is the original Japanese broadcast </connor>
<joey> yeah cuz tiny corner girl was on a crack </joey>
<connor> I didn't know that I see I only watched </connor>
<connor> it years after and now you mentioned </connor>
<garnt> this before but I watched the movie </garnt>
<connor> first by accident yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> dumb mistake yeah this this guy can I I </garnt>
<connor> think you mentioned in episode zero so </connor>
<connor> most people have seen this person watch </connor>
<garnt> the disappearance of haruhi suzumiya </garnt>
<connor> first which is like I wish I was still </connor>
<connor> less confused watching that movie then I </connor>
<connor> was watching most them on igano so if </connor>
<connor> you don't know the they made a movie </connor>
<connor> right of like the thing that like tied </connor>
<joey> the whole hat excuse me it was yeah the </joey>
<joey> disappearance of suzumiya haruhi which </joey>
<joey> is the fourth boy novel I don't know why </joey>
<connor> no I don't [ __ ] know right oh I was </connor>
<connor> like I was in I just got into anime I </connor>
<joey> wanted to watch the best rated anime </joey>
<joey> movie you know no one told me and it's </joey>
<connor> really is the best no one who told me </connor>
<connor> that I needed backstory you know and I </connor>
<connor> went into it I I I watched it all and I </connor>
<garnt> was like well you know what did you </garnt>
<garnt> think it did you think it was a good </garnt>
<connor> movie [ __ ] I bet kono just watch this </connor>
<connor> right after school days ten or ten ten </connor>
<garnt> hours and what the [ __ ] is going on </garnt>
<connor> well I'm like I am I'm on crack I think </connor>
<connor> I think the school days as well like you </connor>
<connor> know broke the camel's back yeah it was </connor>
<connor> definitely the Hannah here Suzumiya </connor>
<connor> movie watching thing that definitely </connor>
<joey> like made me think like reviews gone </joey>
<joey> back to like watch them yes since then I </joey>
<joey> watched the first season in the TV </joey>
<connor> series I got like two episodes into the </connor>
<connor> second TV series where they were </connor>
<connor> repeating everything okay I would say </connor>
<garnt> that I've already he still is very much </garnt>
<garnt> worth watching yeah in this day and age </garnt>
<garnt> because of disappearance disappearance </garnt>
<garnt> is still my it's probably my favorite </garnt>
<garnt> anime franchise film of all time I agree </garnt>
<garnt> and up up there is one of my favorite </garnt>
<garnt> anime films of all time and this this </garnt>
<garnt> guy apparently [ __ ] hates it so I </garnt>
<connor> think that the whole series just kind of </connor>
<connor> mediocre I don't really I'd the first </connor>
<connor> season was just fine right I was </connor>
<connor> watching it and I was like okay I know </connor>
<connor> this is a terrible comparison but I was </connor>
<connor> just like man this just feels like </connor>
<garnt> Toradora but like worse this zero </garnt>
<garnt> romance </garnt>
<connor> Oh cuz the whole setting reminded me so </connor>
<connor> much of like Toradora and the way that </connor>
<joey> it was said that it was set in a school </joey>
<garnt> yeah I know this is like complete soup </garnt>
<garnt> and opinion oh my god </garnt>
<connor> I recognize this is a garbage opinion </connor>
<connor> but the whole time I was just like I </connor>
<connor> guess cuz he was just okay I was very </connor>
<connor> bored a lot of the time what she had is </connor>
<connor> the only thing that made me want to </connor>
<connor> watch it was the fact that uh </connor>
<connor> Crispin Freeman voice kion yeah he was </connor>
<connor> amazing I would use a tree watching him </connor>
<connor> yeah what you said he's like saying oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah I know Hana was kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> another because they have ghosts what </garnt>
<connor> show can you compare Harris use Amir to </connor>
<garnt> if you had to the closest comparison </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing like Harry Suzumiya </garnt>
<garnt> inspired a lot of like III came after </garnt>
<connor> that that huge way I became an anime fan </connor>
<connor> after that huge thing that had its </connor>
<connor> impact right so I think I came into it </connor>
<connor> with like zero attachment to it any </connor>
<joey> sense yeah because I think the thing was </joey>
<joey> hierarchy that I find really interesting </joey>
<joey> is the fact that it's one of those anime </joey>
<connor> that is like really weirdly tied to the </connor>
<connor> period that it came out in much like </connor>
<connor> lucky star I feel because like that's </connor>
<connor> why I don't give a [ __ ] about a unit </connor>
<connor> right because like the thing the thing </connor>
<connor> is like I [ __ ] love both lucky star </connor>
<connor> especially lucky star I think it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing but like the problem is </connor>
<connor> is that the references in lucky star and </connor>
<connor> like the whole fact that it really </connor>
<connor> reflected the otaku culture of yeah is </connor>
<connor> what made that show really funny in the </connor>
<connor> mid-2000s but yeah as much as I love </connor>
<garnt> lucky star I can't really recommend it </garnt>
<joey> to people today no and because the scene </joey>
<connor> is just completely changed yeah but does </connor>
<garnt> that mean you can recommend how he sees </garnt>
<connor> him here today yes I can yeah because I </connor>
<garnt> think I think I ruined it for myself </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah I think you you basically just </garnt>
<garnt> watched the climax you you watch the </garnt>
<garnt> climax before like watching any of the </garnt>
<connor> build-up yeah so now you that's why I </connor>
<connor> kind of don't feel bad for being like </connor>
<connor> yeah I think it's not that good because </connor>
<connor> I'm like I know I ruined it for myself </connor>
<joey> and it might have been the only way to </joey>
<joey> like top that experiences if you </joey>
<connor> committed to reading all the light novel </connor>
<garnt> that and like the final final volume of </garnt>
<joey> he was like pretty [ __ ] good so I </joey>
<garnt> just have to sit every night early I </garnt>
<connor> have no I have no interest in reading a </connor>
<garnt> light novel ever cuz I remember like a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of the elements in herre he have </garnt>
<garnt> been done another place in that cause </garnt>
<connor> like there's a lot of like </connor>
<connor> self-referential humor in herre he I </connor>
<connor> remember when that was like an </connor>
<connor> innovative thing like everyone every </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] light novel wasn't wasn't trying </connor>
<joey> to parody every [ __ ] every other </joey>
<joey> light novel yeah ya know it's just it's </joey>
<garnt> just gotten so [ __ ] lazy with its </garnt>
<joey> self-referential humor again like that's </joey>
<joey> the whole thing where it comes to like </joey>
<connor> the time period I like animate boomers </connor>
<joey> we had it better back in oh six when her </joey>
<garnt> he and lucky star came out like as you </garnt>
<garnt> said like the whole like </garnt>
<garnt> self-referential thing and I think the </garnt>
<garnt> whole meta aspect yeah anime was just so </garnt>
<connor> new like I remember it was such waste </connor>
<connor> modernism at the time because like I </connor>
<joey> remember like at the end of every lucky </joey>
<joey> star beside while the credits were </joey>
<joey> rolling there was no ending song for </joey>
<joey> lucky stuff what it was was it was the </joey>
<joey> scenes of all of the lucky star </joey>
<connor> characters in a karaoke booth but you </connor>
<connor> were outside of the karaoke booth so you </connor>
<connor> could only hear them but the </connor>
<connor> conversations that they were having in </connor>
<connor> the karaoke booth weren't characters </connor>
<connor> having a conversation with characters it </connor>
<connor> was voice actresses having a </connor>
<connor> conversation with voice actresses yeah </connor>
<connor> and people like of course they're voiced </connor>
<connor> by voice actresses </connor>
<connor> these aren't just characters on a screen </connor>
<joey> they're real people and that meta was </joey>
<connor> like that was [ __ ] cool because no </connor>
<connor> other anime did that laughing sit down </connor>
<connor> you're gonna sit down and you're gonna </connor>
<connor> respect this culture matter anime like I </connor>
<connor> still think meta anime peaked with </connor>
<connor> monogatari like in terms of like light </connor>
<connor> novel light novel yeah shows adaptations </connor>
<connor> it kind of like Pete with mornig Atari </connor>
<connor> and there's there's been another good </connor>
<connor> light novel shows as well I've been </connor>
<connor> better but I'd say you know Hera he </connor>
<connor> really was the first time I noticed it </connor>
<connor> Harry it was Harry he and Lucky Star and </connor>
<connor> then monogatari was the one that came </connor>
<joey> afterwards and then it kind of like </joey>
<joey> nothing out did it and now </joey>
<joey> now you see a lot of lazy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> attempts a meta humor and meta jokes </joey>
<joey> like there was what one and one anime I </joey>
<joey> saw recently which was like such an eye </joey>
<joey> rolling moment is the the milfy sekai </joey>
<joey> for ads last year okay okay because it </joey>
<joey> was you know everyone thought and you </joey>
<joey> know it kind of marketed itself as like </joey>
<joey> a parody of the easy right because it's </joey>
<joey> like oh it's the east like a genre but </joey>
<joey> you know there's a mom this time and i </joey>
<joey> you can eat it's different it's </joey>
<joey> different because there's a mom this </joey>
<joey> time and I remember there was one joke </joey>
<joey> okay they're in like they're at there </joey>
<joey> were in a hot springs right and this is </joey>
<joey> one single a that's in the hot springs </joey>
<joey> and then she like she like stands up and </joey>
<joey> she's naked in front of the main </joey>
<connor> character and then the main character </connor>
<connor> literally says ah this is the scene </connor>
<connor> where you're about to hit me right and </connor>
<connor> there goes our but how about if I don't </connor>
<connor> hit you I bet you weren't expecting that </connor>
<connor> were you and the main character goes ah </connor>
<connor> you're right </connor>
<connor> I wasn't expecting that and the cinder a </connor>
<garnt> just goes off crying and that was the </garnt>
<joey> joke wow that was the joke I remember I </joey>
<garnt> remember we have this exact same </garnt>
<connor> conversation that is the kaity Liz video </connor>
<connor> you're like [ __ ] lights fuming a </connor>
<connor> white this is not how you write a </connor>
<joey> message ugh you basically explained that </joey>
<joey> the meds are before you told the mental </joey>
<connor> first of all I want all my anime scenes </connor>
<connor> acted out by God like that yeah second </connor>
<connor> of all I just like where as you said you </connor>
<connor> tend to watch the trash Lisa Chi I could </connor>
<connor> give a less with [ __ ] about the East can </connor>
<connor> see I'm right there it's so like it's </connor>
<joey> iterates on itself and then changes one </joey>
<joey> thing it's like yeah it's like I'm </joey>
<joey> wouldn't be surprised this is another </joey>
<joey> slime one except he's like a green slime </joey>
<joey> next right it's just like that's gonna </joey>
<joey> be the next base just season two yes </joey>
<joey> this is a green and it's just like I </joey>
<joey> just I just struggle to give a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> about any of these are kinda come on </connor>
<connor> like I wanted to watch the mum one just </connor>
<connor> for the memes yeah I couldn't even </connor>
<connor> muster up to like tighten up in yes it </connor>
<garnt> wasn't even that good for the memes like </garnt>
<connor> it was it was it was you saw the title </connor>
<garnt> you're like haha I can make him email </garnt>
<garnt> this and if I did yeah and then I </garnt>
<garnt> watched two episodes I'm like now I'm </garnt>
<connor> done </connor>
<connor> I won't watch these Sherry's so I can </connor>
<connor> talk about them but then I realized like </connor>
<connor> if I now maybe I don't even know that </connor>
<connor> six months after that shares add that </connor>
<connor> that meme is long dead and no one's </connor>
<connor> gonna mention it's like by the time the </connor>
<joey> next season comes around three months </joey>
<connor> time no one's [ __ ] and then maybe </connor>
<joey> it'll be like a factoid one day George </joey>
<connor> some mommy's okay </connor>
<joey> yeah you need to watch it because for me </joey>
<garnt> watching trash ISA guy or just trash </garnt>
<connor> anime in general because apparently </connor>
<connor> that's my brand or whatever it's just </connor>
<connor> the reason I do it is because it's just </connor>
<connor> like it's just the easy turn your brain </connor>
<connor> off show the season right now you know </connor>
<connor> like I have to be in a certain mood to </connor>
<connor> watch something like Monogatari you know </connor>
<connor> enemy like I'll just be like oh and just </connor>
<garnt> like casually sit down having having </garnt>
<garnt> like my lunch or something I'm like I'm </garnt>
<joey> gonna I'm always like the antithesis of </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna put something on yeah </joey>
<garnt> whereas whereas we've with the trashy so </garnt>
<garnt> guy like I just sit down for lunch and I </garnt>
<garnt> just put it on you know and I just don't </garnt>
<garnt> have to think I watch every week and </garnt>
<garnt> then I just end and those the shows end </garnt>
<garnt> up watching because then they're like </garnt>
<garnt> the easiest watch cuz I I know I'm </garnt>
<garnt> getting into I'm not being challenged </garnt>
<garnt> you know I'm just like okay this </garnt>
<connor> characters gonna do that whatever how </connor>
<joey> much of a brain did you know which which </joey>
<garnt> is why I can watch them because they are </garnt>
<connor> brains I don't have to think yes you </connor>
<connor> know you know sometimes where you watch </connor>
<connor> like a good show right and something </connor>
<connor> sometimes you just really want to be in </connor>
<connor> that right mood to watch something good </connor>
<connor> but with some with the trash shows I </connor>
<connor> never have to be in a certain mood the </connor>
<connor> sriracha you know which is why I've </connor>
<connor> found I found that I've watched more </connor>
<connor> trash shows because like like sometimes </connor>
<connor> I don't know I I get ink I get anxiety </connor>
<connor> sometimes when if I know it's not sure </connor>
<garnt> if it's a good show but a mood do you </garnt>
<connor> know what I mean </connor>
<garnt> what was the show keep your hands off </garnt>
<connor> okay right right like that was one of </connor>
<garnt> those shows where I'm like I can't just </garnt>
<garnt> not like I can't just like watch this </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah you have to commit to it it's </connor>
<connor> such a passionate thing where I was like </connor>
<connor> yeah just half ask this so it's one </connor>
<garnt> episode and I liked what I saw </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but because of that I I just never </garnt>
<garnt> watched episode two because yeah I had </garnt>
<garnt> to be in that mood to watch it never was </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's like really </joey>
<joey> hard to like him stop and then get back </joey>
<joey> into yeah and it sucks because I know </joey>
<joey> that was a good show I know it was but I </joey>
<joey> just I didn't care enough to like find </joey>
<connor> that time to be like I want to keep </connor>
<connor> watching this and I thought no bad kiss </connor>
<connor> like everyone was like this is the best </connor>
<connor> show of the season yeah I'm just sitting </connor>
<connor> there like watching like the 100th </connor>
<connor> documentary on Netflix you know right </connor>
<garnt> because a lot more with anime recent I </garnt>
<garnt> feel this this is the reason this is the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] reason I still haven't watched </connor>
<connor> fullmetal alchemist okay yeah no it's </connor>
<connor> good I know it's good and I like because </connor>
<connor> here's the thing I can go years without </connor>
<connor> watching or reading a manga over of a </connor>
<joey> series that I know I'm going to love I </joey>
<joey> but I want to be in the right mood and </joey>
<joey> it might take years it might take a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] decade okay like last year I </joey>
<connor> finally read 20th century boys okay and </connor>
<joey> it went from like I know I was gonna </joey>
<connor> read this since I basically started </connor>
<connor> getting into manga - okay yeah this is </connor>
<connor> like I thought one of my favorite </connor>
<connor> mongers of all time yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] incredible it's what I had to </connor>
<connor> wait like so many years to experience it </connor>
<connor> because I just wanted to be in that </connor>
<connor> perfect zone to read it and I'm so glad </connor>
<connor> I did because there are some shows you </connor>
<connor> Jeff some shows that you think if you re </connor>
<connor> watch it you won't enjoy as much oh you </connor>
<connor> know what the same heads 90% I think </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah because I feel like that's why </connor>
<joey> I caught and I can never get behind </joey>
<joey> watching anime weekly cuz me can I can't </joey>
<joey> I I can't because it's because like I'm </joey>
<garnt> always in a different headspace </garnt>
<connor> sometimes oh there's some shows that </connor>
<connor> like transcend that and like you they're </connor>
<joey> so hype such as attack on Titan watching </joey>
<joey> that Weekly was like - [ __ ] every single </joey>
<connor> week no matter what that one day it came </connor>
<joey> out I was hyped as [ __ ] for that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> cuz I binge that Halsey right yeah like </joey>
<connor> it was such a good episode by episode </connor>
<connor> that like even though it sucked </connor>
<connor> it sucked have to wait a week it was so </connor>
<connor> good cuz that one day in the week you </connor>
<connor> got like a tree and didn't matter how </connor>
<connor> bad your mood was away your headspace is </connor>
<connor> that for 25 minutes you just shut your </connor>
<connor> brain off and just have a [ __ ] time </connor>
<joey> a man I used to be able to do that so </joey>
<connor> easily when I was in my high school in </connor>
<connor> uni but and is well joining inin like </connor>
<connor> this the discourse online you know like </connor>
<garnt> talking about I feel I feel like that's </garnt>
<garnt> a different side that I never got </garnt>
<garnt> growing up with anime which is the </garnt>
<garnt> social aspects because for me it was </garnt>
<garnt> just I watch a show and I'm like that </garnt>
<garnt> was an amazing show and happy I want to </garnt>
<connor> talk has quickly become one of my </connor>
<garnt> favorite parts of like watching anime </garnt>
<garnt> and it's why I like I caught up to demon </garnt>
<garnt> slayer on episode 19 yeah like I wanted </garnt>
<connor> to get involved with the the social </connor>
<garnt> discourse good the great like it's it's </garnt>
<connor> made of so if a show has like a bad </connor>
<joey> ending or something I still enjoy it </joey>
<connor> because like I remember when darling the </connor>
<joey> Franks ended and there was this shift at </joey>
<connor> like episode 18 or 20 icon room the </connor>
<garnt> exact episode and then everyone lost </garnt>
<garnt> their [ __ ] and like it's not a good </garnt>
<garnt> ending but I had a blast watching it you </garnt>
<connor> know I just realized something </connor>
<connor> I remember that you know when Big Ed was </connor>
<garnt> a thing I know bear with me the shit's </garnt>
<garnt> gonna make sense but you get from that </garnt>
<connor> day fiancé was like it was you know </connor>
<connor> great memes fantastic I want to start </connor>
<connor> watching named a fiance because of that </connor>
<connor> yeah I was like it's just like not the </connor>
<connor> same I was watching you and I was like </connor>
<connor> ah it's cuz I need the YouTube comments </connor>
<connor> for everything cuz it's like one thing </connor>
<connor> to have a clip is it's funny but what is </connor>
<garnt> like just the perfect YouTube threads do </garnt>
<connor> so fine like and also when someone's an </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] at even show you want to be like </garnt>
<joey> everyone else thinks this guy's an </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] right let me go check the </joey>
<joey> comments yeah because do you get this </joey>
<joey> now where you watch some YouTube videos </joey>
<joey> or clip some shows or YouTube video </joey>
<connor> where they do something in the clip and </connor>
<connor> that's the moment where you open up the </connor>
<connor> comments yeah I hope I hope everyone's </connor>
<connor> talking about this and that's what I </connor>
<connor> love about watching anime weekly is that </connor>
<connor> you get that kind of like everyone's </connor>
<garnt> gonna be talking about that thing that </garnt>
<garnt> just happened on to it yeah probably fun </garnt>
<connor> I love trying again on that but they're </connor>
<garnt> like like you ever get personally </garnt>
<garnt> offended when you go in a YouTube video </garnt>
<connor> and then the comments are disabled like </connor>
<connor> II like something you never wanted to </connor>
<connor> comment on or you never yeah if it's </connor>
<connor> just most of it is like anime trailers </connor>
<connor> or anime opening sometimes I see the </connor>
<garnt> comments that they say but I'm like I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why but I feel offended are </garnt>
<connor> you [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> I tend like American for like five seven </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like free speech </garnt>
<garnt> where's my second memory you know like </garnt>
<connor> going back to what you said earlier with </connor>
<connor> the if if Yuri watch the sharing on the </connor>
<connor> right headspace yeah I just for some </connor>
<connor> reason I was like I'm pretty sure if I </connor>
<connor> rewatched darker than black </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't think it's that kind of a </connor>
<connor> show but I remember very well I remember </connor>
<connor> really liking this yeah </connor>
<joey> I'm happy to leave that memory like what </joey>
<joey> shows like that of that like oh go proxy </joey>
<connor> for me is one of those yeah I rewatched </connor>
<connor> I go proxy I don't think I'd like I </connor>
<joey> don't think I'd like it as much but when </joey>
<connor> I watched it I was in that like </connor>
<connor> perfectly writing steel like big brain </connor>
<joey> boy Moe was like yep there's there's a </joey>
<garnt> lot of shows that I'm just leaving in </garnt>
<garnt> that bubble yeah I'm happy to talk about </garnt>
<connor> these shows but I never want to rewatch </connor>
<garnt> them no cuz like for me that what the </garnt>
<joey> one big show for me is cutting a cut on </joey>
<garnt> no Kyoukai yeah I watched it when I was </garnt>
<connor> like in a really dark headspace I </connor>
<connor> watched this one with the blood sword no </connor>
<joey> that's not that's beyond the battery he </joey>
<joey> said beyond the boundary yeah I'm a cool </joey>
<connor> guy yeah it's a cool kind of Canada is </connor>
<garnt> beyond the boundaries oh yeah what the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] the Japanese title of yeah that's </connor>
<joey> the one with the pink haired girl in the </joey>
<garnt> glasses it's about it's the one with the </garnt>
<connor> assassin who yeah I was in a really dark </connor>
<connor> headspace when I watched that and no but </connor>
<connor> like it's it like it was one of those </connor>
<garnt> series that's I don't want to be that </garnt>
<garnt> guy but it was like kind of </garnt>
<connor> life-changing for me like because okay </connor>
<connor> now we need him there please please well </connor>
<garnt> because like I was I was like I don't </garnt>
<garnt> wanna get too much in the detail but I </garnt>
<garnt> was like in a headspace that I was I </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like the lowest I've ever been </garnt>
<garnt> in my life and then I watched this </garnt>
<garnt> series and it connected me connected </garnt>
<garnt> with me on a level that's nothing else </garnt>
<connor> could at the time and it kind of like </connor>
<connor> really changed my perception of the </connor>
<connor> world and everything like that and </connor>
<connor> because of this like one of my favorite </connor>
<connor> anime of all time but because I'm not in </connor>
<connor> the same head space that I am now that I </connor>
<connor> was back then I'm so [ __ ] terrified </connor>
<connor> of rewatching it because if I we watch </connor>
<connor> it and I just don't get that same </connor>
<connor> connection that I'm like III don't want </connor>
<connor> to lose that </connor>
<connor> I don't want to lose what that series </connor>
<connor> gave to me at that time at that time of </connor>
<connor> my life and that was that's that's like </connor>
<connor> the one series that I I really hold like </connor>
<connor> really close to me yeah and another </connor>
<connor> series is actually Evangelion because </connor>
<connor> Evangelion I I think is one show that </connor>
<connor> it's just infinitely rewatchable right </connor>
<connor> yeah every time that I've watched </connor>
<garnt> Evangelion I've got a different </garnt>
<joey> experience out of a hundred percent </joey>
<connor> agree I've watched it first time when it </connor>
<connor> came on Netflix first time I were </connor>
<joey> watching it I'd really how do you find </joey>
<connor> her it was good I mean I think because </connor>
<connor> it was the mega hype showed that it was </connor>
<connor> Mickey Cohen expecting too much </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah I mean I was I was happy with </connor>
<garnt> what I what I got it was just very </garnt>
<connor> confusing it was great and I liked how </connor>
<connor> he built the world is a very very </connor>
<connor> terrifying one and I feel like it's a </connor>
<connor> lot of animation struggle to do that </connor>
<connor> yeah and like a truly terrifying do you </connor>
<joey> have like that one anime that as Gahan </joey>
<connor> said is like life-changing for you yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah I I mean we spoke about it last </connor>
<connor> episode which [ __ ] up the recording </connor>
<connor> right right but yeah Bo Khurana is </connor>
<connor> definitely one of those shows that like </connor>
<connor> definitely changed yeah yeah cuz it was </connor>
<connor> again I think it was a similar thing </connor>
<connor> where I was at a point where I think I </connor>
<connor> was really confused with what I wanted </connor>
<connor> in my life yeah and it really helped </connor>
<connor> like ground me a lot and really </connor>
<connor> understand a lot of emotions that I was </connor>
<connor> perhaps feeling we can we talk about Bo </connor>
<joey> Corrado because I want the audience to </joey>
<joey> know but yeah it's one of those shows </joey>
<garnt> where it's not the best sure but it's a </garnt>
<garnt> very important one that I think people </garnt>
<connor> should watch yeah and I don't know how </connor>
<joey> to describe that's very eloquently </joey>
<joey> disturbing but not for like the </joey>
<joey> conventional reason for it being </joey>
<garnt> disturbed yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so what Bo Carano is about is there's </garnt>
<connor> this group of kids this is gonna sound </connor>
<connor> awesome by the way even Gillian Ripa </connor>
<connor> Veronica because there's these group of </connor>
<connor> kids and then the like I think we're on </connor>
<connor> this school trip or something school </connor>
<connor> trip yeah and then they find this all I </connor>
<garnt> remember is they find his cave with a </garnt>
<garnt> talking head or something like no so </garnt>
<connor> there's a guy in a cave and he's like a </connor>
<connor> middle-aged man working on like a PC </connor>
<garnt> right it's really weird setup yeah and </garnt>
<connor> he basically asked them do you want to </connor>
<connor> play a game would you like to play a </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<joey> which you know anyone asking me that </joey>
<joey> ever with a bunch of kids in immediate </joey>
<connor> no name and then I think they all get on </connor>
<connor> a scale or something they all turns he </connor>
<connor> messes them and then you know they </connor>
<garnt> whatever happens and suddenly they go </garnt>
<connor> outside or happens later on in that </connor>
<connor> evening because they're all weave </connor>
<connor> kitchen know these characters a little </connor>
<garnt> bit that's like how many kids is there </garnt>
<garnt> 12 like 12 30 years something like that </garnt>
<garnt> around that many kids and then they get </garnt>
<garnt> teleported into this huge Mac and </garnt>
<connor> there's a scary floating head that's </connor>
<connor> like talking to them and and one of the </connor>
<connor> children has to pilot the mech and now </connor>
<connor> we're gonna go into spoilers a little </connor>
<connor> bit but yeah it's it's episode one so </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna spoil the premise a little bit </connor>
<connor> to you but yeah so one of the kids </connor>
<connor> pilots the mech and they're fighting </connor>
<connor> another Mac and it's to save the world </connor>
<connor> then they're told </connor>
<connor> yes floating head character very </connor>
<connor> intimidating character so they win the </connor>
<connor> battle hurray they all win they all </connor>
<connor> celebrate and they go outside they stand </connor>
<connor> on the Mac and then one of the kids just </connor>
<connor> drops dead and falls off the Mac then </connor>
<connor> they find out that each time this mech </connor>
<connor> comes back and they're summoned one of </connor>
<connor> the kids has to pilot the mech and when </connor>
<connor> they do they're gonna die immediately </connor>
<garnt> after yeah but it's to save the world </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and what the the real beauty of </garnt>
<garnt> this show isn't really the mech battles </garnt>
<connor> or the mech fights it's more of the fact </connor>
<connor> that these kids who have to pilot the </connor>
<connor> mech to save the world like every is </connor>
<connor> like it's kept basically kind of like a </connor>
<connor> monster of the week on a show right </connor>
<connor> every week and you monster comes along </connor>
<connor> and the new kids and another kid from </connor>
<connor> that group has to pilot the mech but </connor>
<garnt> it's about the backstory of each of the </garnt>
<garnt> kids and just having to deal with the </garnt>
<garnt> fact that they're gonna die yes they're </garnt>
<joey> just gonna die and in like really </joey>
<joey> realistic ways as well like these </joey>
<connor> characters are very believable it makes </connor>
<connor> me like uncomfortable even like thinking </connor>
<garnt> back to like the emotions that poured </garnt>
<connor> out and me yeah they're like I get like </connor>
<connor> very like it's really really brutally </connor>
<connor> honest look into like the human </connor>
<connor> condition and yeah life and especially </connor>
<connor> how it's you know a lot of these kids </connor>
<connor> from a lot of different backgrounds some </connor>
<connor> of them have it easier I remember </connor>
<connor> there's a one kid who's the </connor>
<connor> stereotypical piece of [ __ ] but there's </connor>
<connor> some of the kids you know who I think </connor>
<connor> there's one kid who's like 16 or </connor>
<connor> whatever nice looking after two is two </connor>
<connor> siblings yeah and it's brutal because </connor>
<connor> this he's the one who's raising these </connor>
<connor> two his two sisters I think yeah </connor>
<connor> and it's horrible seeing him after like </connor>
<connor> come to terms with that he's not gonna </connor>
<garnt> better look after his sister it's rude </garnt>
<connor> it's something that just disturbs you </connor>
<connor> unlike a level that you can't really do </connor>
<connor> it's so raw it's so realistic yeah you </connor>
<joey> know filters yeah whatsoever I'm like </joey>
<garnt> it's it's something that already was </garnt>
<garnt> like not many people have watched it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's something I was really good </garnt>
<connor> uncomfortable it's really uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> have to like sit down and sit through </connor>
<joey> III admit I definitely like did not </joey>
<connor> watch it when I was first came out like </connor>
<connor> I definitely gave us some time yo cuz I </connor>
<joey> cuz I think the problem with boquerón on </joey>
<joey> the reason why so many people didn't </joey>
<connor> watch it when it came I was because the </connor>
<connor> way that they marketed it was not that </connor>
<joey> good not that angle like oh it's a mecca </joey>
<connor> must just be in a tank yelling rip off </connor>
<connor> there's no world where it's like the </connor>
<garnt> number one anime because it's just too </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable yeah yeah but it also came </garnt>
<garnt> out in the time period cuz I think it </garnt>
<garnt> was like the early to mid-2000s it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't where there was just so many </garnt>
<connor> Evangelion ripple eyes and like they </connor>
<connor> they're of like varying quality as well </connor>
<connor> there's another show that I [ __ ] love </connor>
<joey> as well which is rahxephon </joey>
<connor> oh that's good that's just the revine </connor>
<connor> gilliam cool it's a ripoff but it's </connor>
<joey> still really good it's it's really it's </joey>
<garnt> really good it's like it totally rips </garnt>
<connor> off but it goes about it in a totally </connor>
<connor> different way from the Evangel yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and boqueron oh also sits in this </connor>
<connor> category of just shows that people </connor>
<connor> really looked over cuz premise alone </connor>
<connor> sounds like an Evangelion room it does </connor>
<connor> it does but the way the way they go </connor>
<connor> about it is just absolutely harrowing </connor>
<connor> just seeing these stories of these kids </connor>
<connor> who have to come to terms with their own </connor>
<connor> mortality because it's a [ __ ] tragedy </connor>
<connor> you know I mean it's different from even </connor>
<connor> get even Gilly one to me is just a nose </connor>
<connor> raw cry for help </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean that's like you </connor>
<connor> can't watched like everyone's analyzed </connor>
<connor> the last two episodes of Evangelion and </connor>
<connor> I I I think it's I think it's going back </connor>
<garnt> to that meme about the blue cut I'm </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] sure that I know had no [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> clue everyone's like oh okay the way </garnt>
<garnt> that these lines move and the way that </garnt>
<connor> it's like very sketchy is like really </connor>
<connor> reflective of Shinji's like mental state </connor>
<connor> meanwhile I know it's just like we </connor>
<joey> didn't have much of a budget just just </joey>
<garnt> want to put back fairly because because </garnt>
<garnt> like like but that's why I love that </garnt>
<garnt> you've an kalium </garnt>
<garnt> everyone come everyone comes out of even </garnt>
<garnt> getting on with something different </garnt>
<garnt> because his message was so raw and he </garnt>
<garnt> put so much for himself into the series </garnt>
<garnt> that it's impossible not to like come </garnt>
<joey> out with it feeling something with even </joey>
<joey> Gillian especially that I don't know if </joey>
<joey> it's just uh no is just like trolling </joey>
<connor> like crazy but there were moments where </connor>
<connor> like the Evangelion fanbase and like the </connor>
<connor> the like super hardcore </connor>
<connor> analysts of Evangelion I like just so </connor>
<connor> committed to this idea of like </connor>
<garnt> everything and even gaily on every piece </garnt>
<connor> of imagery everything has to have a </connor>
<connor> meaning there I remember when uh no </connor>
<connor> finally came out in an interview about </connor>
<connor> like the meaning behind Evangelion and </connor>
<connor> it just straight-up said there is no </connor>
<connor> meaning it's just the show I wanted to </connor>
<connor> make and people like but what about like </connor>
<connor> the fact that every time the Angels die </connor>
<connor> it turns into a cross and he's like I </connor>
<connor> thought that looked cool and all the </connor>
<connor> analysts like no no he's lying </connor>
<connor> yeah it has to be a meaning behind I'm </connor>
<joey> like if the creator says there's no </joey>
<connor> meaning what is no meaning what's </connor>
<connor> Occam's razor where the simplest </connor>
<connor> simplest solution is the best solution </connor>
<connor> normally the the actual sleep yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and it's like it even goin </connor>
<connor> definitely made me uncomfortable and </connor>
<connor> feel bad for a lot of the characters </connor>
<connor> yeah like boqueron are just just would </connor>
<connor> like I mean I'd say like even Gideon </connor>
<connor> isn't from like a story it's it's not </connor>
<connor> it's not even remotely similar boqueron </connor>
<connor> Oh like I feel like has more of a </connor>
<connor> structure around its plots where you </connor>
<connor> think anyone just you ended on this you </connor>
<connor> know as I said Rourke rifle for help </connor>
<connor> from Anna yeah but Bo Khurana was </connor>
<garnt> definitely here's here's a group of kids </garnt>
<garnt> dealing with something that's very very </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable and you're gonna feel fun </garnt>
<connor> or for work and it's like it's not even </connor>
<connor> the worst part that like kids are gonna </connor>
<joey> die it's like sometimes it's their </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] back stories of [ __ ] horrific </joey>
<joey> yeah and I'm not gonna say it's a little </joey>
<joey> spoiler Lex it's really at all but that </joey>
<joey> was one episode in particular and uh it </joey>
<joey> like after I finished it was one of the </joey>
<garnt> things I had to like just sit there for </garnt>
<connor> like five minutes and be like [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you can remember all the </connor>
<connor> episode there's one a few plots that </connor>
<connor> like one of the stories are ours just </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> Yeah right at the end you think that you </connor>
<joey> expected everything right yeah that's </joey>
<joey> what I love though about these like </joey>
<joey> human drama shows is that like sometimes </joey>
<connor> they may just be like the simplest thing </connor>
<connor> of like just a story between two people </connor>
<connor> yeah one person but if it's done really </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] well it can be some of the most </joey>
<joey> powerful [ __ ] storytelling yeah well </joey>
<connor> I think it's more relatable than at most </connor>
<connor> things and it's really uncomfortable to </connor>
<connor> think that you could be in a situation </connor>
<connor> where you have to come to terms with </connor>
<joey> your death that's why that's why I like </joey>
<joey> you know I'll say this till the end of </joey>
<joey> time believe that's the whole reason why </joey>
<joey> my favorite manga artist of all time is </joey>
<garnt> any asana I was I was gonna say the one </garnt>
<garnt> series that the one manga series that </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like that I'm still waiting on to be </garnt>
<garnt> in the right headspace to read is oh yes </garnt>
<joey> me boy yeah I've read that I've reread </joey>
<connor> that like two or three times like all </connor>
<connor> the way through and every time I'm just </connor>
<garnt> like oh no the only way it's just oh no </garnt>
<connor> yeah because it's just so like and it's </connor>
<connor> not just pinpoint as well like any other </connor>
<connor> Sanne is just so good at writing these </connor>
<connor> characters that are just so believable </connor>
<connor> yeah and it's really disturbing when you </connor>
<connor> see these characters these very </connor>
<connor> believable characters run into these </connor>
<connor> very believable and horrifying </connor>
<connor> situations and you're just like this is </connor>
<connor> like based off like a real person's life </connor>
<connor> and that's just scary in and of itself </connor>
<connor> because this guy can just think of stuff </connor>
<joey> like this yeah yeah and present it in a </joey>
<connor> way that is just so terrifying I think </connor>
<connor> it's like when people like man </connor>
<connor> danganronpa is really like despair for </connor>
<connor> please shut the it's got pink blood for </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] bag like like real despair is like </connor>
<garnt> uncomfortable pissed off so many Duncan </garnt>
<connor> Rouleau fans don't you see these </connor>
<connor> characters like they're about to die </connor>
<connor> down it's like oh the [ __ ] gives a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yes cuz I feel like there are certain </garnt>
<garnt> levels cuz like everything though ever </garnt>
<garnt> the series that we've talked about is </garnt>
<garnt> just like it hits you I know I don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to say it but like it hits </garnt>
<connor> different </connor>
<connor> okay - a reason why you should watch </connor>
<connor> this if you'll like me I'm a person who </connor>
<connor> avoids these kind of shares like the why </connor>
<connor> cuz I cryed like anything I cry out like </connor>
<garnt> deku when he says anything in my ear </garnt>
<garnt> academic but my deku screams even like a </garnt>
<garnt> little bit I'm like I'm in tears I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know why it's like a human reaction I'll </garnt>
<garnt> cry of anything so I know means what </garnt>
<joey> shows that I can tell my brain often </joey>
<joey> yeah I don't want to have to get into </joey>
<joey> like oh [ __ ] sake I'm really scared now </joey>
<joey> I really just like what now that you've </joey>
<joey> said that I really want you to read like </joey>
<joey> any new a son no I know I know it's </joey>
<connor> gonna bruise it and that's why like I I </connor>
<connor> stay away from it but like please watch </connor>
<garnt> Bo Crowder you know it's if you're in </garnt>
<garnt> the right headspace for that kind of </garnt>
<garnt> show cause like you know you know when </garnt>
<garnt> you have like social barriers up and </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah you see something that's </garnt>
<joey> senior sad or something it's like it's </joey>
<joey> like yeah you feel sad you cry whatever </joey>
<joey> but there are some shows that you like </joey>
<connor> you don't know whether you want to cry </connor>
<garnt> or but or you lie down and just like </garnt>
<connor> disappear yeah yeah cuz there's plenty </connor>
<connor> of romance shows that like you've really </connor>
<connor> mmm </connor>
<garnt> left me kind of like very sad but it's a </garnt>
<garnt> different feeling like it's all </garnt>
<garnt> different field and week made me very </garnt>
<connor> sad a lot of the time so it's called </connor>
<connor> golden we go to time in time a golden </connor>
<garnt> time sorry yeah I'm an egg um III like </garnt>
<garnt> golden time alot maybe very sad you know </garnt>
<garnt> very upset a lot of time but like it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like it it's not I don't leave </garnt>
<connor> that feeling like oh man there's no hope </connor>
<connor> anymore III felt the same way when I </connor>
<connor> watch soccer osa as well because like </connor>
<connor> there are some coz like that seems like </connor>
<connor> all like oh yeah you know cute you know </connor>
<connor> kids in a room you know just yeah but </connor>
<connor> some of the back stories of some of </connor>
<connor> these characters I'm just like [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> describe [ __ ] man that's just it's a sad </connor>
<joey> dude but yeah as you said it's not like </joey>
<joey> it's sadness and despair are just two </joey>
<garnt> totally different emotions right cuz cuz </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like those kinds of shows </garnt>
<connor> where you know I used the oh it changed </connor>
<connor> my life kind of kind of which is really </connor>
<connor> corny when you say it yeah but it's just </connor>
<connor> one of those shows when you finish and </connor>
<connor> you just sit down and you just like </connor>
<connor> staring at a blank Warren you're like </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> it's that big scientist you can't even </connor>
<connor> like listen to the ending song so I </connor>
<connor> can't listen to being silenced right now </connor>
<connor> like I remember being very sad and </connor>
<connor> having a similar feeling watching Bojack </connor>
<joey> horseman and it taps in the same areas I </joey>
<joey> know you're laughing by the way last </joey>
<joey> last last time we recorded this I said </joey>
<joey> an analogy we're amazing Carano right to </joey>
<joey> sum it up to you if you're familiar with </joey>
<connor> Bojack horseman Bo Khurana is imagine if </connor>
<connor> Bojack horseman had 12 kids and they </connor>
<connor> were all equally as [ __ ] up as Bo </connor>
<connor> Jackson and then and then they all had </connor>
<connor> to get sacrificed and you slowly got to </connor>
<connor> hear the backstory of these fucked-up </connor>
<connor> Bojack horseman and the children it's so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up and it's it's it's like </connor>
<connor> different because in Bojack it's his own </connor>
<connor> fault right and yeah and it whatever </connor>
<joey> it's very very sad okay well it hits </joey>
<joey> this episode of trash taste is sponsored </joey>
<connor> by expressvpn Wow we've changed shirts </connor>
<connor> Jerry how amazing I'm here to tell you </connor>
<connor> today about expressvpn now I'm sure a </connor>
<connor> lot of your thinking </connor>
<connor> I caught up how you think of me to merge </connor>
<connor> the FBI can't see me and you'd be wrong </connor>
<garnt> in thinking well call me out like this </garnt>
<garnt> corner me wrong it doesn't save you </garnt>
<connor> only expressvpn can save you and your </connor>
<connor> browsing history as a lot of these </connor>
<connor> websites can still see your browsing </connor>
<connor> history or your internet service </connor>
<connor> provider can see what websites you're </connor>
<connor> visiting because of your IP address and </connor>
<connor> honestly that's why I never go online </connor>
<joey> without expressvpn also the good thing </joey>
<joey> about expressvpn is that you can bypass </joey>
<joey> geo restrictions so say for example I </joey>
<joey> want to go onto Netflix and watch I </joey>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<joey> Harry Potter but it's not available on </joey>
<joey> Japanese Netflix so what do I do </joey>
<joey> I tap on expressvpn i rerouted to the US </joey>
<joey> Netflix and boom there it is all of </joey>
<joey> Harry Potter because sometimes I don't </joey>
<joey> want to watch anything I want to watch </joey>
<garnt> some goddamn hair good thing is if it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't matter if you're on Verizon or </garnt>
<garnt> Comcast or whatever ISP you're on </garnt>
<garnt> expressvpn will hide all the information </garnt>
<garnt> and all the traffic that routes through </garnt>
<garnt> your router from them so even the ISPs </garnt>
<garnt> can't see your browsing history and the </garnt>
<garnt> thing is it runs so smoothly that most </garnt>
<garnt> of the time you don't even realize that </garnt>
<joey> you have expressvpn on and the best </joey>
<joey> thing is expressvpn is available on all </joey>
<joey> devices of </joey>
<joey> the computer mobile phones tablets you </joey>
<joey> name it so you can protect your online </joey>
<joey> internet safety today by using the </joey>
<joey> number one rated VPN service out there </joey>
<joey> by going to expressvpn comm / trash </joey>
<joey> taste to get three months free off of </joey>
<connor> your subscription that's expr ESS VPN </connor>
<connor> comm / trash taste yes I'm reading this </connor>
<joey> from my phone just in case I get the </joey>
<joey> spelling wrong expressvpn comm / trash </joey>
<joey> taste - line more links in the </joey>
<garnt> description below </garnt>
<garnt> back to the video cuz I think one other </garnt>
<garnt> series that I watched that just hit like </garnt>
<joey> really deep is this for like for episode </joey>
<joey> ova based on this novel called no longer </joey>
<joey> human which is like a classic Japanese I </joey>
<joey> all summer yeah yeah yeah that is like </joey>
<joey> it's probably one of the most harrowing </joey>
<connor> things that I've watched never heard </connor>
<connor> about that what is it rights what it's </connor>
<joey> written by this guy called docile summer </joey>
<garnt> who is consider like one of the three </garnt>
<garnt> greats okay traditional Japanese </garnt>
<connor> literature he was like a guy for the big </connor>
<garnt> three what's the story on this one um </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's been a while since I've </garnt>
<garnt> watched it but I'm not sure if it's his </garnt>
<joey> like water biography or if it's like </joey>
<joey> based on his life story but it's just </joey>
<joey> based on his life style okay so it's </joey>
<joey> just based on this life story about this </joey>
<joey> guy who just who just keeps taking </joey>
<connor> Elle's man like imagining four days take </connor>
<connor> imagine if you just take elves your </connor>
<connor> entire life and you're just looking for </connor>
<connor> that one win but no you just you just </connor>
<connor> you just keep taking LS your entire life </connor>
<connor> and it sounds like the Joker it's it's </connor>
<connor> this guy just gets more and more </connor>
<connor> depressed as his life goes on because - </connor>
<connor> it is based on his life story so like </connor>
<connor> this character it's someone who's like </connor>
<connor> clinically depressed you know and he's </connor>
<connor> so depressed that's you know he tries </connor>
<connor> taking his life multiple times I were </connor>
<connor> with with you know woman that he's been </connor>
<connor> with or just people that he finds and </connor>
<connor> then he just he just keeps living which </connor>
<connor> which is actually true like the author </connor>
<joey> tried committing suicide one or several </joey>
<joey> times and then he succeeded yeah he </joey>
<joey> actually succeeded so that's round </joey>
<joey> himself yeah so that's like the </joey>
<connor> headspace of the author who wrote this </connor>
<connor> and like it's like it's this the story's </connor>
<connor> like I can't wait so he died yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> he finished after finishing </joey>
<joey> this door that he finished this was the </joey>
<garnt> last novel here oh yeah yeah so it's </garnt>
<connor> just [ __ ] it's the most like it's </connor>
<connor> like one long suicide no then yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yes cuz it's just like a raw peek into </garnt>
<connor> the headspace of someone's is almost </connor>
<joey> depressing absolutely good that's a </joey>
<joey> really good piece yeah because like it's </joey>
<joey> it's it's just this it's just based on </joey>
<joey> his life story and all the shitty things </joey>
<joey> that happens to him and then it ends </joey>
<joey> with just you you think that you think </joey>
<joey> he's found like of this ray of hope </joey>
<joey> right you think he's he's fine his ray </joey>
<joey> of hope and then he just gets [ __ ] on </joey>
<connor> once again like imagine if someone has </connor>
<connor> stage 4 leukemia and then you just find </connor>
<connor> out he has AIDS as well and then he gets </connor>
<joey> kicked on and then you just kick on it </joey>
<connor> kick him while he was going yeah and </connor>
<joey> like how it ends is that he's like he's </joey>
<joey> like so like he he doesn't even think </joey>
<joey> that died like if he commits suicide </joey>
<joey> that's not even the right way to end it </joey>
<joey> it's called no longer human because he </joey>
<joey> feels like he's so he's so low that he </joey>
<joey> just doesn't he's no longer human </joey>
<joey> like he's no he's no longer is in this </joey>
<joey> human world and it is the most harrowing </joey>
<joey> thing I've used harrowing a lot because </joey>
<garnt> I don't know I don't know why I mean the </garnt>
<connor> only way to describe the tone I don't </connor>
<connor> know if you you're essentially reading </connor>
<connor> the default right yeah yeah that's that </connor>
<joey> sounds like yeah yeah it's it's brutal </joey>
<connor> it's the only way to describe it I mean </connor>
<connor> I I like those experiences but they are </connor>
<garnt> like you said over there you have to be </garnt>
<garnt> in the right headspace because I feel </garnt>
<garnt> like if you go into it like already like </garnt>
<joey> pretty [ __ ] up like you're not feeling </joey>
<joey> too great </joey>
<connor> it's yes talking to do great for your </connor>
<joey> mental I think I think the one problem </joey>
<joey> is well with no longer human and the </joey>
<joey> reason why probably not a lot of people </joey>
<joey> late know about it yeah is that not just </joey>
<garnt> because of its like subject matter but </garnt>
<garnt> just the fact that anime fans today know </garnt>
<garnt> does I or some movie for that one boom </garnt>
<garnt> go stray dogs character like a people </garnt>
<garnt> like oh does I yeah he was my husband Oh </garnt>
<connor> in bingo stray dogs not knowing that the </connor>
<connor> real does I was the most depressed </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] over in like all of Japanese </connor>
<connor> literature and he wrote some not just no </connor>
<connor> longer human but he writes a </connor>
<connor> amazing pieces of literature yeah just </connor>
<connor> because again he based it so much on his </connor>
<joey> real life in the fact that he was just </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] depressed as hell yeah and it's </connor>
<garnt> cause like I feel like you have to be in </garnt>
<garnt> the head space to write something that </garnt>
<garnt> powerful is that raw that just hits and </garnt>
<garnt> just cuts that deeply it's like an Edgar </garnt>
<joey> Allan Poe situation yeah yeah like you </joey>
<joey> can't write dark poetry like that unless </joey>
<connor> you had a [ __ ] up life growing up </connor>
<garnt> sorry sorry to bring a downer of this </garnt>
<connor> episode people watch bottom line is that </connor>
<joey> you know regardless of the fact that we </joey>
<connor> did like talk about a lot of light </connor>
<connor> depressing pieces of literature and </connor>
<connor> media like just because it like puts you </connor>
<connor> down at the end of the day it doesn't </connor>
<connor> mean it's something that people should </connor>
<connor> skip over I think that it's equally as </connor>
<connor> important to experience those kinds of </connor>
<connor> I'm anime and I like to do that so that </connor>
<connor> I'm comfortable with having those </connor>
<connor> emotions prop up sometimes right yeah </connor>
<connor> that I can I feel like I haven't be some </connor>
<connor> experience dealing with them maybe when </connor>
<connor> it's someone else is a lot easier but if </connor>
<garnt> you do get to that point where you are </garnt>
<garnt> starting to feel like that it's like </garnt>
<connor> okay I can I understand where this is </connor>
<garnt> coming from yeah yeah maybe I know </garnt>
<garnt> better how to processor </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like question to you guys going off </garnt>
<garnt> this then but it's a bit less depressing </garnt>
<garnt> has there been any shows or any anime in </garnt>
<connor> your in your history that has like </connor>
<connor> affected you in any way not just like </connor>
<connor> not just like in the negative aspect </connor>
<garnt> obviously or just rethinking I would </garnt>
<connor> just like black but I think me like the </connor>
<garnt> one as much as I hate to use the word </garnt>
<connor> change my life for me was like and this </connor>
<garnt> is gonna sound cliche as [ __ ] but </garnt>
<connor> Clannad was one I totally understand </connor>
<connor> when I laughed it comes from I know </connor>
<connor> there was a handful of people who </connor>
<connor> laughed at the same time right because </connor>
<connor> it's so cliche now to say that climate </connor>
<connor> change I play when I watch that like all </connor>
<connor> the way through it like straight up cuz </connor>
<connor> that was not a story [ __ ] me out that </connor>
<connor> was the first time that I'd like in not </connor>
<connor> just an enemy but in any piece of media </connor>
<connor> then I just [ __ ] broke </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah because especially that second </connor>
<connor> half of Clannad after story it was just </connor>
<connor> the most brutal power yeah those two the </connor>
<connor> longest build-up right and just I don't </connor>
<connor> think I'll be able to that's again like </connor>
<connor> going back like milling topics that's </connor>
<connor> another show I don't think I'll be able </connor>
<connor> to watch again </connor>
<connor> yeah just because again I'm not in that </connor>
<connor> headspace and it's just something it's </connor>
<connor> not just like the fact that it was just </connor>
<connor> a sad anime but I think it's just the </connor>
<connor> fact that again you've been kind of </connor>
<connor> following these characters lives all the </connor>
<connor> way through where like where as like </connor>
<connor> most you know visual novels or like </connor>
<connor> romance stories would end with the </connor>
<connor> couple getting together yeah why med </connor>
<connor> took that one step further and showed </connor>
<connor> you as the title says the after story </connor>
<connor> right of like what happens and I think </connor>
<connor> just seeing that made these characters </connor>
<connor> even more relatable to me and that was </connor>
<connor> the first time where I was like you know </connor>
<connor> what family family is cool man like </connor>
<connor> family's [ __ ] door like before that </connor>
<connor> family was just like a Christian man </connor>
<connor> like you know concept of like family was </connor>
<connor> just very much like everybody else was </connor>
<connor> like yeah of course family's cool like </connor>
<connor> yeah everyone wants a family </connor>
<connor> but like Clan that was that one show </connor>
<connor> that really dug into like just how </connor>
<connor> important family is and I think that </connor>
<connor> like I mean as weird as it is to say </connor>
<connor> after I watch Clannad I became way close </connor>
<connor> to my family and I think that's like a </connor>
<connor> be pretty wholesome that just it is </connor>
<joey> wholesome and I'm like and that like </joey>
<joey> really changed my life I feel really bad </joey>
<joey> now cuz you're talking about how can I </joey>
<garnt> change your life I couldn't [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> finish the first thing yeah and after </joey>
<garnt> saw yeah and I said oh the whole time </garnt>
<joey> I'm watching cloud I'm like when's it </joey>
<joey> gonna get good I am don't [ __ ] sing </joey>
<connor> that dango song I dare you to sing that </connor>
<connor> song cuz like I remember watching the </connor>
<connor> first eight episodes and I'm just like </connor>
<connor> this this is trying really hard it's </connor>
<joey> very boring yes but that's the problem </joey>
<connor> right is that like the thing was the </connor>
<connor> first season of Clan I never say to </connor>
<connor> people hey you should watch the first </connor>
<connor> season recliner yeah because I know that </connor>
<connor> on the grand scale of things the first </connor>
<connor> season [ __ ] appreciate the second season </connor>
<joey> that's the problem you can't jump into </joey>
<connor> off the story without having experienced </connor>
<connor> these characters yeah </connor>
<connor> and it is important because a lot of </connor>
<joey> these characters do make a very </joey>
<connor> significant impact in after story but I </connor>
<connor> guess you know it's really hard I guess </connor>
<connor> especially now like baby back then you </connor>
<connor> could make so much 25 episodes yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] to get a good payoff but now </joey>
<connor> you can't do that I just don't think you </connor>
<joey> can recommend dirty right because like </joey>
<joey> the the story structure and the joke </joey>
<joey> structures that help in it's just so </joey>
<joey> overdone now that laying down it just </joey>
<joey> seems like an aged version of everything </joey>
<joey> that you can see today but back when </joey>
<garnt> Klein I first came out in like 2009 I </garnt>
<garnt> believe yeah that's about 2007 mm what </garnt>
<connor> are you choosing me or the first season </connor>
<connor> I remember thinking like this is just </connor>
<connor> like shittier a school dynamic which is </connor>
<garnt> garbage do you just watch every high </garnt>
<garnt> school and a man just like yeah it's in </garnt>
<connor> high school yeah it's the same I like to </connor>
<connor> compare the high school animes since you </connor>
<joey> won't like dynamics they got going on </joey>
<joey> and see what all the uniform is </joey>
<joey> difference okay I like going off topic </joey>
<garnt> like I remember the first time I watched </garnt>
<garnt> Sarah from the end and I remember it was </garnt>
<joey> like it was like a show with a </joey>
<joey> post-apocalyptic show right about like </joey>
<joey> how vampires had taken over the world </joey>
<joey> yeah and then for like four episodes in </joey>
<joey> there's just a [ __ ] high school and </joey>
<garnt> I'm like well why is there a high school </garnt>
<garnt> that if there's one show that doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> need a high school dynamic [ __ ] this </garnt>
<connor> show I'm like guilty cuz like I'm like </connor>
<connor> the only guy I think you read is read </connor>
<connor> like all of that manga so far lizards </connor>
<joey> don't know I'm the complete opposite </joey>
<connor> guilty I've never consumed anything </connor>
<connor> about it which is so weird because for </connor>
<connor> the longest time I don't know if you </connor>
<connor> guys got these messages so many people </connor>
<connor> were asking me to make a video right </connor>
<connor> it's got a really big female fault yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah you notice I don't think </joey>
<joey> there's been a single an achiever that's </joey>
<connor> made a video on it cuz we use they're </connor>
<connor> all because they're all dudes you </connor>
<connor> females we have the first episode of </connor>
<garnt> zeref the end was like I wanted like the </garnt>
<connor> best first episodes yeah I remember for </connor>
<connor> a while the we'd had is such a good </connor>
<connor> first episode in the Rye not even the </connor>
<garnt> lines really good world ending Wars and </garnt>
<connor> then at Yale except high school </connor>
<garnt> it gets really good again when they </garnt>
<garnt> leave high school it does quickly </garnt>
<garnt> abandoned man I'd like to think that's </garnt>
<garnt> the artist the other author being like </garnt>
<connor> yes it got really good and I'd say well </connor>
<connor> like about two-thirds through the manga </connor>
<connor> because I hasn't finished yet but about </connor>
<connor> two-thirds for the manga artist right </connor>
<connor> now it gets amazing yeah and then it </connor>
<garnt> goes like not so good yeah cuz did the </garnt>
<garnt> manga deviate from the anime because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember watching all of the anime and </garnt>
<garnt> it's it was one of those shows where I </garnt>
<connor> had a good time watching it if I </connor>
<connor> remember correctly the manga was really </connor>
<connor> really similar to the show right and </connor>
<garnt> they build on a lot of the things that I </garnt>
<connor> thought were really interesting on the </connor>
<connor> show amazingly in the in the manga as it </connor>
<connor> goes on yeah but then it became really </connor>
<connor> weird and world ending what kind of like </connor>
<connor> trigger II Ryan it's yeah I don't really </connor>
<connor> like the main main like the final </connor>
<connor> villain that they have as well it's just </connor>
<connor> a fine it's fine </connor>
<garnt> it's is one of those shows where I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like I had a good time watching you I'm </garnt>
<garnt> not gonna really watch it I'm probably </garnt>
<joey> not gonna remember most would you </joey>
<joey> recommend people to read it or watch it </joey>
<connor> because I haven't done either yeah if </connor>
<connor> you I would say watch it and if you like </connor>
<joey> what you watched and continue onwards </joey>
<joey> okay I'm gonna probably enjoy it I think </joey>
<joey> yeah okay up to a certain point and then </joey>
<joey> you'll start to be like confused and </joey>
<joey> it's good there it's good I like how </joey>
<joey> they did a lot of things and like the </joey>
<connor> much Trump said in seventh I like how </connor>
<joey> they did things I like the things I did </joey>
<garnt> I totally get it because I actually </garnt>
<garnt> agree view like oh yeah it was good IIIi </garnt>
<connor> had a good time it's it's like it's like </connor>
<connor> the most six out of ten ever it's like </connor>
<connor> it's it's very decent and I have no </connor>
<connor> minimal complaints yeah there's not much </connor>
<connor> to it and you're just kind of like I'm </connor>
<connor> happy I'm happy with what happened I </connor>
<garnt> don't want anymore it was before I had </garnt>
<garnt> like five II sakai to watch every season </garnt>
<connor> but and this is took the space of that </connor>
<connor> when this came after right after the </connor>
<connor> hyper-v someone attack yeah yeah I </connor>
<connor> remember everyone was Hyper's fought for </connor>
<connor> this and yeah and </connor>
<connor> like so off even though I thought about </connor>
<garnt> the alley was pretty [ __ ] high </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just kind of just it just didn't </garnt>
<connor> take off and I don't know why that's it </connor>
<connor> right it is well because the anime had </connor>
<connor> like an amazing like fight scene it like </connor>
<connor> yeah like a like an orchestrated like </connor>
<connor> fight like they were hunting down these </connor>
<connor> vampires really cool episode and for </connor>
<joey> some reason that wasn't enough it's one </joey>
<joey> of those shows that weirdly like I hear </joey>
<garnt> some people talk about talk about but I </garnt>
<joey> don't really see anything about you know </joey>
<connor> what I mean yeah because I think people </connor>
<connor> who read it are really really into it </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's good I think the problem </garnt>
<connor> with it is that I just kind of liked its </connor>
<connor> own identity when it first aired because </connor>
<connor> I remember when it first night I think </connor>
<connor> like I made a joke that I was like oh </connor>
<garnt> it's like a taco and blue exes with gay </garnt>
<connor> vampires very much is like an </connor>
<garnt> amalgamation of a lot of different </garnt>
<garnt> aspects yeah yeah and the main character </garnt>
<garnt> is kind of annoying yeah that's true as </garnt>
<garnt> well that's never good it's annoying </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like I like all of this </garnt>
<garnt> we're getting a lot of this one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm just kind of wish would just be </garnt>
<connor> a little less like potent you know yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah there's a lot of shows like that </garnt>
<connor> there where I've read the manga after it </connor>
<connor> and no one really spoke about it and I </connor>
<joey> was like I don't really know I like a </joey>
<joey> certain black clover </joey>
<connor> like low I didn't repay man hey man </connor>
<joey> black clover is good I'm repping black </joey>
<garnt> go off for 40 minutes about it my monkey </garnt>
<connor> brains like taking over now some reason </connor>
<garnt> I always end up reading the manga that </garnt>
<connor> no one [ __ ] talks about or gives a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] about and I don't know why I think </connor>
<connor> cuz because I don't know anything I find </connor>
<connor> it more interesting because no one told </connor>
<joey> I'm definitely in that phase right now </joey>
<connor> yeah I'm just like I just want to find </connor>
<joey> the weirdest [ __ ] like unknown manga </joey>
<connor> and just like talk about okay like I </connor>
<joey> know that I know it's not unknown at all </joey>
<joey> but I read terraformers just because </joey>
<connor> like no one speaks about it and I </connor>
<connor> remember liking what I saw of the anime </connor>
<connor> which like is the anime adaptation was </connor>
<garnt> horrible or but I remember enjoying the </garnt>
<joey> concept so I went back and read all of </joey>
<joey> it I had a [ __ ] great time yeah their </joey>
<joey> form is also amazing you should </joey>
<joey> definitely read it if you get the chance </joey>
<connor> super gory terrifying cockroaches yeah </connor>
<garnt> great time really good if you've seen </garnt>
<garnt> the thumbnail that Connor is made about </garnt>
<garnt> his cockroach story that that's a </garnt>
<connor> terraform a [ __ ] well let me give you </connor>
<connor> like a 30-second pitch right on </connor>
<connor> terraform is sir.you these as an </connor>
<connor> expedition to Mars and as these </connor>
<connor> cockroaches </connor>
<connor> that are like absolute Giga Chad </connor>
<connor> Cochrane like the most but like Jim bro </connor>
<joey> cockroaches and then they want to bring </joey>
<connor> them back to earth to see why they're </connor>
<joey> like this who made these cockroaches </joey>
<garnt> like this because there must be </garnt>
<joey> something and then they then it turns </joey>
<garnt> out that yo these guys can fight and </garnt>
<garnt> then the humans get injected with an bug </garnt>
<connor> DNA insect DNA to become superhumans but </connor>
<connor> then they still keep getting destroyed </connor>
<connor> by the Giga Chad cockroaches and it's </connor>
<connor> just a great war it's a great time in </connor>
<connor> politics lots of game of throne politics </connor>
<connor> ask things involved yeah it's fantastic </connor>
<connor> lots of deaths yeah it's great because </connor>
<connor> you would think that a really </connor>
<joey> straightforward plot way it's about </joey>
<joey> action big cockroach fight big bug boy </joey>
<joey> yeah and but then it's just certainly </joey>
<joey> but then it really quickly why you you </joey>
<connor> big boy because you'll never feel as </connor>
<garnt> excited for learning one bug like cuz I </garnt>
<garnt> remember right I remember thinking when </garnt>
<garnt> I was in like high school the mantis </garnt>
<garnt> shrimp coolest bug in the world the </garnt>
<garnt> mantis shrimp is is that he's not the </garnt>
<joey> one that like pun they can punch it like </joey>
<joey> the speed of sound oh yeah it punches so </joey>
<garnt> hard that it can't be contained and </garnt>
<garnt> aquarium this thing is like like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then when they made like a </garnt>
<garnt> human formed with a mantis shrimp out he </garnt>
<connor> was our P but uh I've gone off topic but </connor>
<garnt> because I remember think you you read </garnt>
<connor> like a vide any chapters of this thing </connor>
<connor> thinking that it's just gonna be like </connor>
<connor> big man punch bug man like you down </connor>
<connor> Fripp then it quickly turns into like </connor>
<connor> the weight if f was trying to take over </connor>
<joey> Mars and get these samples there would </joey>
<joey> be a lot of [ __ ] up politics involved </joey>
<joey> with what your country is gonna want </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah and so it devolves into a </joey>
<joey> lot of that it's really [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> interests wall buildings done really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] super [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> I really recommend it sorry they've </joey>
<joey> turned from a 30-second pitch into a </joey>
<garnt> full discussion but there's a great </garnt>
<garnt> manga and if you if you like something </garnt>
<connor> like dance something like that yeah boy </connor>
<garnt> I feel right at home for you yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> think I've rented just after I read guns </garnt>
<connor> cuz I was looking for something very low </connor>
<connor> effect for that kind of yeah I was in </connor>
<garnt> the I was in like that edgy teenager </garnt>
<connor> phase </connor>
<garnt> I resisted living my edgy teenager face </garnt>
<connor> like six months ago I read yes I read </connor>
<garnt> terraformers like yo sometimes sometimes </garnt>
<connor> the edgy teenager phase like you never </connor>
<connor> grow out of it you know I I [ __ ] love </connor>
<connor> going back to my edgy teenager phase cuz </connor>
<connor> I I really want to reread Gant's as well </connor>
<connor> ganses [ __ ] great that's like that </connor>
<connor> defines what I was into as like as like </connor>
<joey> a late teen it's like really it's a sexy </joey>
<connor> girls cool yeah when he starts just like </connor>
<connor> okay this is scenic dance and like I </connor>
<garnt> guess we sure used to the normal </garnt>
<connor> dynamics in anime yeah rather like a hot </connor>
<garnt> girl turns up and he wants to have sex </garnt>
<connor> with her but then he actually just start </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] [ __ ] you know I'm like who </garnt>
<garnt> is this Chad like I've never seen such a </garnt>
<garnt> big child in animated Oh what the [ __ ] I </garnt>
<connor> was on the train reading this as well </connor>
<connor> there's a terrible manga to read on the </connor>
<joey> trains every time I flick the panel or </joey>
<joey> just be naked tits yeah it's so weird </joey>
<connor> that it's like not even remotely like a </connor>
<garnt> realistic depiction of it's so because </garnt>
<garnt> then suddenly she's obsessed with him </garnt>
<garnt> after it's yeah but the one thing that's </garnt>
<garnt> amazing about gansan and I could I would </garnt>
<connor> like to sell people on is one the </connor>
<connor> monster drawings and the same do not </connor>
<connor> want you do not want to watch the I know </connor>
<connor> what that's awfully good because Gantz </connor>
<connor> is like like peak mid-2000 gonzo CG it's </connor>
<connor> like you think CG today's bad watch </connor>
<garnt> watch Ganz and you just see how bad CG </garnt>
<joey> was back there so remember the I just </joey>
<garnt> absolutely just messed up CG of like </garnt>
<connor> even the opening is like let's see how </connor>
<joey> many times we can rotate this camera </joey>
<connor> heads we make everybody sick hopefully </connor>
<connor> have it on screen right now so you can </connor>
<garnt> suppose you'd saw everything was a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] banging oh that song was so good </garnt>
<joey> my rip slime a drip signed by every time </joey>
<joey> I watched it I was like I'm about to </joey>
<connor> throw up </connor>
<connor> it's so amazing if you enjoyed the good </connor>
<connor> parts of darling in the Franks like the </connor>
<connor> mystery and not knowing anything about </connor>
<connor> the world and wondering like oh my god </connor>
<connor> how does this all function yeah if you </connor>
<connor> like that aspect of world building your </connor>
<garnt> love dance yeah I was really impressed </garnt>
<garnt> by the world building in Gant's because </garnt>
<garnt> not not to spoil how it ends but like </garnt>
<connor> the actual ending of Gans itself was </connor>
<joey> like very very antique </joey>
<joey> questionable but the actual answers was </joey>
<connor> like that that kind of like that wasn't </connor>
<connor> kind of like that you know that big </connor>
<connor> brain like me felt like oh my god like </connor>
<connor> it it's [ __ ] great like it's one of </connor>
<connor> the few series that I've seen that has </connor>
<garnt> built up this huge mystery and has </garnt>
<garnt> delivered on it and has delivered on an </garnt>
<connor> answer though that like I said it's </connor>
<connor> satisfying the actual ending is not </connor>
<connor> great but the answers for the main </connor>
<garnt> mysteries were very satisfying </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and amazingly yeah the explanation </garnt>
<garnt> for all the stuff that was happening is </garnt>
<garnt> very cool yeah and I thought it's really </garnt>
<connor> interesting but there's also some stuff </connor>
<garnt> in the manga everybody's read it will </garnt>
<connor> know what I mean there's a part where </connor>
<connor> like a character does blackface and </connor>
<garnt> suddenly like - oh my god I completely </garnt>
<garnt> forgot six months ago and that's like a </garnt>
<garnt> scene where one of the characters goes </garnt>
<connor> to shoot up a thing in public goes to do </connor>
<connor> a public shooting that's oh my god now </connor>
<joey> though it's like really breathe at all </joey>
<connor> that is the most don't cancel </connor>
<connor> it's like the it's a normal Japanese guy </connor>
<garnt> and then he wears black face but then he </garnt>
<connor> just is drawn like an actual black guy </connor>
<connor> yeah and it's really really unkind yeah </connor>
<connor> yes you're like and then that was the </connor>
<connor> moment where I went online you like this </connor>
<joey> is anyone else realized how [ __ ] up it </joey>
<connor> and they immediately everyone was like </connor>
<joey> we you know it's good but we kind of </joey>
<connor> turnable </connor>
<garnt> it's the one thing that makes it really </garnt>
<connor> hard to recommend because it's a very </connor>
<garnt> interesting series and that does a lot </garnt>
<connor> of cool things but then it's really </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] like that part is like </connor>
<connor> yeah you could recommend it to edge </connor>
<garnt> people yeah yeah yeah it's just too much </garnt>
<garnt> it's just it's just like a example of </garnt>
<garnt> something that hasn't aged well because </garnt>
<garnt> I when I've read that as a kid I think </garnt>
<garnt> you know there's a lot of nuance that is </garnt>
<connor> lost a Japanese called yeah yeah it's </connor>
<connor> still even for Japanese standards is </connor>
<joey> pretty awful it was like when Gant's was </joey>
<joey> like serializing </joey>
<joey> it was very like lopsided in terms of </joey>
<connor> like is not I care if the Japanese </connor>
<connor> audience is concerned with it being </connor>
<garnt> racist yes like it's it's like it was </garnt>
<connor> like it's definitely the one giant stain </connor>
<joey> on like Gantz in general I think so </joey>
<joey> other than 3d CG that's a pretty damn </joey>
<joey> thing I mean that's just the stain </joey>
<joey> that's just like the [ __ ] stain on the </joey>
<connor> I'm a Hannah live-action movie didn't </connor>
<joey> they yeah but the live-action was not as </joey>
<connor> horrible as a lot of people thought it </connor>
<connor> was going to because I watched the live </connor>
<connor> action and I was like it wasn't amazing </connor>
<connor> late solid 5 out of tango but yeah </connor>
<connor> there's definitely a lot of like </connor>
<connor> questionable CG about it because of </connor>
<connor> course Japanese live-action is Lee right </connor>
<connor> but the way that they actually like did </connor>
<connor> the whole Gant's thing in the whole feel </connor>
<connor> of it the flag the whole like despair of </connor>
<connor> like oh [ __ ] this wall we don't know </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is having yeah it's not </joey>
<connor> really well in the live-action what do </connor>
<connor> you think is like the best live-action </connor>
<garnt> animated movie cuz that's hard one is </garnt>
<connor> for you </connor>
<joey> Gintama oh yeah a live-action I was I've </joey>
<garnt> never laughed that hard watching a live </garnt>
<garnt> action and late not even like I'm not </garnt>
<garnt> talking about like Dragonball Evolution </garnt>
<garnt> like ironic laughing like it's genuinely </garnt>
<garnt> funny thief it's genuine it brings out </garnt>
<connor> the Gintama spirit so [ __ ] well and I </connor>
<connor> don't know how the hell they did it </connor>
<connor> because you read a Mongol against i'ma </connor>
<connor> watch anime like in telling you like </connor>
<connor> there's no way this can be live-action </connor>
<connor> yeah no [ __ ] way Lee you can't </connor>
<connor> translate this comedy into live-action </connor>
<garnt> but they somehow did it lad to do it I'm </garnt>
<connor> like the casting was perfect the Cossack </connor>
<connor> your tricks I've no idea even the action </connor>
<connor> scenes because the second half of it </connor>
<connor> goes into like the first story arc of </connor>
<connor> Gandia yeah and concludes it and I'm </connor>
<connor> like wow this is actually like really </connor>
<connor> good CG really good choreography and </connor>
<joey> it's like very believable Gintama be </joey>
<connor> like I would watch that again that's how </connor>
<connor> good I was pleasantly surprised with the </connor>
<joey> Jojo part for maybe really it was like I </joey>
<connor> didn't like him yeah he was like fine I </connor>
<connor> didn't like some of the scenes that are </connor>
<garnt> pretty good I mean that's that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> the thing it was live-action anime </garnt>
<garnt> movies right the bar is so low that just </garnt>
<joey> yeah listen is it good </joey>
<garnt> it's all of these other [ __ ] morosely </garnt>
<garnt> being passable is like the best </garnt>
<garnt> compliment you can give an anime </garnt>
<garnt> live-action I remember watching the </garnt>
<connor> ghost in the shell' live action and I </connor>
<joey> remember how offensively average it was </joey>
<connor> yeah like it was like like like I </connor>
<garnt> couldn't form an opinion in there cuz </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like it's okay it's like it the </joey>
<joey> ghost in the shell' was really weird </joey>
<connor> because it's like if you watched it as a </connor>
<connor> ghost in the show live-action it was </connor>
<connor> like a four out of ten yeah but if you </connor>
<connor> just watched it it's like if you just </connor>
<garnt> thought like okay this is just a </garnt>
<garnt> standalone like sci-fi complex you know </garnt>
<garnt> I wish Aleta the battle angel was like </garnt>
<connor> really good and you told I forget that's </connor>
<garnt> a yeah I think that's one of the best </garnt>
<connor> that I like anime or manga movies we've </connor>
<joey> had really I mean it was the ending was </joey>
<connor> just whack but I mean everything up </connor>
<joey> until the ending for me Aleta was very </joey>
<joey> much like goes in the show whereas like </joey>
<connor> as I put it higher than ghosts in this </connor>
<joey> you have you read Aleta why I watch the </joey>
<joey> show he's read everything that's why </joey>
<joey> I've watched the movie right yeah I </joey>
<joey> guess I bet if I watch the manga I'd </joey>
<joey> like yeah very much like ghosts in the </joey>
<connor> show eat them hug haha but I read the </connor>
<connor> manga I'd appreciate but I'd like the </connor>
<connor> moan room if you it's like goes on the </connor>
<connor> show right like people who are fans of </connor>
<connor> ghosts on the show before there was live </connor>
<connor> action were like that was a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> adaptation of goes on the show yeah </connor>
<connor> Elite is the exact same as good as a </connor>
<joey> standalone movie but as an adaptation of </joey>
<connor> a leader it was pretty weak but at least </connor>
<connor> at least the Hollywood ones are better </connor>
<connor> than their Japanese being like Nazis I </connor>
<garnt> got invited by madman in Australia as </garnt>
<connor> you go to the cinemas on the date like </connor>
<connor> you can bring a plus-one so I brought my </connor>
<garnt> best friend quite a huge anime fan and </garnt>
<connor> we watched it and we just kind of sat </connor>
<joey> there as the credits were rolling and I </joey>
<joey> just looked around like how was that my </joey>
<joey> friends like I know you got me in for </joey>
<joey> free but I want my money I'm like you </joey>
<joey> know I kind of have to agree with you </joey>
<garnt> there man right no because I like my </garnt>
<garnt> cousin who I've been trying to get into </garnt>
<connor> an life like ages biggest Norma you can </connor>
<connor> kind of think of and then I was working </connor>
<connor> there </connor>
<connor> like I was like I was like recommitting </connor>
<connor> attack on Titan because that's like one </connor>
<connor> of the perfect game yeah yeah its attack </connor>
<connor> on Titan and then he [ __ ] ends up </connor>
<connor> watching the attack on Titan live-action </connor>
<connor> and he is like yeah that wasn't very </connor>
<joey> good I'm like why why oh you were almost </joey>
<connor> there you are this close and now like </connor>
<connor> now whenever I recommend attack when </connor>
<garnt> tight I'm like no no no trust me the </garnt>
<garnt> anime is so much better he's like oh </garnt>
<garnt> like is it the same story but like yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah hey my son no but there's this </joey>
<connor> character called Levi he wasn't in the </connor>
<connor> live-action because they couldn't </connor>
<connor> pronounce his name oh really the reason </connor>
<connor> why Levi is not in the live-action is </connor>
<connor> because they were like these are </connor>
<connor> Japanese actors I don't think they can </connor>
<connor> pronounce the V sound and I'm like you </connor>
<joey> don't realize this was written by a </joey>
<connor> Japanese oh yeah yeah people like that </connor>
<joey> the reason why microwaves come with </joey>
<joey> instructions they need a hand to hold </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] movie stay away from the </connor>
<connor> movies though I say from all our movies </connor>
<connor> I think the only one I should enjoy it </connor>
<garnt> is edge of tomorrow which I didn't have </garnt>
<joey> one was really good Tom Cruise Tom </joey>
<garnt> Cruise Tom Hanks out yeah I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> really cuz I didn't even realize that </garnt>
<joey> was based on a manga yeah all you need </joey>
<joey> is kill just like the edgiest title ever </joey>
<garnt> yeah all you need is kill all you can </garnt>
<joey> see it's actually based off a novel that </joey>
<connor> was later adapted into a manga that was </connor>
<connor> written by about the takishi Oh Oh </connor>
<garnt> straight for death night right right </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah which is also very good manga </garnt>
<garnt> well so when I saw cuz like I picked up </garnt>
<connor> the novel walls in Japan because I was </connor>
<connor> just like all you need to secure [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yeah dude that's awesome and I read it </garnt>
<garnt> and the novel is really good but then </garnt>
<connor> like when they were promoting in the </connor>
<connor> bookstore they were like Tom Cruise </connor>
<connor> movie coming out soon I was just like oh </connor>
<connor> no oh don't be one please please Tom </connor>
<connor> don't do this but of course I had to go </connor>
<connor> watch because I'm like alright this is </connor>
<joey> gonna be pretty it's probably gonna be </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] let's go watch it was like oh good </joey>
<joey> I'll give you this one Holly was good </joey>
<garnt> you didn't do it you do it was it was </garnt>
<connor> one of the few </connor>
<connor> I watched it and I was like oh I gotta </connor>
<joey> go read the source material now and it </joey>
<joey> was quite different from the source </joey>
<joey> material wasn't exactly the same but </joey>
<garnt> that's how you adapt a live-action movie </garnt>
<joey> in my opinion gonna change some things </joey>
<joey> if there is something that is just if </joey>
<garnt> there's a concept in a story that you </garnt>
<connor> know will never work in live-action </connor>
<garnt> don't put it in yeah it's so simple and </garnt>
<connor> yet there are so many [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> productions and directors who are like </connor>
<joey> oh we can do it yeah we definitely </joey>
<joey> assassination classroom giant yellow guy </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] man CG we'll fix that is a weird </connor>
<joey> adaptation I I don't know why but I've </joey>
<joey> slowly started to find myself like </joey>
<joey> watching live action anime movies why </joey>
<garnt> would you do this to your thing cuz it's </garnt>
<garnt> just gonna give me [ __ ] watching trashy </garnt>
<joey> secure huh it's just a guilty pleasure </joey>
<joey> for me now even if it's because I watch </joey>
<joey> the erase live-action as well and even </joey>
<connor> though I didn't like erased Len that was </connor>
<connor> on Netflix right yeah but purely just </connor>
<joey> because I was like oh it's it's just </joey>
<connor> it's it's the puffy example of curiosity </connor>
<connor> killed the cat right because it's like </connor>
<connor> I'm so curious to be like this how could </connor>
<joey> they possibly adapt this and then I go </joey>
<joey> into it I'm like amazing I just wasted </joey>
<joey> an hour and a half just some anime </joey>
<joey> adaptions you just know we're gonna be </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah there's some you watch for the </joey>
<joey> train wreck but not all of them like </joey>
<connor> oratio need to watch The Full Metal </connor>
<connor> Alchemist live-action I don't need to </connor>
<joey> watch that to know it's gonna be [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah that's the one I that's the one </joey>
<connor> thing I still haven't you know I'm gonna </connor>
<garnt> do guys alchemist isn't that good [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> you talk talks for Metallica miss sucks </connor>
<joey> what we guys on in the story yeah run </joey>
<connor> story it's just awful I mean the only </connor>
<connor> reason I watch The Death Note one is cuz </connor>
<connor> you know wow I know I wanted to be you </connor>
<connor> know able to help with the discussion on </connor>
<joey> Twitter and then oh yeah yeah yeah I </joey>
<joey> mean I got a great video out of it but </joey>
<connor> if you call it yeah exactly right you </connor>
<connor> can clown on it it's great cuz </connor>
<joey> everyone's gonna be waiting for it yeah </joey>
<joey> you can't clown the already strong </joey>
<garnt> because no one gives a [ __ ] well that's </garnt>
<joey> why I didn't make a video of you well I </joey>
<garnt> watch you while they sit down </garnt>
<joey> hi-y I mean I've done that I've done </joey>
<joey> that with more I think there are more </joey>
<joey> anime live actions that I haven't made a </joey>
<connor> video on than ones that I have made a </connor>
<connor> video on just because no one needs to </connor>
<connor> know this is [ __ ] I just need to know </connor>
<connor> this because everybody already knows </connor>
<connor> it's [ __ ] like I didn't have to make a </connor>
<connor> video on the parasite live action </connor>
<joey> because everybody knew was gonna be [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> but I needed to know that it was gonna </joey>
<joey> be [ __ ] and sure enough and I found out </joey>
<connor> that it was absolutely gone </connor>
<connor> you don't blows my mind that sometimes </connor>
<joey> they may only make the anime to promote </joey>
<joey> the garbage movie yeah like with </joey>
<connor> parasite one of those situations I know </connor>
<connor> Kaiji The Gambler one yeah that was </connor>
<joey> definitely that anime was just made to </joey>
<joey> promote the movie yeah yeah and the </joey>
<garnt> movie with Ali I actually like I enjoyed </garnt>
<garnt> the kaiju movie in this like really can </garnt>
<connor> peek on away you know I mean it's kind </connor>
<connor> of but in what world would you choose </connor>
<connor> the movie over the anime oh no </connor>
<garnt> absolutely not </garnt>
<connor> right because like watching watching the </connor>
<garnt> Kaiji live-action was kind of just </garnt>
<garnt> watching like some you know k drama or j </garnt>
<connor> drama so you want to show work ideas </connor>
<garnt> quickly so V yes so it's it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a gambling what it's a gambling story so </garnt>
<joey> this guy racks up this massive massive </joey>
<joey> debt I forgot what why he backed up this </joey>
<joey> massive debts oh come on why did her for </joey>
<joey> some reason yeah so so basically he gets </joey>
<joey> an offer from this like mysterious </joey>
<joey> company that can that can clear his debt </joey>
<joey> that just says you need to go on the </joey>
<joey> ship and you're gonna play a bunch of </joey>
<joey> games and you if you win these games </joey>
<joey> then we will clear your debts or you can </joey>
<joey> go into even greater depth yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> the basic premise is just Kaiji on the </joey>
<garnt> ship or just like after after the ship </garnt>
<garnt> Hawkes over it's just him going through </garnt>
<garnt> a bunch of different gambling games and </garnt>
<joey> just trying to clear his debts and and </joey>
<connor> he's not Opie so that's like the best </connor>
<joey> part yes genuinely he loses a lot very </joey>
<joey> much as he wears and it's great because </joey>
<joey> you generally don't know if he's gonna </joey>
<joey> lose a winner yeah it's a very quotable </joey>
<joey> job it's really a lot of watch it I </joey>
<garnt> think mainly because for some reason it </garnt>
<garnt> was only published in 480p really yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah he was only published yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> came out in 2000 </garnt>
<garnt> as well it was only 480p and I remember </garnt>
<connor> like when I was watching him like West </connor>
<connor> was what's this like so just know that </connor>
<connor> when you watch it it's gonna be like </connor>
<joey> that but it's definitely worth your time </joey>
<joey> I thought the reason why people didn't </joey>
<joey> watch car shows because of the art style </joey>
<connor> I think is that and I think um I think </connor>
<garnt> there's a ton of reasons why because </garnt>
<garnt> like it's got like zero female </garnt>
<garnt> characters in there I think yeah I can't </garnt>
<joey> remember a single - got a lot of ugly </joey>
<garnt> bastards that's cozy right imagine </garnt>
<connor> imagine an NCR plot but instead of sex </connor>
<connor> it's just watching a guy it's just </connor>
<connor> gambling </connor>
<garnt> it's just NCR gambling that's just crazy </garnt>
<connor> okay but it's [ __ ] great so good I'm </connor>
<joey> going from watching Kaiji to I don't </joey>
<joey> know how you pronounce it caca guru it </joey>
<garnt> was like how can I watch this [ __ ] when </garnt>
<garnt> this gambling is so fake </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah yeah it's all just [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> gambling to serve the plot so I was in </connor>
<joey> Chi Chi it felt like real gamble it was </joey>
<joey> just like this through if they were like </joey>
<joey> okay how do we make these hot girls </joey>
<connor> orgasm yeah gambling let's just throw it </connor>
<connor> like the main character always wins </connor>
<connor> unless it doesn't really matter then she </connor>
<connor> doesn't win and it's like haha you </connor>
<connor> didn't expect well that's like yeah but </connor>
<joey> it didn't matter </joey>
<joey> like yeah exactly it's like like there </joey>
<connor> was a one dumb moment that's apart I </connor>
<connor> dropped the series when the girl with </connor>
<connor> the gun playing Russian roulette and </connor>
<connor> it's like it's obvious no one is going </connor>
<connor> to die in this situation don't pretend </connor>
<connor> like someone is going to die because I'm </connor>
<connor> not stupid </connor>
<connor> yeah and then I couldn't watch it </connor>
<connor> further somebody this is just dumb </connor>
<joey> whereas if that wasn't IG well it's like </joey>
<connor> someone's gonna die yeah which is great </connor>
<connor> because but then it wasn't sure maybe </connor>
<connor> both of them could die we don't here </connor>
<connor> that's the best part about Chi Chi is </connor>
<connor> that like you just genuinely don't know </connor>
<joey> the melodic IG is the narrator's voice </joey>
<connor> oh yeah why is that why is that just </connor>
<joey> that narrator in like every [ __ ] show </joey>
<joey> of that time because you know epic I </joey>
<connor> lost I already see it's an anime you </connor>
<garnt> know you eating like you know watch you </garnt>
<garnt> this Netflix show this narrator comes </garnt>
<connor> out you know a nude what's the follow-up </connor>
<garnt> series the spin-off one with the middle </garnt>
<garnt> management whatever tonegawa </garnt>
<connor> it's very it's quite funny it's if you </connor>
<connor> go in expecting kaity you're gonna be </connor>
<garnt> very disappointed yes if you want if you </garnt>
<garnt> want kaisi then you it's better if you </garnt>
<garnt> read lie </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know the author's name but like </garnt>
<joey> read some of his other works akagi's </joey>
<joey> really good a car key I really like a </joey>
<connor> car key was a car keys basically mahjong </connor>
<connor> chi-ji yeah I'm like here's the thing I </connor>
<connor> had no [ __ ] interest in mahjong I was </connor>
<connor> watching the show I had no [ __ ] rules </connor>
<connor> of the I had no [ __ ] clue of the </connor>
<joey> rules mahjong either yeah when you get </joey>
<connor> drawn in right after I finish I'll call </connor>
<connor> girls like me exact same thing I don't </connor>
<connor> know which show was use little girls </connor>
<joey> competing in mahjongg tournaments I </joey>
<joey> don't know which I think it was Mac </joey>
<joey> might have just been called mahjong no I </joey>
<joey> don't know what it Wallace I remember I </joey>
<connor> was trying my god damn pass to learn </connor>
<joey> mahjong and I was like I I mean like you </joey>
<joey> know mas comes in like a lion made me </joey>
<connor> really invested in shogi I was like yeah </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the [ __ ] shogi is but </connor>
<connor> then after I watch much comes on like I </connor>
<connor> want to learn show I mean show uses </connor>
<connor> Japanese chess er I don't even know how </connor>
<connor> to play chess and yet I was like sure </connor>
<connor> you look boy I'd play chess Jerri </connor>
<joey> because I just did it Wow we didn't even </joey>
<connor> own like a chess board my house you know </connor>
<connor> to play chess right yeah I know the </connor>
<garnt> basics that's good [ __ ] sock it if </garnt>
<connor> I'm playing weight a chess anime but of </connor>
<connor> seekers no because I I actually really </connor>
<garnt> want a chess on amigo chance you'd be so </garnt>
<joey> good a Nana might be so [ __ ] - I'm </joey>
<joey> surprised there hasn't been one year </joey>
<garnt> because like how big is chair how big is </garnt>
<garnt> chess in Japan isn't it's not very big I </garnt>
<joey> mean I guess if you're gonna play chess </joey>
<garnt> you know it's there's plenty of knocks I </garnt>
<connor> think a lot of the grandmasters are from </connor>
<garnt> Japan oh yeah that's true actually but </garnt>
<connor> like yeah I feel like chess because I </connor>
<connor> remember I go like sucked into this </connor>
<connor> YouTube hole of just like watching a lot </connor>
<connor> of chess I had no interest in chess I'm </connor>
<connor> like wow this is actually like really </connor>
<connor> interesting cuz the history and just the </connor>
<connor> entire premise of the chess is like </connor>
<connor> really really interesting the fact that </connor>
<connor> you'd like a lot of history yeah like </connor>
<connor> like off plate like it's basically like </connor>
<connor> this massive tournement hog you know </connor>
<connor> enemies times there's like reading about </connor>
<connor> some of like some like the most </connor>
<connor> historical chess games it was like it's </connor>
<connor> like I have no interest in chess but </connor>
<connor> this was [ __ ] hype and I was I </connor>
<connor> remember thinking man listen works so </connor>
<connor> well in an anime or manga setting so I </connor>
<garnt> went out to try and find a single chess </garnt>
<garnt> anime or manga and there just wasn't one </garnt>
<garnt> and all right I was really really </garnt>
<joey> disappointed it's it's surprising </joey>
<joey> honestly because like I think the whole </joey>
<joey> state </joey>
<joey> with chess in anime is like you know the </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] like transfer student who </joey>
<joey> also happens to be like the daughter of </joey>
<garnt> like the German company like the way </garnt>
<connor> chess is used in anime is to make </connor>
<connor> someone look smart yeah like there's no </connor>
<connor> reason for a leash to play chess you </connor>
<connor> ever lead with the king corner for </connor>
<garnt> example do it you wanna tell people </garnt>
<connor> about your hidden like [ __ ] that </connor>
<connor> yellow chess champion sir why is 13 no </connor>
<connor> 12 I just started high schools after I </connor>
<connor> left primary school I was playing </connor>
<connor> professional chess yeah and like parama </connor>
<connor> I like how I ended up in playing </connor>
<connor> professional chess is we had to begin </connor>
<connor> with because I never like played it much </connor>
<connor> I just liked video games along yeah so </connor>
<connor> video it was the only video game that my </connor>
<connor> dad would play with me yes yeah no </connor>
<connor> normal chess right but like I remember I </connor>
<connor> was playing it like year three how old </connor>
<garnt> you in year three in the UK like eight </garnt>
<garnt> nine eight nine and the chess club is </garnt>
<garnt> only for the like the last year which </garnt>
<garnt> was like all the 12 year olds yeah and I </garnt>
<garnt> remember they wouldn't let me play with </garnt>
<garnt> them but one they let me play with them </garnt>
<connor> and this is so anime right because yeah </connor>
<connor> because after outside of the Chess Club </connor>
<connor> I'd beat their best player in a game of </connor>
<connor> chess right and then they'd like no no </connor>
<connor> you gotta let this guy play with us yes </connor>
<connor> and so I beat them all and then I </connor>
<garnt> nothing happened for like three years </garnt>
<connor> until is my time to join the Chess Club </connor>
<connor> and I was allowed to join the tribe yeah </connor>
<garnt> and then I was let I joined the Chess </garnt>
<garnt> Club and our school had lost like every </garnt>
<connor> single chess tournament ever right </connor>
<garnt> because yeah it was like a local I don't </garnt>
<connor> even know we had this there's like a </connor>
<connor> local circuit right between all the </connor>
<connor> schools played each other like football </connor>
<connor> and yeah the other sport right yeah </connor>
<connor> there's one for chess and uh I remember </connor>
<connor> that we started playing in that and also </connor>
<connor> the guy who is number two in our </connor>
<connor> testings I have number one we were both </connor>
<joey> like equal yeah which is also very </joey>
<garnt> animated everything on par with mine my </garnt>
<joey> whole chess like experience its genuine </joey>
<garnt> like an anime I'm gonna keep talking on </garnt>
<garnt> there's more stuff to it yeah and then </garnt>
<garnt> we just started like winning everything </garnt>
<garnt> like against every other school like it </garnt>
<connor> wasn't even close I remember like these </connor>
<connor> kids were bad and I remember every time </connor>
<connor> they were like wait they would be like </connor>
<connor> shocked at how quickly we would beat </connor>
<connor> these kids yes yeah it's very different </connor>
<connor> a professional chance to playing it </connor>
<connor> somebody doesn't in professional chess </connor>
<connor> it's it's a long thing and I'll get more </connor>
<connor> into it later but and and these were </connor>
<connor> games I could win in 20 minutes all </connor>
<connor> right like I could see how they [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> up and I would take it and I to me it </connor>
<connor> just made sense right I didn't practice </connor>
<connor> I was just good at games and it made </connor>
<connor> sense and then one time there was a </connor>
<connor> school and these guys have been like </connor>
<connor> number one for like ten years in a row </connor>
<connor> or something because they had a guy who </connor>
<connor> was someone's parent and he's obsessed </connor>
<connor> with chess knows like he's very very </connor>
<connor> good chess and we beat his team and they </connor>
<connor> were like shocked they were like nany </connor>
<garnt> you beat like the prodigy like this is </garnt>
<joey> like a sports anime this is a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Sports anime good bass a chess Mong off </joey>
<connor> of your wife I remember thinking like it </connor>
<connor> was weird because this guy was making </connor>
<connor> like a whole come up bear mine I was </connor>
<connor> like 12 I don't know what the [ __ ] was </connor>
<connor> going on and this guy's making like a </connor>
<garnt> whole commotion he was like shocked and </garnt>
<garnt> I was sitting then he was like walking </garnt>
<garnt> me through everything you did and I was </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't know I didn't write it down </garnt>
<garnt> cuz know she's gonna write it down </garnt>
<garnt> national chess and he was running it </garnt>
<garnt> down and I thought that was weird </garnt>
<garnt> and I said why would you write down your </garnt>
<garnt> moves you did you did them yeah you're </garnt>
<garnt> not gonna go back and he was like which </garnt>
<connor> one which moved why did you move here </connor>
<connor> how did you know how to do that and </connor>
<connor> stuff and I was like I don't know I just </connor>
<connor> like did it yeah and then he spoke to my </connor>
<connor> mom and was like you should come to this </connor>
<connor> thing yeah it's like it's weird it's </connor>
<connor> like 200 kids come to a place yeah by </connor>
<connor> the way chess for like kids is a really </connor>
<connor> weird kind of thing that's it's really </connor>
<connor> it's just adults pushing a bunch of like </connor>
<connor> young bridge kids yeah so I went to a </connor>
<connor> location and there was like two three </connor>
<connor> hundred kids all just playing chess then </connor>
<garnt> you would get like an opponent and if </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna lost you would then play </garnt>
<connor> someone who is like one yeah and the </connor>
<garnt> more you kept winning the more you would </garnt>
<connor> go up and then eventually people who won </connor>
<connor> all their games go on to play for like </connor>
<connor> the area is the best horn Hawkeye was </connor>
<connor> killing all my games right and I had won </connor>
<connor> like four X you play 7-iron by won four </connor>
<joey> in a row they were really easy my friend </joey>
<joey> is well he'd lost like two and then he </joey>
<connor> was already out </connor>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<garnt> see you in the finals like it's weird </garnt>
<connor> because I never had any like a lot of </connor>
<connor> these kids as well they would be </connor>
<connor> studying it in between games but I would </connor>
<connor> just whip out like Pokemon and start </connor>
<connor> playing it yeah oh it's my time to go </connor>
<connor> and save play but I remember said like </connor>
<connor> my 5th game was against the guy I beat </connor>
<connor> in my school my prodigy team whatever </connor>
<connor> yeah and I took play him again and we </connor>
<connor> drew it was really like anticlimactic I </connor>
<connor> was like [ __ ] I beat him last time I </connor>
<connor> want to beat him again anyway I got on </connor>
<connor> the team and I was ok I was struggling </connor>
<connor> cuz this is where it was getting really </connor>
<connor> serious like I was decent enough where I </connor>
<connor> could win like 70% of my games but it </connor>
<connor> was still starting to get like really </connor>
<connor> long cuz chess games never went more </connor>
<connor> than an hour yeah and then they start </connor>
<garnt> becoming like two hours yeah and I'm 13 </garnt>
<connor> I'm like this is Tana taken I just want </connor>
<garnt> to play [ __ ] but I start winning and </garnt>
<garnt> then I got content they're like hey do </garnt>
<garnt> you want to play for your country and I </garnt>
<garnt> was like sure I guess I'll play for my </garnt>
<connor> country why not yeah I'm doing good </connor>
<connor> enough so I turn up I go to the first </connor>
<connor> tournament you won't believe because I </connor>
<connor> was number 10 so there's 10 seats right </connor>
<connor> yeah one is the best 10th was so I was I </connor>
<connor> was the worst on their country what's </connor>
<connor> the country 13 yeah yeah guess who was </connor>
<connor> number one </connor>
<connor> I think I've told you guys this yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah it was like the main bully at my </garnt>
<garnt> school called make this [ __ ] or not it </garnt>
<connor> was like the main bully at my school who </connor>
<joey> like no one knew he did this he pointed </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] we're like the flash back he was </joey>
<connor> the main rival </connor>
<connor> literally was the kid that everyone was </connor>
<garnt> scared of and I remember thinking like </garnt>
<connor> man he was really good at halo wars mm </connor>
<garnt> that was weird right and then then </garnt>
<connor> suddenly like he's really [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> at chess he's amazing and he was winning </connor>
<connor> a law against like uh like really really </connor>
<connor> wicked good players bare mind when it </connor>
<garnt> got to this point </garnt>
<garnt> it was pretty much me him and eight kids </garnt>
<garnt> who are gonna go to Cambridge know what </garnt>
<garnt> I mean the environment was really weird </garnt>
<garnt> as well and I remember just that was </garnt>
<garnt> when I really started to not enjoy chess </garnt>
<garnt> anymore is that when I remember woman </garnt>
<garnt> when I lost a game </garnt>
<garnt> I got [ __ ] bollocks by [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> the coaches they were furious at me </garnt>
<garnt> because they would take your sheep right </garnt>
<garnt> when you had to start riding at them </garnt>
<joey> yeah they would take your sheet and they </joey>
<connor> would rinse you for your moves </connor>
<garnt> they wouldn't they would watch you the </garnt>
<connor> whole game so that's like always an area </connor>
<connor> of path where they can watch you yeah </connor>
<connor> like a god </connor>
<connor> and I remember if you made a move that </connor>
<connor> was under five minutes that was a </connor>
<connor> mistake </connor>
<connor> you got [ __ ] rinsed Frisch's they </connor>
<connor> were like you didn't you didn't think </connor>
<connor> long enough I've got to go through the </connor>
<connor> options cuz it gets to the point where </connor>
<garnt> you're like you know that they're </garnt>
<garnt> thinking just as many moves ahead as you </garnt>
<garnt> are yes I just get really difficult </garnt>
<garnt> you're like [ __ ] like I haven't studied </garnt>
<connor> enough at this point because I never </connor>
<connor> studied chess yeah but this is where I </connor>
<connor> was getting to the point where I was </connor>
<connor> against people who are naturally pretty </connor>
<connor> good but also was studying all the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] time </connor>
<connor> yeah alright and it's just a really bad </connor>
<connor> environment I really didn't like it it </connor>
<connor> was just like like where I would finish </connor>
<connor> my games and I play pokemon they would </connor>
<connor> want to talk about so why did you move </connor>
<connor> rook to you know f2 you know why did you </connor>
<connor> do that did he was really impressive </connor>
<connor> when he moved his guys I was like my </connor>
<connor> turn </connor>
<joey> we are playing chess for eight hours </joey>
<joey> today I do not want to talk about Jesse </joey>
<joey> just yeah it was really weird </joey>
<garnt> environment and I could I think if I </garnt>
<garnt> came into chess later in my life I would </garnt>
<garnt> have had a more healthy enjoyment of </garnt>
<garnt> chess yeah I still like to play it </garnt>
<garnt> occasionally but I think I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> scarred from yeah the anime experience </garnt>
<garnt> that I had yes was like that's what I </garnt>
<garnt> found to find so fascinating about chess </garnt>
<garnt> is just like like here like talk talking </garnt>
<connor> to you hear your chest doing like hear </connor>
<connor> it like reading up and watching like </connor>
<connor> Magnus Carlson's I think yeah his </connor>
<connor> stories and and how you were just like </connor>
<connor> you were just born and you just got the </connor>
<connor> game there like there are people who </connor>
<connor> just studied the game yeah and then </connor>
<connor> there are just people who just like a </connor>
<connor> genius is it and they don't know why </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's it's like it's [ __ ] family </garnt>
<connor> horn blows it's [ __ ] fascinating </connor>
<connor> it's it was weird because you kind of </connor>
<connor> like no matter how good you aren't </connor>
<connor> something and like how much raw talent </connor>
<connor> you have it's something when you start </connor>
<connor> competing at such a high level you start </connor>
<garnt> to realize that like it doesn't matter </garnt>
<garnt> as much but also you meet people who </garnt>
<garnt> also like yeah you know there might be </garnt>
<garnt> like ten people in that country you also </garnt>
<garnt> have that same raw talent yeah right and </garnt>
<garnt> then it's like [ __ ] yeah cuz then it </garnt>
<garnt> starts to come it's like who can put </garnt>
<garnt> them cuz I didn't care about chess I </garnt>
<joey> never cared about chess I was good at it </joey>
<connor> and I just played it because such a </connor>
<connor> thing that our protagonist </connor>
<connor> where where is the protagonist were to </connor>
<garnt> go to my point lost and then been like </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna dedicate my life dude I was </connor>
<garnt> like Pokemon Ranger just came spinning </garnt>
<joey> it was just kind of like it gets to that </joey>
<joey> point when your life or you're like I </joey>
<joey> just I don't need this anymore and I and </joey>
<joey> I remember my parents are so sad because </joey>
<connor> I mean I don't know why my parents were </connor>
<connor> so invested and I think that it was a </connor>
<connor> mixture of proud and also they love </connor>
<garnt> bragging about it of course your series </garnt>
<garnt> got canceled for failure at a spinoff </garnt>
<connor> right so what happened is about when I </connor>
<connor> was like 15 16 or 17 I had like a </connor>
<connor> rejuvenation of my mind enjoyment </connor>
<connor> remember a website called MLG game </connor>
<garnt> battles remember that I remember that </garnt>
<garnt> there's where you could like compete </garnt>
<garnt> against carpet jiya hooch s I remember I </garnt>
<garnt> would compete against like fully grown </garnt>
<garnt> men and beat them on Yahoo chastened </garnt>
<garnt> gets her pissed off and then I I joined </garnt>
<connor> the local pub and that was a weird </connor>
<connor> experience so I joined the local pub </connor>
<garnt> chess team and I remember Behrman they </garnt>
<garnt> were all like 80 to 40 year old men yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I never won one time I was playing </garnt>
<connor> against a guy who looked like Ross Kemp </connor>
<connor> like the baby's like a skinhead </connor>
<connor> terrifying dude like he's like this over </connor>
<garnt> the table like a brick [ __ ] every </garnt>
<connor> every bouncer you see at a nightclub and </connor>
<connor> I'm like well I'm like like 15 16 like </connor>
<connor> this with my coke and he had like a pint </connor>
<connor> and like smoking like coke like Casey </connor>
<connor> checking my phone I don't know if that </connor>
<connor> that pissed him off but in between moves </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't look at what he was doing I </connor>
<connor> would just check my phone and I was like </connor>
<connor> because I'm normally thinking in my move </connor>
<connor> so I don't really pay much attention </connor>
<connor> yeah and I remember when I beat him and </connor>
<connor> he looked really [ __ ] angry I was so </connor>
<garnt> scared </garnt>
<garnt> I was like believe you've done this </garnt>
<connor> people people didn't like losing to a 15 </connor>
<garnt> year old battle for the law I mean yeah </garnt>
<joey> I can understand I'm just really </joey>
<joey> committed to making this a manga Nelly </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah please cuz like from a narrative </garnt>
<garnt> perspective there's so many interesting </garnt>
<garnt> ways you could tackle just </garnt>
<joey> yes how come I want to take like that </joey>
<connor> concept of like you know your friend </connor>
<connor> being beaten in the preliminary just cut </connor>
<connor> to the scene where you're like in the </connor>
<connor> final and your friend is like that one </connor>
<connor> guy on Perseus just goes on with this is </connor>
<garnt> gonna sad so nerdy that's one move and </garnt>
<garnt> chest that I always wanted to use I was </garnt>
<garnt> the icon I don't know the name of it but </garnt>
<garnt> it was the one where like if someone </garnt>
<connor> moves they're like porn - and then like </connor>
<connor> in front of if you move your pawn - yeah </connor>
<connor> and they move it - as well that you can </connor>
<joey> then take it yeah dude </joey>
<connor> using a rook is a castling a zopi and </connor>
<garnt> you always castle that's all I remember </garnt>
<joey> like why do you console there's like </joey>
<connor> I'll tell you why I don't know because I </connor>
<garnt> remember they try to teach us they're </garnt>
<connor> like why don't he use the Indian prince </connor>
<connor> opening of 1970 I was like yes they </connor>
<garnt> would they would when I would do an </garnt>
<connor> opening move mmm I always did the same </connor>
<connor> opening moves I just liked it it was </connor>
<connor> like yeah nice and central reactant and </connor>
<connor> they would they would always say why did </connor>
<connor> you use that this person like yeah like </connor>
<connor> I said like the Indian prince move of </connor>
<garnt> 1764 yeah I was like I just like how the </garnt>
<garnt> bishop ghost just feels nice you know I </garnt>
<garnt> just feel it don't you explain it when </garnt>
<garnt> you're a kid cuz you're just like you're </garnt>
<connor> just thinking four moves heading you're </connor>
<connor> like if this goes here and this goes </connor>
<connor> here and this goes here then you go that </connor>
<connor> you know I mean I just it's like any any </connor>
<connor> sport I imagine where kids are really </connor>
<connor> good at it </connor>
<connor> yeah adults are really pushy and kind of </connor>
<connor> like almost borderline some of the kids </connor>
<connor> I'd say they'd like a predatory </connor>
<connor> relationship with it yeah yeah because a </connor>
<connor> lot of them again like I said there they </connor>
<connor> were very rich parents whose kids went </connor>
<garnt> to very good private schools and they </garnt>
<garnt> were destined to go to Cambridge or </garnt>
<garnt> Oxford no matter what and they would you </garnt>
<garnt> know exactly what I mean what kind of </garnt>
<garnt> kids I'm talking about yeah you spoke to </garnt>
<garnt> them you're like we're from a different </garnt>
<connor> world </connor>
<joey> it's really awesome yes despite their </joey>
<connor> entire wall to them yeah it was like </connor>
<connor> something that was forced upon them </connor>
<garnt> because it was you know it's something </garnt>
<garnt> that looks good on the resume when right </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah yeah I'm very like yeah I mean </garnt>
<garnt> to be fair it got me a few good jobs or </garnt>
<connor> helped a lot I remember some job </connor>
<connor> interviews where they </connor>
<connor> playing chess and they would bring it up </connor>
<connor> and it was like oh that's cute you're </connor>
<connor> good that's already you know I think </connor>
<connor> that's like a really interesting story </connor>
<garnt> that you have yeah bottom line we need </garnt>
<joey> to turn this into an anime yeah if </joey>
<joey> someone was like I want to like make a </joey>
<joey> chess anime I would absolutely find out </joey>
<garnt> just like talk dr. Khanna has a very </garnt>
<joey> interesting story </joey>
<joey> three stories race because like it's </joey>
<garnt> just it's the perfect chance to like </garnt>
<garnt> teach people about how to play chess as </garnt>
<connor> well I think it's a really good game and </connor>
<connor> it's one of my favorite things to like </connor>
<connor> sit down and talk to someone about just </connor>
<connor> talk and then VHS yeah it's a really </connor>
<connor> good way to and I just have exactly and </connor>
<joey> that's also fun beating people who think </joey>
<joey> that good a chance you'll meet people </joey>
<joey> who have just been like studying chess I </joey>
<connor> mean it's getting really big on twitch </connor>
<garnt> right now yeah exactly white people who </garnt>
<connor> are like you know they're like really </connor>
<garnt> getting into it yeah and just like Tom </garnt>
<garnt> Thumb yeah it's like well you cuz okay </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing right here's the worst </garnt>
<garnt> part about chess professionally is that </garnt>
<garnt> you normally know like five or six moves </garnt>
<garnt> in if you've lost or not but I have to </garnt>
<garnt> play it for another two and a half hours </garnt>
<joey> and all it is the difference between </joey>
<connor> casual chat and professional chess is </connor>
<connor> the casually you always think you could </connor>
<connor> win if you outsmart them yeah personal </connor>
<connor> chess it's just like how do I drag this </connor>
<joey> out enough so that maybe they'll make a </joey>
<connor> mistake yeah yeah that's all God is </connor>
<garnt> horrible it was awful I hated it cuz </garnt>
<garnt> they just got to the point right like </garnt>
<joey> what's the [ __ ] point in this it's </joey>
<joey> like been control online it's just I'm </joey>
<joey> just I'm literally just being awkward </joey>
<joey> yeah you just go along in the inevitable </joey>
<connor> right yeah yeah and it's like I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> up I [ __ ] up thirty minutes in I'm not </connor>
<garnt> gonna put up with this but you know it's </garnt>
<connor> like loading a game of League and then </connor>
<connor> five minutes in like your own sighting </connor>
<connor> is someone sensing the jungle is just </connor>
<connor> afk are you like can I just can I just </connor>
<connor> can I just F F now we just F F like is </connor>
<garnt> this is like a diamond like a diamond </garnt>
<connor> game right now I know no one's gonna </connor>
<connor> make a mistake you know I never got </connor>
<connor> praised for winning games they would </connor>
<garnt> always be like good job </garnt>
<garnt> you know when they would praise me when </garnt>
<garnt> I made it [ __ ] hell for the other </garnt>
<garnt> person </garnt>
<garnt> when I this poor girl I I dragged it out </garnt>
<garnt> and she made a mistake to a stalemate </garnt>
<garnt> Barrett this game went on for like three </garnt>
<garnt> hours and 20 minutes or so it was </garnt>
<connor> something [ __ ] long and I remember </connor>
<connor> I'd lost like an hour in a hundred </connor>
<connor> percent yeah and I just made it awkward </connor>
<connor> I wasn't playing to win anymore I was </connor>
<connor> playing to make it awkward for her yeah </connor>
<connor> and so I did things that you wouldn't </connor>
<connor> normally do to try and win would you do </connor>
<connor> it to cock-block everything still annoy </connor>
<joey> them but she was getting so stressed and </joey>
<connor> I remember being like this is kind of </connor>
<connor> fun but also like I hate this whole </connor>
<connor> jurors when I got back it was like </connor>
<connor> coming back into the football locker </connor>
<garnt> room nice way to hell for that thirteen </garnt>
<garnt> year old girl like I was just like man I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't feel good okay I just like a </garnt>
<garnt> stalemate like yeah yeah I worked three </garnt>
<garnt> hours for a stale man like are you </garnt>
<connor> kidding me absolute ease yeah there's </connor>
<connor> this other worse ones there where like </connor>
<connor> there was I remember there's people who </connor>
<connor> would constantly like cuz you can ask </connor>
<connor> for a draw yeah you want to draw [ __ ] me </connor>
<connor> I have my psychology off because I was </connor>
<connor> like does this mean I'm winning he's </connor>
<joey> losing at one time I remember I regret </joey>
<joey> it to this day I should have took the </joey>
<connor> drawing I lost [ __ ] gave me now that's </connor>
<joey> the lowness man that's the character </joey>
<connor> development we need yeah I know exactly </connor>
<connor> I got a little little trophy if you won </connor>
<garnt> like three games professionally you got </garnt>
<joey> a thing called a Wendy I don't know why </joey>
<garnt> isn't called Wendy I don't know it just </garnt>
<joey> says Wendy's Burger Wendy I'm sure </joey>
<garnt> there's some chess people who know what </garnt>
