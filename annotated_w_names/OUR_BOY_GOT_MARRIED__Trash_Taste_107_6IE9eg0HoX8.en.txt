<joey> one point if i have one second without </joey>

<connor> double check like </connor>
<joey> yeah double clutch like ladybird did but </joey>
<joey> uh yeah we've uh made it to los angeles </joey>
<garnt> um and we've somehow found like been </garnt>
<garnt> able to build a studio despite a lot of </garnt>
<joey> issues oh that's we're gonna get into </joey>
<joey> that very quickly um i'm sure the the </joey>
<connor> rounds have already </connor>
<connor> been made of the actual situation yeah </connor>
<connor> the rounds have already been the rains </connor>
<garnt> people online if you've been on reddit </garnt>
<garnt> maybe you're aware of this uh if not </garnt>
<joey> which i'm like a big portion of the </joey>
<joey> audience isn't uh the subreddit yeah so </joey>
<joey> our baggage con containing melin said it </joey>
<joey> was thirty thousand dollars worth of </joey>
<joey> equipment it's actually i think closer </joey>
<joey> to fifty thousand yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah closer to fifty thousand worth </joey>
<joey> dollars worth of filming equipment all </joey>
<garnt> our mics all our cameras uh were lost </garnt>
<garnt> on the way here </garnt>
<garnt> and uh at this point at this moment we </garnt>
<joey> still don't know where they are yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so we had to like scramble to get </joey>
<joey> all of this equipment so that we can </joey>
<joey> actually film some episodes and you know </joey>
<joey> especially because we're going to get </joey>
<joey> guests on eventually as well yeah from </joey>
<joey> next episode yeah so uh </joey>
<garnt> it's just stressful as [ __ ] this was not </garnt>
<garnt> the start that we wanted i'm so thankful </garnt>
<garnt> that we scheduled in like two three free </garnt>
<joey> days of just like no guess no filming </joey>
<joey> anything yeah uh because if we if we </joey>
<joey> thought that we were gonna hit the </joey>
<garnt> ground running we would have been [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> like i guess literally arrives and it's </joey>
<joey> like so where's the set like uh </joey>
<joey> about that yeah it doesn't exist yet do </joey>
<connor> you want to explain your process of </connor>
<garnt> going to okay </garnt>
<garnt> so i was in charge of bringing all of </garnt>
<garnt> the equipment </garnt>
<garnt> uh to america because these boys flew a </garnt>
<garnt> bit early uh so i get to heathrow </garnt>
<garnt> airport terminal 2 </garnt>
<garnt> and i already like already alarm bells </garnt>
<garnt> are ringing because i get there and i </garnt>
<joey> want to check in and i can't check in </joey>
<joey> and i hear one of the operators say oh </joey>
<joey> no we can't check anyone in right now </joey>
<joey> because there is a queue downstairs of </joey>
<joey> about 200 bags and no one can check in </joey>
<joey> right now so i'm like </joey>
<joey> that's uh that's that's that's pretty </joey>
<joey> bad that's that's that's a lot that's </joey>
<joey> like that's like a bad omen right there </joey>
<joey> yeah that's worrying yeah so i arrive </joey>
<joey> you know an hour no two hours before my </joey>
<joey> flights as like that's what they </joey>
<joey> recommend so i have to wait an hour just </joey>
<joey> to check in my backs just checking my </joey>
<joey> bags right uh and that's true for like </joey>
<joey> pretty much everyone on the plane so i </joey>
<connor> check in my bags an hour before our </connor>
<connor> flight and then i check in my normal </connor>
<connor> bags and then i have we have two massive </connor>
<connor> pelican cases containing all of our </connor>
<connor> filming equipment </connor>
<connor> and um they look at that and they're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> we can't check that in here you're gonna </connor>
<joey> have to go to the oversized luggage like </joey>
<joey> section i'm like okay i'm like oh no oh </joey>
<joey> no this is this is this is this is scary </joey>
<joey> already i'm like my spidey senses were </joey>
<joey> tingling yeah you know i was like </joey>
<joey> something is going to go wrong </joey>
<joey> so i bring over the two pelican cases </joey>
<joey> over to the oversized luggage uh place </joey>
<connor> and uh so there's an operator there and </connor>
<connor> you could tell like this operator just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] done he did he he does not give </connor>
<connor> him you're dealing with this for a few </connor>
<connor> days yeah yeah yeah he does not give a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] at all right </connor>
<connor> and then he looks at the cases and he's </connor>
<connor> like all right just just put them put </connor>
<connor> them on there put them on the conveyor </connor>
<connor> belt and i'll get it through the system </connor>
<connor> and then he i put it on the conveyor </connor>
<connor> belt he presses a button to open a </connor>
<connor> shutter to get it through the airport </connor>
<connor> the shutter doesn't open and here he </connor>
<connor> presses again doesn't open and i'm like </connor>
<connor> okay uh there's something weird going on </connor>
<connor> here is this a mouth </connor>
<connor> like malfunction or something and he </connor>
<connor> just he sits there he sits down and he </connor>
<joey> sits there for five minutes doing </joey>
<connor> nothing doing like like doing nothing </connor>
<connor> right he just sits there for five </connor>
<connor> minutes and i'd like even like pretend </connor>
<garnt> to work yeah he just doesn't even </garnt>
<garnt> pretend to work he just sits down and </garnt>
<garnt> like plays on his phone and then like </garnt>
<garnt> while i'm waiting a queue starts to form </garnt>
<garnt> behind me first it's like one person </garnt>
<garnt> then it's two people then it's three </garnt>
<garnt> people and like it it really starts to </garnt>
<garnt> build up right and so after about 10 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes of just sitting down doing </garnt>
<garnt> nothing the guy just like tries to press </garnt>
<garnt> it again </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't work and then he finally he like </garnt>
<garnt> phones he like tries to phone somebody </garnt>
<garnt> he tries to do something about it </garnt>
<connor> um and so he phones the operator in </connor>
<connor> charge of whoever is in charge of the </connor>
<connor> baggage uh and uh he says oh the shutter </connor>
<connor> won't open and then they say </connor>
<connor> uh yeah we're not letting any bags in </connor>
<connor> right now because we are just completely </connor>
<connor> full like we cannot take any more bags </connor>
<connor> into our system right and so i was </connor>
<connor> waiting for about like 20 minutes </connor>
<connor> uh and so you know i was waiting in this </connor>
<connor> queue for about 20 minutes before he </connor>
<connor> presses the button and the shutter </connor>
<connor> finally opens and like right the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bags finally went through and i remember </connor>
<connor> by the time my bags went through it was </connor>
<connor> half an hour before my flight </connor>
<connor> and like </connor>
<garnt> and like i remember thinking finally the </garnt>
<garnt> shutters open bag goes through </garnt>
<garnt> and then the shutter closed and there </garnt>
<garnt> was just this moment </garnt>
<garnt> of </garnt>
<garnt> i'm never gonna see them again </garnt>
<garnt> like i had i had a feeling i had a </garnt>
<joey> feeling self-fulfilling prophecy yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah i had like a [ __ ] vision it </garnt>
<garnt> closed and i'm just like okay i was like </garnt>
<garnt> i have a bad feeling about this like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] obi-wan and um i remember </garnt>
<garnt> texting the group being like uh guys not </garnt>
<garnt> to be alarmed but i'm pretty sure </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's a good chance that maybe </garnt>
<garnt> we won't get to see our equipment but i </garnt>
<garnt> was like hoping out of hope </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and so you know i check in we go through </garnt>
<garnt> uh so we i flew air lingus so the air </garnt>
<joey> lingus flight goes from dublin so it </joey>
<joey> goes from heathrow to dublin and then </joey>
<joey> dublin to america lax </joey>
<joey> and so uh the </joey>
<joey> flight from dublin that's the flight </joey>
<joey> from heathrow to dublin was actually on </joey>
<joey> time which i think that's the reason our </joey>
<joey> bags didn't get delivered because it was </joey>
<joey> on time and we woke up the next day and </joey>
<joey> we found out that there's there's an </joey>
<joey> image on screen with all of the bags </joey>
<joey> that are like stuck in heathrow terminal </joey>
<joey> 2 now it's like a [ __ ] it's a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> sea of bags right our bag is somewhere </joey>
<joey> in there at this point </joey>
<joey> um but then after that </joey>
<connor> uh i check into my second flight to go </connor>
<connor> to america </connor>
<connor> and we all check in i'm sitting in my </connor>
<connor> seat and then </connor>
<connor> it's you know you know where you have </connor>
<joey> some of those flights where for some </joey>
<connor> reason the plane just doesn't move yeah </connor>
<joey> right right so i we were sitting there </joey>
<joey> for like a full-on hour right so like we </joey>
<joey> were sitting there for a full an hour </joey>
<joey> trying to figure out what's going on you </joey>
<joey> know are we actually going to take off </joey>
<joey> and then after an hour like the operator </joey>
<joey> comes in and we and was like guys i know </joey>
<joey> you've been waiting a while uh that's </joey>
<joey> because there's been a massive queue on </joey>
<joey> the runway right now uh so we're gonna </joey>
<connor> be a bit delayed and i'm gonna be real </connor>
<connor> with you uh it's looking like that we're </connor>
<connor> gonna be sitting here for another two </connor>
<connor> hours </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> and like </connor>
<connor> like you know when like bad news gets </connor>
<connor> announced and you just feel the air just </connor>
<connor> drop yeah yeah yeah like like there was </connor>
<connor> like that [ __ ] grown noise that just </connor>
<connor> distributed throughout the entire </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] plane right and everyone's just </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> so we we all start getting our phones </connor>
<joey> and everything like that and uh you know </joey>
<joey> i </joey>
<joey> i you know i was thankful because i got </joey>
<connor> to catch up with [ __ ] spy family you </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<connor> that's what i did with my extra two </connor>
<joey> hours on the tarmac but after worse yeah </joey>
<garnt> it could be worse but like after being </garnt>
<joey> delayed for three hours on the tarmac </joey>
<joey> finally i get to go to lax right you </joey>
<joey> know [ __ ] wow [ __ ] [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> brilliant i finally i finally get to go </joey>
<joey> my flight to america the flight itself </joey>
<joey> was very very pleasant you know um you </joey>
<joey> know we had some very good </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<garnt> what they called air stewardesses there </garnt>
<garnt> you know service yeah service we had </garnt>
<garnt> very good service uh the flight itself </garnt>
<garnt> was great but then </garnt>
<garnt> the nightmare continued when i landed in </garnt>
<connor> lax right </connor>
<connor> and that's just any landing in lao yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah the nightmare continues yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and so </garnt>
<garnt> i get i i get down and i thought that i </garnt>
<garnt> had saved time because if you fly from </garnt>
<garnt> dublin to america we have pre-clearance </garnt>
<connor> so we don't like if you fly from dublin </connor>
<connor> you don't actually need to go through </connor>
<connor> immigration in america that's very </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] good yeah you can go through </connor>
<connor> immigration in dublin yeah so it's </connor>
<connor> treated as a domestic flight so i'm like </connor>
<connor> great i could just pick my bags and get </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] out of there yeah and so i walk </connor>
<joey> for what feels like 20 minutes to get to </joey>
<joey> my baggage collection right yeah we all </joey>
<joey> have to do that yeah yeah yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> by the time i get there our bags aren't </joey>
<joey> even on the carousel because they are so </joey>
<joey> busy that they are still </joey>
<joey> like the people from the previous </joey>
<joey> flights are still getting their bags </joey>
<joey> from this carousel because there's only </joey>
<joey> one carousel in the domestic terminal </joey>
<joey> yeah so we that we like people from </joey>
<joey> hawaii were still like which was the </joey>
<joey> flight before we're still waiting for </joey>
<joey> their bags to come out so we couldn't </joey>
<joey> get our bags before the </joey>
<joey> passengers from hawaii could completely </joey>
<joey> get their bags out so i was waiting for </joey>
<joey> about an hour </joey>
<joey> before we even got any of </joey>
<garnt> any bags from our flights to come out </garnt>
<garnt> and then </garnt>
<garnt> after our after our bags after their </garnt>
<garnt> bags finished getting uh collected </garnt>
<garnt> finally our bags come out and it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like a drip feed i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how i don't know how it was such a slow </garnt>
<garnt> drip feed would like were they like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] cycling it over like one bag at </garnt>
<connor> a time because i was like dragging it </connor>
<connor> over the whole </connor>
<garnt> journey </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> it was coming out like [ __ ] five bags </garnt>
<garnt> at a time like it's so by the time </garnt>
<connor> by the time like i got some of my bags </connor>
<connor> out i had i had to wait another like 20 </connor>
<connor> 30 minutes and then of course i was </connor>
<connor> waiting for my equipment bags and then i </connor>
<connor> wait </connor>
<connor> i wait a little longer i waited a little </connor>
<connor> longer and they're all like uh so thank </connor>
<connor> you ladies and gentlemen uh the air </connor>
<connor> lingus bag flights uh the air lingus </connor>
<connor> flight bags are now finished uh so if </connor>
<joey> you have any bags to collect we've </joey>
<joey> collected it in the corner and i was </joey>
<joey> just like [ __ ] i do not i did not see </joey>
<joey> the bags i had you know i would rather </joey>
<connor> have lost my clothes than lose the 50 </connor>
<joey> 000 yeah of of equipment and so i go to </joey>
<garnt> this corner and there's a line of about </garnt>
<garnt> 30 people being like where the [ __ ] is </garnt>
<garnt> my bag </garnt>
<garnt> and and so </garnt>
<garnt> after that i have to queue again with </garnt>
<garnt> the with these 20 30 people all trying </garnt>
<garnt> to like wave their [ __ ] tickets to </garnt>
<joey> like uh like pick a form up and </joey>
<joey> like it was like my first reminder about </joey>
<joey> you know what i can experience here in </joey>
<joey> terms of customer service because i'm </joey>
<connor> used to japanese customer service </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i i'm very blessed with </connor>
<connor> japanese customer service where they </connor>
<joey> felt like you know they will do anything </joey>
<joey> they can to help you or at least they </joey>
<joey> they will like at least pretend to give </joey>
<joey> you [ __ ] yeah right yeah like at lax </joey>
<joey> like i've had two instances now where </joey>
<joey> there is not even any pretending to give </joey>
<joey> a [ __ ] about the customer at all like </joey>
<joey> like if anything i felt guilty for </joey>
<joey> having to trouble them for an issue with </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] airport you know so like i </joey>
<joey> guess so like i had to like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> fight my way through to like give them </joey>
<joey> the ticket and this guy punching my </joey>
<joey> numbers in uh to this lost and found </joey>
<garnt> form just could not give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> he could he like </garnt>
<garnt> he like he didn't give a [ __ ] so much </garnt>
<garnt> that it ended up we found out later that </garnt>
<garnt> he'd punched in the wrong numbers </garnt>
<garnt> to this form </garnt>
<garnt> and so it was like this </garnt>
<garnt> it was this experience of everything </garnt>
<garnt> that could go wrong with a flight did go </garnt>
<garnt> wrong and it turned a already long </garnt>
<garnt> travel time from england to america and </garnt>
<garnt> added around five to six hours on top of </garnt>
<joey> that as well </joey>
<garnt> i'm so sorry yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> she's staying here yeah there's like </connor>
<joey> this they're saying it and uh yeah </joey>
<joey> that's what that at this moment in time </joey>
<connor> that's all we know about what's happened </connor>
<connor> to our bags i think it's still in </connor>
<joey> heathrow um if i'm gonna guess </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> hopefully we can hopefully get our </garnt>
<connor> equipment back like what happens if </connor>
<connor> they're like oh by the way we delivered </connor>
<garnt> it to lax like a month later and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like we're not in here </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah i don't know what the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] is happening yeah yeah it's just </garnt>
<connor> frustrating it's like i wish they would </connor>
<connor> tell you anything yeah i think it's the </connor>
<connor> fact that they don't they like </connor>
<garnt> like the airline leaves you completely </garnt>
<garnt> in the dark and doesn't tell you hey </garnt>
<garnt> it's here it hasn't been shipped out yet </garnt>
<garnt> because it's all backed up yeah okay </garnt>
<joey> well i could somewhat understand that </joey>
<joey> but when they just [ __ ] tell you </joey>
<joey> nothing yeah they're like oh no it's an </joey>
<connor> lax yeah and like like they because </connor>
<garnt> meleen was calling them up and being </garnt>
<garnt> very angry yeah good good </garnt>
<garnt> good mailing uh </garnt>
<connor> they told meleen that like hey yeah the </connor>
<connor> bags have been at lax since june 16th </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and then he goes to lax again </connor>
<garnt> to try and get there and so i [ __ ] so </garnt>
<garnt> they told us that the bags had been </garnt>
<garnt> delivered to lax so i was just like i </garnt>
<garnt> want to go there physically to pick them </garnt>
<garnt> up yeah right because we've got 50 000 </garnt>
<joey> of equipment i don't want to risk like </joey>
<joey> wasting any more time so i drive to lax </joey>
<joey> and of course driving to lax is a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] nightmare in la because you have </joey>
<joey> to like [ __ ] because you have to </joey>
<joey> drive in l.a yeah yeah yeah so it takes </joey>
<connor> us about 40 minutes to get to lax and </connor>
<connor> then i go to the section where they told </connor>
<connor> me to pick the bags up </connor>
<connor> and i had my second experience with uh </connor>
<connor> lax customer service right which was uh </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> i tried to explain that i have tickets </connor>
<connor> to pick up my bags um and so the woman </connor>
<connor> in charge just goes no no we don't have </connor>
<connor> any bags from air lingus right now and </connor>
<connor> that's what she says and then she goes </connor>
<connor> away she doesn't even give me time to </connor>
<connor> like explain my situation she's just she </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] off and i'm like </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<connor> what could i do </connor>
<connor> what do i do so like i phoned i found </connor>
<connor> out male 1 to be like can i get like the </connor>
<connor> exact details of everything our airline </connor>
<connor> said to you so i can explain the </connor>
<connor> situation and so this lady goes off and </connor>
<connor> i can see her in eyesight she goes off </connor>
<connor> to the other side of the room and starts </connor>
<connor> like picking up and messing around with </connor>
<connor> some bags and so i talked to like one of </connor>
<connor> the security guards there to be like uh </connor>
<connor> can i call that lady over please because </connor>
<connor> i think she's in charge of like the </connor>
<connor> baggage system here and she literally </connor>
<joey> like picks out her phone and phones the </joey>
<joey> lady i can see the lady pick up her </joey>
<joey> phone and answer it </joey>
<joey> and she and then and then uh she's like </joey>
<joey> she's like okay and then hangs up and </joey>
<joey> then she continues messing around with </joey>
<joey> the bags i can see her in eyesight i see </joey>
<joey> her you can literally just run up to her </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah and so after 20 minutes </joey>
<joey> of [ __ ] around over there i don't </joey>
<joey> know what she's doing she reluctantly </joey>
<joey> comes back looks at me and i can see </joey>
<joey> like the disappointment in her face be </joey>
<joey> like why the [ __ ] are you calling me </joey>
<joey> again right and so i'm like trying to </joey>
<joey> explain </joey>
<joey> um yeah i just wanted to get more </joey>
<joey> information and explain more of the </joey>
<connor> situation about what i've been told and </connor>
<connor> what the situation is so i explained </connor>
<connor> everything that melian has explained to </connor>
<connor> me i give her the tickets and she does a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] eye roll and just </connor>
<connor> like she literally does that and i'm </connor>
<connor> like why am i being made to feel guilty </connor>
<joey> yeah for trying to solve a situation </joey>
<connor> with my guys creation yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> it's just </joey>
<joey> it made it made like a stressful </joey>
<joey> situation like eve like 10 times more </joey>
<joey> stressful because like you know i don't </joey>
<joey> i you know with customer service i don't </joey>
<joey> mind like if you are not like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> japanese level you know </joey>
<joey> yes king we'll do anything we want for </joey>
<joey> you you know what you need i'll explain </joey>
<joey> everything but at least don't make the </joey>
<joey> customer feel guilty yeah about bringing </joey>
<garnt> up needing a service about needing a </garnt>
<garnt> service it just it just made me like she </garnt>
<garnt> made me feel guilty for even like trying </garnt>
<garnt> to explain the situation and trying to </garnt>
<garnt> find out more information </garnt>
<garnt> um after driving there for 40 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> and she goes in she checks the details </garnt>
<garnt> on the [ __ ] luggage tag and </garnt>
<garnt> everything and then she comes back and </garnt>
<garnt> she's just like there is no bags here </garnt>
<garnt> your bags have not been delivered i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know what the airline have told </garnt>
<garnt> you they've pretty much just said uh </garnt>
<garnt> they've pretty much just said something </garnt>
<garnt> false because we've had no bags from the </garnt>
<garnt> airline at all </garnt>
<garnt> and that like that like almost broke me </garnt>
<garnt> because that like almost broke me right </garnt>
<garnt> because after driving there for 40 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes not getting my bags after being </garnt>
<garnt> delayed for fight like after wasting </garnt>
<garnt> five hours of my time the day before </garnt>
<joey> yeah i i now had to drive back from lax </joey>
<joey> to our studio and </joey>
<joey> like for some reason god just hated me </joey>
<joey> on that day because the traffic back was </joey>
<joey> like way worse than the traffic there so </joey>
<joey> it took twice the amount of time to </joey>
<joey> drive back and it was just </joey>
<joey> ah like i couldn't get it done oh man </joey>
<joey> like that like that drove my monk </joey>
<garnt> experience to its limit because i was </garnt>
<garnt> like i was like up to here i was about </garnt>
<garnt> to [ __ ] explode </garnt>
<joey> i'm surprised you didn't explode i think </joey>
<garnt> anyone else would have [ __ ] exploded </garnt>
<garnt> long before yeah i was like i would have </garnt>
<joey> certainly exploded internally i was </joey>
<garnt> screaming because like i like i don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to scream at like you know i don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to be like the karen to like the </garnt>
<garnt> customer service manager but like i just </garnt>
<joey> they just situations like that where i </joey>
<joey> think </joey>
<joey> it's almost a necessity to be a </joey>
<garnt> character well no because like right </garnt>
<garnt> like i didn't want to make i didn't want </garnt>
<garnt> to like like bring out my frustration on </garnt>
<garnt> the person right but also that person </garnt>
<joey> was i felt bringing out her frustrations </joey>
<joey> on me right my customer with maybe </joey>
<joey> previous customers she's had and i'm </joey>
<joey> just like it just </joey>
<joey> it was just awful </joey>
<joey> it was an awful experience there's no </joey>
<joey> there's no there's no silver lining in </joey>
<joey> this it was just an awful experience and </joey>
<joey> it's still not resolved um yeah yeah so </joey>
<garnt> it's it wasn't the best first experience </garnt>
<garnt> uh touching touching down in america but </garnt>
<garnt> uh yeah come to america wow </garnt>
<connor> welcome to america right what do you </connor>
<joey> mean you didn't tip your bag handler at </joey>
<joey> the airport </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> you know give him a 20 tip on his salary </connor>
<joey> to get your bag delivered we [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> talk about that because that's that's </joey>
<garnt> one frustration i've had since getting </garnt>
<garnt> here right so it's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> obviously because we had lost our [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> right and it still hasn't been resolved </garnt>
<garnt> we had to figure out ways to get the </garnt>
<garnt> equipment right so it's like we're </garnt>
<garnt> calling up camera play camera rental </garnt>
<garnt> places we're calling up light rental </garnt>
<joey> places yeah all that kind of stuff and </joey>
<joey> then we realized oh there's no uh mic </joey>
<joey> stands right because we're usually </joey>
<joey> attached to a table right but wait like </joey>
<joey> that's not going to work with you know </joey>
<joey> the current set we're in right now so </joey>
<joey> we're like alright [ __ ] we got to buy </joey>
<garnt> some mic stands so i'm like all right </garnt>
<garnt> i'll just get some on amazon you know go </garnt>
<garnt> on to amazon blah blah blah </garnt>
<garnt> and i think again this is where we're </garnt>
<garnt> blessed with amazon japan standards yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which is it is very rare to get </garnt>
<garnt> something on amazon no matter how small </garnt>
<garnt> or large how cheap or expensive it is </garnt>
<garnt> and usually 99 times out of 100 you'll </garnt>
<garnt> get it the next day yeah </garnt>
<joey> next day delivery that's just like </joey>
<garnt> normal yeah </garnt>
<joey> so i thought </joey>
<joey> it would be the same here yeah they do </joey>
<joey> have next day delivery if you would like </joey>
<joey> to pay </joey>
<connor> 500 more </connor>
<connor> for shipping yeah and like i looked at </connor>
<connor> it and i was like hold on how does that </connor>
<connor> work so i get free shipping if it comes </connor>
<connor> on </connor>
<garnt> like three days from now yeah but if i </garnt>
<garnt> want it tomorrow </garnt>
<joey> i basically have to tip amazon </joey>
<joey> 10 15 more yeah to get it the next day </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's about 10 15 delivery uh if you </garnt>
<joey> want to get your stuff the next day yeah </joey>
<joey> which i'm i'm of we're obviously blessed </joey>
<joey> with amazon uk amazon japan which it </joey>
<joey> comes free with prime you get next day </joey>
<joey> delivery yeah and like you know i like i </joey>
<joey> would i would understand maybe if uh if </joey>
<joey> it was kind of like </joey>
<joey> one thing that surprised me because i </joey>
<joey> thought you know [ __ ] amazon started </joey>
<joey> in california right yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> so so can we fact check that at least </garnt>
<connor> because i i don't know amazon yeah </connor>
<garnt> it was it's uh seattle is this yeah oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah okay okay </joey>
<garnt> it's american yeah okay okay okay just </garnt>
<joey> fine ignore that that's that's that's </joey>
<joey> just i made it the [ __ ] up moment yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah okay seattle but i would think that </joey>
<joey> with la being one of the </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] major cities in america </joey>
<joey> right because like you get perks if you </joey>
<joey> order from say london in the uk i </joey>
<joey> thought with la with this being like you </joey>
<garnt> know hollywood and needing a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> equipment a lot of shipment and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that i thought that they </garnt>
<garnt> would have a service that is more </garnt>
<garnt> convenient </garnt>
<garnt> um and i yeah i was very surprised to </garnt>
<garnt> see that you can't get the same level of </garnt>
<garnt> convenience </garnt>
<joey> uh just by being in l.a you literally </joey>
<connor> have to pay to win yeah it's it's hard </connor>
<connor> right there's a lot of like uh </connor>
<connor> socio-economic factors involved right </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean already right like </connor>
<connor> next day shipping you don't really need </connor>
<connor> next-door shipping like when do you how </connor>
<connor> often do you need next-day shipping all </connor>
<joey> the time no never normally no i do </joey>
<connor> because i i usually when i have to buy </connor>
<joey> something on amazon it's when i need it </joey>
<joey> urgently yeah and i don't have enough </joey>
<joey> time to go to the shops to get it or i </joey>
<connor> or perhaps it's something that i can't </connor>
<connor> get like an example just give me an </connor>
<connor> example </connor>
<joey> well say for example like camera </joey>
<connor> equipment in japan right isn't that </connor>
<joey> right it's very rare that you can go to </joey>
<connor> a big enough like yoda bash your big </connor>
<connor> camera that has the exact specifics </connor>
<connor> yeah well you know sometimes there are </connor>
<joey> some brands for example that you can't </joey>
<connor> easily access in japanese but like i i'd </connor>
<connor> say it's very rare that you need 100 you </connor>
<connor> need this next day like i bet 90 of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you ordered on amazon you did you did </connor>
<joey> not need that next day i'm sure yeah but </joey>
<joey> the convenience is there right yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it's there i think it's it's good to </joey>
<joey> have that convenience but i think </joey>
<joey> especially in america cause it's just </joey>
<joey> like so inefficient </joey>
<connor> and like you know everything is </connor>
<connor> delivered by roads like have you seen </connor>
<connor> the videos of like the </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<garnt> freight trains at the liver stuff in </garnt>
<connor> like california yeah i have to [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> break it open yeah yeah they get robbed </connor>
<connor> all the [ __ ] time yeah wow i just </connor>
<connor> think because the infrastructure just </connor>
<connor> isn't there and then the next day </connor>
<connor> delivery that they do do is almost like </connor>
<connor> it like [ __ ] up the like the people who </connor>
<connor> have to actually deliver it because they </connor>
<connor> have to do these insane routes right </connor>
<connor> trying to deliver this and they're </connor>
<connor> pissing in bottles and [ __ ] so part of </connor>
<connor> me is like yeah i love next day delivery </connor>
<connor> but i feel like just in america it just </connor>
<connor> doesn't it's not feasible it's not </connor>
<connor> feasible and if you are doing it </connor>
<connor> something bad is happening to someone </connor>
<connor> who is yeah i guess this is definitely </connor>
<garnt> like me being privileged it's definitely </garnt>
<connor> awesome it's definitely pretty much i </connor>
<connor> just wanted to talk about it because i'm </connor>
<connor> like yeah it's a complicated thing and </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean there's a bigger underlying issue </garnt>
<connor> to it you know japan </connor>
<connor> for some reason people don't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> about being worked like crazy for like </connor>
<connor> nine hours and being superficial </connor>
<connor> i don't know why in the uk you get next </connor>
<connor> day delivery as well you do but in </connor>
<connor> london it's it seems like it's it would </connor>
<connor> make way more sense to have that work in </connor>
<connor> london but like in wales you don't have </connor>
<connor> that oh you don't </connor>
<joey> not really like i lived right next to </joey>
<joey> the amazon warehouse in swansea and it </joey>
<joey> was never next day delivery really i </joey>
<joey> live next to the warehouse right for the </joey>
<joey> whole area </joey>
<connor> uh it's just i don't know london it </connor>
<connor> makes more sense it's possible there's a </connor>
<joey> lot more like curious is there maybe </joey>
<joey> like a sense of urgency towards like </joey>
<joey> fulfilling customer like requests maybe </joey>
<joey> because like i i assume in wales not a </joey>
<joey> lot of people are like ordering from </joey>
<garnt> amazon right sure </garnt>
<connor> surely in cardiff right maybe in cardiff </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah but like i think all the </connor>
<connor> card afforders are being filled </connor>
<connor> fulfilled by the swansea yeah right it's </connor>
<garnt> about an hour yeah because like i guess </garnt>
<joey> that's what i thought where i would </joey>
<connor> understand if you lived like in the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] boonies like in the middle of </joey>
<joey> nowhere okay you're not gonna get to get </joey>
<joey> next day delivery but like if you live </joey>
<joey> in america this is l.a yeah this is this </joey>
<connor> is l.a you can get it but like i it's </connor>
<connor> only certain items right because it's </connor>
<connor> got to be fulfilled by amazon which </connor>
<connor> means it's in their warehouse already </connor>
<connor> and then they get one of their couriers </connor>
<connor> to come and get it and that makes more </connor>
<connor> sense but i don't know the whole [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> system here is weird and even in europe </connor>
<connor> it's like not as good as japan japan </connor>
<connor> yeah works just but japan's had like </connor>
<connor> like an amazing shipping network for </connor>
<connor> like forever yeah like they've they've </connor>
<joey> they've got to figure it out yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> everything like that's what they care </connor>
<joey> about yeah that's like there like and </joey>
<connor> not a single tip was necessary yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because people yeah because people here </connor>
<connor> they're like bro we've got like so many </connor>
<connor> issues like guns and then japan's like </connor>
<joey> yeah that if that [ __ ] package </joey>
<connor> doesn't [ __ ] turn up when i tell it </connor>
<connor> to i'm not voting for you yeah that's </connor>
<garnt> like legit that's what they give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> about it we've only been here like a few </connor>
<garnt> days and like within that few days we've </garnt>
<garnt> just like we can feel like an entire </garnt>
<garnt> complaining about america like like this </garnt>
<joey> is just the complaining about america </joey>
<garnt> episode </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah because it's just this endless </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] stream because like well care is </connor>
<connor> like an endless loop of like </connor>
<connor> dichotomy is like okay oh this big </connor>
<connor> company does bad thing but it's like the </connor>
<connor> reason why it's doing bad thing is </connor>
<connor> because people don't want to do anything </connor>
<garnt> else and yeah it's just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> cause </garnt>
<garnt> i get it to a point why why i've </garnt>
<garnt> experienced such bad customer service </garnt>
<garnt> because it's because they have no </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] incentive to give a [ __ ] about </garnt>
<garnt> their job right and you know i get it </garnt>
<garnt> you know i've i've especially dealing </garnt>
<garnt> with people at the airport you deal with </garnt>
<garnt> like the most stressed out people in the </garnt>
<joey> world right you know at you know at a </joey>
<joey> level i get it you know </joey>
<joey> um and it's kind of sad in a way where i </joey>
<joey> see a lot of people in customer service </joey>
<joey> uh positions and you and it feels like </joey>
<joey> the only people that you see actually </joey>
<joey> care about giving a good service is when </joey>
<joey> there is an option to tip in the </joey>
<joey> occupation yeah right </joey>
<joey> it's true yeah i mean i mean that's </joey>
<joey> that's that's just what i've seen like </joey>
<joey> if like there is there are plenty of </joey>
<joey> customer service positions in america </joey>
<joey> but only the ones that tip i've with my </joey>
<joey> own experience is the ones where you </joey>
<joey> really feel that they care about the </joey>
<joey> customer right right and </joey>
<joey> society right </joey>
<joey> we live in a society society </joey>
<connor> i'd love to say that man yeah dude i </connor>
<connor> would do different yeah i i would </connor>
<connor> totally care yeah i don't think i'd care </connor>
<connor> no no no well no no i'd be like i don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] care like why would i </connor>
<joey> you know it's on my back well especially </joey>
<joey> if you're surrounded by that environment </joey>
<joey> right it's like you'd look like the </joey>
<connor> weirdo if you're the one that's caring </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm sure at lax that woman has </connor>
<connor> probably had the most horrible people </connor>
<connor> like yeah shouting at her yeah i'm just </connor>
<connor> screaming and then no repercussions yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> the guy [ __ ] walks off goes home he's </garnt>
<garnt> like i did nothing wrong yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> you know yeah yeah yeah i i totally get </garnt>
<garnt> that it's it sucks though but it does </garnt>
<connor> suck and you're like why don't you on me </connor>
<garnt> i was nice to you yeah yeah yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> like it sucks for me because like i </garnt>
<joey> happen to be the person that all that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] frustration got taken out of </joey>
<joey> yeah you know </joey>
<joey> like it just felt [ __ ] horrible just </joey>
<joey> not to be given the time of day or just </joey>
<connor> to be like made to feel guilty for just </connor>
<garnt> trying to like resolve one issue in my </garnt>
<connor> end even in the uk that's pretty rare </connor>
<connor> yeah they happen often the i feel like </connor>
<connor> there's a level of disappointment and </connor>
<connor> resentment that everyone has </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't really yeah yeah it doesn't </garnt>
<connor> really go below that everyone kind of is </connor>
<garnt> just kind of like yeah all right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i feel like in the uk you </garnt>
<connor> can really just like look i'm going </connor>
<joey> through a [ __ ] day right </joey>
<connor> there's a certain tone where you know </connor>
<connor> especially in this kind of situations </connor>
<connor> where i feel like it's much rarer in the </connor>
<connor> uk from what i've seen to like see </connor>
<connor> people really have like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> outburst you know what i mean i mean </connor>
<connor> that they were that they're all planning </connor>
<connor> i've seen playing it will definitely </connor>
<connor> happen yeah but </connor>
<connor> it's less than what i've seen you know </connor>
<garnt> here in america at least okay i just i </garnt>
<garnt> just needed to vent a bit okay because i </garnt>
<garnt> literally like lost about like </garnt>
<garnt> encountering about like eight hours of </garnt>
<garnt> my time to this i mean like when it's </garnt>
<garnt> when it's lax it's like triple it's like </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah you you you gave eight </joey>
<connor> but you lost twenty times yeah yeah i </connor>
<garnt> move slowly i feel like i lost like a </garnt>
<garnt> year of my life with this with this </garnt>
<connor> experience you know i mean i'd be </connor>
<connor> miserable if i worked at lax yeah </connor>
<joey> miserable going through lax let alone </joey>
<joey> working out people people are like bro </joey>
<connor> these are not newark i'm like you're not </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] any better like what are you on </connor>
<connor> about like you all suck it's all this is </connor>
<connor> all broken none of this works </connor>
<garnt> yeah so actually because like this like </garnt>
<garnt> because we've been to la before but i </garnt>
<garnt> think this is like the first time we've </garnt>
<garnt> had like extended stay in l.a right yeah </garnt>
<joey> the longest time i've been in la like in </joey>
<joey> one goes maybe like five days yeah at </joey>
<garnt> most yeah and that's always been in </garnt>
<joey> downtown yeah right and every time i </joey>
<joey> talk to a local they're like </joey>
<joey> downtown really yeah that's like that's </joey>
<connor> that's like that's like the awful it's </connor>
<joey> pretty sick yeah that's the sketch </joey>
<connor> sector </connor>
<connor> you'll get stabbed or shots uh if you </connor>
<connor> walk down the streets there which is </connor>
<connor> something we've definitely come close to </connor>
<connor> experiencing in downtown l.a around ax </connor>
<connor> but like the reason we normally come to </connor>
<joey> la is because of ax and ax is in </joey>
<joey> downtown l.a so </joey>
<joey> um so this is actually our first like </joey>
<joey> experience mostly like outside of </joey>
<joey> downtown but also getting a chance to </joey>
<joey> like you know experience actually </joey>
<joey> explore los angeles yeah yeah so you </joey>
<garnt> guys were like here a few days before me </garnt>
<joey> how was how was your guys's experience </joey>
<joey> well it was good until i got covered </joey>
<garnt> that's true </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it was good for like the first </garnt>
<garnt> three or four days because i was staying </garnt>
<garnt> in pasadena yeah which is like a </garnt>
<garnt> relatively nicer part of l.a everyone in </garnt>
<connor> la says it's a nice part of l.a it was </connor>
<connor> nice to be fair yeah um and then you </connor>
<garnt> have like you know places like glendale </garnt>
<connor> which is next door which is where all </connor>
<garnt> the youtubers live yeah um and stuff and </garnt>
<connor> like i definitely saw like a more </connor>
<garnt> like relaxed and more i guess like i </garnt>
<garnt> felt safer in pasadena and glendale </garnt>
<garnt> right a million times more than in </garnt>
<garnt> downtown l.a yeah which is not hard </garnt>
<garnt> because downtown la is just gta in real </garnt>
<connor> life right so it's like you know i felt </connor>
<connor> a lot safer and i was like okay i can </connor>
<connor> actually like kind of walk the streets </connor>
<connor> of pasadena during the day yeah and it </connor>
<connor> feels just like a regular town it's like </connor>
<connor> kind of nice and there's like lots of </connor>
<joey> places to eat and it's like really chill </joey>
<connor> yeah um just look like drake and josh </connor>
<connor> when i realized that yeah </connor>
<connor> i felt like i was on an episode of drake </connor>
<joey> and josh a little bit yeah i like walked </joey>
<joey> past like like an elementary school that </joey>
<joey> looked like </joey>
<joey> like it was ripped straight from the </joey>
<connor> simpsons and i was like oh </connor>
<connor> like it was like that was like okay you </connor>
<connor> know that it was that point where i'm </connor>
<connor> just like okay you know what l.a might </connor>
<joey> not be as bad yeah and then again there </joey>
<joey> was just those like just small little </joey>
<joey> instances </joey>
<joey> that just made me be like um yeah maybe </joey>
<connor> not maybe right </connor>
<garnt> yeah like say the [ __ ] lax situation </garnt>
<connor> yeah like you know the amazon situation </connor>
<garnt> it's just like it's it's very nitpicky i </garnt>
<garnt> know yeah but i think it just goes to </garnt>
<garnt> show how much we've been blessed in </garnt>
<garnt> tokyo i mean like it's it's nitpicky but </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's when you choose for like </garnt>
<garnt> a place to live for example like place </garnt>
<garnt> visiting and living is like two totally </garnt>
<garnt> different experiences but like it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of like little things that will </garnt>
<garnt> build up over time of course you know </garnt>
<garnt> and it's you know one thing i've really </garnt>
<garnt> really missed </garnt>
<garnt> is walking yeah i've missed walking a </garnt>
<garnt> lot and you know i'm sure like there </garnt>
<garnt> there are some places in in la which i'm </garnt>
<garnt> you know i'm sure you can walk you know </garnt>
<garnt> but like i feel like a lot of america as </garnt>
<garnt> a whole is just not built for walking </garnt>
<joey> yeah that's all right because i remember </joey>
<joey> i was i was meeting up with a friend of </joey>
<garnt> mine uh and she she just lives she lives </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of uh in the middle between </garnt>
<garnt> pasadena and glendale so like from my </garnt>
<garnt> hotel it was like </garnt>
<garnt> 20 minute walk yeah right at most yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and so i was like we were hanging in </garnt>
<garnt> pasadena we had lunch and [ __ ] and then </garnt>
<garnt> i was like oh let's just go back to your </garnt>
<garnt> place and we'll just hang out yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> looked on the map and it was like 20 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes i'm like yeah we can walk that </garnt>
<connor> it's a nice day [ __ ] it's the middle </connor>
<connor> of the day it's like what 2 p.m yeah </connor>
<connor> afternoon i kind of want to have a walk </connor>
<connor> and she was like she looked at me like i </connor>
<connor> was a [ __ ] weirdo she was like what </connor>
<connor> are you homeless yeah it's just like </connor>
<connor> walking what the [ __ ] this is like we're </connor>
<connor> gonna walk it and i'm like </connor>
<connor> don't [ __ ] look at me like that like </connor>
<connor> yes i would like to use my legs because </connor>
<garnt> i haven't done that in a while since i </garnt>
<garnt> got here </garnt>
<garnt> and uh and she was just like </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> and you know kind of thing and she kind </garnt>
<garnt> of reluctantly followed me yeah um i got </garnt>
<joey> like five minutes into this walk yeah </joey>
<garnt> and i turned a corner and i was like i </garnt>
<connor> don't want to go down there </connor>
<joey> i was like okay i can see what you were </joey>
<joey> talking about </joey>
<connor> yes it's a 20 minute walk but it's also </connor>
<joey> 20 minutes of my life potentially in a </joey>
<joey> lot of danger at the same time you know </joey>
<connor> it's 30 minutes when you've got to do </connor>
<connor> like the navy seals checks and all that </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> when you've got to dodge all the </joey>
<joey> homeless people yeah but it's uh yeah i </joey>
<connor> don't know even it could be like i felt </connor>
<connor> i feel weird catching an uber to some </connor>
<garnt> place that's like five minutes away yeah </garnt>
<joey> but it's you have to right living here </joey>
<garnt> and i think that's like one thing that </garnt>
<garnt> made me realize </garnt>
<joey> you know perhaps </joey>
<joey> la is fun to visit but definitely i </joey>
<joey> wouldn't want to live here yeah </joey>
<connor> personally speaking i don't know when </connor>
<connor> there's like four lanes of like cars </connor>
<connor> it's like crossing it just feels like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] dice roll </connor>
<connor> and there's like a lot of them don't </connor>
<connor> have light so i'm like wait so when do i </connor>
<connor> go it's just like no no you play chicken </connor>
<connor> you cross the first two yeah and then </connor>
<joey> you kind of wait in the middle literally </joey>
<joey> the moment you step out of the car you </joey>
<garnt> are playing with your life </garnt>
<joey> you're just playing frogger </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean it gets pretty [ __ ] scary </joey>
<connor> especially like especially when you're </connor>
<connor> in downtown la or like any like sketch </connor>
<joey> places right which there are a number of </joey>
<connor> in l.a no no i'm white </connor>
<connor> yeah you get a free pass </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> because i [ __ ] i still remember i was </joey>
<joey> saying this to conor the other day i </joey>
<garnt> still remember that [ __ ] airbnb you </garnt>
<garnt> and sydney booked at the last time we </garnt>
<garnt> were in uh ax oh yeah and i remember you </garnt>
<garnt> sent me you were having like a house </garnt>
<joey> party and you sent me the the address </joey>
<joey> right on google maps and i was like oh </joey>
<connor> sick it's like literally just around the </connor>
<garnt> corner from our hotel so i was just like </garnt>
<joey> let's just [ __ ] walk in a three </joey>
<joey> minute walk right and i remember we were </joey>
<joey> mostly on the main road you know cars </joey>
<joey> whizzing by you know a couple of people </joey>
<joey> on the streets or whatever it's like all </joey>
<joey> right cool yeah and the moment we got to </joey>
<joey> your street it was just this dark </joey>
<joey> alleyway </joey>
<joey> yeah and i'm like this can't be right </joey>
<joey> yeah and then from all the way across </joey>
<joey> the alleyway i could just hear you going </joey>
<joey> over here </joey>
<joey> now like you are not making me walk down </joey>
<joey> this block </joey>
<joey> are you kidding me yeah there are like </joey>
<joey> two other people in this alleyway </joey>
<connor> looking sketch as [ __ ] just like </connor>
<garnt> standing around like i'm literally about </garnt>
<joey> to put my life on the line yeah to go </joey>
<garnt> and hang out with god yeah all right </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it let's do it because it was like </garnt>
<joey> i remember that airbnb because inside it </joey>

<joey> know it was great yeah it's not as </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] fantastic we had like a pool </joey>
<joey> table and everything like it was it was </joey>
<joey> a nice open space yeah but my god it was </joey>
<joey> in like the most sketch area you could </joey>
<joey> ever imagine and i felt bad whenever </joey>
<joey> like i was inviting people around to </joey>
<joey> that airbnb because i know you remember </joey>
<joey> you like yeah at least like you walked </joey>
<joey> down that dark alleyway because like our </joey>
<joey> house was like right at the end of this </joey>
<joey> dark alleyway and it wasn't it was like </joey>
<joey> an alleyway with a dead end </joey>
<joey> so like if you if you would like to rank </joey>
<connor> like the top places to get mugged in la </connor>
<connor> i'm like i'm pretty sure that was like </connor>
<joey> top 10 places to get mugged and stabbed </joey>
<joey> in l.a </joey>
<joey> and i remember like </joey>
<joey> uh i invited super eye patch wolf john </joey>
<joey> uh to the apartment as well and i </joey>
<joey> remember he gets the same point right </joey>
<joey> and and all i see is like a dark </joey>
<garnt> silhouette because he's like he's saying </garnt>
<garnt> that he's standing at the end of this </garnt>
<garnt> alleyway i see like this dark silhouette </garnt>
<garnt> it's john he's by himself and </garnt>
<garnt> uh and i'm like i go out i see him like </garnt>
<joey> god oh yeah oh yeah but like i'm sure to </joey>
<joey> him he just goes </joey>
<garnt> and so like and so i remember he like he </garnt>
<garnt> sees my silhouette i remember he starts </garnt>
<joey> walking the opposite direction </joey>
<joey> immediately starts like power walking </joey>
<joey> the opposite direction </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah and so i have to like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] sprint to run up to him do we go </garnt>
<garnt> john john it's me it's me don't worry </garnt>
<joey> and then he starts running faster he's </joey>
<joey> like get away </joey>

<connor> wedding yeah but i didn't know what was </connor>
<garnt> going to be the trigger yeah right and </garnt>
<connor> definitely it and the trigger came very </connor>
<connor> quickly when you started crying </connor>
<joey> because i don't know because there's </joey>
<joey> something about </joey>
<joey> watching god cry that is like </joey>
<connor> really [ __ ] sad it's like seeing your </connor>

<garnt> this is going to make me cry and like i </garnt>
<joey> i could tell that i wasn't the only one </joey>
<joey> because literally [ __ ] 70 percent of </joey>
<joey> that room was crying at that moment it </joey>
<garnt> was like a sniffing convention for a </garnt>
<garnt> while </garnt>
<joey> told me man </joey>
<joey> and then and then i cried and then i </joey>
<joey> almost cried a second time when we </joey>
<joey> it was that clip where we hung it out oh </joey>

<garnt> i remember melin so we had we had an </garnt>
<garnt> open bar </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<joey> and i remember the best and worst </joey>
<garnt> decision ever best and worst decision of </garnt>
<garnt> my life because i remember going up to </garnt>
<garnt> the bar to open the bar and you have to </garnt>
<joey> put like a tab down on the bar </joey>
<joey> and i remember asking how much should i </joey>
<joey> you know how much is like a reasonable </joey>
<joey> number right to uh to to put the tab </joey>
<joey> down uh and the guy says like you know </joey>
<joey> we've been doing weddings for years we </joey>
<joey> recommend this number great and so i was </joey>
<joey> like great just in case i'm gonna put </joey>
<joey> double the amount so that i don't have </joey>
<joey> to like get charged uh so you don't have </joey>
<joey> to call me if it like breaks that limit </joey>
<joey> so i'm like great and so how it works is </joey>
<connor> that however much you don't spend </connor>
<connor> uh they'll refund you so about like a </connor>
<connor> few days after the wedding i give them </connor>
<connor> an email to be like oh great can i get </connor>
<connor> the refund please how much was not on </connor>
<connor> was not used on the tab yeah and </connor>
<connor> i waited a few days because it was like </connor>
<connor> bank holiday or something and then i get </connor>
<connor> an email about all this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> transactions yeah i get an email back </connor>
<garnt> and i'm like oh great uh we can refund </garnt>
<garnt> you at grand total of one pound forty </garnt>
<garnt> legit one pound one pound forty damn </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> damn yeah i'm like i'm not even mad </garnt>
<joey> anymore i'm just impressed you're like </joey>
<joey> meticulously calculated yeah but it was </joey>
<garnt> like double the recommended amount and </garnt>
<garnt> you guys [ __ ] destroyed that and i </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not i'm not surprised because like </garnt>
<garnt> i've never seen so many [ __ ] shots </garnt>
<garnt> being taken out in like one night i'd </garnt>
<connor> say like i'm i took around like seven </connor>
<connor> shots of tequila that night my god melin </connor>
<connor> was a [ __ ] tequila fiend my god if </connor>
<connor> you had become if you </connor>
<connor> went into like a five meter radius of </connor>
<connor> melind you are getting dragged to it to </connor>
<connor> do a shot of tequila i remember like </connor>
<connor> there's one time i remember seeing melin </connor>
<connor> like ask joey if she if you wanted the </connor>
<garnt> shot and you're like no no million i </garnt>
<garnt> hate shots and she [ __ ] gave you a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] death grip yeah and just dragged </joey>
<joey> me to the bar and made you do a shot she </joey>
<joey> literally grabbed me by my sleeve and </joey>
<joey> was just like </joey>
<joey> no it's not an answer </joey>
<joey> that's how i did that first shot and i </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<joey> so okay so the first shot was like all </joey>
<joey> right you know what it's it's it's a </joey>
<connor> wedding there's like seven other people </connor>
<connor> doing the show with me [ __ ] yeah you </connor>
<connor> know i hate tequila </connor>
<garnt> so much yeah but i'll do it just because </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to you're vibing yeah i'm </garnt>
<garnt> good i want to be part of the vibe right </garnt>
<garnt> so i did it </garnt>
<garnt> it was [ __ ] horrible and then the </garnt>
<connor> second time around was when melian was </connor>
<connor> like no it's not an answer and gra </connor>
<connor> dragged me to the bar yeah again with </connor>
<connor> all the familiar faces like oh the first </connor>
<joey> time for you all right yeah so i did the </joey>
<joey> second shot hated it and then a couple </joey>
<joey> of hours passed by and i'm like okay </joey>
<joey> alien hasn't called me back yet and so </joey>
<joey> just when i thought i was in the clear </joey>
<joey> mailing from a distance [ __ ] scutters </joey>
<joey> towards me </joey>
<joey> and it was just like </joey>
<joey> tequila shot joey and i just had to go </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] off </joey>
<joey> i literally i literally flipped a finger </joey>
<joey> i was just like no </joey>
<joey> get away from me and and i just walked </joey>
<joey> off and merely it was just like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> run yeah i literally ran from her cause </joey>
<joey> because i thought because i knew if i </joey>
<connor> wasn't like stern about it yeah she </connor>
<connor> would grab me by the slave again yeah </connor>
<connor> because i heard from a bunch of other </connor>
<connor> people who were like way too nice to </connor>
<connor> mainly yeah they were like yeah she made </connor>
<connor> me do like six shots and i'm like that's </connor>
<joey> because you have to say the hard no </joey>
<joey> you have to say it's not just the </joey>
<joey> softness it's the </joey>
<garnt> yeah predator </garnt>
<connor> yeah did you make you do any shots i </connor>
<joey> think so i didn't really mind though </joey>
<joey> one's fine yeah </joey>
<joey> you only got to do one i think melee </joey>
<joey> only made me do one what did you make me </joey>
<joey> do like three just because you were just </joey>
<joey> too close to her </joey>
<joey> vicinity-wise yeah yeah so i was really </joey>
<joey> worried because you know we had food and </joey>
<joey> i was like this isn't enough there's not </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> three courses gone yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm a six-course kind of guy minimum or </connor>
<joey> at least give me someone else's course </joey>
<joey> who didn't finish right yeah and then </joey>
<connor> and then lord behold people just start </connor>
<joey> bringing out pizza yeah we we go or you </joey>
<joey> could eat pizza it go it was like </joey>
<garnt> all we can eat like stone baked pizzas </garnt>
<connor> yeah i think i had like four whole </connor>
<connor> pizzas </connor>
<joey> it was it was </joey>
<joey> i had a i had a worrying amount of pizza </joey>
<connor> it was like it was more pizza than any </connor>
<connor> doctor would ever recommend yeah like </connor>
<connor> even if you were like carb loading for </connor>
<connor> like a desert survival for like 10 weeks </connor>
<connor> you wouldn't eat then this many cows </connor>
<connor> this was i i don't know every time they </connor>
<connor> brought it to me i was like well i can't </connor>
<connor> say no i mean it's a different topic i </connor>
<joey> gotta try it that was me with the </joey>
<garnt> espresso martinis oh yeah i think i had </garnt>
<joey> like five espresso </joey>
<garnt> and i'm like oh that's why i'm shaking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so we had a station to uh give out </garnt>
<connor> free espresso martinis to everyone wow </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean we wanted everyone to have a good </joey>
<connor> time like oh no wonder that tab was </connor>
<garnt> high but that wasn't even on the tab </garnt>
<joey> that was like a free package that we </joey>
<joey> paid for i remember i remember i was </joey>
<connor> like i went up to the bar after like my </connor>
<connor> first espresso martini that they brought </connor>
<connor> out for everyone right and i was like oh </connor>
<connor> can i get another espresso martini and </connor>
<joey> the dude literally just points to the </joey>
<joey> side because there's literally this like </joey>
<joey> three layered shelf of espresso martinis </joey>
<joey> there was like 12 espresso martinis i </joey>
<joey> was like take your pick i was like oh </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] all right cool </connor>
<joey> well i just drank like three of them and </joey>
<garnt> i was just [ __ ] shaking yeah so i </garnt>
<garnt> guess like to go to like the start of my </garnt>
<garnt> experience with the wedding because </garnt>
<garnt> obviously you guys experience was very </garnt>
<garnt> very different from mine yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so like um so we had like about i </garnt>
<joey> think it was only like 62 people at this </joey>
<joey> wedding so it's like a fairly small </joey>
<joey> wedding but like i really really like </joey>
<joey> the size of the wedding because it was a </joey>
<joey> good amount of size i could keep up with </joey>
<joey> like pretty much you could interact with </joey>
<joey> everyone i could talk with everyone and </joey>
<joey> not feel like it was just like a </joey>
<joey> convention experience where i was having </joey>
<joey> like one sentence conversation with </joey>
<joey> people would like have proper meaningful </joey>
<joey> conversations which is which is good </joey>
<joey> because i just wanted to like i just </joey>
<joey> wanted to just like share the good vibes </joey>
<joey> and everything like that </joey>
<joey> um but i remember like the night before </joey>
<joey> the wedding i was so [ __ ] i don't </joey>
<joey> know i don't know what the right word to </joey>

<garnt> myself i'm like okay let's just try </garnt>
<garnt> something new so i like </garnt>
<garnt> i i take off all of my sheets and take </garnt>
<garnt> all my blankets and i put them on the </garnt>
<garnt> floor i'm like let's let's try sleeping </garnt>
<garnt> on the floor on the hard floor and for </garnt>
<garnt> some reason i don't know if it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like these like asian jeans or something </garnt>
<garnt> where it just felt like i was home again </garnt>
<garnt> and i just like immediately conked out </garnt>
<joey> it felt like i was sleeping like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] futon or something i don't know </joey>
<joey> what it was about sleeping on the floor </joey>
<joey> but like i just immediately conked out </joey>
<joey> after like sleeping on like a nice comfy </joey>
<connor> bed or something um and then yeah like </connor>
<connor> we we go to the vetting uh the wedding </connor>
<connor> venue and of course it was i was </connor>
<connor> not like tense nervous it was like the </connor>
<connor> feeling of like before you get in you </connor>
<connor> start a panel or you go on stage or </connor>
<connor> something yeah it's just like you know </connor>
<joey> this big thing is coming up but you just </joey>
<joey> gotta wait around yeah for it to start </joey>
<joey> that's the worst yeah it's it's i was i </joey>
<joey> was so i was so [ __ ] jittery </joey>
<joey> and i know yeah like because i talked to </joey>
<joey> sydney if she was nervous for the </joey>
<joey> wedding and she was like her nerves like </joey>
<joey> ended the moment she woke up because she </joey>
<joey> was like so busy like before the wedding </joey>
<connor> started because she had to like go do </connor>
<connor> her makeup go do her hair and like all </connor>
<connor> the bridesmaids as well so she was at </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> venue from like 9am oh wow and i didn't </connor>
<connor> i didn't need to get there until 12 00 </connor>
<connor> 12 00 </connor>
<joey> to 12 noon yeah the easy job yeah </joey>
<joey> and so like that that was just like a </joey>
<joey> lot of time for just me to like be alone </joey>
<joey> with my own thoughts and be really </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] nervous um </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> and so yeah i was i was really tense </joey>
<joey> nervous whatever but luckily luckily i </joey>
<joey> had i had my i had my boys with me i had </joey>
<joey> my boys were there the lads were there </joey>
<joey> my hype men you know whether they were </joey>
<joey> there with me um and i remember i'm like </joey>
<connor> i remember um </connor>
<connor> going to the boys um so </connor>
<connor> to fully explain neither of these two </connor>
<connor> were my best men uh it's it's okay so </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry i'm sorry guys and only conor </connor>
<connor> was a groomsman but like part of the </connor>
<connor> reason was like it made me realize </connor>
<joey> how long it's been since i've planned </joey>
<joey> this wedding because we had we like me </joey>
<joey> and cindy had planned the wedding </joey>
<joey> basically like before we had moved to </joey>
<joey> japan </joey>
<joey> and yeah and like every like air like </joey>
<joey> every role or like the entire wedding </joey>
<joey> party was chosen and everything um yeah </joey>
<joey> and it was like it was like going the </joey>
<joey> wedding was going to originally be </joey>
<joey> before trash tastes even started yeah so </joey>
<joey> it's like [ __ ] insane that like i've </joey>
<joey> grown so much closer to these two in </joey>
<joey> like these past two years where like </joey>
<joey> when my wedding was planned i like i i </joey>
<joey> knew joey but we hung out only like a </joey>
<joey> few times you know and we'd hang out </joey>
<joey> like a lot but i was like not as close </joey>
<joey> to you as i am now so so it was like it </joey>
<joey> was so weird to like </joey>
<joey> it was so weird to have a wedding that </joey>
<joey> was planned two years ago where like now </joey>
<joey> the dynamic is like totally [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> different and everything i was just </joey>
<joey> saying like </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> so like i remember like we call everyone </joey>
<joey> in to the main ceremony hall uh so </joey>
<joey> everyone starts getting their seats </joey>
<joey> and like i call like i'm like i go out i </joey>
<joey> go out by myself </joey>
<joey> and i'm like gone you got this you got </joey>
<joey> this go on this is you're gonna you're </joey>
<joey> gonna do a no-tier wedding run there's </joey>
<connor> going to be zero crying at this wedding </connor>
<connor> and like i got to myself just to give </connor>
<connor> myself like a breather and like i'm like </connor>
<connor> okay i bring out like we have me and </connor>
<connor> sydney had personal vows so i bring out </connor>
<connor> my personal vows and i'm like </connor>
<connor> rehearsing them in my head i'm like okay </connor>
<connor> you got this this is zero tears we're </connor>
<connor> not going to cry this morning we got </connor>
<connor> this you got this i read like the first </connor>
<connor> sentence and i just like started like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> my jaw my jaw just starts going </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like oh no oh no this is a bad </garnt>
<garnt> sign this is a bad sign and so </garnt>
<garnt> while i'm like </garnt>
<connor> while i'm doing this like all of my all </connor>
<connor> my lads all my groomsmen come out and </connor>
<connor> they see me and i'm like guys i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> need some hype around me i'm i'm i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna need some [ __ ] hype around me </connor>
<connor> yeah and so </connor>
<connor> like this was a step this was the moment </connor>
<connor> where i took a page out of connor's book </connor>
<connor> i'm like i literally go full monkey mode </connor>
<connor> right outside the ceremony it works dude </connor>
<connor> it works i was like i was like </connor>
<garnt> you [ __ ] got this you [ __ ] got </garnt>
<garnt> this not realizing that everyone in the </garnt>
<garnt> site could you hear me like just [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> shouting but i i heard you shouting at </joey>
<joey> something but i i wasn't too sure i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> that's good right like people who fear </joey>
<joey> this the shouting type you offer people </joey>
<garnt> who haven't tried it if you tried it </garnt>
<garnt> actually yeah you fully commit to it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it works yeah i mean like that time </garnt>
<joey> it really [ __ ] worked because i had </joey>
<joey> so much adrenaline in my body yeah that </joey>
<joey> uh that i needed some way to uh i need i </joey>
<joey> needed some way to release it yeah and </joey>
<joey> so i remember getting to the ceremony </joey>
<joey> room and i'm like okay it's good the </joey>
<joey> shouting helps i'm like i'm like i'm </joey>
<connor> like recent on the chatting's help uh i </connor>
<connor> go to i go to the front i turn around </connor>
<connor> i look at my mum's face and just </connor>
<connor> immediately </connor>
<joey> immediately i'm just like i'm a broken </joey>
<joey> man again </joey>
<joey> because like oh just </joey>
<joey> like my cousin told me this after the </joey>
<joey> ceremony yeah but he's just like if </joey>
<joey> there's one thing you definitely should </joey>
<joey> not do when you're standing up there </joey>
<joey> waiting is your mom is look at your mom </joey>
<connor> look at your parents and it's true </connor>
<connor> i i can understand that yeah let's go </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> it's a feeling i can't describe well </connor>
<connor> yeah my dad and my mom were like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> tearing up and i rarely see them tear up </connor>
<connor> and it's just </connor>
<connor> it's just like i don't know like </connor>
<garnt> what did my face look like when i was </garnt>
<joey> waiting up there i gotta know because i </joey>
<joey> i can do a reenactment of exactly what </joey>
<joey> you were like you're like </joey>
<joey> that's what you look like close yeah </joey>
<joey> that's really accurate it's just like </joey>
<joey> every now </joey>
<connor> time they were about to like you know </connor>
<connor> their song ends yeah yeah they're doing </connor>
<connor> a medley yeah </connor>
<joey> the song finishes and then they start </joey>
<joey> the new one and everyone's talking and </joey>
<joey> then the moment they finish the song i </joey>
<joey> was like my god everyone yeah everyone </joey>
<joey> stops it's starting </joey>
<connor> and then they start playing the next one </connor>
<connor> i'm not here to like do a bit like what </connor>
<joey> do i do i don't know and then seeing you </joey>
<joey> know again it was like it was seeing you </joey>
<garnt> nervous that made everyone else in the </garnt>
<garnt> room nervous right being like oh [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> this is actually finally happening yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right and then the quartet stops for the </garnt>
<garnt> final time and then it's like everyone </garnt>
<connor> was like okay it's starting right and </connor>
<connor> then sydney walks down </connor>
<garnt> and then you immediately start breaking </garnt>
<garnt> and then i expected which which i fully </garnt>
<garnt> expected right so i'm just like oh here </garnt>
<joey> come the floodgates </joey>
<joey> okay so it comes and then what stopped </joey>
<joey> me yeah was the song you guys yeah </joey>
<joey> i was just like oh my god here we go </joey>
<joey> and i literally like jan was sitting </joey>
<joey> next to me and moon was sitting next to </joey>
<joey> me yeah and we all looked at each other </joey>
<garnt> like that that's god's theme right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so like okay so what made you yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's what i wanted to talk about what </joey>
<garnt> made you choose sydney walked down the </garnt>
<joey> aisle to gutsy's theme yeah and i i </joey>
<joey> thought </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah which like i knew it was </joey>
<joey> coming because like i remember it was </joey>
<joey> literally the day that miura passed away </joey>
<joey> right and i remember you know we were </joey>
<joey> we're at netflix shoot at the day so i </joey>
<joey> didn't have like properly proper time to </joey>
<joey> like process that news </joey>
<connor> and i remember that day i went back home </connor>
<connor> and i put on gus's theme and i was just </connor>
<connor> like just like zoning out together this </connor>
<connor> thing [ __ ] crying </connor>
<connor> to the news that i just got announced </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> and you know sydney also </connor>
<connor> cindy was also listening to it just </connor>
<connor> listening to it </connor>
<connor> uh seeing me listen to it for hours yeah </connor>
<connor> and she's just like i [ __ ] [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> love this song you know yeah because </connor>
<joey> like it's like to me gus's theme is like </joey>
<joey> by far like one of one of the greatest </joey>
<joey> tracks in anime to like to like ever to </joey>
<joey> like ever be made you know it's it's </joey>
<joey> such a like a beautiful track and you </joey>
<joey> know it's unfortunate that it's been </joey>
<joey> memed a lot nowadays so that's that's </joey>
<joey> like that's like a lot of that's like </joey>
<joey> how people perceive guts's theme but </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> i remembered listening to that on that </connor>
<connor> day that it's just such a beautiful </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] track gorgeous yeah and i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] cried to it so many times and so </connor>
<connor> i remember sydney goes to me </connor>
<joey> jokingly she turns to me and she was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> wouldn't it be funny if we walked down </joey>
<joey> the aisle to this </joey>
<joey> and i was just like </joey>
<joey> yeah that'd be funny </joey>
<joey> and then we both turned to each other </joey>
<garnt> and and we looked at each other in the </garnt>
<garnt> eyes and we're just like but what if </garnt>
<connor> what are you going to do the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> default music yeah yeah yeah yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> then like we we like we're like would it </garnt>
<garnt> be would it be cheesy i thought it would </garnt>
<garnt> it would be cheesy and so we let it we </garnt>
<garnt> let it sink for a while and like we let </garnt>
<joey> it sit for a few days we let it sit for </joey>
<joey> a few weeks and then like the longer </joey>
<joey> the longer like we sat in it the more it </joey>
<joey> felt like it was just the right idea </joey>
<joey> because like i [ __ ] knew that i was </joey>
<joey> going to cry listening to gus's theme </joey>
<joey> walking like </joey>
<joey> like i'm sure like people knew we were </joey>
<garnt> going to play gus's theme that would </garnt>
<joey> have taken like the [ __ ] guts this thing </joey>
<joey> yeah you know i i i wish i knew </joey>
<joey> beforehand yeah yeah yeah because i feel </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> it was for me it was like the initial </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> really yeah it was like that moment </joey>
<connor> right it's like wow they're actually </connor>
<connor> using godzilla's thing right yeah like </connor>
<joey> there was a split second where i i was </joey>
<garnt> about to start laughing yeah but then i </garnt>
<joey> was like but then again seeing you and </joey>
<joey> then seeing sydney i was just like nah </joey>
<garnt> this is like this this is the right </garnt>
<garnt> choice yeah yeah yeah because it's like </garnt>
<garnt> i remember sydney was telling me that </garnt>
<garnt> you know before sydney comes out all the </garnt>
<joey> bridesmaids walk out yeah so </joey>
<joey> if if you are familiar with guts's theme </joey>
<joey> there's like the intro bit and then </joey>
<joey> there's like the voice there's the voice </joey>
<joey> of the guy going </joey>
<garnt> and i remember thinking i see all the </garnt>
<garnt> bridesmaids walk out and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> where's sydney where's sydney </garnt>
<garnt> and as soon as like the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> comes up she's she just appears right </joey>
<joey> and apparently </joey>
<joey> behind the scenes like like sydney's </joey>
<joey> like with her dad waiting to walk out </joey>
<joey> and her dad's like come on it's time to </joey>
<joey> go and she's like no i need to wait for </joey>
<joey> that moment the right moment i need to </joey>
<joey> wait for that voice </joey>
<garnt> before i appear </garnt>
<joey> oh my god </joey>
<joey> it was like so incredibly well timed it </joey>
<garnt> was incredibly rewarding i thought it </garnt>
<garnt> was just like [ __ ] gorgeous smiling </garnt>
<connor> down on us </connor>
<connor> but no sydney was like no i'm waiting </connor>
<joey> for this moment i i am waiting for you </joey>
<connor> to get one shot yeah i didn't [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> work yeah like i think that's why i just </connor>
<connor> immediately started bawling because i </connor>
<joey> hear i hear that voice like just pop off </joey>
<joey> and i see sydney emerge i'm just like </joey>
<joey> this is </joey>

<joey> it's like a [ __ ] beautiful slime i </joey>
<joey> can't i can't </joey>
<joey> describe </joey>
<connor> what i felt at that moment because it </connor>
<connor> was literally like a scene out of an </connor>

<connor> it was so like a final episode </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah like like that moment </connor>
<connor> that that [ __ ] voice hit she emerges </connor>
<connor> and i'm </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>

<connor> yeah because it really really gave me </connor>
<joey> and sydney the time to really like </joey>

<garnt> yeah but like we tried to write a nice </garnt>
<joey> little personal message to everyone who </joey>
<garnt> attended our wedding and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> little touches like this i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> we would have been able to do one if we </garnt>
<garnt> didn't have enough time and two </garnt>
<garnt> if there was like too many people there </garnt>
<connor> yeah your sister yours was nice sydney </connor>
<connor> just insulted me yeah yeah i was like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] sydney </connor>
<joey> that's pretty much the same with </joey>
<connor> everyone what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what did i do i turned up didn't i </connor>
<garnt> actually but like another thing is we </garnt>
<connor> wanted to like try to integrate like the </connor>
<connor> places we'd been to and the cultures we </connor>
<connor> were we lived in as much as possible so </connor>
<connor> we had like uh </connor>
<connor> uh we had a custom-made muscle box made </connor>
<connor> which if you don't know what that is </connor>
<connor> it's uh one of those sake boxes yeah </connor>
<connor> right so we had like a custom crest that </connor>
<garnt> we </garnt>
<garnt> we made which was like a combination of </garnt>
<garnt> like both of our families and then we </garnt>
<garnt> gave everyone mastery boxes which you </garnt>
<garnt> normally drink sake out of yeah um but </garnt>
<garnt> so i was excited yeah yeah yeah so i was </garnt>
<joey> like i was like telling everyone at the </joey>
<joey> table being like yeah so this is this </joey>
<joey> thing called like </joey>
<joey> that you use these masu boxes for when </joey>
<joey> you like you pour it so much that it </joey>
<joey> overflows into the box and everyone was </joey>
<joey> like oh cool </joey>
<garnt> and then </garnt>
<garnt> and then like if if you know me in </garnt>
<garnt> sydney you know that we are not saki </garnt>
<garnt> drinkers right yeah but like i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know why but there is a drink within our </garnt>
<garnt> group which which we are like really </garnt>
<garnt> famous for drinking uh because every </garnt>

<joey> gigabytes total yeah and like we've been </joey>
<joey> blessed by japanese there's just no </joey>
<joey> internet speeds that can do it so it was </joey>
<joey> either we ship it to him uh to like in </joey>

<joey> floor holy [ __ ] [ __ ] joke i was with </joey>
<joey> dee </joey>
<joey> and you know and he can dance his ass </joey>
<joey> off yeah and i heard the cargo summer </joey>
<joey> opening and i was like i have to pop </joey>
<connor> there's people that played </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah because like the dance </joey>
<joey> floor was kind of weird because it was </joey>
<joey> like there was either no one there or </joey>
<joey> everyone was there yeah there was no </joey>
<joey> in-between so it was during the time </joey>
<joey> where it was like me dean like a couple </joey>
<joey> of other people and we just you know </joey>
<joey> there's like a couple of tracks playing </joey>
<joey> and then and then the calgary summer </joey>
<joey> theme starts and we're just like </joey>
<joey> well we gotta dance to this all right </joey>
<joey> like we're gonna pop off to this one </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah and so i just stopped </joey>
<joey> popping off because i was stupidly drunk </joey>
<joey> not realizing someone is behind me </joey>
<joey> filming this entire ordeal right yeah </joey>
<joey> and so when i received the video i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> wow i'm [ __ ] right now </joey>
<garnt> i'm so [ __ ] because i never danced </garnt>
<connor> yeah right because i can't dance for </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah i was i was dancing like my </garnt>
<garnt> life was [ __ ] depending on it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then you went again when uh dev </garnt>
<garnt> manoj started playing again i started </garnt>
<garnt> playing i was like all right all right </garnt>
<garnt> ty is coming off i'm popping off today </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> yeah because i remember we went in waves </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone went on the dance floor </garnt>
<garnt> and then everyone was like let's get a </garnt>
<garnt> drink and then everyone immediately went </garnt>
<garnt> to the bar and it just it just kept </garnt>
<garnt> coming in waves but i remember like the </garnt>
<garnt> the time when everyone started to pop </garnt>
<garnt> off was when [ __ ] september played </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> and that's and that's when that's when </garnt>
<garnt> the video like me and joey [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> hugging yeah um came about but like i </joey>
<joey> remember before that i remember i like </joey>
<joey> gave conor that conor the hug as well </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> because it was like [ __ ] september </joey>
<joey> and everyone was so hyped and i was that </joey>
<garnt> was like i think like the hyper song i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why it was september </garnt>
<joey> because i like because i thought it was </joey>
<connor> just like it's a happy song and also </connor>
<connor> like every time we used to go to karaoke </connor>
<connor> together yeah that song was always the </connor>
<garnt> best oh yeah yeah yeah so that's where i </garnt>
<garnt> thought it was yeah yeah yeah yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> like i would say like if okay so one of </garnt>
<connor> i think one of the best decisions i made </connor>
<connor> with my wedding if you are whatever </connor>
<joey> planning advice </joey>
<joey> here's some wedding advice um if you're </joey>
<joey> ever planning uh if you're planning a </joey>
<joey> future wedding or something so like even </joey>
<joey> though there was only 62 people at my </joey>
<joey> wedding which is a fairly small wedding </joey>
<joey> in my eyes smaller yeah yeah smaller </joey>
<joey> wedding like wedding fomo is a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> thing because </joey>
<connor> i wanted to be with everyone at all </connor>
<joey> times i wanted to see what was [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> popping off what people were talking </connor>
<joey> about i just wanted to see what's going </joey>
<joey> on because like because there's only one </joey>
<joey> of me and because there's like only so </joey>
<joey> much so many hours in this one [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> day you can only be at one place at a </connor>
<connor> time and it's like i had so many regrets </connor>
<connor> um because we're also like really really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] busy with the photographers </connor>
<connor> getting like our own wedding photos or </connor>
<connor> something like one thing i big one </connor>
<connor> probably my biggest figure of the </connor>
<connor> wedding is that i didn't see everyone's </connor>
<connor> reaction to the postcards and all the </connor>
<connor> messages and stuff because we were like </connor>
<connor> should have all filmed your reaction so </connor>
<connor> i can react to it later yeah </connor>
<connor> so because we were outside taking </connor>
<connor> wedding photography uh when you guys </connor>
<joey> were in so like </joey>
<joey> one of the best decisions i made is that </joey>
<joey> i had we had like a gopro there </joey>
<connor> uh because of course we did i learned </connor>
<joey> from trash tastes right i i learned from </joey>
<connor> trash taste of course and i was just i </connor>
<joey> went to like everyone and i was just </joey>
<joey> like film whatever you want just just </joey>
<joey> just film whatever you want </joey>
<joey> um and </joey>
<joey> like i've seen the footage and i'm just </joey>
<joey> like it's </joey>
<joey> it gives you like such an on the ground </joey>
<joey> experience to what everyone was doing </joey>
<joey> and like we haven't we had videographers </joey>
<joey> there and so i'm very very excited to </joey>
<joey> see what they captured on their end but </joey>
<joey> i think it's just like it was like it </joey>
<joey> was a totally different view when you </joey>
<joey> just had people filming their own povs </joey>
<joey> on gopros right um because like you got </joey>
<garnt> to see like the progression everyone was </garnt>
<garnt> like so well spoken so happy at the </garnt>
<joey> beginning of the wedding </joey>
<joey> and then you go to like the end footage </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it was like a guy [ __ ] kind of so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] happy for you </joey>
<joey> and yeah it was like it was like it was </joey>
<joey> like one of the best decisions i think </joey>
<joey> regarding my wedding because i got to </joey>
<joey> see so much my wedding that i wouldn't </joey>
<joey> have got to see if uh </joey>
<connor> if if i did if i didn't have a gopro </connor>
<joey> there so yeah </joey>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> unfortunately you guys are never going </connor>
<joey> to see that uh but uh it does it does </joey>
<connor> exist on my hard drive oh yeah yeah but </connor>
<joey> yeah like i said fantastic day you know </joey>
<joey> i know it's a cliche to say like you </joey>
<garnt> know your wedding's like the happiest </garnt>
<garnt> day of your life but it was it was top </garnt>
<joey> three </joey>
<joey> like no one's that jaded where they're </joey>
<joey> like yeah my wedding was all right yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah like of course i mean i live it up </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> because like before the wedding i was </garnt>
<garnt> just like you know maybe it'll be the </garnt>
<joey> happiest day of my life you know it's i </joey>
<joey> didn't really think about it too much </joey>
<joey> we're looking back it was genuinely the </joey>
<joey> happiest day of my life so far so i'm </joey>
<connor> glad i'm glad i got i'm glad you guys </connor>
<connor> got to share that you know yeah it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] awesome yeah i think that's the </connor>
<connor> best thing about having a wedding to me </connor>
<connor> like we we had a lot of mates there and </connor>
<joey> it was just having your mates around to </joey>
<joey> experience like the happiest moment of </joey>
<joey> your life is something that i cannot put </joey>
<garnt> into words it's just it's it's it's so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] special yeah absolutely and joey </connor>
<garnt> wore trainers </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah oh you're going to talk about </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<garnt> joey joey got the vessies on i do okay </garnt>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> you know because the wedding was not </joey>
<joey> done in london it was done just outside </joey>
<joey> of london right yeah so we were in </joey>
<joey> london you know for about a week i was </joey>
<joey> hanging out with a bunch of people what </joey>
<joey> not and i i had forgotten because </joey>
<joey> because uh originally i was supposed to </joey>
<joey> get a suit from the suit rental place </joey>
<joey> that gone had organized yeah but because </joey>
<joey> right now in the uk and just i guess </joey>
<joey> everywhere in the world it's like </joey>
<joey> wedding craze right now because you know </joey>
<joey> we're approaching the end of the </joey>
<connor> pandemic um </connor>
<connor> they were all booked up right so gant </connor>
<connor> messaged me like a few days before i was </connor>
<connor> about to fly out to uk being like hey so </connor>
<connor> sorry but i wasn't able to get your suit </connor>
<connor> rental yeah so you're gonna have to </connor>
<connor> bring your own suit yeah and i was like </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> i only have a jojo suit i mean that's </connor>
<connor> fine that's sort of which was okay so i </connor>
<connor> was like whatever you know i'll just get </connor>
<connor> that dry clean you know where whatever </connor>
<connor> but then when i got to london and i was </connor>
<connor> sorting out my luggage i was like [ __ ] i </connor>
<joey> forgot to </joey>
<joey> bring my suit shoes yeah right and so in </joey>
<joey> the back of my head i was like well i'm </joey>
<joey> in london for like an entire week i'll </joey>
<joey> just like pop over to a shoe store and </joey>
<joey> buy some nice shoes right yeah </joey>
<connor> uh i got a little bit ham in london </connor>
<joey> i was like drinking every day in london </joey>
<connor> right because of course you do yep you </connor>
<connor> know meeting up catching up with a bunch </connor>
<connor> of people so </connor>
<connor> the morning of the wedding yeah as i was </connor>
<connor> taking my suit out i realized i don't </connor>
<garnt> have suit shoes </garnt>
<garnt> and the only pair of shoes i had were </garnt>
<garnt> the vessies that i was wearing </garnt>
<garnt> so i rocked up to the wedding </garnt>
<connor> in full suit you know type in belt </connor>
<garnt> everything yeah and a pair of vessies </garnt>
<connor> yeah and uh everyone at the wedding was </connor>
<joey> giving me [ __ ] they were like they </joey>
<joey> literally </joey>
<joey> they were literally doing the water </joey>
<joey> you know fully deserved mind you but um </joey>
<joey> but you know what at the end of the day </joey>
<joey> i won because when i got onto that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] dance floor dude i was fully </joey>
<joey> prepared </joey>
<joey> i was fully prepared with my everyone </joey>
<joey> like had taken their shoes off to dance </joey>
<connor> i was like step aside i got the footwear </connor>
<connor> for you yeah yeah yeah yeah so that was </connor>
<joey> uh don't do that </joey>
<joey> bring bring it bring bring proper sushi </joey>
<joey> i had one job to buy sutures and i did </joey>
<garnt> not fulfill it making it making a </garnt>
<joey> statement there making a statement </joey>
<joey> exactly i was making a statement yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah but i guess like you know wedding </garnt>
<garnt> aside it was like i guess it was like </garnt>
<garnt> a </garnt>
<garnt> reasonable amount of time in the uk you </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like you got to experience more </garnt>
<garnt> of the uk this time as well yeah </garnt>
<joey> absolutely yeah i mean last time i was </joey>
<connor> in the uk which was the first time was </connor>
<connor> we were staying mostly at your place in </connor>
<connor> brighton yeah so i think we were only in </connor>
<connor> london for maybe like </connor>
<connor> two days yeah even then it was mostly </connor>
<joey> just like going to all of the you know </joey>
<joey> touristy places yeah right so i think </joey>
<joey> yeah this time around not only did i get </joey>
<connor> to have like a proper </connor>
<connor> like view of london london yeah but also </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> chris took me out of london as well to </joey>
<joey> like we went filming into a bunch of </joey>
<joey> places and i actually got to see like </joey>
<garnt> the countryside of london i got to see </garnt>
<garnt> stonehenge oh did you actually yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> went to stone edge it's really </garnt>
<garnt> disappointing isn't it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it looks way cooler from a disney yeah </garnt>
<connor> because you actually get so to get to </connor>
<connor> stonehenge you have to like go to this </connor>
<connor> visitor's center buy a ticket for some </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] reason yeah and then you can </connor>
<connor> either take a bus </connor>
<connor> which is like five minutes to stonehenge </connor>
<joey> or you can walk across the fields for </joey>
<joey> like 30 minutes yeah and i was like well </joey>
<joey> it's kind of a nice day let's just like </joey>
<garnt> walk across the fields because it might </garnt>
<joey> be nice yeah it was not nice </joey>
<garnt> because it was not only nothing for 30 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes but there was also just horse </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] everywhere </garnt>
<joey> so i'm like [ __ ] dodging these like </joey>
<joey> you know these [ __ ] horse this horse </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] because god forbid these are the </joey>
<joey> only pair of [ __ ] shoes i have as </joey>
<joey> well so i don't want your besties i was </joey>
<joey> wearing the besties </joey>
<joey> no i have to wear these things </joey>
<joey> so we got to it and then i guess because </joey>
<joey> there was like an incident uh some years </joey>
<garnt> ago of like some drawing you know uh you </garnt>
<joey> know [ __ ] on the stone hair stones </joey>
<garnt> yeah so they had actually like fenced it </garnt>
<connor> off yeah but like they had fenced it off </connor>
<connor> not really like an arms reach away but </connor>
<connor> like at least about a hundred meters </connor>
<connor> away yeah so the closest you could get </connor>
<connor> to stonehenge was like 100 meters away </connor>
<connor> which </connor>
<connor> was kind of like defeating the purpose i </connor>
<connor> guess like because apparently you used </connor>
<connor> to be able to like actually walk into </connor>
<connor> stonehenge and like actually get like a </connor>
<connor> close view of it you can't do that </connor>
<connor> anymore because i guess some people just </connor>
<connor> ruined it for everyone so </connor>
<connor> which you know was like kind of </connor>
<connor> underwhelming i guess in a sense but </connor>
<connor> like you know i was like well you know </connor>
<connor> stonehenge is like that one uh heritage </connor>
<connor> site that you hear people talking about </connor>
<connor> and it's like a hot tourist place so i'm </connor>
<connor> just like well you know what at least </connor>
<joey> now i can say that i've seen stonehenge </joey>
<joey> but like </joey>
<joey> it was </joey>
<joey> fascinating it necessarily not really </joey>
<connor> i'd go to a greg's any day over </connor>
<joey> stonehenge yeah i mean we did afterwards </joey>
<connor> we went to greg's afters but like i </connor>
<connor> think the most enjoyment i had like on </connor>
<connor> that trip out of london was the fact </connor>
<connor> that like i just actually got to see </connor>
<connor> like the real side of the uk like the </connor>
<garnt> actual like country side like we went </garnt>
<garnt> past like all these like really small </garnt>
<garnt> like quaint little villages that you </garnt>
<garnt> like there were some villages that we </garnt>
<garnt> drove past that legitimately looked like </garnt>
<garnt> rpgs </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was like an rpg like medieval </garnt>
<garnt> town </garnt>
<connor> which was like so [ __ ] cool most of </connor>
<garnt> the uk right but like i had never seen </garnt>
<connor> that before right because my experience </connor>
<garnt> of the uk is london and brighton right </garnt>
<connor> which is very much not like that yeah so </connor>
<garnt> it was really cool to actually like stop </garnt>
<joey> by in like these really small quaint </joey>
<garnt> villages to be like oh we got like the </garnt>
<joey> full experience of the uk what are the </joey>
<garnt> best one of the best [ __ ] stories </garnt>
<connor> was we stopped by uh i had i was like </connor>
<connor> dying for a piss right right and so i </connor>
<connor> was like we have to stop by somewhere </connor>
<connor> right yeah and but like we're in the </connor>
<connor> middle of nowhere right so we're like oh </connor>
<garnt> okay i guess we'll just like stop by the </garnt>
<garnt> closest village to see if there's like </garnt>
<garnt> an establishment right we can borrow um </garnt>
<garnt> so we stopped by this village i don't </garnt>
<garnt> even remember the name of this village </garnt>
<connor> it's [ __ ] tiny and </connor>
<connor> we got to the entrance of the village </connor>
<connor> and there's like this old dude standing </connor>
<connor> there and he like kind of flags us down </connor>
<connor> like hey yeah and so chris is like all </connor>
<connor> right this uh what what's what's </connor>
<joey> happening and we drive up to him and </joey>
<joey> he's like yeah what's what's the problem </joey>
<joey> and the guy goes are you here to see the </joey>
<joey> duck race </joey>
<joey> and we're like what </joey>
<joey> it's like there's a duck race happening </joey>
<joey> so make sure to drive nice and slowly </joey>
<joey> across this road okay </joey>
<joey> a dark race </joey>
<joey> and sure enough we dr we drive maybe </joey>
<joey> about 50 meters and there's just this </joey>
<joey> gathering of about </joey>
<joey> 10 to 20 like old people just watching </joey>
<joey> these ducks </joey>
<joey> that sounds awesome and i'm like this is </joey>
<joey> the most british thing i've ever seen in </joey>
<connor> my [ __ ] life what else are you going </connor>
<joey> to do with your free time yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> i was like i want to be there yeah </joey>
<joey> at that age i want to just like wake up </joey>
<joey> in the morning and be like oh the duck </joey>
<joey> races today and just go down to my local </joey>
<joey> pond </joey>
<joey> and just watch some ducks </joey>
<joey> that's [ __ ] awesome yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's cause like </garnt>
<garnt> i remember like as like we went to a pub </garnt>
<connor> the day for a wedding yeah um and it was </connor>
<connor> like it's very very quaint local pub uh </connor>
<connor> in this very very small town yeah um </connor>
<connor> because this this like where the wedding </connor>
<connor> took place it was in a town that was </connor>
<joey> like you know you could walk from one </joey>
<joey> end to the other in about like 30 </joey>
<joey> minutes </joey>
<joey> it was a [ __ ] tiny so it was like a </joey>
<joey> local pub and like i remember there was </joey>
<joey> just this poster on the wall that just </joey>
<garnt> said uh this is the place for the uh the </garnt>
<garnt> worldwide annual pea tossing tournament </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that oh yeah well it </garnt>
<connor> was the p flicking tournament right well </connor>
<connor> i think it's the way that the streets </connor>
<connor> had kind of uh the way like that natural </connor>
<connor> landscape was yeah the idea was that you </connor>
<connor> threw at the peak because i googled it i </connor>
<connor> was curious you're gonna throw the p i </connor>
<connor> mean this is gonna tell him wherever </connor>
<garnt> your wedding is by the way it's only in </garnt>
<garnt> this place i mean i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i already have one wedding yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so so the way that this kind of town is </garnt>
<garnt> really cool architecture it's like kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like there's a village at the top and </garnt>
<garnt> then it kind of winds down towards the </garnt>
<garnt> bottom so the idea of this pea throwing </garnt>
<joey> thing apparently according to google is </joey>
<joey> it the idea is that you throw it and </joey>
<joey> hopefully if you throw it well enough or </joey>

<connor> managed to find a spot like three or </connor>
<connor> four miles away from where we originally </connor>
<connor> were gonna start this yeah </connor>
<connor> where it was like okay the signal is </connor>
<connor> kind of okay yeah let's just [ __ ] </connor>

<connor> funny thing where when your pc is </connor>

<connor> some reason they'll be like </connor>
<connor> uh sorry uh it was connected to wi-fi </connor>
<connor> and ethernet yeah i was like i'll just </connor>
<connor> use the wi-fi yeah </connor>

<connor> of sick like it's wireless and it's like </connor>
<connor> no no no no use the [ __ ] why would </connor>
<connor> you use the slower one when you connect </connor>
<connor> it to the first one i'm sure there's </connor>
<connor> some [ __ ] engineer in the comments oh </connor>
<connor> actually it's because </connor>
<joey> i'll be like i don't [ __ ] care </joey>

<garnt> the dichotomy of like chris doing an irl </garnt>
<garnt> stream with you in japan versus in the </garnt>
<garnt> uk yeah in japan he's just like you know </garnt>
<garnt> just don't talk too loud i don't want to </garnt>

<connor> it was just so fun </connor>
<garnt> it was great it was great i didn't get </garnt>

<connor> entourage the uh the american family and </connor>
<connor> show them around and make sure they </connor>
<garnt> weren't in trouble yeah yeah yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was a very very interesting </garnt>
<garnt> interesting experience showing them </garnt>
<garnt> around uh because like the first night </garnt>
<joey> uh they you know they just flown in </joey>
<joey> um and </joey>
<joey> so they didn't want to go too far but we </joey>
<joey> went to like my local pub which is </joey>
<joey> literally like down the road right but </joey>
<connor> it's like so it's it's like not in like </connor>
<connor> central central brighton it's like we're </connor>
<connor> like on the outskirts of brighton </connor>
<connor> whatever so it's it's not somewhere you </connor>
<connor> see like </connor>
<connor> a lot of like touristy people go right </connor>
<connor> because brighton's like a pretty famous </connor>
<connor> touristy place uh and i remember we go </connor>
<connor> there </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> we sit down we're having a pint and </connor>
<connor> obviously they're american and they got </connor>
<connor> like the true </connor>
<garnt> british experience right right it was it </garnt>
<garnt> was a local pub </garnt>
<garnt> and we had </garnt>
<garnt> local people there and </garnt>
<garnt> some </garnt>
<garnt> some younger people </garnt>
<garnt> uh recognized their accents </garnt>
<connor> oh my god </connor>
<connor> were they like road men or something </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i've never seen like you know you </garnt>
<garnt> know there's always like the image of </garnt>
<garnt> how americans think british people speak </garnt>
<garnt> and like for the first time sydney's </garnt>
<garnt> family got like the true british </garnt>
<joey> experience right right right they they </joey>
<joey> got true local brits and i remember they </joey>
<joey> were having like they were like </joey>
<joey> there was this one kid having a </joey>
<joey> conversation with sydney's brother </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<connor> and of course he was talking about his </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] rap career that was that was </joey>
<connor> going to take off in new w in america </connor>
<joey> because he had listeners from new york </joey>
<joey> and he had like a spotify account yeah </joey>
<joey> and i could i could see sydney's </joey>
<joey> brother's face just like i know you're </joey>
<joey> speaking english </joey>
<garnt> but i have no idea what the [ __ ] you are </garnt>
<garnt> saying </garnt>
<garnt> it was literally like a scene out of the </garnt>
<joey> in-betweeners right like yeah maylene's </joey>
<connor> husband marky had the exact same </connor>
<connor> experience when i like took him to a </connor>
<connor> friend's house yeah yeah yeah and like </connor>
<connor> my because my friends in london they're </connor>
<connor> not originally from london they're from </connor>
<joey> like further up north right so they have </joey>
<connor> the more northerner accent and uh and </connor>
<garnt> one of my friends yusuf uh he has like a </garnt>
<garnt> really strong leeds accent right which </garnt>
<garnt> is like </garnt>
<garnt> hard even for me yeah yeah to understand </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes so it was just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> hilarious every time uh </garnt>
<connor> yusuf like opened his mouth </connor>
<connor> and just said something yeah just monkey </connor>
<connor> would just like </connor>
<connor> squint like this like he's like really </connor>
<connor> trying to [ __ ] close </connor>
<connor> he's like this is definitely english </connor>
<joey> i think </joey>
<joey> i don't know and every time yusuf would </joey>
<joey> stop talking i would turn to maki in </joey>
<joey> japanese i'd be like did you understand </joey>
<joey> that he was like no </joey>
<joey> and then he got really sad </joey>
<joey> and he was like i thought i was good at </joey>
<joey> english </joey>
<joey> but i guess i'm not and i'm like don't </joey>
<joey> worry don't worry about it it's fine </joey>
<joey> this is like this is like even i have </joey>
<connor> trouble with this thing yeah that should </connor>
<connor> be on like the toeic exam it should be </connor>
<connor> like can you understand a man from leeds </connor>
<connor> if you can you're fluent right yeah </connor>
<connor> pretty much you're good to go yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's funny because like if the more </garnt>
<joey> northern you go the harder time it gets </joey>
<joey> for like anyone outside of the uk to </joey>
<joey> understand what the [ __ ] is being said </joey>
<joey> exactly yeah because even for me as like </joey>
<joey> of southerner i can barely understand </joey>
<garnt> what's being said in like liverpool oh </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah op being from </connor>
<connor> the north it's like you just understand </connor>
<garnt> everyone yeah that's right i'm like yeah </garnt>
<connor> super chill it's all good lucky the only </connor>
<connor> time i struggle is like i think there's </connor>
<connor> a really uh i felt ashamed at this one </connor>
<joey> point there's i think there's a clip of </joey>
<joey> a really really rural irish uh pub and </joey>
<joey> then they interviewed is that the guy </joey>
<joey> with like the three teeth i think so and </joey>
<connor> he just [ __ ] says [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i was like even at that point i'm like i </connor>
<joey> only understood like three words it's </joey>
<joey> like the guy from kalani or something it </joey>
<connor> might be something but like that was the </connor>
<connor> only time where i'm like yeah i don't </connor>
<connor> even know if if if the other people in </connor>
<connor> the pub understood him i i don't know if </connor>
<joey> i'm the one </joey>
<connor> but the interviewer understood him </connor>
<joey> because he's from that point that's </joey>
<joey> right yeah so he was like he the guy </joey>
<joey> would just be like </joey>
<joey> and be like yes i like this pub too </joey>
<connor> you're conversing with this guy </connor>
<joey> yeah i wish i understood that anytime i </joey>
<connor> felt like inadequate i was like yeah i </connor>
<garnt> thought i understood everything </garnt>
<joey> everything [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah i know the exact video you're </connor>
<joey> talking about as well because like i i </joey>
<joey> felt disappointed as well because i'm </joey>
<joey> like i'm like i'm sure i can understand </joey>
<joey> this i'm sure i can understand this </joey>
<garnt> yeah don't know you just start uh you </garnt>
<garnt> you like start playing at like 4.5 </garnt>
<garnt> speeding like maybe i can like gauge the </garnt>
<connor> system </connor>
<connor> the closed captions just say [ __ ] i </connor>
<joey> don't know yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't even think the closed captioning </joey>
<connor> can determine if it's english or not i </connor>
<connor> wish it was like a tv ad one so they'd </connor>
<joey> have to have that like woman who like uh </joey>
<connor> does the uh sign language sign language </connor>
<connor> she's trying to do the shot </connor>
<connor> she's just like </connor>
<joey> i give up dude </joey>
<garnt> i don't give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> do they have like strong accents in </garnt>
<connor> whales like to the point where </connor>
<connor> maybe nothing you wouldn't be able to </connor>
<connor> understand just a very like oh i'm from </connor>
<connor> this village you know we talked about is </connor>
<joey> there like differing like geographical </joey>
<connor> differences in whales like the uk or is </connor>
<connor> it kind of just like um yeah stronger or </connor>
<connor> weaker i generally like the more north </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<connor> west you go uh i heard some [ __ ] do </connor>
<connor> the thing about that yeah uh it gets a </connor>
<connor> little stronger the south has a </connor>
<connor> different accent but it's not like </connor>
<connor> completely i wouldn't say it's that </connor>
<connor> different but they also have different </connor>
<connor> words yeah so i feel like the difference </connor>
<connor> is not so much in the dialect more so in </connor>
<connor> uh well not the dialect is the written </connor>
<connor> word yeah the accent isn't as different </connor>
<connor> just the words yeah so the accent sounds </connor>
<connor> very similar with both but you get the </connor>
<connor> more traditional welsh accent that you </connor>
<connor> might hear in movies and stuff from the </connor>
<joey> south yeah so </joey>
<joey> it's more of a dialect difference than a </joey>
<connor> pronunciation yeah yeah the the </connor>
<joey> dialect's pretty similar i mean it's </joey>
<joey> basically it's like translation </joey>
<joey> yeah so it's like japan yeah yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> it's because there's like the the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] history is so uh different </connor>
<connor> between the north and the south yeah the </connor>
<connor> south was like conquered by england for </connor>
<connor> a really long time and then north wasn't </connor>
<connor> so yeah it's way more welsh up north and </connor>
<connor> then it's it's you [ __ ] know you've </connor>
<connor> watched villain saga </connor>
<connor> just like they they lightly touch it a </connor>
<joey> little bit i'm jealous because australia </joey>
<joey> doesn't have that at all and i always </joey>
<joey> thought it was really cool because like </joey>
<garnt> you know american like the uk it's like </garnt>
<garnt> oh you can immediately tell where </garnt>
<joey> someone is from yeah yeah but in </joey>
<connor> australia we don't have that at all yeah </connor>
<connor> i really love the history of it but like </connor>
<connor> no one gives a [ __ ] so it's really </connor>
<joey> boring to talk about it and i i don't </joey>
<joey> want to talk about it if people are like </joey>
<connor> they're like [ __ ] resident sleeper </connor>
<joey> they're like </joey>
<joey> it's like yeah but video is pretty good </joey>
<connor> it's a [ __ ] mess it's pretty cool </connor>
<joey> though at least you got an anime </joey>
<joey> surrounding around and right right yeah </joey>
<connor> and you got one of the most about if </connor>
<connor> you've got england but at least we had a </connor>
<connor> scholar yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> you got one of the most badass </garnt>
<joey> characters in all of anime man </joey>
<joey> we got is [ __ ] five minutes in a </joey>
<connor> hetalia episode </connor>
<connor> uh you got rin from free </connor>
<connor> yeah oh wow </connor>
<connor> bro he's </connor>
<joey> when i did watch the free movie and i </joey>
<connor> saw sydney station i was like yeah </connor>
<garnt> let's go </garnt>
<garnt> i think the most representation i've had </garnt>
<garnt> is just like one guy from yuri on ice </garnt>
<joey> and that's that's it that was that no </joey>
<joey> what about the chaon movie that was set </joey>
<garnt> in the uk right now i'm talking about </garnt>
<garnt> thailand thailand oh thailand yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah like we had a one thai </garnt>
<connor> ice skater in yuri and ice and i </connor>
<connor> remember when i went to like there's </connor>
<connor> like a big anime chain in japan called </connor>

<connor> badass anime characters as well that's </connor>
<connor> pretty cool yeah he's definitely up </connor>
<connor> there and not because he's well that </connor>
<joey> might have bumped him up a few weeks we </joey>
<joey> just got like racially profiled by </joey>
<joey> hetalia character </joey>

<connor> back got an entire account wells didn't </connor>
<joey> even get one yeah every no every other </joey>
<joey> country got it yeah except whales </joey>
<joey> apparently whales didn't get it they </joey>
<connor> were like what are they [ __ ] doing </connor>
<joey> well </joey>
<connor> this is it again i've said i've said </connor>
<joey> this a billion times whales is a </joey>
<joey> branding problem we need a brand </joey>
<joey> the person in charge of welsh branding i </joey>
<joey> don't know who it is prime minister i </joey>
<joey> don't know we need to [ __ ] sort this </joey>
<joey> out we need to we need to have a game </joey>
<joey> plan of how we're going to brand what's </joey>
<joey> there in wells </joey>
<joey> see that's the thing what am i going to </joey>
<garnt> tell you like oh do you like history </garnt>
<garnt> great well there's loads but if not like </garnt>
<garnt> go need some [ __ ] sheep that's great </garnt>
<garnt> if you like lamb it's amazing we also </garnt>
<garnt> have some pretty good baked stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we have a lot of welsh cakes that's </garnt>
<connor> kind of good but i mean that's that's </connor>
<garnt> yeah because like because like to me </garnt>
<connor> like nature's yeah i've been to like </connor>
<connor> ireland and i'm like i [ __ ] love </connor>
<garnt> ireland like yeah it's like one of the </garnt>
<garnt> most aesthetic places i've ever been to </garnt>
<connor> like felix went to wales he loved it he </connor>
<connor> went to uh aberystwyth no i think it was </connor>
<connor> uh yeah yeah really cool looking place </connor>
<joey> that was inspired by like mediterranean </joey>
<joey> things yeah weirdly in like the west of </joey>
<joey> wales yeah yeah it's a really cool area </joey>
<joey> he sold me on wales yeah there's a lot </joey>
<joey> of really cool areas it's just like you </joey>
<joey> can't </joey>
<joey> like you can't drop up yeah like if you </joey>
<joey> if you just rock up without researching </joey>
<joey> where to go yeah you're gonna be like </joey>
<connor> where the f where the [ __ ] is everything </connor>
<joey> what is there to do like where am i if </joey>
<connor> you know what you're going for there's </connor>
<connor> some amazing hiking spots really </connor>
<connor> beautiful nature parks uh like a lot of </connor>
<connor> the north uh brecken beacons area is all </connor>
<connor> like nature reserves like nothing's </connor>
<connor> built there it's just just go hike </connor>
<joey> having a great time oh broken breakers </joey>
<garnt> is really good yeah yeah yeah um and uh </garnt>
<joey> yeah snowdonia uh snowden snow snowdonia </joey>
<garnt> snowdonia so that sounds like a place </garnt>
<garnt> from like game of thrones yeah that's </garnt>
<connor> like a pokemon series yeah i mean chris </connor>
<connor> has been up here yeah that's good uh </connor>
<joey> there's yeah there's a bunch of cool uh </joey>
<joey> seaside stuff that you can go to but </joey>
<connor> like yeah it depends yeah yeah you </connor>
<joey> really have to research because like </joey>
<connor> when you hear about people visiting the </connor>
<joey> uk obviously there is like english </joey>
<connor> islands yeah yeah and people are like oh </connor>
<joey> i [ __ ] love going to ireland because </joey>
<joey> like every [ __ ] fifth person here in </joey>
<garnt> america is apparently like </garnt>
<garnt> like half irish or some [ __ ] right but </garnt>
<garnt> then you also hear people talking about </garnt>
<connor> like yes scotland </connor>
<connor> i think it really helps for the uk </connor>
<joey> countries like okay you have london and </joey>
<joey> then you can branch out you have </joey>
<joey> scotland then you can branch out you've </joey>
<joey> got dublin then you can branch out it's </joey>
<joey> like you have card </joey>
<connor> even then cardiff is really far from all </connor>
<connor> the nature stuff like yeah it's kind of </connor>
<connor> weird in the u in wales where if you </connor>
<connor> want to kind of travel </connor>
<connor> via public transport up north you have </connor>
<connor> to go around and back up you don't you </connor>
<joey> don't go you can't just go through the </joey>
<joey> middle so if you go if you've got that </joey>
<joey> there's like a lot of mountains or oh </joey>
<joey> yeah there's a lot of mountains and it </joey>
<connor> didn't make sense to build the trains </connor>
<connor> there because it kind of connects </connor>
<connor> through england right and it goes back </connor>
<connor> in just like shrewsbury and stuff yeah </connor>
<connor> so if you go really far west and it's </connor>
<connor> just going on off on it's kind of really </connor>
<connor> annoying to get back up so if you're </connor>
<connor> going westward you plan your whole trip </connor>
<joey> to go west and then you go back right </joey>
<joey> it's kind of annoying to go back up like </joey>
<joey> you can if you want to go to like abba </joey>
<connor> dust with but that's no aberration is </connor>
<joey> down south we're saying no no that's a </joey>
<joey> tower there's so many fights </joey>
<joey> it's all it's all weird it's a really </joey>
<garnt> cool place if you plan your trip it'll </garnt>
<connor> be cool </connor>
<garnt> yeah there's again there's some amazing </garnt>
<garnt> stuff you got to show us around because </garnt>
<garnt> like i've never had like a guide for </garnt>
<connor> whales yes basically you have to bear in </connor>
<connor> mind my my experience with wales was </connor>
<connor> when i was like young and a kid so if </connor>
<connor> you're like a show me whales and i'm </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you yeah but i'm going to be like that </joey>
<joey> for australia yeah yeah sure like like </joey>
<joey> my view of sydney is going to be very </joey>
<connor> different </connor>
<connor> the average tourism yeah i think because </connor>
<connor> all my tourism was done in the confines </connor>
<connor> of like school trips and stuff yeah it's </connor>
<connor> like very like warped yeah what i </connor>
<connor> actually would think would be fun my </connor>
<connor> parents know that my parents love doing </connor>
<garnt> it they they like they're doing this </garnt>
<garnt> thing where they go all around wales </garnt>
<connor> like by walking right not in one go it's </connor>
<garnt> like in trips right right so they do a </garnt>
<connor> section and they go back and then they </connor>
<joey> do another section and then they go back </joey>
<joey> it's cool it's [ __ ] insane </joey>
<joey> my parents love walking yeah and </joey>
<joey> exercising i wish that rubbed off on me </joey>
<connor> it's like where's the clown i've got the </connor>
<connor> bare minimum of wanting to walk and </connor>
<joey> stuff yeah but uh yeah if you if you're </joey>
<connor> interested in like really convoluted and </connor>
<joey> complex history yeah you might want to </joey>
<joey> look into it it's kind of cool yeah it's </joey>
<joey> just about people trying to not be taken </joey>
<connor> over by the english for like 400 years </connor>
<joey> and then they fail more history more </joey>
<garnt> history than what we've got dude it's </garnt>
<garnt> pretty like pretty much every country on </garnt>
<connor> in like the uk right i think they did a </connor>
<connor> pretty good job look at the rest of the </connor>
<connor> world they didn't last very long against </connor>
<connor> england i think we did pretty good uh we </connor>
<connor> had a pretty good run </connor>
<joey> but it's pretty good right sir </joey>
<joey> yeah but i mean it's cool there's some </joey>
<joey> really funny history moments of i think </joey>
<joey> i've ever told that i've told that story </joey>
<joey> before about the castle like it took </joey>
<joey> over yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then i </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] loved that story yeah it's so </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] funny i wish we had like fun </joey>
<garnt> stories like that yeah like we don't we </garnt>
<garnt> don't know we didn't have any of that </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah we're just like yeah a bunch </garnt>
<connor> of convicts was just like [ __ ] you uk </connor>
<garnt> and then we just started our own country </garnt>
<connor> and uh yeah just a whole lot of uh </connor>
<garnt> racism and politics yeah yeah it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like it's because </garnt>
<joey> when sydney's family were visiting like </joey>
<joey> you take for granted just how much </joey>
<joey> history the uk has yeah because you </joey>
<joey> could you could show that like i i was </joey>
<joey> showing them just like even just like </joey>
<connor> seeing even them just seeing like </connor>
<connor> buildings yeah pubs that were just like </connor>
<connor> really old </connor>
<connor> that's like fast that was like </connor>
<connor> fascinating yeah many churches in the uk </connor>
<joey> have been around since uh over 1400 </joey>
<connor> years yeah like there's a lot of </connor>
<joey> churches that are still like built in </joey>
<connor> eight eight hundred like this is just </connor>
<garnt> insane yeah they're still there it's </garnt>
<garnt> crazy and it's like we take for granted </garnt>
<garnt> just having like a country with like </garnt>
<garnt> history in it whereas like i think if </garnt>
<connor> you're like over 25 or something in </connor>
<connor> america then you've like been alive for </connor>
<connor> like a tenth of the entire country's </connor>
<connor> history yeah </connor>
<connor> your entire country's age and that's </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] that just [ __ ] blows my </connor>
<garnt> mind you know </garnt>
<connor> that there's a country that that is that </connor>
<connor> young but then you get you run into the </connor>
<connor> issue of like okay i want to learn about </connor>
<connor> uk history where do i start and then you </connor>
<connor> go with the highlights but then when you </connor>
<connor> start digging into stuff you're like </connor>
<connor> this is really [ __ ] convoluted right </connor>
<connor> okay so they took over and then another </connor>
<connor> guy took over and then another guy took </connor>
<connor> over and then england got taken over by </connor>
<connor> vikings and then now it's the french </connor>
<joey> yeah it's convoluted but it's super </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] fascinating if you're into that </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] right that's what makes it even </connor>
<connor> cooler that all like some of these </connor>
<connor> churches and stuff have lasted like </connor>
<connor> being taken over like 10 different times </connor>
<connor> yeah right like it's like how the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> did this it's the exact same thing with </joey>
<connor> like japanese history as well yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and that's what makes it so fascinating </connor>
<connor> for history like fanatics right but it's </connor>
<connor> like you know [ __ ] yeah australia's not </connor>
<connor> even 250 years old yeah we [ __ ] were </connor>
<connor> founded in </connor>
<joey> 1777 i think 78 yeah yeah which is like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like the uk had like already </joey>
<joey> figured this [ __ ] out </joey>
<joey> we were just like oh what the [ __ ] do we </joey>
<connor> do </connor>
<connor> like a lot of modern like a lot of </connor>
<connor> countries that we know today and we're </connor>
<connor> like super used to like i'm very new </connor>
<joey> yeah i think finland is only like 100 </joey>
<connor> years old yeah oh germany yeah yeah like </connor>
<connor> to think that germany like was like like </connor>
<connor> a completely different [ __ ] thing </connor>
<connor> yeah like because we've been alive our </connor>
<connor> whole life i mean our whole life is like </connor>
<garnt> angela merkel like it's so weird when </garnt>
<connor> you're like these countries are not like </connor>
<connor> they weren't a thing yeah i don't think </connor>
<garnt> germany want to talk about that yeah </garnt>
<connor> they don't </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> actually they do talk about it a lot </connor>
<connor> they're like be ashamed </connor>
<connor> i don't know how we got onto countries </connor>
<connor> or whatever the [ __ ] but i mean i love </connor>
<connor> talking about history and countries i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm obsessed with history i love </connor>
<connor> it so much yeah and uh but there's just </connor>
<garnt> too much to learn </garnt>
<garnt> i just that's just too much i gotta pick </garnt>
<connor> an era you know like i i get so jealous </connor>
<connor> when i meet people who are like dude i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] love the byzantine era and i'm </connor>
<joey> like [ __ ] dude that's just like i've </joey>
<joey> i've heard of that from age vampires </joey>
<connor> it's like it's like i feel like i'm a </connor>
<connor> history buff but then someone talks to </connor>
<joey> me about like ancient rome and egypt </joey>
<connor> yeah like [ __ ] i wish i had like i wish </connor>
<connor> that was the stuff i was really </connor>
<connor> interested yeah i just loved like the </connor>
<connor> past 1000 years </connor>
<garnt> even though that's pushing it </garnt>
<garnt> i i love like the ancient stuff you know </garnt>
<connor> yeah but then you feel like is your </connor>
<connor> history more better </connor>
<connor> is your history </connor>
<joey> it's like is it more significant because </joey>
<connor> like the romans yeah okay dude that's </connor>
<connor> kind of that's kind of [ __ ] sick yeah </connor>
<connor> you can't you can't go up against it </connor>
