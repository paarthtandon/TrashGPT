<garnt> I think Breaking Bad epitomizes </garnt>
<joey> everything that I guess does not </joey>
<garnt> interest me I prefer the later seasons </garnt>
<joey> of Game of Thrones [ __ ] oh God genuinely </joey>
<connor> welcome back to this episode of trash </connor>
<garnt> taste I'm Connor with the boys Garden </garnt>
<connor> Jay and today with a special episode yes </connor>
<connor> only fit to be viewed on the TV hope you </connor>
<joey> are chromecasting this or you have a </joey>
<joey> built-in Chromecast in your TV Apple TV </joey>
<joey> the point is it's going to be on your TV </joey>
<joey> because this is the TV episode we talk </joey>
<joey> about some of our favorite TV shows of </joey>
<joey> all time and roast each other's tastes </joey>
<joey> we're going to be picking nine shows </joey>
<joey> each and then we're both gonna be </joey>
<joey> raiding the other persons three by three </joey>
<connor> babies </connor>
<garnt> because I've missed the three by three </garnt>
<garnt> format you know I've missed it because </garnt>
<garnt> we it's been actually like a long time </garnt>
<garnt> since we did our last three bites what </garnt>
<connor> was the last three by three weeks I </connor>
<joey> think it was like music right music </joey>
<garnt> that feels like a [ __ ] eternity </garnt>
<garnt> I like what's better than just talking </garnt>
<garnt> about [ __ ] that you like you know and uh </garnt>
<joey> just not arguing every like five seconds </joey>
<connor> about I mean we are gonna be arguing you </connor>
<connor> had a lot of difficulty picking your </connor>
<joey> list yeah yeah yeah because I it wasn't </joey>
<garnt> until I was making by 3x3 I realized I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't really grow up watching a whole </garnt>
<garnt> lot of like variety of TV yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um so I really I had to actually text my </garnt>
<connor> sister to be like what the [ __ ] did we </connor>
<garnt> watch growing up because I legitimately </garnt>
<connor> don't remember so how can I see that </connor>
<connor> good TV if you don't [ __ ] remember it </connor>
<joey> well no I remembered it and she reminded </joey>
<joey> me because we were both like uh what the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] was it what is my favorite TV show </connor>
<connor> of all time I couldn't tell you I can't </connor>
<garnt> remember it no no well actually it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's I I had a similar problem to Joey </garnt>
<joey> in that I haven't I don't think I've </joey>
<joey> actually seen that many TV shows yeah </joey>
<joey> right yeah or like seen it down to like </joey>
<garnt> the end or have like an emotional </garnt>
<joey> attachment yeah like there's lots of </joey>
<joey> that I've seen But like they haven't </joey>
<joey> really stuck with me or they've I don't </joey>
<joey> really feel that strongly about them </joey>
<garnt> yeah because let me tell you the </garnt>
<garnt> difference between like a TV show and an </garnt>
<joey> anime anime 24 episodes one season you </joey>
<garnt> can binge that in a night if you wanted </garnt>
<garnt> to uh you start a TV series and it's </garnt>
<garnt> like hey here's nine seasons of 24 </garnt>
<garnt> episodes that's an hour long true and </garnt>
<connor> that's like that's like a you know a </connor>
<joey> fairly middle length TV yeah if you talk </joey>
<joey> about some of the most famous TV shows </joey>
<garnt> like Breaking Bad or something that's </garnt>
<garnt> Five Seasons That's so short in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> like I mean for Americans </garnt>
<joey> right so so the the rule uh is that we </joey>
<joey> decided to not include any anime because </joey>
<joey> we've already done an anime </joey>
<joey> um we can do it was like a mix of </joey>
<joey> basically it was like any TV show right </joey>
<joey> so it's like a mix between like Western </joey>
<joey> cartoons like uh narrative driven like </joey>
<connor> TV shows like just TV programming we </connor>
<joey> used to watch literally anything series </joey>
<garnt> yes episodes yeah and so basically </garnt>
<joey> anything that's not anime because it's </joey>
<joey> not anime and a movie I can name off </joey>
<garnt> more anime that I've watched than whole </garnt>
<garnt> than the entire broad spectrum of TV </garnt>
<connor> shows in every country I feel like my </connor>
<connor> list or gaunts List uh could easily have </connor>
<joey> been my list I'm pretty sure I know what </joey>
<connor> God's gonna put on his and I I could </connor>
<joey> have put them on mine but I was like </joey>
<connor> God's gonna put them on his so I'll let </connor>
<joey> go and talk about it mine's gonna be </joey>
<garnt> some weird [ __ ] I hope so when isn't it </garnt>
<garnt> Joe when is </garnt>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<garnt> this I definitely felt more like a </garnt>
<garnt> casual coming into this like than a lot </garnt>
<connor> of other I watched the most TV out of </connor>
<connor> the three of us probably probably </connor>
<garnt> yeah because like I discovered anime </garnt>
<connor> really early I discovered anime really </connor>
<garnt> early in life so I'm like why would I </garnt>
<garnt> need to watch TV when I have anime guys </garnt>
<connor> come on I don't know like you know </connor>
<connor> sometimes anime is great but sometimes </connor>
<connor> you need you need like a bit of Jack </connor>
<garnt> Bauer 24 in your life to like spice </garnt>
<garnt> things up yeah I mean like yeah I I get </garnt>
<connor> that as well and I like that one of them </connor>
<connor> that's not one of them that could be on </connor>
<connor> my list really I love 24. I don't think </connor>
<connor> I've seen a single episode of 24. 24 was </connor>
<connor> like the thing I watched when I was 15 </connor>
<connor> I'm like this is so [ __ ] I know enough </connor>
<joey> about 24 through osmosis but I've never </joey>
<joey> sat down on any episode is the uh </joey>
<connor> movement of uh water particles by the </connor>
<joey> way yeah </joey>
<connor> but it's about wow do you mean the </connor>
<connor> future did you just come actually </connor>
<garnt> yeah I mean like there's a lot of TV </garnt>
<joey> shows that I've watched like I've </joey>
<joey> actually seen 24 but I've only like I've </joey>
<joey> only seen one season of 24. I've seen </joey>
<joey> like three four seasons of Lost I've </joey>
<joey> seen two seasons of house but like it </joey>
<joey> takes up so much time I've watched a lot </joey>
<connor> of TV but I've been a commitment yeah </connor>
<connor> I've never I've I've really done in my </connor>
<connor> student days yeah I've already finished </connor>
<connor> TV shows right up until the end just </connor>
<connor> because there's so much </connor>
<connor> yeah that's why I had a hard time </connor>
<connor> choosing fair enough yeah well should we </connor>
<garnt> leave it to trash station </garnt>
<connor> space is like almost gone yeah it is </connor>
<connor> a battered Warfare yeah all right who's </connor>
<connor> going first </connor>
<connor> I don't know who's gonna go first </connor>
<connor> oh it's you it is you Connor I guess </connor>
<connor> that works all right all right Kai bring </connor>
<connor> up Connor's three by three all right uh </connor>
<connor> for those of you in case this is your </connor>
<connor> first time you're watching a trash Chase </connor>
<connor> 3x3 video we should do a quick </connor>
<connor> explanation what a three by three is </connor>
<connor> basically it's as the name suggests it's </connor>
<joey> a box three squares by three squares </joey>
<joey> nine in total and it's basically nine </joey>
<joey> whatever the the topic is in this case </joey>
<joey> TV series that you feel strongly about </joey>
<joey> or you grew up with or you really enjoy </joey>
<connor> you really like you want to share so </connor>
<garnt> these a lot of these are some of my </garnt>
<joey> favorites but maybe some there's a good </joey>
<connor> story behind it all yeah that's what </connor>
<joey> it's helped me yeah yeah basically </joey>
<joey> you'll get a good idea of what that </joey>
<joey> person's personality is like based on </joey>
<joey> their three by three yeah that's mine </joey>
<joey> that's mine </joey>
<garnt> before starting can I just say this is </garnt>
<connor> the worst cropping I've ever seen </connor>
<connor> I did not care to hand mode </connor>
<connor> Kane is there any way we can see God </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] on the top of the bottom dude I </joey>
<joey> can't even see the title of Mad Men </joey>
<connor> because it's yeah </connor>
<connor> they put this big ass [ __ ] oval of </connor>
<connor> watermelon I'm like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> whatever I I was like looking for mine I </garnt>
<connor> liked I tried to look for like Square </connor>
<connor> images </connor>
<garnt> I've never seen of Kane or well I'll </garnt>
<connor> explain what they're all in hunting so </connor>
<connor> let's go which way are we gonna how do </connor>
<joey> you guys want to do it uh just go </joey>
<joey> through them all I mean okay so actually </joey>
<connor> before we get into it I'll just tell </connor>
<joey> which each show is and then we'll talk </joey>
<joey> about it yeah please number one Banger </joey>
<connor> Hannah Montana number two in the the </connor>
<connor> Middle top yeah yeah sure top right </connor>
<connor> Arcane middle left better call Soul </connor>
<joey> middle task master uh middle right </joey>
<connor> Futurama bottom left come dine with me </connor>
<joey> bottom middle yeah bottom right is Mad </joey>
<joey> Men okay yes I was I was wondering see </joey>
<joey> because I've seen this image through </joey>
<garnt> memes let's let's start with custom </garnt>
<connor> designs you should come really loudly </connor>
<connor> yeah that triggered a response in me </connor>
<garnt> um I'm assuming you didn't put it on </garnt>
<garnt> your list gone yes I didn't I didn't </garnt>
<connor> yeah but there's a yes I did yes I did </connor>
<garnt> okay yes no there are a few things here </garnt>
<joey> that I very much considered putting on </joey>
<joey> uh I was very close to the funny future </joey>
<garnt> Futurama very very close come down with </garnt>
<garnt> me as well I think is pretty much the </garnt>
<connor> only I I made my list and I was like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you can tell I'm white without </connor>
<joey> looking I was like I felt like I made it </joey>
<garnt> and I was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> but that's fine I am right I too enjoy </joey>
<garnt> Television right so let me explain come </garnt>
<garnt> down with me to those who don't know </garnt>
<joey> it's a British TV show and it's </joey>
<joey> fantastic I swear this thing is shot in </joey>
<connor> like a budget like a hundred dollars </connor>
<joey> yeah um they they add like one every day </joey>
<connor> I don't like understand how this works </connor>
<connor> it's like they air so many of these </connor>
<connor> goddamn episodes how many episodes have </connor>
<connor> come down with me in the UK is that so </connor>
<connor> the the whole concept behind this TV </connor>
<garnt> show is you get four strangers yeah who </garnt>
<garnt> all are very proud of their cooking and </garnt>
<garnt> their house and the idea is is that once </garnt>
<garnt> in this in this nice uh is it an hour or </garnt>
<garnt> 30 minutes uh I think it's about 30 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes 30 minutes they all go do you </garnt>
<garnt> get a Womp </garnt>
<garnt> who's everyone </garnt>
<joey> so it's four people competing against </joey>
<joey> each sometimes five sometimes five okay </joey>
<joey> but most of the time it's four people </joey>
<garnt> and these four people going to take it </garnt>
<garnt> in turns to host a dinner party that's </garnt>
<garnt> better than me yeah yeah yeah I guess </garnt>
<garnt> and within uh within the spin party they </garnt>
<garnt> have to impress the guests as much as </garnt>
<garnt> possible not just with the food but with </garnt>
<garnt> the experience of their home dining </garnt>
<garnt> experience right right uh so sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> they put as much effort into like </garnt>
<garnt> personalize their home dining experience </garnt>
<garnt> as possible and at the end of the day </garnt>
<garnt> um each contestant rates how good their </garnt>
<garnt> experience was and how good the night </garnt>
<connor> was and how good the night was </connor>
<garnt> atmosphere yeah but obviously right like </garnt>
<garnt> you're is everyone's voting for each </garnt>
<connor> other it's kind of a trust system of are </connor>
<garnt> you not going to be a dick yeah give </garnt>
<connor> everyone else a one because you want to </connor>
<garnt> win yeah and so it kind of has a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> really fun elements to it a lot of snide </garnt>
<garnt> moments but also the best part of the </garnt>
<garnt> show is the cringe it's so good because </garnt>
<garnt> you get a bunch of just generic office </garnt>
<garnt> workers just normal people yeah you tell </garnt>
<garnt> them they're a dinner party for random </garnt>
<connor> strangers on camera and it's just it's </connor>
<connor> fantastic and then they also decided and </connor>
<connor> this is probably the best part of the </connor>
<connor> show yeah they decided that they were </connor>
<connor> gonna make the narrator just a guy who </connor>
<connor> just takes the piss out of everything </connor>
<connor> they do classic British is just </connor>
<connor> completely sarcastic right 24 7. and it </connor>
<connor> just keeps the show going and it keeps </connor>
<garnt> you uh keeps you invested this to me </garnt>
<connor> come down to me this to me is Peak </connor>
<garnt> British reality TV because like I </garnt>
<connor> imagine like a come dine with me in </connor>
<garnt> America God every time I say come now I </garnt>
<garnt> can't I can't </garnt>
<garnt> come down with me oh my God like every </garnt>
<garnt> if I imagine like can you imagine an </garnt>
<garnt> American come down with me it'll be like </garnt>
<garnt> it would be like the most over the top </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> it's great there's like there's very </joey>
<joey> minimal editing it's really strong it's </joey>
<garnt> really stale it's like the the thing </garnt>
<joey> that shines about this is just British </joey>
<garnt> sarcasm and Sass because they never say </garnt>
<garnt> that they have a bad experience yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> that's what makes it good right right </garnt>
<garnt> how would you how would you not insult </garnt>
<garnt> the uh the host of this dinner party </garnt>
<garnt> while we're while still insulting the </garnt>
<garnt> host of this dinner party right it's </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] fantastic and like most of the </connor>
<connor> time it's like four very average or </connor>
<connor> below average Cooks just giving each </connor>
<joey> other [ __ ] right for not I feel like </joey>
<connor> I've definitely seen Clips yeah it's </connor>
<connor> really good and </connor>
<connor> things what were they like while the </connor>
<connor> person's cooking I'm pretty sure the </connor>
<connor> producer's like hey go and Snoop around </connor>
<connor> their house and look at things and </connor>
<garnt> comment and they just like raid each </garnt>
<garnt> other's houses it's so bizarre but it's </garnt>
<garnt> really fun and I do oh my God it's just </garnt>
<joey> the the amount of bickering and just </joey>
<joey> bitchiness involved which is fantastic </joey>
<garnt> and it's just so like surface level yeah </garnt>
<joey> like a concert they don't ever say it </joey>
<connor> they'll be like well Timothy's quiche </connor>
<connor> was rather cold so I'm gonna have to </connor>
<connor> dock five points for that and it's like </connor>
<connor> what what do you mean like you're making </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up like you just made it up or like </connor>
<connor> someone be like the food was all amazing </connor>
<connor> and one person would be like actually I </connor>
<connor> hated it it was not the difference it's </connor>
<garnt> like you're right it was it sucked I I </garnt>
<garnt> think there's one clip where someone </garnt>
<garnt> actually did properly go off like there </garnt>
<garnt> was actually drama and it's one of my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite like television clips of all </garnt>
<garnt> time she's like like because a guy was </garnt>
<garnt> like really really salty that someone </garnt>
<connor> else had won right and by the way oh </connor>
<connor> I've I know this he stands up right and </connor>
<garnt> he stands up what what yeah by the way </garnt>
<connor> the winner they only get like a hundred </connor>
<connor> quid or something </connor>
<connor> it doesn't recover the cost to cook the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] food people are playing for </connor>
<connor> pride and there's there's one clip once </connor>
<connor> one guy gets so [ __ ] salty that </connor>
<connor> someone else wins and it's like one of </connor>
<connor> my favorite moments in TV because he </connor>
<connor> because he just starts like it's the </connor>
<garnt> most British insults that he just starts </garnt>
<garnt> throwing out and he just goes well Phil </garnt>
<garnt> three to get the [ __ ] out of my house </garnt>
<garnt> you reverse out of this like uh you </garnt>
<garnt> reverse you reverse you know you walk </garnt>
<garnt> with the grace of a dump truck or </garnt>
<connor> something like that it was so good can </connor>
<connor> we play the clip me down please you won </connor>
<connor> Jane enjoy the money but I hope now you </connor>
<connor> spend it on getting some lessons in </connor>
<connor> Grace and decorum because you have all </connor>
<connor> the grace of a reversing dump truck </connor>
<connor> without any tires on oh my God it's it's </connor>
<connor> just fantastic and it's just like if to </connor>
<connor> me it's what reality TV should be right </connor>
<connor> yeah it's like none of this like ruins </connor>
<connor> someone's life or just make them [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> miserable or just sell sex sex sex sex </connor>
<garnt> it's like let's just get people to cook </garnt>
<garnt> for each other and just let them do like </garnt>
<connor> just give them the tools to have their </connor>
<garnt> own destruction like just saying hey </garnt>
<connor> bring their food right and just see what </connor>
<connor> happens and it's fantastic I think </connor>
<garnt> there's like a bazillion episodes yeah </garnt>
<garnt> there is 151 episodes </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> 1051. 1051 episodes yeah basically you </connor>
<connor> know you know that TV show that just </connor>
<connor> always seems to be always on this every </connor>
<connor> day this is always on in one channel or </connor>
<connor> another if it's not one like channel </connor>
<garnt> four then it's on one of like the reruns </garnt>
<garnt> of like one of the other channels it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't matter I'm surprised it even has </garnt>
<connor> Seasons like it's really good yeah it's </connor>
<connor> very and this is that which is where </connor>
<garnt> that iconic uh meme comes from where the </garnt>
<garnt> guy puts the the uh The Colony </garnt>
<connor> it's so gross it's so like revolting but </connor>
<connor> it's like it sums up like home cooking I </connor>
<connor> just do it my way yeah yeah you know </connor>
<joey> what I mean I don't know </joey>
<joey> um okay so I obviously I know Futurama </joey>
<garnt> uh Hannah Montana obviously keep sure </garnt>
<joey> you guys talk about I feel like you've </joey>
<joey> told me about people sick on the British </joey>
<garnt> shows then for now let's just go right </garnt>
<garnt> to this let's go to Taskmaster okay so </garnt>
<garnt> people should then test match okay yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah okay okay so Peep Show yeah uh I </connor>
<connor> will explain it poorly you've explained </connor>
<connor> it to me before I remember yeah </connor>
<connor> um so imagine two British people whose </connor>
<connor> life is just not going the way they </connor>
<connor> wanted right and instead of like </connor>
<connor> actually doing anything about it they </connor>
<connor> just take it out on each other and just </connor>
<connor> cause the most cringe situations for </connor>
<joey> everyone around them and themselves so </joey>
<joey> this isn't like this is like narrative </joey>
<connor> right like it's fiction or it's fiction </connor>
<connor> and it's but it's not like reality TV </connor>
<connor> right it is it is one of the most </connor>
<connor> intentionally cringe shows in existence </connor>
<connor> right yeah if you love cringe humor this </connor>
<connor> is this is the king of it right there's </connor>
<connor> no show that even comes close to this I </connor>
<joey> mean I think the first episode opens up </joey>
<joey> uh with Jeremy who is one of the two </joey>
<joey> main characters of Jeremy and Mark uh </joey>
<joey> Mark is played by David Mitchell who is </joey>
<connor> a fantastic kind of he's really great at </connor>
<connor> playing these Weasley characters yeah </connor>
<connor> like he's kind of like weasel looking </connor>
<connor> characters that are very like and he </connor>
<connor> plays that amazingly he plays this kind </connor>
<connor> of timid but very like the sky is way </connor>
<connor> smarter than he is Michael Sierra like </connor>
<connor> type or Michael Sierra if what </connor>
<connor> have to go wrong in Michael's here alive </connor>
<connor> to be </connor>
<connor> that bad it's like it's like imagine of </connor>
<joey> actually somewhat intelligent 40 year </joey>
<joey> old man who just made all the wrong life </joey>
<joey> decisions all right and is angry at the </joey>
<connor> world for it right and so he kind of </connor>
<joey> thinks that he's owed more than he gets </joey>
<connor> and so he just takes it out on everyone </connor>
<joey> else in a very British way right and he </joey>
<joey> just takes it out on Jeremy but Jeremy </joey>
<connor> is also just a giant buffoon yeah he's </connor>
<connor> an idiot right and the first episode </connor>
<connor> opens up I believe with </connor>
<connor> um Jeremy meets this girl who's wearing </connor>
<connor> like a beanie and he's like oh she's so </connor>
<joey> cute I want to have sex with her and </joey>
<joey> then I think they get together finds out </joey>
<joey> she has cancer and then doesn't want to </joey>
<garnt> be with her anymore and tries to kind of </garnt>
<joey> break it off in a really weird way and </joey>
<garnt> it's just so cringe where he's trying to </garnt>
<garnt> like he said because he doesn't fully </garnt>
<garnt> understand like he knows what cancer is </garnt>
<garnt> because he's never met anyone with it </garnt>
<garnt> he's just really [ __ ] awful yeah </garnt>
<garnt> being able to even remotely understand </garnt>
<joey> how to talk to someone with cancer yeah </joey>
<joey> so he's just like he's like when did </joey>
<joey> this come out it's like 2009 okay so I </joey>
<connor> was going to say this very 2000's human </connor>
<connor> yeah no no this is like this this is </connor>
<garnt> easily air today </garnt>
<connor> at all this is age like perfectly </connor>
<connor> because I still watch it to this day </connor>
<connor> right right me and Sydney still binge </connor>
<garnt> all of the seasons unfortunately one of </garnt>
<garnt> the bad things about British televisions </garnt>
<garnt> unlike Americans keeping Seasons yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah every like there's like seven </garnt>
<garnt> seasons of Peep Show but like every </garnt>
<garnt> season has six episodes that's and </garnt>
<connor> that's six half an hour episodes as well </connor>
<connor> but like this is what I really love </connor>
<connor> about sunbridge TV shows it really feels </connor>
<connor> like it earns the six episodes 30 </connor>
<connor> minutes each where it's like there is </connor>
<connor> not a single beat Mist in this show yeah </connor>
<connor> like there is no episode that sucks yeah </connor>
<connor> there's no episode that isn't funny and </connor>
<connor> there's no episode where there isn't </connor>
<connor> like five moments that isn't gonna make </connor>
<garnt> you laugh out loud yeah right right just </garnt>
<garnt> like I sometimes it's just every almost </garnt>
<garnt> every episode I think in Peep Show is an </garnt>
<garnt> absolute Banger there are some lines </garnt>
<garnt> that are just like stuck with me for </garnt>
<connor> like my entire life there's okay there's </connor>
<connor> a there's a completely unrelated plot </connor>
<connor> line I feel like this sums it up so well </connor>
<connor> yeah uh there's a there's a there's an </connor>
<connor> episode where Jeremy is one of the </connor>
<connor> characters uh Works in a gym and Mark is </connor>
<connor> going to this gym and doesn't really </connor>
<connor> want to go to it but it's kind of being </connor>
<connor> forced to and Jeremy for some why does </connor>
<connor> Jeremy want to not go to the gym anymore </connor>
<garnt> he does why does he not want to work </garnt>
<garnt> there I can't remember why </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> I remember what he does I remember oh I </garnt>
<garnt> think he joined it to get with a girl or </garnt>
<connor> something like that yeah so he joins the </connor>
<connor> gym to get with this attractive uh other </connor>
<connor> worker there yeah and meanwhile Mark </connor>
<connor> doesn't want to go to the gym anymore </connor>
<connor> right so he makes up this elaborate </connor>
<connor> excuse that one of the masseuses touched </connor>
<joey> him yeah and it's like it's this whole </joey>
<joey> awkward ordeal where he has to go to the </joey>
<joey> office to the manager yeah and awkwardly </joey>
<joey> explain that he was touched while the </joey>
<joey> guy is there the masseuse right it's </joey>
<joey> just this stumbling horrible </joey>
<connor> cringe-inducing thing and and he and he </connor>
<connor> touched me and the guy said what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] I didn't touch you and then to get </connor>
<connor> fired because Jeremy doesn't want to </connor>
<connor> work there anymore he like shits in the </connor>
<joey> pool and then tries to blame somebody </joey>
<joey> else it's this whole like it's just it </joey>
<joey> goes from zero to a hundred every single </joey>
<joey> episode where everything just </joey>
<connor> accumulates and and builds and it's just </connor>
<joey> fantastic it's so good yeah it's it's </joey>
<garnt> cringe humor at its best it's British </garnt>
<connor> humor at its best </connor>
<connor> um if you want to feel like you're </connor>
<connor> British for some reason why I don't know </connor>
<connor> what you would watch this TV show tell </connor>
<connor> them to tell the British person you've </connor>
<garnt> watched this show they'll love you </garnt>
<garnt> exactly I mean Sydney [ __ ] loves this </garnt>
<joey> show that's you know and that's how I </joey>
<joey> knew that she could understand British </joey>
<joey> humor if you can get Peep Show because I </joey>
<joey> show Peep Show to my mum and dad they're </joey>
<connor> like why why is this it's too much for </connor>
<garnt> my parents as well yeah it's too much </garnt>
<garnt> cringe it's a lot yeah there is not a </garnt>
<connor> single episode where you won't be </connor>
<garnt> uncomfortable yeah the way the best way </garnt>
<joey> I can describe it is like just imagine </joey>
<joey> two [ __ ] [ __ ] and try not to be </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] but in the end of the day </joey>
<joey> they're just they're just trying to get </joey>
<joey> on with life but they somehow find </joey>
<joey> themselves in the worst [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> situations right now it's so good and </joey>
<joey> like it's not just even these two </joey>
<joey> characters there's so many like </joey>
<joey> if you've lived in England you've like </joey>
<joey> recognized who these people are because </joey>
<joey> there's like some you know you know </joey>
<garnt> somebody sometimes you have a show that </garnt>
<garnt> you it's a bit it's a bit too close to </garnt>
<garnt> home sometimes yeah because there are </garnt>
<garnt> some characters that you kind of </garnt>
<joey> recognize as a person that you've met in </joey>
<joey> your life before in the UK yeah </joey>
<joey> um like one of one character that stands </joey>
<joey> out to me is like super hands oh my God </joey>
<joey> I think I think Super hands who's just </joey>
<garnt> that guy who just brings drugs to </garnt>
<joey> everything right and and he's just like </joey>
<connor> he's just lost control of his life right </connor>
<joey> right why is he called Superhead no one </joey>
<garnt> knows no one knows this guy's just </garnt>
<garnt> insane and like there's you know it's </garnt>
<garnt> also shot really interestingly it's all </garnt>
<garnt> POV yeah I think that's why it's called </garnt>
<garnt> Peep Show yeah yeah because yeah and </garnt>
<joey> they shoot the scenes multiple times but </joey>
<joey> like so the camera keeps swapping </joey>
<joey> between the povs in the scenes so it's </joey>
<connor> never a uh an angle of like okay his </connor>
<connor> over the shoulder it's like it's always </connor>
<connor> POV oh which makes for some really good </connor>
<connor> moments because a lot of the times </connor>
<connor> really really awkward moments hit so </connor>
<connor> hard because the person who sees you </connor>
<connor> that the awkward thing happened looks </connor>
<joey> directly at the camera yeah and it's </joey>
<connor> looking at it like you did it yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's really good it's so good it's </connor>
<connor> really interesting and it's just amazing </connor>
<connor> again it's it's I know the TV show is </connor>
<connor> kind of shot like this to my knowledge </connor>
<garnt> and it just works yeah oh that's </garnt>
<garnt> interesting yeah watch Peep Show it's </garnt>
<joey> amazing I know I know you guys like rave </joey>
<connor> on about it yeah and the POV thing also </connor>
<connor> makes it feel very uncomfortable because </connor>
<joey> you're often in the face right there's a </joey>
<connor> lot and it feels like you're there you </connor>
<garnt> kind of feel like okay this is cool </garnt>

<garnt> your house and kill you </garnt>
<connor> bye back to the episode yeah and then </connor>
<connor> obviously Taskmaster yeah which I think </connor>
<joey> is it's okay so Taskmaster let me </joey>
<joey> explain it before I get into it but I </joey>
<joey> think this shows is is blowing up and </joey>
<joey> it's gonna blow up a [ __ ] ton in the US </joey>
<joey> as well more I know a lot of people have </joey>
<connor> recently coming up to him from the US </connor>
<joey> like have you heard a single task master </joey>
<connor> I'm like yeah yes it's very old in the </connor>
<garnt> UK right uh it's I don't even know how </garnt>
<connor> you explain this uh you get a bunch of </connor>
<garnt> comedians together yeah I actually </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to do a task master for after </garnt>
<connor> dark yeah we definitely want to do this </connor>
<connor> at something yeah the format is just </connor>
<garnt> gold yes okay so so basically such good </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like a game show but not </garnt>
<garnt> really and now that you've put </garnt>
<garnt> Taskmaster on I'm like [ __ ] I have so </garnt>
<garnt> many shows I should have put on my list </garnt>
<garnt> that I completely forgot there was this </garnt>
<joey> genre so that that happens a lot yeah I </joey>
<connor> wanted to put up a panel or slash kind </connor>
<garnt> of thingy type kind of yeah so I think </garnt>
<garnt> this is like a very British genre of TV </garnt>
<garnt> show which is why I completely forgot </garnt>
<garnt> about it where it's kind of like this </garnt>
<connor> British panel slash game right but the </connor>
<connor> get but the uh the uh but what you don't </connor>
<connor> try to do in this game show is Win </connor>
<joey> basically they just try to be as </joey>
<connor> entertaining as possible right so with </connor>
<joey> task master it's basically like a game </joey>
<joey> show where you take a bunch of comedians </joey>
<joey> on and then you give them the same task </joey>
<garnt> right it could be anything right could </garnt>
<garnt> range from getting a marble out of a </garnt>
<garnt> bottle that's been sealed and like full </garnt>
<connor> of jelly or some [ __ ] right there's some </connor>
<garnt> really obscure like things that you're </garnt>
<garnt> like why would you do this like yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> know there'll be like 30 shocks and be </garnt>
<garnt> like find the orange yeah a sock but all </garnt>
<garnt> of them will have something different </garnt>
<connor> and you're allowed to like sniff three </connor>
<garnt> or touch two right yeah so so they give </garnt>
<garnt> stuff yeah so they're given like a very </garnt>
<garnt> they're given a very Ambiguously worded </garnt>
<garnt> task right Sometimes some tasks are more </garnt>
<garnt> ambiguous than others but it's up to the </garnt>
<garnt> contestant to figure out what is the </garnt>
<joey> best way to do this task right and so </joey>
<garnt> there's always like a life hack to </garnt>
<garnt> solving it yeah yeah there's there's not </garnt>
<connor> always a life so it'll be just a house </connor>
<connor> and you can do anything in the house </connor>
<connor> with the challenge so like for one </connor>
<connor> challenge it'll be like they'll be in a </connor>
<connor> room and they'll be like hide three </connor>
<connor> eggplants in the room okay whoever hides </connor>
<connor> their eggplants the longest from the guy </connor>
<connor> searching wins yeah all right so it's </connor>
<connor> like you know some some contestants hide </connor>
<joey> the eggplant others Smash Up the </joey>
<joey> eggplant and try to like squish it into </joey>
<joey> something yeah yeah you know and some </joey>
<joey> people start eating whole eggplants yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like there's the rules are always </connor>
<connor> set so ambiguous where any </connor>
<garnt> interpretation is correct and it's up to </garnt>
<garnt> the Taskmaster to decide if somebody </garnt>
<garnt> deserves the point based on yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> know because maybe somebody did </garnt>
<garnt> something it's a little a little too </garnt>
<connor> cheeky in the Taskmaster Yeah by Greg </connor>
<connor> Davis who's amazing we'll be like no I </connor>
<garnt> don't like that yeah that's why it's </garnt>
<garnt> like perfect for trash days because we </garnt>
<connor> can't follow the rules oh [ __ ] yes so </connor>
<connor> the rules are ambiguous and then you </connor>
<connor> never follow them and then the guy in </connor>
<garnt> charge just changed his mind yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so so that's that's that's the </garnt>
<connor> point right I'm sure a lot of people be </connor>
<connor> like I can't believe he lost this task </connor>
<joey> because he didn't follow the rules </joey>
<connor> correctly well that's not really the </connor>
<joey> point of task master the point of task </joey>
<joey> master is just to see the funny ways </joey>
<joey> that different people can get creative </joey>
<garnt> different people approach the same time </garnt>
<garnt> right right oh that sounds fun yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and and you can go as out of the box as </garnt>
<garnt> you want the only important thing is you </garnt>
<joey> gotta it's kind of like you kind of </joey>
<joey> gotta like </joey>
<joey> try to not to take the piss but also </joey>
<joey> take the piss as well right so I </joey>
<joey> remember what like one one task I </joey>
<joey> remember recently was there was this </joey>
<joey> switch in this room and the task was </joey>
<joey> figure out what this switch does right </joey>
<joey> yeah and so what happens is like nine </joey>
<joey> people out of ten they start they start </joey>
<joey> flipping on the switch running out </joey>
<joey> looking at every light in the house </joey>
<joey> looking at every Appliance in the house </joey>
<joey> seeing if anything's changed run back in </joey>
<joey> and like flip the switch off and then </joey>
<joey> they they repeat this process right </joey>
<joey> until they finally figure out that the </joey>
<connor> switch rotates a statue or something </connor>
<joey> that's that's what that's what the </joey>
<connor> switch did yeah one guy just cut the </connor>
<joey> power to the switch right and was just </joey>
<connor> like well switch does nothing </connor>
<connor> because it has no power </connor>
<joey> oh wow so that's that's the kind of like </joey>
<joey> thinking outside the box because it </joey>
<joey> didn't necessarily because he's </joey>
<joey> technically right yeah in that this </joey>
<garnt> twitch does nothing in that moment </garnt>
<garnt> because he's seriously not breaking the </garnt>
<joey> rules because there's no rules right </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's very </connor>
<garnt> loose rules yeah that's very very loose </garnt>
<garnt> one of the best things is is that it's </garnt>
<joey> completely available on YouTube for free </joey>
<joey> yep you can watch all of it nearly all </joey>
<joey> of it on YouTube for free yeah uh which </joey>
<joey> is amazing because the clips they have </joey>
<joey> Eclipse Channel which is amazing but you </joey>
<joey> can just watch the straight up the whole </joey>
<joey> episodes oh cool and the best part is is </joey>
<garnt> that it's it's structured in a way where </garnt>
<garnt> every episode has its own self-contained </garnt>
<garnt> thing right uh in like a greater season </garnt>
<garnt> so it'll be the same comedians for the </garnt>
<garnt> whole season and the points will rack up </garnt>
<garnt> but you could come into any episode and </garnt>
<garnt> enjoy an episode like there is nothing </garnt>
<garnt> that requires you to watch the previous </garnt>
<garnt> episode right right if you want to and </garnt>
<joey> you'll get more out of it you can go one </joey>
<joey> two three four up until the end then you </joey>
<joey> can see who the winner is yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> it's Seasons they have like five </joey>
<joey> Comedians and they change kind of it </joey>
<joey> makes it a bit more consistent and makes </joey>
<joey> it have a lot more re-watchability and </joey>
<joey> more reasons to tune in every week it's </joey>
<garnt> really good really really good yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> going to blow up in the year I highly </garnt>
<garnt> recommend it we'll probably do do a task </garnt>
<garnt> Market I think a lot I know it's already </garnt>
<connor> popular nice because they made a US </connor>
<connor> version that sucked as they always do of </connor>
<connor> course but I think a lot more YouTubers </connor>
<joey> and stuff will probably start doing some </joey>
<connor> stuff like that oh yeah it's going to </connor>
<joey> happen I don't think so it's good </joey>
<joey> Taskmaster is [ __ ] amazing that's all </joey>
<joey> my British TV shows that I recommend uh </joey>
<joey> what is mind Hunter did any of you know </joey>
<connor> what mindhunter is no no mind Hunter is </connor>
<connor> so good so mine hunter unfortunately uh </connor>
<connor> at least it's just my knowledge is not </connor>
<connor> going to continue I think you can Google </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> um it had two seasons and then for some </connor>
<connor> reason Netflix or I think some creative </connor>
<connor> staff involved didn't agree on some </connor>
<connor> stuff maybe Kai can fact check for me uh </connor>
<connor> but it's basically about it's a really </connor>
<connor> good Netflix like drama but kind of </connor>
<connor> loosely based on real events of </connor>
<garnt> why the the FBI decided to start </garnt>
<joey> figuring out what psychopaths are </joey>
<joey> is this a drama or like a drama but kind </joey>
<joey> of loosely based on real events very </joey>
<joey> Loosely because you know they they were </joey>
<joey> a lot of the time you know way back in </joey>
<joey> America people were killing people with </joey>
<joey> similarly no motive and nobody can </joey>
<joey> understand why certain groups of these </joey>
<joey> people were very very organized would </joey>
<connor> didn't seem to care about the killings </connor>
<connor> would kill like 10 people and then some </connor>
<connor> people in the FBI are like huh I think </connor>
<connor> we should study these people who have </connor>
<connor> clearly very intelligent very good at </connor>
<connor> their crimes and who clearly are not </connor>
<connor> like the other criminals yeah right </connor>
<connor> yeah right well you know it's basically </connor>
<connor> like this is where it's a story about </connor>
<joey> how basically psychopath profiling </joey>
<joey> started every true Chrome fan </joey>
<connor> but dude it's so good like the the </connor>
<garnt> acting the shots the cinematography the </garnt>
<connor> pacing is amazing do we have info </connor>
<connor> it's on indefinitely which basically </connor>
<connor> means it's done yeah and it's it sucks </connor>
<connor> so it is they go um in the first season </connor>
<connor> they basically you spend a lot of the </connor>
<connor> seasons with this this FBI guy who's </connor>
<connor> really dedicated to figuring out this </connor>
<garnt> because he really believes that if if </garnt>
<garnt> they can figure out what makes these </garnt>
<garnt> Psychopaths tick and why they're doing </garnt>
<garnt> this that it can help them profile in </garnt>
<garnt> future and figure out how to stop this </garnt>
<garnt> happening yeah again this is all based </garnt>
<garnt> on like Loosely based on true events and </garnt>
<garnt> whatnot so the interview a very famous </garnt>
<connor> serial killer uh over across the first </connor>
<connor> season called Ed camper who is like uh </connor>
<connor> oh yes I know very very famous yeah and </connor>
<garnt> the actor in the series who portrays him </garnt>
<joey> is insane he's so good I think I've seen </joey>
<joey> the clips of that the guy who like </joey>
<joey> killed his mother and killed his family </joey>
<joey> and then went on to kill and he killed </joey>
<joey> so many people and the only reason they </joey>
<joey> caught him is because he got bored and </joey>
<joey> turned himself in yeah right and he was </joey>
<joey> really well spoken didn't like you know </joey>
<joey> I've seen like interviews of the real </joey>
<joey> age really creepy guy really creepy </joey>
<connor> because he would just be like he would </connor>
<connor> be willing to admit anything and talk </connor>
<connor> about it in full and so a lot of the </connor>
<connor> first season is just them talking to him </connor>
<connor> going back and forth trying to convince </connor>
<connor> the higher-ups this is worth doing going </connor>
<joey> back to Ed talking to him the main </joey>
<joey> character getting a little bit too </joey>
<joey> invested in talking to this serial </joey>
<joey> killer right and it's just really good </joey>
<joey> and it's it's just such a good human </joey>
<joey> drama whilst also kind of showcasing </joey>
<connor> like a really fascinating part of FBI </connor>
<connor> kind of history and this kind of how </connor>
<garnt> they came up to start even doing this </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right every True Crime fan yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> then the second season I think they have </garnt>
<garnt> some Charles Manson stuff another famous </garnt>
<connor> serial killer again it's all really </connor>
<connor> really interesting if you want a really </connor>
<connor> good kind of crime uh detective not to </connor>
<garnt> say that like like you know a really </garnt>
<garnt> unnerving drama okay is this did this </garnt>
<garnt> Series start off with some guy blowing </garnt>
<garnt> off his head with a shotgun or something </garnt>
<connor> you know I watched this when it came out </connor>
<joey> yeah and I remember that it's just been </joey>
<joey> one of those shows where I always check </joey>
<joey> every like month I'm like yeah is </joey>
<joey> anything happening because I really it </joey>
<connor> was getting so good yeah it's the dad </connor>
<connor> that went together </connor>
<connor> but even because because the two seasons </connor>
<connor> are so good I still feel comfortable </connor>
<connor> recommending it being like this is such </connor>
<connor> still worth watching yeah it's so good </connor>
<connor> because because I remember Sydney was </connor>
<garnt> like oh I want to watch a show it's on </garnt>
<connor> Netflix and stuff like that and I'm like </connor>
<connor> what is it about and she was like serial </connor>
<joey> killers I'm like great okay all right </joey>
<joey> you're from Wisconsin I get it okay I </joey>
<garnt> remember just like walking in the room </garnt>
<connor> seeing someone blow the head off of the </connor>
<garnt> shotgun I can't I've had a massive </garnt>
<garnt> spoiler no problem it's like opening </garnt>
<connor> scene </connor>
<connor> um and then I just walked out I was like </connor>
<garnt> the guy with the thing around his neck </garnt>
<connor> and blew up or a shotgun definitely </connor>
<garnt> shotgun okay that's the other evil but </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a drama it wasn't like a </garnt>
<joey> documentary I've seen it I've seen Evil </joey>
<connor> Geniuses that's that's good super </connor>
<connor> Geniuses game horrifying yeah I mean </connor>
<joey> mindhunter is amazing if you want just a </joey>
<joey> great drama you want to be fascinated </joey>
<joey> enthralled you've got to watch it it's </joey>
<garnt> on Netflix it's a shame that we're not </garnt>
<garnt> gonna get a season three please bring </garnt>
<garnt> back season three yeah so Hannah Montana </garnt>
<joey> all right let's talk about it yeah I </joey>
<connor> mean again look you've talked about you </connor>
<connor> had a child a crush on Hannah Montana </connor>
<connor> but like sell me on the show because </connor>
<connor> I've seen oh no it's not good but that's </connor>
<joey> the thing I've seen bits and pieces of </joey>
<joey> the show it's not good at all I think I </joey>
<joey> think though in a week is this your </joey>
<joey> guilty pleasure no </joey>
<joey> um I feel like this has a lot more uh </joey>
<joey> impact on me than I'd care to admit it </joey>
<joey> does I hate to be like but you know when </joey>
<joey> you're a child you're impressionable you </joey>
<joey> know at the end of the day I'm not </joey>
<joey> afraid to admit that Hannah Montana </joey>
<joey> changed my life then were you how how </joey>
<joey> did uh the the change that mileage </joey>
<garnt> affect you what's Hannah Montana about </garnt>
<connor> I've not seen a single episode right so </connor>
<connor> there's it's a great question go on </connor>
<connor> fantastic question so there's Hannah </connor>
<garnt> who's from Hannah Montana yeah the stage </garnt>
<garnt> name is Hannah Montana it's this girl uh </garnt>
<connor> I can't remember why she wants to be on </connor>
<connor> stage I'm sure just because her dad </connor>
<connor> because her dad is uh Billy Ray Cyrus </connor>
<connor> who's in like actual musician right um </connor>
<connor> I'm sure that I'm sure that helped get </connor>
<connor> the show Achy Breaky Heart yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> literally oh so it's about her who she's </connor>
<garnt> trying to get in school but she doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> want people in school to know that she's </garnt>
<garnt> a pop star so she lives this dual life </garnt>
<connor> where it's it's just Hannah she's living </connor>
<connor> the best yeah so that's the way the Best </connor>
<joey> of Both Worlds come from so she's trying </joey>
<joey> to balance the nobody nobody can know </joey>
<joey> I'm Hannah Montana yeah but also I got </joey>
<joey> to go to school but also I do these hit </joey>
<connor> performances yeah I don't know what her </connor>
<connor> real name is and her name in the show is </connor>
<connor> uh Hannah Smith is it really I don't </connor>
<connor> know I think it's only sometimes but I </connor>
<connor> don't know it's just fun and I think I'm </connor>
<connor> in a weird way </connor>
<connor> um I think like the whole Hannah Montana </connor>
<joey> and the Disney and all that kind of got </joey>
<joey> me into like American culture a lot more </joey>
<joey> right got me into the path of kind of </joey>
<joey> liking the idea of maybe performing yeah </joey>
<connor> because before that I had I had no no </connor>
<connor> desire in my bone to to perform or get </connor>
<joey> on a stage so basically you watched </joey>
<joey> Hannah Montana and you went I want the </joey>
<connor> best I I did want The Best of Both </connor>
<connor> Worlds and now as a social media person </connor>
<garnt> I was like how about just one world and </garnt>
<garnt> I'll make that the best one you combined </garnt>
<garnt> the world think further Hannah go </garnt>
<garnt> further Beyond yeah so I I don't know in </garnt>
<connor> a weird way the Disney channel has this </connor>
<connor> weird kind of intoxicating effect on </connor>
<connor> kids that is like yeah you want to be a </connor>
<connor> little [ __ ] entertaining little [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> in a weird way I think it kind of does </garnt>
<garnt> it does it's just basically the you know </garnt>
<garnt> the the show for theater kids </garnt>
<connor> everyone on the Disney show is like a </connor>
<connor> theater and I hate to admit it because I </connor>
<connor> think the show sucks in a weird way uh </connor>
<connor> but it was fun at the time and I did I </connor>
<connor> was obsessed with it again it just got </connor>
<connor> me into it and at a time where nobody uh </connor>
<joey> you know because I find in school </joey>
<joey> if you're not a theater kid yeah you are </joey>
<joey> never allowed to be a theater kid yeah </joey>
<joey> you can never join you know what I mean </joey>
<connor> there is a cut-off period if you are not </connor>
<connor> in the theater kid period by like age </connor>
<joey> eight you are not allowed in the theater </joey>
<connor> the thing the thing is you have to be </connor>
<joey> born and raised they are a ruthless </joey>
<connor> Bunch yeah where they lied to a bed at </connor>
<connor> night you can join the football team if </connor>
<connor> you get better you cannot become a </connor>
<garnt> theater kid no no and that and that [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> stays with you oh yeah yeah like a kid </joey>
<joey> always a thing have you ever meet </joey>
<joey> someone and then they were like yeah I </joey>
<garnt> was a theater kid I'm like I [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> knew it I knew it I can sense it from </garnt>
<garnt> the aura you know you feel the pressure </garnt>
<garnt> for sure </garnt>
<connor> it stays with you I swear they never </connor>
<joey> drop it but again like in school I I a </joey>
<joey> part of me I had that tiny little </joey>
<joey> inkling I was like I'd love to try this </joey>
<joey> yeah but even at 10 I'm like the </joey>
<connor> window's gone because like you're like </connor>
<garnt> yeah because the teachers wouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> wouldn't pick you yeah because they </garnt>
<garnt> would never give you the opportunity to </garnt>
<garnt> do anything because they were like well </garnt>
<joey> we already know we like these kids yeah </joey>
<joey> we know who can these are the kids that </joey>
<joey> act yeah you're not the kid that acts </joey>
<joey> you're the kids at times the audition </joey>
<joey> and then we make the kids at act feel </joey>
<joey> good because we can pick them you know </joey>
<joey> it's like and and this is a thing that I </joey>
<joey> felt in a weird way I hate Disney with a </joey>
<joey> burning passion I think they're a tower </joey>
<joey> company uh but </joey>
<connor> predict where credit's due a little bit </connor>
<connor> of it kind of brought out that that I </connor>
<connor> was like [ __ ] you know I kind of wanna </connor>
<connor> but I didn't know how how do you how do </connor>
<connor> you get into it and that's kind of like </connor>
<connor> what kind of maybe planted the seed to </connor>
<connor> then when I found anime that made me </connor>
<joey> think actually I want a voice act did </joey>
<joey> you did you ever watch like High School </joey>
<connor> Musical yeah I didn't really want to </connor>
<garnt> sing right something about acting kind </garnt>
<garnt> of spoke to me uh but it doesn't handle </garnt>
<connor> a Tennessee yeah she sings but it was </connor>
<connor> kind of the acting part of it a lot of </connor>
<connor> these kid actors I thought they were </connor>
<connor> amazing yeah yeah props to the kid </connor>
<connor> actors I don't know how the [ __ ] they </connor>
<joey> did that yeah I can't act now bro um you </joey>
<joey> know and I think that planted the seeds </joey>
<joey> to make me want to pursue something and </joey>
<joey> then discovered voice acting and that </joey>
<joey> was like stars aligned right so that </joey>
<joey> planted the seeds to me but also you </joey>
<joey> know I a lot of people like they can't </joey>
<joey> get into theater and I I like that </joey>
<joey> there's ways or kind of motivations </joey>
<garnt> pushing us to do it because you know </garnt>
<garnt> like people like [ __ ] Gerard Butler </garnt>
<garnt> right or uh who we'll talk about later </garnt>
<garnt> uh uh [ __ ] uh uh Dawn and </garnt>
<garnt> um mad man what's his [ __ ] name in </garnt>
<garnt> real life Jon Hamm Jon Hamm you know </garnt>
<joey> those two are both School teachers yeah </joey>
<joey> just got into acting at like age 40. and </joey>
<joey> I love that [ __ ] I want more of that </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah I hate it when it's like if </garnt>
<garnt> you didn't act from age 10 get the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> out of the industry you're a joke it's </garnt>
<garnt> like I hate that [ __ ] I think acting </garnt>
<joey> should be like if you want to try it Go </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] ahead if you don't if nothing </joey>
<joey> comes of it who cares yeah I think </joey>
<joey> having a way to express yourself and </joey>
<joey> having a way to perform is so uh just </joey>
<joey> fulfilling and satisfying I don't know </joey>
<connor> why [ __ ] Hannah Montana put that in </connor>
<joey> my brain but thank you Hannah Montana </joey>
<joey> thank you Miley expression Express </joey>
<connor> Yourself guys yeah all right uh then </connor>
<connor> let's talk about Mad Men I guess all </connor>
<garnt> right I know the name of this show never </garnt>
<joey> seen a single episode yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like advertising right this is like </connor>
<joey> the Chad show before Chad shows exists </joey>
<joey> like Jon Hamm plays like a giga chat I </joey>
<joey> love John Hammond but like it's great </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> in the show it starts out as like yeah </joey>
<joey> John uh I think it's all day of Don Don </joey>
<joey> the show he you know he's this kind of </joey>
<joey> he knows everything he's smart he's </joey>
<garnt> killing it but as the show goes on they </garnt>
<garnt> they slowly introduce flaws to him and </garnt>
<garnt> humanize him </garnt>
<garnt> um and in a way that feels great and and </garnt>
<garnt> it's about it deals with a lot of the </garnt>
<joey> topics at the time like this is like </joey>
<garnt> 1950s it deals with a lot of sexism it </garnt>
<joey> deals with a lot of misogyny uh it deals </joey>
<joey> with other cultures not being uh </joey>
<connor> recognized at the time and how that </connor>
<connor> interacts Mad Men is about John and and </connor>
<connor> the Ad Agency they make ads for people </connor>
<connor> okay so a lot of the time the show is </connor>
<joey> just how do we make this happen </joey>
<joey> newspapers and billboards and stuff like </joey>
<connor> that big Brands they're like the premium </connor>
<connor> a grade yeah marketing company in New </connor>
<garnt> York Manhattan okay well this this is </garnt>
<joey> when like our agencies start to become </joey>
<joey> like a real world oh yeah oh yeah they </joey>
<garnt> started realizing oh if you advertise </garnt>
<garnt> correctly you could make like a [ __ ] ton </garnt>
<connor> of money oh yeah right yeah so you know </connor>
<connor> a lot of the drama comes from okay we're </connor>
<connor> interacting with this client they have </connor>
<connor> these needs and how that character </connor>
<connor> interacts and it's a great way of </connor>
<connor> introducing characters for a few </connor>
<joey> episodes that have a big impact on the </joey>
<joey> main cast yeah and then how that kind of </joey>
<joey> plays out in their life yeah and there's </joey>
<joey> a great scene that I feel like after </joey>
<joey> you've lived in Japan you're like yes I </joey>
<joey> understand this they have like there's a </joey>
<joey> scene where they like have a [ __ ] uh </joey>
<joey> they maybe like Toyota or something and </joey>
<joey> one of the Japanese car brands right and </joey>
<joey> they made like the Ad Agency compete </joey>
<joey> against another Ad Agency to make the </joey>
<joey> best ad and they wouldn't like geek </joey>
<joey> shows I will not make an ad to compete </joey>
<joey> you will buy my services or you are not </joey>
<joey> welcome and they go out and it was just </joey>
<joey> like this whole thing of I will not </joey>
<connor> dance for you I was like I feel that so </connor>
<connor> much now this happens so much in Japan </connor>
<connor> we have to do [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> wow no no but it's great it's a great </garnt>
<garnt> show if you want what what makes it good </garnt>
<garnt> what makes it good characters I think uh </garnt>
<garnt> like one like like better call song </garnt>
<garnt> which I'll talk about like really good </garnt>
<connor> characters really good writing yeah you </connor>
<connor> know it's a slow burn nothing crazy </connor>
<connor> happens nothing explosive happens every </connor>
<connor> every episode it's just if you like </connor>
<connor> people talking you like good dialogue </connor>
<connor> you like development I like good dialo </connor>
<connor> it's it's just a great show and it's </connor>
<connor> it's very slow to start with I think </connor>
<connor> that's the problem with that a lot of </connor>
<connor> people don't get into it because it </connor>
<garnt> feels like all right when's something </garnt>
<connor> gonna happen but they're just laying the </connor>
<garnt> foundation I really love Mad Men because </garnt>
<garnt> because like I've always found the </garnt>
<connor> advertising world just uh interesting to </connor>
<connor> begin with I feel like I explained it </connor>
<connor> poorly by the way yeah it's it's like </connor>
<connor> especially seeing like the evolution of </connor>
<connor> the advertising world like you look at </connor>
<connor> like the old days and like the 60s or </connor>
<connor> something and like an advertisement </connor>
<connor> would literally be here's my product </connor>
<connor> here's what it does let me list off all </connor>
<connor> the benefits of using this products and </connor>
<garnt> then yeah like I think like somewhere </garnt>
<joey> along the line I'm not sure if it was </joey>
<joey> like likes must be TV all right you know </joey>
<garnt> it was you know this was this was on TV </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah but somewhere along the line I </garnt>
<connor> think like the most the biggest example </connor>
<connor> I can give off is like I can think of is </connor>
<connor> like the cigarette industry where Marvel </connor>
<connor> started like they they stopped marketing </connor>
<joey> their products and they started like </joey>
<joey> marketing a feeling a lifestyle yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah instead of just being like hey </joey>
<joey> here are cigarettes they're gonna </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] kill you oh by the way you know </garnt>
<garnt> buy our product they're they're like </garnt>
<connor> this is the American way yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like Peak 1950s America where </connor>
<joey> they're figuring that stuff out wasn't </joey>
<joey> it like uh was it like Coca-Cola that </joey>
<connor> were like one of the first ones to do it </connor>
<connor> might have been really just like it's </connor>
<connor> this is the feeling that you get yeah </connor>
<connor> this is what it's like it's like the how </connor>
<connor> it feels to chew five guns it's like </connor>
<connor> that it's like that [ __ ] you know but </connor>
<connor> it's great it's a long one it's got like </connor>
<connor> nine Seasons okay right but you slowly </connor>
<joey> watched Don's life uh change quite a lot </joey>
<joey> but it's good it's good though it's it's </joey>
<joey> worth it I got into it and I I couldn't </joey>
<garnt> stop like it was it was enthralling all </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah okay uh we also have future </garnt>
<garnt> drama I mean need I say much about </garnt>
<garnt> future yeah we were all this I guess we </garnt>
<garnt> were all this close to putting Futurama </garnt>
<garnt> on it's like I don't know it's like how </garnt>
<connor> do you make like it's it's like macaroni </connor>
<connor> inside I'm gonna make a show that's </connor>
<connor> funnier than Simpsons has a storyline </connor>
<connor> has characters that you love more and </connor>
<joey> just hits every note I feel as well the </joey>
<connor> humor is a little more geared towards </connor>
<connor> like the older generation I think oh </connor>
<connor> yeah because like because you know </connor>
<connor> Simpsons has a lot of Chloe Simpsons is </connor>
<connor> very good early symptoms yeah but like </connor>
<joey> around like comparing it to The Simpsons </joey>
<joey> during the time that Futurama was airing </joey>
<connor> like alongside I definitely felt like </connor>
<connor> they cared way more about Futurama yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah it's kind of like a throwback to </joey>
<garnt> more than old school Simpsons type of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] right yeah yeah I mean one thing </garnt>
<joey> I've always loved about Futurama is that </joey>
<joey> they actually gave a [ __ ] about the </joey>
<joey> Sci-Fi setting yeah in the world yeah it </joey>
<joey> wasn't just like a haha here wacky </joey>
<joey> setting haha they're like there are so </joey>
<joey> many episodes in Futurama that they </joey>
<joey> really delved into this like really like </joey>
<joey> Niche scientific concept or something </joey>
<joey> like that it was basically kind of like </joey>
<connor> Peak Rick and Morty before Rick and </connor>
<connor> Morty </connor>
<joey> Rick and Morty could walk </joey>
<connor> I want to have any Rick and Morty fans </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna piss off with that yeah I mean </connor>
<connor> it's especially like when they started </connor>
<garnt> delving into more of the story aspect oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah drama holy [ __ ] oh some of the </joey>
<garnt> latest some of the later episodes made </garnt>
<garnt> me cry yeah like [ __ ] Fry's dog is </garnt>
<joey> gonna [ __ ] stick with I I mentioned </joey>
<garnt> that you know and everyone everyone has </garnt>
<connor> the exact same reaction just like really </connor>
<joey> funny jokes as well like using the </joey>
<joey> Sci-Fi setting to like a huge Advantage </joey>
<joey> yeah like I just like one of the First </joey>
<joey> episodes right it's like Bender goes in </joey>
<joey> the suicide Booth right yeah tries to </joey>
<connor> and tries to con it and I feel like that </connor>
<connor> tells you literally everything you need </connor>
<connor> to know about Bender oh yeah the guy </connor>
<connor> doesn't want to pay even for his own </connor>
<connor> suicide we'll try and con it and then </connor>
<joey> gives up immediately like it's like they </joey>
<garnt> just it's such good writing and and you </garnt>
<garnt> can tell that everyone on the team cared </garnt>
<garnt> so much about making the show as funny </garnt>
<garnt> as possible yeah and I just love it so </garnt>
<garnt> much and I love the episode where Fry </garnt>
<connor> drinks like 100 coffees one of my </connor>
<connor> favorite ones </connor>
<garnt> love that episode so much so that's such </garnt>
<connor> a good [ __ ] everyone </connor>
<joey> so much yeah what I love about Futurama </joey>
<joey> is just the cast as well it's just it's </joey>
<joey> it's rare that you see such a perfectly </joey>
<garnt> balanced cast like like Eve I think it's </garnt>
<garnt> like even better than the Simpsons oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah in terms of balance the side </joey>
<joey> characters definitely shine in that shot </joey>
<joey> and even like even like the every now </joey>
<joey> and then characters that you see in like </joey>
<joey> just some of the concepts that you see </joey>
<joey> like you know obviously because like you </joey>
<joey> know because it's Futurama and like Matt </joey>
<connor> Rainey show it's like okay we'll throw </connor>
<connor> in maybe like a couple of like celebrity </connor>
<connor> naughties and stuff like that but the </connor>
<connor> fact that these like celebrity cameos </connor>
<connor> make their way into few trauma as just </connor>
<connor> the head yeah in a glass it's like </connor>
<connor> that's that's like immediately way more </connor>
<connor> funnier than just like here's the </connor>
<connor> character that you all know and love </connor>
<connor> that just comes into the frame it's like </connor>
<connor> yeah it's a little more interesting uh </connor>
<connor> and then and then I guess the fine uh </connor>
<connor> two final ones okay sure Arcane yeah I </connor>
<connor> mean Jerry come on all right so Arcane </connor>
<joey> is is fantastic there's like 70 clips of </joey>
<connor> you guys talking about okay I just think </connor>
<joey> that Arcane should be watched this is </joey>
<joey> your weekly reminder to watch our can if </joey>
<joey> you haven't yeah I am I am frothing at </joey>
<joey> the thought of getting a season two all </joey>
<joey> right Julie know that you want to talk </joey>
<joey> about Better Call Saul and I just think </joey>
<connor> they've released the behind the scenes </connor>
<connor> recently that was fantastic yeah they </connor>
<garnt> really just showed how much love and </garnt>
<garnt> care went into it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I agree yeah what what you said Connor </garnt>
<connor> yeah what do you say I don't know what </connor>
<connor> more I can say about Arcane it's a show </connor>
<garnt> that hits the ground running it's good </garnt>
<connor> save me it's uh it's uh Joey's favorite </connor>
<joey> show I love it all right Hunter Hunter </joey>
<joey> and I came my top two favorites so I </joey>
<connor> figured that God would would not put </connor>
<joey> breaking bad because maybe we're going </joey>
<joey> to talk about it anyway I don't know if </joey>
<joey> maybe God did for Breaking Bad I figured </joey>
<garnt> we're going to talk about breaking bad </garnt>
<garnt> okay Universe spoiler spoiler I didn't </garnt>
<connor> actually put broken back I've never even </connor>
<connor> seen it but I figured we would want to </connor>
<joey> talk about it in some capacity okay </joey>
<joey> because I mean it's like it's breaking </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] mad yeah </joey>
<garnt> my favorite are you putting breaking </garnt>
<garnt> battle are you putting benefits the </garnt>
<connor> universe is the universe the universe </connor>
<garnt> yeah I think like what is that you I </garnt>
<connor> would put both of them on here but I </connor>
<connor> feel like what is that Universal coin </connor>
<connor> okay the metaverse the Vince Gilligan </connor>
<connor> Universe I don't know like the the whole </connor>
<joey> world of Breaking Bad and better call </joey>
<joey> soul is fantastic and honestly I mean </joey>
<joey> the only reason I put medical Souls </joey>
<joey> because it just finished recently and it </joey>
<joey> was it was insane it's so good like one </joey>
<joey> of the best TV shows I've ever watched </joey>
<joey> like flat out just I mean I've been </joey>
<joey> watching the show weekly well not weekly </joey>
<joey> like since it aired weekly uh since I </joey>
<joey> was in university right because I was </joey>
<joey> watching Breaking Bad when that was </joey>
<joey> airing weekly when I was like 15. and I </joey>
<joey> just think that there's something about </joey>
<joey> it that I mean it clearly captivates </joey>
<joey> everyone online as well yeah people are </joey>
<joey> in love with this world and the show and </joey>
<joey> I think it's just because of how just </joey>
<joey> careful and how meticulous all the </joey>
<joey> character writing is yeah and how you </joey>
<joey> know there's a lot of twists and turns </joey>
<joey> in Breaking Bad and medical soul but it </joey>
<joey> doesn't feel feel like it's done for any </joey>
<joey> particular shock value it's like you </joey>
<joey> know if a character dies it is a big big </joey>
<joey> deal and it's dealt with really severely </joey>
<garnt> in the show and a character's death has </garnt>
<garnt> such Rippling effects on everyone in the </garnt>
<garnt> cast and it bothers them and it changes </garnt>
<garnt> how they view things and I I can't do it </garnt>
<garnt> justice I mean Breaking Bad and medical </garnt>
<garnt> assault you probably know all about it </garnt>
<garnt> it is just amazing and I hate being that </garnt>
<garnt> normally guys like watch Breaking Bad </garnt>
<connor> it's a good TV show but it just is it's </connor>
<garnt> literally it just is an amazing show </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean I don't know if I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if this is going to be a hot take or not </garnt>
<joey> but like yeah I've seen breaking bads I </joey>
<joey> think it's an amazing show I have zero </joey>
<joey> emotional attachment to it which is why </joey>
<joey> I didn't put it on my list right yeah it </joey>
<joey> like I think Breaking Bad epitomizes </joey>
<connor> everything that I guess does not </connor>
<connor> interest me about TV American TV shows </connor>
<connor> what what are you wearing where it's </connor>
<connor> just it's what do you mean okay </connor>
<joey> my perception of Breaking Bad is every </joey>
<joey> reason why I am an anime fan if that </joey>
<joey> makes sense okay where I think Breaking </joey>
<garnt> Bad isn't like I look at it as a Critic </garnt>
<garnt> right I think it's an amazing show it's </garnt>
<garnt> got so many moving pieces there's so </garnt>
<garnt> much care and attention that's been put </garnt>
<garnt> into the writing and the themes and how </garnt>
<garnt> how the uh how the developments of the </garnt>
<garnt> show evolve and everything like that but </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it's polished it's it's to me </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's it's a show that's like </garnt>
<garnt> polished to a point </garnt>
<garnt> that's it's how I don't know how to say </garnt>
<garnt> it it's polished to a point where </garnt>
<garnt> it just doesn't interest me is that </garnt>
<connor> weird is that weird bro I never even </connor>
<connor> gave it a chance why would you not want </connor>
<connor> to see the Pinnacle in like TV </connor>
<garnt> storytelling </garnt>
<garnt> uh I think one one okay one big thing </garnt>
<connor> again uh is that it's so grounded in </connor>
<connor> reality right the part of the reason why </connor>
<connor> so many people are attached to so many </connor>
<garnt> of these characters because they they </garnt>
<connor> feel like like such well don't want your </connor>
<connor> characters to feel real </connor>
<joey> he's an isakai fan yeah but like I think </joey>
<connor> I think it is an extremely tall order to </connor>
<connor> make characters that feel real and and </connor>
<connor> somehow Breaking Bad in medical Soul are </connor>
<connor> Masters at making you care about these </connor>
<connor> characters oh yeah who are so well </connor>
<garnt> written and unbelievable yeah yeah they </garnt>
<garnt> are incredibly well written too like I </garnt>
<connor> saw a fault it's so strange I've never </connor>
<connor> heard anyone have that complaint yeah I </connor>
<garnt> know I mean I don't even know if it's a </garnt>
<connor> complaint right I'm complaining that the </connor>
<connor> show is too good we've studied regards </connor>
<connor> brain yeah yeah I mean I mean here's a </connor>
<garnt> some sometimes you love sometimes I like </garnt>
<garnt> a bit of rawness in the expression </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I like a bit of unpolished you </garnt>
<garnt> know unpolishness you know sometimes I </garnt>
<garnt> like it when something is just is not </garnt>
<connor> like this well refined </connor>
<garnt> it's too clean this is such a bizarre </garnt>
<connor> argument this is going to build on one </connor>
<garnt> of the shows that I'm going that I've </garnt>
<joey> put on my okay which is okay this is </joey>
<garnt> half of a hot tick right okay I like I </garnt>
<garnt> think Breaking Bad is an amazing show </garnt>
<garnt> but I I have zero attachment to Breaking </garnt>
<connor> Bad I hear this if you didn't have zero </connor>
<connor> attachment to it but I could understand </connor>
<joey> that I just think I I loved it a lot </joey>
<joey> maybe it's because I you know when I </joey>
<garnt> first watched it I was like 16. yeah </garnt>
<joey> I've rewatched it since and I still love </joey>
<garnt> it I just think it's just amazing like </garnt>
<garnt> it just does everything so goddamn well </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah exactly well I guess why it's </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] number two on IMDb yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> mean do you think that you do you think </garnt>
<garnt> medical saw is better than Breaking Bad </garnt>
<garnt> now that it's over </garnt>
<connor> that's tough </connor>
<connor> um I think if you had to pick one of the </connor>
<connor> two </connor>
<connor> I think Breaking Bad offers a more </connor>
<joey> complete package of </joey>
<joey> hitting every kind of emotion soul is a </joey>
<joey> very very slow burn yes that really </joey>
<joey> believes that in its storytelling and </joey>
<joey> its characters to to tell an amazing </joey>
<joey> story yes it knows that the characters </joey>
<joey> of in the universe are so strong that </joey>
<joey> they can really slow it down yeah and </joey>
<joey> and you know because the first two </joey>
<joey> seasons it's a very very slow burden not </joey>
<joey> that much happens and it's like for two </joey>
<connor> seasons it's very slow it's all just </connor>
<connor> setting the stage building up these </connor>
<connor> characters showing you why they're going </connor>
<connor> to be why they are and it's like it's so </connor>
<joey> rare to see a prequel that almost </joey>
<connor> improves on what the main thing did and </connor>
<connor> kind of offers even more reason to go </connor>
<joey> back and watch the first of the original </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you know the Jimmy's character of Saul </joey>
<joey> in Breaking Bad is is very funny very </joey>
<garnt> funny loyal man but just make medical </garnt>
<garnt> Soul turns him into this amazing </garnt>
<garnt> grounded character where you can </garnt>
<joey> understand why he went down the paths he </joey>
<garnt> went down yeah just it's just a great </garnt>
<garnt> drama it's it but it's slow it's very </garnt>
<garnt> slow yeah I think that's why Breaking </garnt>
<garnt> Bad might just Edge it out for me right </garnt>
<garnt> Breaking Bad just hits the ground </garnt>
<connor> running right yeah probably because he </connor>
<garnt> had to do a pilot and whereas the </garnt>
<connor> medical Soul could had the had the brand </connor>
<connor> had more Wiggles Yeah well yeah I mean </connor>
<connor> the reason I think a lot of people </connor>
<connor> wouldn't watch Better Call Saul or </connor>
<connor> wouldn't have got past the first season </connor>
<connor> if they didn't know it's part of </connor>
<connor> Breaking Bad because it is just it it </connor>
<connor> just trusts that you want to see the </connor>
<garnt> payoff right yeah I I think I've got a </garnt>
<joey> perfect analogy of why I </joey>
<connor> I'm not personally attached to Breaking </connor>
<joey> Bad </joey>
<joey> so Breaking Bad is like if you built an </joey>
<joey> AI computer </joey>
<joey> and you programmed it to write the </joey>
<joey> perfect TV show that would be Breaking </joey>
<joey> Bad okay you know like it feels like it </joey>
<connor> is the perfect TV show with with correct </connor>
<joey> Spanish in it apparently the Spanish is </joey>
<joey> Dreadful I don't know </joey>
<joey> okay apparently the Spanish is like </joey>
<joey> unwatchable Spanish people I'm so sorry </joey>
<connor> especially but at least a medical Soul </connor>
<connor> they have an actual uh Spanish person uh </connor>
<connor> playing a character and he's really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] good yeah no Gustavo is not even </connor>
<connor> remotely Spanish oh and apparently his </connor>
<connor> Spanish is Dreadful oh really yeah </connor>
<joey> apparently it's [ __ ] unbearable uh </joey>
<joey> because he's supposed to be playing a </joey>
<joey> Chilean dude yeah but he's uh from like </joey>
<joey> Denmark or something and has African </joey>
<joey> descent oh so there's no Spanish ties </joey>
<connor> remotely </connor>
<garnt> um so people are like bro his Hispanic </garnt>
<garnt> should yeah yeah that's that's I think </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's what I mean it's like it </garnt>
<garnt> feels like the perfect TV show but it </garnt>
<garnt> feels so good that it feels like it was </garnt>
<garnt> written by a computer and why would you </garnt>
<joey> not want it so you say so what you're </joey>
<joey> basically saying is that like some flaws </joey>
<garnt> in the show are good because the guys </garnt>
<garnt> actually rotted your brain I mean it has </garnt>
<garnt> okay I'm not gonna lie but like </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes okay even watch like sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> one of my favorite things is kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like feeling a connection between the </garnt>
<garnt> person who made this particular thing or </garnt>
<garnt> this particular piece of fiction </garnt>
<garnt> um I like feeling like there is I </garnt>
<garnt> understand what they're trying to </garnt>
<garnt> portray or Express you know with </garnt>
<garnt> Breaking Bad I Feel Complete coldness </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel it's just amazing it's </garnt>
<garnt> perfectly written but I don't know what </garnt>
<joey> you know so there's nothing wrong with </joey>
<joey> like the like a show being like </joey>
<garnt> inherently perfect in its writing or </garnt>
<connor> like incredibly good in its writing yeah </connor>
<garnt> like you need some kind of thing that </garnt>
<garnt> gives you a connection between you as a </garnt>
<garnt> viewer and the person who made it trying </garnt>
<garnt> to express themselves through the work I </garnt>
<joey> mean I mean that's why Evangeline was </joey>
<garnt> like I was about to say this </garnt>
<garnt> is like one of my favorite anime of all </garnt>
<garnt> time you know it doesn't doesn't </garnt>
<connor> necessarily have to make sense I wonder </connor>
<connor> if that's just a posted my person thing </connor>
<connor> because I feel like I get it oh it's </connor>
<connor> definitely a person I I feel like I </connor>
<connor> understand the messages they're trying </connor>
<joey> to put out and yeah they're trying to </joey>
<connor> portray yeah I feel the same thing with </connor>
<connor> music it's like sometimes you just want </connor>
<connor> to listen to a good song and not give a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] about who it's made by yeah </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you want to be like well I </garnt>
<joey> need to care about the song Because I </joey>
<joey> want to care about this person yeah who </joey>
<connor> made it yeah I know Chris loves medical </connor>
<connor> Souls that's a good taste sheep all </connor>
<garnt> right who's next who is next then </garnt>
<connor> go for this person </connor>

<garnt> Arthur okay </garnt>
<connor> literally </connor>
<connor> because half of these are from your </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] childhood yes of course they are </connor>
<connor> yeah I don't watch TV series Simpsons </connor>
<connor> why Simpsons ever say like you just </connor>
<joey> mentioned okay so I was really debating </joey>
<joey> at first I put in Futurama but then the </joey>
<garnt> more I thought about it I have more of a </garnt>
<garnt> childhood connection with the Simpsons </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<connor> um even though Futurama came out what </connor>
<connor> year did it come out like uh no not too </connor>
<joey> long ago too long after I was like </joey>
<connor> mid-2000s I think or late 2000s okay </connor>
<connor> look it up but I feel Simpsons was that </connor>
<joey> like one cartoon that has always been </joey>
<connor> around and I have like fond childhood </connor>
<joey> memories of watching Simpsons with my </joey>
<joey> sister more than Futurama so like the </joey>
<joey> the only like I guess uh childhood </joey>
<joey> memory I have of me watching Simpsons </joey>
<joey> was before uh my my dad inevitably threw </joey>
<joey> it out he had this like old CRT TV right </joey>
<joey> and he was gonna throw it out and I was </joey>
<joey> like no no father I want it if it </joey>
<joey> doesn't still work and he's like yeah if </joey>
<connor> you like get the antenna thing on it and </connor>
<joey> you extend the [ __ ] yeah then it </joey>
<connor> still works and I'm like okay can I put </connor>
<connor> it in my room and so there would be </connor>
<connor> nights where like my dad would be </connor>
<connor> watching some kind of [ __ ] TV show I </connor>
<connor> didn't give a [ __ ] about and my sister </connor>
<garnt> and I would go into my room and we would </garnt>
<garnt> take turns holding the antenna on the TV </garnt>
<garnt> to get good reception enough to watch </garnt>
<garnt> reruns of The Simpsons and so every and </garnt>
<garnt> because it was play it played on channel </garnt>
<connor> 10 there were like ad breaks every like </connor>
<garnt> you know 10-15 minutes so every time an </garnt>
<connor> ad break came on we'll be like all right </connor>
<connor> your turn to hold the antenna and I </connor>
<connor> would just have like fond childhood </connor>
<connor> memories of that and like that would </connor>
<connor> happen after Futurama came out because </connor>
<connor> in Australia it would be a rerun of The </connor>
<connor> Simpsons and then immediately after it </connor>
<connor> would be an episode of Futurama right </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> um so it would it would kind of be like </joey>
<joey> a Simpsons Futurama combo for me but I </joey>
<joey> still remember more and vividly remember </joey>
<joey> more characters and jokes and stuff like </joey>
<garnt> that from The Simpsons I consumed a lot </garnt>
<connor> more Simpsons than Futurama </connor>
<garnt> there was way more of it yeah and I </garnt>
<joey> thought because it like I remember I </joey>
<joey> grew up with The Simpsons oh yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> The Simpsons was The Simpsons existed </joey>
<joey> since I was born yeah it's like a game </joey>
<joey> every year yeah yeah exactly clear it </joey>
<joey> came out it came out every day but then </joey>
<garnt> I remember when Futurama first started </garnt>
<joey> airing it was like a new thing yeah so </joey>
<garnt> Simpsons has just like always been there </garnt>
<joey> when did you try and come out 1999 1999 </joey>
<connor> oh okay yeah what what is your do you </connor>
<connor> have a favorite Simpsons episode that </connor>
<joey> comes to mind </joey>
<joey> Peak Simpsons for me is the 24 short </joey>
<joey> stories about Springfield do you know </joey>
<joey> that one which one's what's the plot of </joey>
<joey> that one again it's basically just like </joey>
<garnt> they it's it's basically just like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] Quentin Tarantino escalate just </garnt>
<garnt> short stories about different characters </garnt>
<garnt> in Springfield that all coincide with </garnt>
<garnt> one another and there's a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> movie parodies and [ __ ] like that they </garnt>
<garnt> parody like Pulp Fiction multiple times </garnt>
<joey> and like just like classic movies and </joey>
<joey> stuff but with Simpsons characters yeah </joey>
<joey> um and it's just a really and also like </joey>
<connor> uh we used to have like DVDs of like the </connor>
<connor> Treehouse of Horrors I love those are </connor>
<connor> like classes </connor>
<joey> like like The Shining Parody episode of </joey>
<connor> The Simpsons is like that's Peak I love </connor>
<connor> the uh who shot Mr Burns who shot Mr </connor>
<joey> Burns and also like the the robot house </joey>
<joey> of death and stuff like that oh my God </joey>
<garnt> yeah well it's like this they like </garnt>
<garnt> Implement like an AI like house and it's </garnt>
<connor> voiced by all the characters who played </connor>
<joey> James Bond yeah oh yeah it's like it's </joey>
<garnt> voiced by Pierce Brosnan I think who </garnt>
<garnt> shot Mr Burns was how I discovered what </garnt>
<garnt> Cliffhangers were yeah right like </garnt>
<garnt> honestly I remember like genuinely good </garnt>
<joey> stories yeah I remember as a kid I was </joey>
<connor> watching who the who shot Mr Burns part </connor>
<connor> one and then it ends right I'm like what </connor>
<connor> do you mean it's ending what where is </connor>
<connor> part two </connor>
<garnt> what do you mean I have to wait I'm like </garnt>
<connor> five or something right yeah but like it </connor>
<garnt> the writing was so good that you know </garnt>
<joey> you got a [ __ ] child invest yeah and </joey>
<joey> I and I think as well like I had a </joey>
<garnt> really good because like obviously </garnt>
<garnt> Simpsons started way before any of us </garnt>
<garnt> were born yeah and so like a lot of the </garnt>
<joey> The Simpsons that we saw on that shitty </joey>
<joey> CR TV were reruns of the older Seasons </joey>
<joey> which anyone who's watched enough </joey>
<joey> Simpsons will agree with Peak Simpsons </joey>
<garnt> right yeah exactly um when did you stop </garnt>
<garnt> watching The Simpsons when did you all </garnt>
<connor> start watching The Simpsons when I stop </connor>
<joey> watching TV yeah pretty much focus on on </joey>
<connor> in the UK right </connor>
<garnt> on Sky yeah paid uh broadcasting which </garnt>
<garnt> my dad bought because he wanted to watch </garnt>
<garnt> football matches yeah so it was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> we'll buy this and then the only reason </garnt>
<garnt> that you know the wife won't get angry </garnt>
<garnt> at me so it's for the family because </garnt>
<garnt> we've got other channels as well right </garnt>
<garnt> so we had we had that and um they used </garnt>
<joey> to play four episodes uh a day from six </joey>
<joey> to eight pm damn so every single day </joey>
<joey> after school just chill on the living </joey>
<connor> room do whatever I need to do and just </connor>
<connor> watch four episodes of Simpsons yeah </connor>
<joey> every single day I remember I think it </joey>
<connor> was like on weekends they would do like </connor>
<connor> three or four episode runs yeah this is </connor>
<garnt> crazy yeah it was great yeah I can </garnt>
<connor> remember the exact moment for me that </connor>
<connor> the Simpsons died in my mind it's </connor>
<connor> actually like The Simpsons Movie I think </connor>
<joey> actually yeah </joey>
<garnt> I remember like oh okay so wow Simpson's </garnt>
<garnt> got a movie that's a big [ __ ] deal I </garnt>
<garnt> haven't like at that point I hadn't like </garnt>
<garnt> watched you know I grew up with The </garnt>
<connor> Simpsons but I wasn't like regularly </connor>
<connor> watching you don't realize it like </connor>
<garnt> season like nine or ten is [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you're just like oh this is funny </garnt>
<garnt> he </garnt>
<connor> and then I remember like people [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> losing it over [ __ ] spider pig or </joey>
<connor> something oh my God I hated that and I'm </connor>
<joey> just like what </joey>
<joey> this isn't funny why is yeah white </joey>
<garnt> people that was definitely the least </garnt>
<joey> funniest part of The Simpsons that was </joey>
<garnt> like there were many not funny parts of </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah that was like I remember back </garnt>
<garnt> when that came out people like quoting </garnt>
<connor> it I'm like this is the pickle Rick of </connor>
<garnt> my time you know it literally was yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> was just like why are people quoting </garnt>
<connor> spider pig and it's not even spider pig </connor>
<connor> Ransom pickle Rick </connor>
<connor> dude I I [ __ ] love especially like </connor>
<connor> when we were probably getting in </connor>
<connor> Simpsons when all the best Simpsons </connor>
<connor> games were out yeah like hit and run one </connor>
<connor> of the arcades the arcade ones </connor>
<connor> oh my God that was a [ __ ] coin </connor>
<joey> guzzler that was Peak Simpsons right but </joey>
<connor> yeah I mean Simpson's great I mean this </connor>
<garnt> is great what the [ __ ] is specs and </garnt>
<joey> specs yeah specs and specs is a TV show </joey>
<connor> that sounds Australia it looks like a </connor>
<connor> kid's show it's a quiz show </connor>
<connor> um it's a music question it's like a gay </connor>
<connor> pride show no no no they just happen to </connor>
<joey> have a rainbow okay okay now Rainbows </joey>
<joey> are dope </joey>
<joey> but it's named after I think a uh uh a </joey>
<joey> Beach Boys song I think right but </joey>
<connor> basically it's this kind of it's kind of </connor>
<connor> like imagine like Qi right but yeah </connor>
<connor> except all of the questions and all of </connor>
<connor> the guests are the musicians okay this </connor>
<joey> is right up your ass yeah and obviously </joey>
<connor> you know I'm a [ __ ] music nerd right </connor>
<connor> so it's like that show was really cool </connor>
<connor> because not only would they get really </connor>
<connor> cool musicians on as guests but they </connor>
<connor> also like it was hosted by an Australian </connor>
<connor> comedian </connor>
<connor> um called Adam Hills </connor>
<connor> um and he had you know in any in each </connor>
<connor> team there would be like different kinds </connor>
<connor> of you know music themed like quizzes </connor>
<connor> and like that would also break into like </connor>
<connor> a talk show where they would like talk </connor>
<joey> about guests and stuff like that I think </joey>
<joey> one of my one of the weirdest segments </joey>
<joey> that they had was they had this quiz </joey>
<joey> early on in specs and specs called </joey>
<joey> musician or serial killer </joey>
<joey> and they'll basically what they would do </joey>
<joey> is they would show a black and white </joey>
<joey> picture and just by looking at the </joey>
<garnt> picture of the person it's like a mug </garnt>
<connor> shot like front face you would have to </connor>
<connor> guess is this a musician or a serial </connor>
<connor> killer that's also wow yeah and a lot of </connor>
<connor> the times I and and as a kid I watched </connor>
<garnt> that and you know you'd play along </garnt>
<garnt> obviously because you you know there's </garnt>
<garnt> no [ __ ] prior knowledge or anything </garnt>
<garnt> this is before True Crime [ __ ] was a </garnt>
<garnt> thing right yeah yeah and so like it was </garnt>
<garnt> really weird that I swear the more </garnt>
<garnt> someone looked like a serial killer the </garnt>
<connor> more likely they were more likely they </connor>
<garnt> were a musician and vice versa I believe </garnt>
<connor> it yeah and so there was stuff like that </connor>
<connor> there was another one where it was like </connor>
<connor> um they took song lyrics put them </connor>
<connor> through Google translate it's like some </connor>
<connor> Asian language and then translated it </connor>
<connor> back in English and then they would read </connor>
<connor> that out and you'd have to guess what </connor>
<joey> the song is and so like it was just like </joey>
<joey> really cool ideas for quizzes </joey>
<joey> that's a great idea for an after dark </joey>
<joey> question honestly I like him Honestly </joey>
<joey> though like I came up with like you know </joey>
<joey> I came up with so many like quiz ideas </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that for my videos </joey>
<garnt> through shows like this yeah because it </garnt>
<garnt> was just like really interesting and fun </garnt>
<garnt> ways where you could kind of oh another </garnt>
<garnt> one where was like there was like an </garnt>
<garnt> exercise bike that was connected to a </garnt>
<garnt> vinyl player like a vinyl record player </garnt>
<garnt> right and you had to Pedal the bike at a </garnt>
<joey> certain speed for the song to be able to </joey>
<garnt> play oh that's cool you have to quickly </garnt>
<connor> guess yeah yeah what the song is for </connor>
<connor> example it's just stuff like that sounds </connor>
<connor> good yeah it's a really really good show </connor>
<connor> Even if you have no idea about music </connor>
<garnt> just the fact that it's like hosted by a </garnt>
<garnt> comedian who's really funny has a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> really cool musical guests and just like </garnt>
<garnt> the quiz segments are just really </garnt>
<garnt> creative yeah which is like really </garnt>
<garnt> really good show </garnt>
<garnt> um and then I guess top right is the </garnt>
<garnt> only Japanese show I put in Goku not Sky </garnt>
<garnt> basically every American uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> like uh punishment game remake remake </garnt>
<connor> came from this okay so Silent Library is </connor>
<garnt> one of the most famous ones these guys </garnt>
<garnt> came up with the first </garnt>
<connor> um another one would explain what silent </connor>
<garnt> libraries is Silent Library I guess so </garnt>
<connor> basically everyone yeah Silent Library </connor>
<connor> basically is just again these guys </connor>
<connor> started first but basically you would go </connor>
<connor> into a public library sit around a desk </connor>
<connor> and then you would hand out uh like </connor>
<connor> cards you'd flip them over one person </connor>
<connor> would get the punishment and then they </connor>
<connor> would have to do a punishment but react </connor>
<joey> yeah silently yeah and these punishments </joey>
<connor> in this show were [ __ ] brutal I mean </connor>
<garnt> Japanese TV shows is a big history yeah </garnt>
<joey> adaptation for being yeah like Takeshi's </joey>
<joey> Castle is another show that I thought </joey>
<garnt> about putting on here but he definitely </garnt>
<garnt> pushed the line in terms of like what </garnt>
<joey> you can get away with it some of the </joey>
<garnt> things that they did on this show were </garnt>
<garnt> like actual torture yeah like it's crazy </garnt>
<garnt> like uh one segment that they did was um </garnt>
<garnt> 24 hour no reaction uh pie face </garnt>
<garnt> challenge where basically one of the </garnt>
<garnt> comedians in this group would live in </garnt>
<connor> this like mock house and the entire time </connor>
<connor> for 24 hours the rest of the cast are </connor>
<connor> throwing like pies at his face and he's </connor>
<connor> not allowed to react for 24 hours what </connor>
<connor> yeah it's just [ __ ] like that it's just </connor>
<connor> being Pi boarded you're being High </connor>
<connor> borders for 24 hours straight insane </connor>
<connor> yeah it's it's insane another one was </connor>
<connor> like 24 hour tag so that would be inside </connor>
<joey> of a gymnasium and then randomly a dude </joey>
<joey> would pop up and if you got tagged by </joey>
<joey> them then you'd have to get punished for </joey>
<connor> 24 hours it's just crazy I noticed in </connor>
<connor> Japanese TV when you've done your time </connor>
<connor> so to say you've done the the brutal </connor>
<connor> stuff and done all the you've put </connor>
<connor> yourself out there a bunch you get to be </connor>
<connor> the react Andy yeah when you become the </connor>
<connor> show you how become royalty in Japan's </connor>
<joey> comedy scene you get to react yep that's </joey>
<joey> that because that's that's who the big </joey>
<joey> dogs are yeah because they're on </joey>
<joey> everything every big Celebrity Face you </joey>
<connor> see yeah it's always the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> in the corner of the screen they're all </connor>
<garnt> the comedians that you see just in the </garnt>
<garnt> react corner of the screen they started </garnt>
<joey> off doing [ __ ] like yeah so it's like </joey>
<garnt> we've done our time we've done our work </garnt>
<connor> so with the work their way off the </connor>
<connor> system man it's like hunting games and </connor>
<joey> maybe you get a successful </joey>
<garnt> exactly but like on like honestly if </garnt>
<joey> you're a YouTuber just watch episodes of </joey>
<joey> Goku not sky and it's just a treasure </joey>
<joey> oh yeah I mean that guy is the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> oh yeah </connor>
<joey> but uh yeah so that's uh that's like one </joey>
<connor> of my favorite Japanese shows going on </connor>
<connor> also learn a lot of Japanese watching </connor>
<connor> that show as a child I believe it yeah </connor>
<connor> um and then Japanese quiz game Japanese </connor>
<connor> quiz game yeah exactly uh MythBusters </connor>
<connor> obviously everyone knows [ __ ] videos </connor>
<connor> Okay so this was assembly okay so this </connor>
<garnt> was the original Adams Family TV show </garnt>
<garnt> from the 60s I was wondering why I was </garnt>
<garnt> in black and white yeah so this is on </garnt>
<connor> the 60s this is this was this was during </connor>
<joey> a time where I had this like weird </joey>
<connor> obsession with watching a lot of old </connor>
<joey> films so I would like this was during </joey>
<connor> the time where I would be like so uh was </connor>
<connor> Citizen Kane actually a good movie I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna go and check it out right so I </connor>
<connor> would watch like citizen it was okay I </connor>
<joey> would I would watch Citizen Kane and </joey>
<joey> like all the you know the Orville films </joey>
<garnt> and like all of the [ __ ] this is what </garnt>
<garnt> this is how you started your altar phase </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I was yes </garnt>
<joey> I was like I'm not like those other kids </joey>
<connor> watching Breaking Bad [ __ ] off I'm gonna </connor>
<connor> watch Adam's Channel you mean let's cook </connor>
<joey> but um yeah I think what really was cool </joey>
<garnt> about Adam's Family like the even though </garnt>
<joey> this is [ __ ] what a 60 year old show at </joey>
<garnt> this point yeah it's still [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> hilarious you know whenever you like you </connor>
<connor> know you watch Modern TV shows that </connor>
<connor> popped on the TV you're like this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] Whatever Whenever you for some </connor>
<garnt> reason in a place and old TV shows come </garnt>
<connor> on they're always so good yeah they are </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if I'm like crazy but like </garnt>
<garnt> that one's just funny they must be good </garnt>
<garnt> in order to have still to still be still </garnt>
<connor> survive yeah right yeah maybe it's like </connor>
<joey> Survivor bias of like well yes because </joey>
<joey> you're seeing the best of the best that </joey>
<joey> we remember right yeah cherish and made </joey>
<connor> sure we kept in HD I'm sure out of every </connor>
<joey> one Adam's family there was 20 really </joey>
<garnt> shows but yeah like I mean what is </garnt>
<joey> Adam's Family about I I just know the </joey>
<garnt> name Adam's family is about comedy is it </garnt>
<garnt> a drama it's a comedy so Adam's family I </garnt>
<garnt> think it's based off a comic book series </garnt>
<joey> or a book or something please confirm </joey>
<joey> Kai but basically it's about this really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] weird family called The Adams </joey>
<joey> Family uh like very like Macabre and </joey>
<joey> like obsessed with like death and stuff </joey>
<garnt> like that and they're just like a very </garnt>
<garnt> weird they were like the original like </garnt>
<garnt> we don't like the other families type of </garnt>
<garnt> family right </garnt>
<garnt> um so like they kind of want to be yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so there's like Gomez and like Morticia </garnt>
<connor> and uh [ __ ] I don't know Uncle Fester </connor>
<joey> and like just characters like that where </joey>
<joey> it's just like you know there was just </joey>
<joey> like it was the weirdest cast of </joey>
<garnt> characters they're human right yes </garnt>
<joey> they're human but they're but they're so </joey>
<connor> weird and so obsessed in the Macabre </connor>
<connor> that they're almost not human I mean </connor>
<joey> there is a character that's also not </joey>
<connor> human but in other another </connor>
<joey> interpretation of the show they are </joey>
<joey> actually like yeah why do I think </joey>
<connor> they're vampires yeah other in other </connor>
<joey> versions of stories like the I think </joey>
<joey> Adam's family is yeah I think it borders </joey>
<joey> on like are they human or are they just </joey>
<joey> weird humans or are they non-humans </joey>
<connor> trying to live in a human is he Adams </connor>
<connor> can you look uh it was based on the </connor>
<connor> cartoon like oh a cartoon okay is it </connor>
<connor> public domain I can't remember if it is </connor>
<connor> I don't know to be honest but they've </connor>
<joey> done re a bunch of remakes of uh like </joey>
<connor> movies from like the 90s Adams Family </connor>
<connor> movie is [ __ ] hilarious and I think </connor>
<connor> recently uh Adam Sandler one right not </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<garnt> Adam's Family one or is that a Dracula </garnt>
<garnt> movie I don't know </garnt>
<connor> animated cartoon am I crazy am I mixing </connor>
<connor> yeah so like what I really enjoyed about </connor>
<garnt> this show is that like it because the </garnt>
<joey> characters are just so [ __ ] absurd </joey>
<garnt> yeah it makes for some really really </garnt>
<garnt> unique comedic bits right um so like for </garnt>
<garnt> example like </garnt>
<garnt> um I don't know like uh Lodge for </garnt>
<garnt> example is this like almost like </garnt>
<garnt> Frankenstein's monster type of thing but </garnt>
<garnt> he's also the he's also the butler of </garnt>
<garnt> the family right and then there's also </garnt>
<garnt> another character called thing which is </garnt>
<connor> just a disembodied hand that just crawls </connor>
<garnt> around and emotes and there's been so </garnt>
<connor> many remakes of it I think there's gonna </connor>
<connor> be a remake of there's like a new like </connor>
<joey> Netflix I think TV series based on </joey>
<joey> Wednesday Adams oh uh which is like the </joey>
<joey> youngest daughter of Adam's family or </joey>
<connor> something made by what's his name Adam </connor>
<connor> Sandler maybe my brain was Dumb and </connor>
<connor> thought Adam Sandler was in it because </connor>
<connor> it's The Adams Family yeah that's what I </connor>
<connor> was about to say but yeah </connor>
<garnt> I thought we I thought that was like too </garnt>
<connor> obvious </connor>
<connor> yeah but it's a real if you want like a </connor>
<connor> classic like funny like comedic uh show </connor>
<connor> then I I'd say Adam's family's still </connor>
<garnt> like a lot of the episodes I think are </garnt>
<joey> still really funny yeah did you ever </joey>
<garnt> watch a thing too yeah oh yeah of course </garnt>
<joey> what is it you know it oh okay oh okay </joey>
<garnt> that's it that's it yeah did you ever </garnt>
<garnt> watch the Twilight Zone since yeah oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah Twilight Zone I grew up with as </joey>
<connor> well but like I don't think Twilight's </connor>
<connor> always one of those shows where that I </connor>
<connor> would see it every now and then on TV I </connor>
<connor> wouldn't like religiously watch it like </connor>
<connor> Simpsons have you ever watched that TV </connor>
<joey> show that was like fact or fiction </joey>
<joey> and well the memes of that that guy </joey>
<garnt> going like it's it's a lie I made it up </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's not true I made enough I lied </garnt>
<garnt> you know I think so that sounds like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] dude what God damn it why does such </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] patch oh no no no no wait wait </connor>
<connor> I know what you're talking about yeah </connor>
<connor> the guy in like in the Smoky room in the </connor>
<joey> Smoky room no I made it up yes okay no </joey>
<garnt> now I know what you're talking about I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know I think so I thought what I </garnt>
<connor> didn't know that came from like a TV </connor>
<connor> it's uh uh beyond belief beyond belief </connor>
<connor> uh Jonathan </connor>
<connor> Frakes Beyond a belief I thought I don't </connor>
<garnt> know I don't know why I just thought </garnt>
<connor> that was like a History Channel show </connor>
<garnt> yeah I thought so too yeah it's just </garnt>
<connor> like a bunch of oh yeah and realized </connor>
<connor> you'd forgotten where you parked your </connor>
<garnt> car ever gone mountain biking what do </garnt>
<garnt> you want to be when you grow up what's </garnt>
<connor> the right tip have you called it oh yes </connor>
<joey> yes </joey>
<connor> this one's good I like that show that </connor>
<joey> was really good yeah </joey>
<connor> MythBusters I think we spoke about this </connor>
<joey> a little while ago yeah I mean I met </joey>
<joey> Adam Savage is great MythBusters is </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] awesome if you don't know what </connor>
<connor> MythBusters is Jerry take it away </connor>
<joey> MythBusters basically Adam and Adam </joey>
<joey> Savage and Jamie Hyman uh they basically </joey>
<connor> I think they used to work in like </connor>
<connor> Hollywood as like special effects uh </connor>
<connor> creators but they basically have like </connor>
<connor> two guys with really long science </connor>
<connor> backgrounds who basically take common </connor>
<connor> myths and scientifically prove whether </connor>
<connor> it's real or just a myth yeah um really </connor>
<connor> simple concept but because they go about </connor>
<connor> it in a scientific way it's really cool </connor>
<connor> to just see them be like all right so </connor>
<connor> there's the myths for example that yeah </connor>
<connor> um there's the myth for example that </connor>
<garnt> like uh enough balloons can pick up a </garnt>
<connor> human body off yeah so then they go out </connor>
<connor> and go all right how many balloons would </connor>
<connor> it actually take to pick up an average </connor>
<connor> human body off the ground and so they </connor>
<connor> would go through all this or like you </connor>
<joey> know another one was like um how many </joey>
<joey> layers of uh of glass could stop a </joey>
<connor> bullet yes for example there's also like </connor>
<connor> you know can salsa dissolve prison bars </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah just like </joey>
<connor> just like all like a uh floss like a </connor>
<connor> teeth floss yeah can it cut through a </connor>
<connor> steel bar for example it's so it's like </connor>
<connor> they basically take common myths or like </connor>
<joey> stuff you see in movies and they go is </joey>
<connor> like is that Capital fact it's basically </connor>
<connor> it's like uh you know the the </connor>
<connor> predecessor to crazy YouTube engineering </connor>
<garnt> Channel yeah obviously I was going to </garnt>
<garnt> say this did science YouTube before </garnt>
<connor> science YouTube yeah yeah absolutely </connor>
<connor> it's very it's very uh it feels very </connor>
<connor> nerdy yeah and it feels very you know </connor>
<connor> doesn't care if you don't like the show </connor>
<joey> or you don't like the style it feels </joey>
<garnt> like they just wanted to make the show </garnt>
<connor> and make it for them yeah and make it </connor>
<garnt> the way they wanted it and blow stuff up </garnt>
<joey> yeah it was it was one of the few shows </joey>
<joey> that managed to make science cool oh </joey>
<joey> yeah because whenever we think of </joey>
<garnt> science engineering we just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> fall asleep because like why why should </connor>
<garnt> I give a [ __ ] about chemistry or boring </garnt>
<garnt> or like you know [ __ ] sorry </garnt>
<connor> the reason we give about chemistry is </connor>
<garnt> Breaking Bad that's right but but now oh </garnt>
<garnt> you're telling me that chemistry can </garnt>
<connor> blow things up and set things on fire </connor>
<joey> okay suddenly I care now just like like </joey>
<connor> in a lot of in a lot of the episodes </connor>
<connor> what I really enjoyed is the fact that </connor>
<connor> it was just purely Adam and Jamie just </connor>
<joey> being like </joey>
<joey> what if this would happen or like have </joey>
<joey> you ever thought about could this be </joey>
<joey> real like a one that's really good is </joey>
<joey> like um shell shock from grenades how </joey>
<joey> close like it's the uh the myth of like </joey>
<joey> if there's a grenade about to go off and </joey>
<joey> someone Dives on top of it then that </joey>
<joey> will save everybody else yeah and so </joey>
<connor> what they would do is they would like </connor>
<connor> out of ballistics gel that would create </connor>
<connor> a human shaped thing that would put it </connor>
<connor> on top of a grenade they would put </connor>
<connor> another human some distance away and </connor>
<connor> then they would see if that human being </connor>
<connor> dies yeah and it was just funny because </connor>
<joey> it was just an excuse for them to just </joey>
<garnt> blow up a bunch of grenades I mean it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's funny because you you started those </garnt>
<garnt> the soft being like you know what they </garnt>
<garnt> did it for the name of science you know </garnt>
<garnt> they want to blow [ __ ] off yeah I was </garnt>
<garnt> just like talking to the safety third </garnt>
<garnt> guys I'm like I just realized they just </garnt>
<joey> find like the most convoluted reasons to </joey>
<joey> find to find a reason to blow [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> you know that's true and that's that's </joey>
<joey> MythBusters basically honestly and so </joey>
<joey> like oh you know a lot of like I [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> watch the show religiously it was like </connor>
<connor> my favorite thing to watch it's a great </connor>
<connor> TV show oh it's fantastic very well </connor>
<connor> yeah um editing any [ __ ] goes without </connor>
<joey> saying probably one of the best Cartoon </joey>
<connor> Network shows to come out I just love </connor>
<connor> edit nitty a lot I love the um I've got </connor>
<connor> the name of the uh this art style where </connor>
<joey> the the every character's lines are </joey>
<joey> always moving oh that's like like a </joey>
<joey> rubber hose no no rubber hose is more </joey>
<connor> like Disney like right oh like 30s </connor>
<connor> animations yeah it's like it's like a </connor>
<connor> it's like boiling lines or something </connor>
<connor> I love that the color palette oh yeah </connor>
<joey> nuts I mean and like just it's one of </joey>
<joey> those shows that where I feel the </joey>
<joey> original creators were just like what's </joey>
<joey> human anatomy yeah that doesn't exist </joey>
<joey> well tell us about the surgery what </joey>
<joey> happens Ed and Eddie's basically just a </joey>
<joey> Cartoon Network show from the 90s where </joey>
<joey> it's just two thousands is it 2000 it </joey>
<joey> was the 90s for sure it's 2000 I don't </joey>
<joey> know it's somewhere around there though </joey>
<joey> early 2000s where it's basically just </joey>
<joey> based in a cul-de-sac in everyday </joey>
<joey> America and it's just a bunch of kids </joey>
<joey> just [ __ ] doing random [ __ ] in the </joey>
<connor> cul-de-sac to try and get jawbreakers so </connor>
<connor> try and get jawbreakers so they do a </connor>
<joey> bunch of schemes to try and money to get </joey>
<joey> your </joey>
<joey> they love these draw breakers for some </joey>
<connor> reason and they'll do anything yeah and </connor>
<connor> it's great every every character is </connor>
<connor> great that it's just fun show the voice </connor>
<connor> acting is so good yes it aged really </connor>
<joey> well really really well the animation </joey>
<joey> style is so good there's a there's a </joey>
<connor> clip that recently I found on YouTube </connor>
<connor> that I've just been obsessed with again </connor>
<connor> and it's just this one episode where uh </connor>
<joey> Eddie uh this guy in the middle here if </joey>
<joey> you don't know Eddie is like he he </joey>
<joey> dresses up as like a demon uh like </joey>
<joey> character to try and convince Ed who's </joey>
<joey> the dumb guy to do a bunch of weird [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> so that he could like turn him into like </joey>
<connor> a freak to like earn it a freak Show and </connor>
<connor> there's one scene where he's just like </connor>
<connor> eat your mattress and then edges looks </connor>
<connor> at the bed and he's like okay </connor>
<connor> and then it double D this little guy Ed </connor>
<joey> comes in and it's just this scene of </joey>
<joey> just Edge [ __ ] eating this mattress </joey>
<connor> hole and it's the most like okay before </connor>
<joey> it was yeah it was just like good Lord </joey>
<joey> man he's just eating this mattress </joey>
<joey> um it's just the most absurdist humor </joey>
<garnt> ever but it's really really [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> funny like one thing that like </joey>
<joey> re-remembering Ed Edd and Eddie makes me </joey>
<joey> realize is that our cartoons as weird </joey>
<connor> now no no </connor>
<joey> a little bit a little bit different way </joey>
<joey> yeah because I feel Eden Eddie kind of </joey>
<garnt> falls into the same genre of cartoons as </garnt>
<garnt> like you know the remnants team yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they're in Stimpy where it's like so </garnt>
<connor> absurdist to the point where it's almost </connor>
<connor> gross oh yeah the art style can be gross </connor>
<garnt> at times yeah well I was just I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> thinking about it I'm like man I watched </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of weird [ __ ] as a kid this era of </garnt>
<connor> Cartoon Network had some of the weirdest </connor>
<garnt> television yeah it's like the Golden Era </garnt>
<connor> of course oh yeah like Cow and Chicken </connor>
<connor> was another one where I'm just like oh </connor>
<joey> Cow and Chicken </joey>
<garnt> like these shows are [ __ ] weird well </garnt>
<joey> like if you put this on Adult Swim it </joey>
<joey> would totally just blend in oh </joey>
<connor> absolutely and I'm just like how did we </connor>
<joey> grow up with these cartoons that's so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] weird what yeah like re-watching </joey>
<joey> some scenes of Ed and Nanny I'm like how </joey>
<joey> did I not get traumatized with some of </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] I'm seeing right now like dude </connor>
<joey> yeah I would not show my kids </joey>
<connor> kind of group Vibe uh yeah I kind of did </connor>
<joey> um I was definitely like the the Eddie </joey>
<connor> type of character where I'm just like I </connor>
<connor> was just convincing other people to do </connor>
<connor> dumb [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that makes sense yeah I definitely had a </connor>
<joey> friend who was like Ed yeah I was just </joey>
<garnt> like anything I told him to do he would </garnt>
<garnt> do I think everyone every friend group </garnt>
<garnt> had an edge but that's the thing that's </garnt>
<joey> what I think that's what I think was so </joey>
<joey> good about ednetty was that it was such </joey>
<connor> an absurdist like completely just like </connor>
<connor> out of the norm type of show but the </connor>
<connor> characters fundamentally were characters </connor>
<connor> that you could recognize whereas like </connor>
<connor> there was at least one character in edin </connor>
<connor> Eddie where you're like I have a friend </connor>
<connor> who's like that or I'm like that </connor>
<connor> um music as well oh do an intro opening </connor>
<joey> song </joey>
<connor> best one so good um do I have to talk </connor>
<connor> about Arthur we say it's God is Arthur's </connor>
<connor> got it if you don't know what Arthur is </connor>
<joey> just watch Arthur how would you even </joey>
<joey> describe our [ __ ] children's TV but it's </joey>
<joey> so good that an adult could probably </joey>
<joey> enjoy it yeah like it is literally made </joey>
<connor> for like five-year-olds but it's written </connor>
<connor> so well that like again like as an adult </connor>
<joey> you're like this is not it's it's so </joey>
<joey> weird because it kind of hides its very </joey>
<connor> adult themes in a very like friendly for </connor>
<joey> children type of way like I think it's </joey>
<connor> really I think Arthur is one of the best </connor>
<connor> shows when it comes to subtle writing </connor>
<connor> yeah where it's like before you realize </connor>
<connor> it this character has been built up to </connor>
<joey> be something that you can kind of be </joey>
<joey> like yeah I I get what you're going </joey>
<connor> through this is a really good episodes </connor>
<joey> yeah even when I was like 16 yeah come </joey>
<connor> back from school if Arthur was on I'd </connor>
<connor> watch Arthur oh yeah yeah I loved Arthur </connor>
<joey> speaking of Banger openings my life oh </joey>
<garnt> my God one of the most legendary </garnt>
<garnt> cartoons </garnt>
<garnt> ingrained in my mind </garnt>
<joey> etched in dude everybody thought they </joey>
<joey> were roster when they were listening to </joey>
<garnt> this [ __ ] you know but uh very much a </garnt>
<connor> shame that it's gone </connor>
<garnt> you're a legend in our hearts it's it's </garnt>
<joey> weird because I know I watched so many </joey>
<garnt> episodes of Arthur I don't know if I was </garnt>
<joey> just too young no you do yeah but I </joey>
<garnt> don't like remember much of it it's it's </garnt>
<joey> it's it's only through memes that I'm </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah this kind of happened </joey>
<joey> wearing the headphones yeah wearing the </joey>
<connor> headphones on top of the years yeah the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] Arthur fist yeah that's Legend </connor>
<joey> what about that uh what was it it was </joey>
<connor> the the meme of um what's the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bulldog looking guy and he's like yeah I </connor>
<connor> I can't remember and he's like and he </connor>
<joey> puts the headphones in he just like </joey>
<connor> starts tripping </connor>
<connor> I love that one it's so good it's like a </connor>
<joey> really good show okay um the final two </joey>
<joey> ones are very Australian they look they </joey>
<connor> look Australian holy [ __ ] which one do </connor>
<joey> you want to start with okay uh Russell </joey>
<joey> coits all Aussie Adventures okay so this </joey>
<joey> was um do you know the show Katherine </joey>
<joey> Kim no it's like very like one of the </joey>
<joey> most quintessential Australian sitcom </joey>
<connor> shows very very funny we're only </connor>
<joey> important neighbors yeah well okay so it </joey>
<garnt> was it was if if neighbors is like </garnt>
<garnt> number one Captain Kinsley number two </garnt>
<garnt> it's like one of the most beloved shows </garnt>
<garnt> um I thought about putting that on there </garnt>
<connor> but this guy uh he's uh I keep </connor>
<connor> forgetting the guy's name the actor's </connor>
<joey> name but he's also a comedian Russell </joey>
<connor> Russell Coit is this character oh so </connor>
<joey> basically this is a parody of like a </joey>
<connor> kind of survival like Steve Owen </connor>
<joey> survival in Australia type of </joey>
<connor> educational shows except this guy whose </connor>
<joey> real name is not Russell Queen he's an </joey>
<connor> actor he plays this character called </connor>
<connor> Russell Coit who's like the most </connor>
<connor> stereotypical like yeah I'm a you know </connor>
<connor> I'm a survival expert out in Australia </connor>
<connor> and he tries to give and it's it's just </connor>
<connor> the sketch comedy show where it's </connor>
<connor> Russell Coit just trying to like kind of </connor>
<connor> tell you about like how this like this </connor>
<connor> is how you build a flyer in Australia or </connor>
<connor> like oh I just found a a a red belly </connor>
<connor> black snake here's how you like get rid </connor>
<connor> of it but it always ends up in the most </connor>
<connor> like horrific ways oh that's awesome </connor>
<connor> there's this one scene where he's </connor>
<connor> talking to some indigenous Australian </connor>
<garnt> people </garnt>
<garnt> um and uh and and and he's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> getting them to like you know teach them </garnt>
<joey> about like how to like pick berries in </joey>
<garnt> the wildlife and stuff yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> learning from them but there's this </joey>
<joey> reoccurring joke in in Russell Coit </joey>
<joey> where every time Russell Coit goes up to </joey>
<joey> someone and gives him a handshake </joey>
<joey> there's this one clip that replays every </joey>
<joey> single handshake so it's like it's just </joey>
<joey> it's almost like this stock image video </joey>
<joey> of just the close-up of the hands right </joey>
<joey> hand shaking these two white guys </joey>
<joey> handshaking and it plays every time </joey>
<joey> Russell Coit goes up to a new person and </joey>
<joey> gives him a handshake so this is one end </joey>
<joey> of one episode where he's talking to </joey>
<joey> these like indigenous Australians and </joey>
<joey> he's going up to handshake all of them </joey>
<joey> every time he goes into handshake it </joey>
<joey> just cuts to two white guys handshaking </joey>
<connor> every and it's like it's this show is </connor>
<garnt> like that sounds like a meme yeah it oh </garnt>
<connor> it is it dude like when people go back </connor>
<connor> so like adults or both oh yeah like it's </connor>
<connor> there were some there were some </connor>
<connor> instances where like it was very like </connor>
<connor> adult oriented where like he would </connor>
<connor> actually get hurt in the show but in </connor>
<connor> like a comedic kind of way but it was </connor>
<connor> just so incredibly funny because it's </connor>
<garnt> one of the most perfect examples of just </garnt>
<garnt> really subtle comedy in like sketch </garnt>
<connor> comedy shows right I don't know how well </connor>
<connor> it is aged today uh it might be you know </connor>
<connor> because I think this is from like the </connor>
<joey> late 90s I think early 90s okay today's </joey>
<connor> falling yeah yeah so some a lot a lot of </connor>
<joey> comedies of age Paul a lot of comedies </joey>
<joey> very </joey>
<joey> and another comedy that might have aged </joey>
<joey> poorly from that time is this one uh </joey>
<garnt> it's called fat Pizza </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> so this is a show </garnt>
<garnt> so Kevin right our boy Kevin Kevin yeah </garnt>
<garnt> we [ __ ] bonded over the show again </garnt>
<garnt> the other day when we were when we were </garnt>
<garnt> in Australia because this is one of </garnt>
<garnt> those shows where I think everyone in </garnt>
<garnt> our age group watched this show all </garnt>
<garnt> right um so basically like you guys were </garnt>
<garnt> talking about Peep Show being like the </garnt>
<garnt> peak of like British cringe comedy yeah </garnt>
<joey> this is probably the Australian </joey>
<garnt> equivalent to it right okay so it's this </garnt>
<joey> show about uh this this guy Paulie uh </joey>
<joey> who is this like uh Italian Australian </joey>
<joey> immigrant </joey>
<joey> um and it's basically about his </joey>
<joey> character he's like a pizza delivery guy </joey>
<joey> okay and he works at this like really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] sketch pizza shop right this </joey>
<joey> really sketch neighborhood of Australia </joey>
<joey> um and it's basically just like the </joey>
<joey> daily shenanigans that he gets up to </joey>
<joey> where he has to deal with like these </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] horrendous like Bogan </garnt>
<garnt> customers and like uh because uh Paul </garnt>
<garnt> Paulie this actor's name I think his </garnt>
<garnt> actual real name is Paul as well right </garnt>
<garnt> um and uh all of the cast members are </garnt>
<garnt> like you know uh Italian immigrants in </garnt>
<garnt> Australia or like uh like Lebanese </garnt>
<garnt> immigrants in Australia and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of the it's it's very much </garnt>
<garnt> revolved around like kind of the </garnt>
<garnt> European and Middle Eastern immigrants </garnt>
<garnt> who migrated to Australia so a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> that kind of Comedy exists but you don't </garnt>
<garnt> have to be part of that race to </garnt>
<garnt> understand that comedy because it's so </garnt>
<garnt> ingrained in Australian comedy </garnt>
<garnt> um there's a really famous actress now </garnt>
<garnt> in Hollywood uh Rebel Wilson I think her </garnt>
<garnt> name is she started off in this show wow </garnt>
<garnt> Rebel Wilson she's not in this picture </garnt>
<joey> oh no this is right there oh yeah so she </joey>
<joey> started off this was like the show that </joey>
<joey> made her famous in Australia she played </joey>
<joey> this character called Tula who is this </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] obese-like girl who like </garnt>
<garnt> keeps ordering pizzas from this one okay </garnt>
<garnt> yeah okay and uh and and it's just like </garnt>
<joey> it's it's really [ __ ] difficult to </joey>
<joey> explain but basically it's hearing you </joey>
<joey> guys talk about Peep Show is basically </joey>
<joey> the Australian equivalent of that take a </joey>
<garnt> lot of cringe okay great great I'm </garnt>
<garnt> already interested </garnt>
<garnt> it's incredibly cringe it can be </garnt>
<joey> incredibly offensive at times but also </joey>
<garnt> really really funny yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um my Australian Brothers I know you get </garnt>
<garnt> you guys get your sarcasm your cringe </garnt>
<garnt> humor oh yes that's why like I would be </garnt>
<garnt> very interested to watch this yeah I </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] love it I feel this is the </joey>
<joey> perfect window into what Australian like </joey>
<connor> you know comedy and like Civilization is </connor>
<connor> kind of like super sexy </connor>
<connor> we live in a civilization because to be </connor>
<joey> fair I have been to some places in like </joey>
<garnt> kind of outer Australia yeah where it </garnt>
<joey> gives off this Vibe okay like these are </joey>
<garnt> like they're exaggerations I think of </garnt>
<garnt> people that exist in real life yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> is is there a particular scene that uh </garnt>
<joey> sticks out oh [ __ ] I don't know so like </joey>
<joey> uh like there's this one scene where </joey>
<joey> like uh Paulie gets like uh he has like </joey>
<joey> this uh friend who this Lebanese friend </joey>
<joey> uh called Habib </joey>
<joey> um and he like pisses off Habib for </joey>
<joey> doing something and then habib's just </joey>
<joey> like don't [ __ ] get in my way bro I'm </joey>
<joey> gonna call up all my cousins and then </joey>
<joey> he's just like how many cousins do you </joey>
<joey> have here and then five minutes later </joey>
<joey> there's just like over the hill there's </joey>
<joey> just these like 40 cars just full of </joey>
<joey> these Lebanese dudes that just like rock </joey>
<connor> up to the pizza shop and just start </connor>
<joey> beating the [ __ ] out of Paulie </joey>
<joey> and then and then Habib he he's like </joey>
<connor> this character he plays like this like </connor>
<connor> stereotypical like Lebanese Australian </connor>
<connor> guy so every time he takes off his shirt </connor>
<connor> it's just like completely just like full </connor>
<connor> of hair like you can't see any of his </connor>
<garnt> skin at all and it just like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> plays into those stereotypes yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> not in like a way where it's like racist </garnt>
<garnt> if that makes sense it's just like a lot </garnt>
<connor> of like just very you know </connor>
<joey> tongue-in-cheap like slapstick comedy </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah um that's very Australian all </connor>
<joey> right um and yeah that's uh my I don't </joey>
<garnt> watch TV tonight how hard was it to make </garnt>
<joey> this to be fair thinking about it now I </joey>
<joey> would probably replace maybe like </joey>
<joey> because I completely forgot about Top </joey>
<connor> Gear yeah yeah I'm like I mean I could </connor>
<connor> have put that down and I'm like what the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] I watch so much [ __ ] Top Gear so </joey>

<garnt> I could have put on mine yeah exactly </garnt>
<joey> hello we watch the same pop regular TV </joey>
<connor> shows yeah uh there's a couple I don't </connor>
<garnt> know okay so starting from </garnt>
<connor> these are these are so famous these are </connor>
<connor> literally some of the most popular shows </connor>
<connor> what's this one this is TV show </connor>
<connor> except I just framed it right this time </connor>
<connor> okay okay so so I guess we don't talk </connor>
<garnt> about Pete's show yeah but I don't need </garnt>
<garnt> to talk about teachers Always Sunny Game </garnt>
<garnt> of Thrones Peep Show the good place uh </garnt>
<garnt> the original Justice League cartoon </garnt>
<garnt> shinobu uh Chernobyl sorry Battlestar </garnt>
<garnt> Galactica Black Mirror and Doctor Who I </garnt>
<joey> am very surprised by Battlestar </joey>
<joey> Galactica yeah hold up what okay okay </joey>
<connor> why why why Battlestar life you've never </connor>
<garnt> mentioned an interesting like sci-fi </garnt>
<garnt> stuff actually I I've realized it when </garnt>
<garnt> making this list but I've really [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> love Sci-Fi TV shows what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> you've never talked about yeah why have </joey>
<garnt> you never like hinted at that what do </garnt>
<joey> you mean okay this is the music is it </joey>
<garnt> because that I already talked about </garnt>
<connor> isakaya yeah you literally have never </connor>
<connor> given inclination that you give a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> about I would take you more seriously if </joey>
<connor> you stop talking about music you didn't </connor>
<connor> talk about Dune huh you didn't talk </connor>
<garnt> about doing much I [ __ ] love dude </garnt>
<connor> dude's great dude's [ __ ] great I </connor>
<connor> think it's weird I think it's weird </connor>
<joey> right because I [ __ ] love uh sci-fi </joey>
<connor> but I just don't like Star Wars in terms </connor>
<joey> and that's like that's like that's like </joey>
<connor> whatever </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> um so yeah walk is um </connor>
<garnt> that's one of the few sci-fi shows oh </garnt>
<garnt> sorry one of the few uh television shows </garnt>
<connor> that I actually got to complete when I </connor>
<garnt> was in universities it's been a while </garnt>
<connor> since I watched battle started Galactica </connor>
<connor> but I enjoyed the sternie the journey </connor>
<joey> from start to end basically if you want </joey>
<garnt> a synopsis of the basic plot of </garnt>
<garnt> Battlestar Galactica it </garnt>
<garnt> uh humans have colonized the Galaxy and </garnt>
<garnt> there are like 13 colonies or some [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like that and then they also built AIS </garnt>
<garnt> right AI robots and of course the AIS </garnt>
<joey> had an uprising where the AIS I believe </joey>
<joey> they destroyed 12 of the 13 colonies </joey>
<joey> right yeah and the one remaining </joey>
<joey> surviving group of humans they tried to </joey>
<garnt> find the last </garnt>
<garnt> mythical 13th colony which is Earth </garnt>
<garnt> damn damn but uh what makes it </garnt>
<garnt> interesting is of course these are like </garnt>
<garnt> the last 50 or 60 000 humans that are </garnt>
<garnt> just traveling through space trying to </garnt>
<garnt> find this last Colony uh but of course </garnt>
<garnt> they're on the run from the robots which </garnt>
<garnt> is like I think I believe they're called </garnt>
<garnt> cylons </garnt>
<garnt> um but the twist is that the robots the </garnt>
<joey> cylons are so well programmed that there </joey>
<joey> are some cylons that have invaded this </joey>
<joey> Fleet right of humans but they're so </joey>
<joey> well programmed that they don't even </joey>
<joey> know that they're like a sleeper agent </joey>
<joey> right so and they look and sound and act </joey>
<joey> exactly like humans do and there's no </joey>
<joey> real way to detect them so basically </joey>
<joey> real Blade Runner [ __ ] huh that's a real </joey>
<garnt> Blade Runner Yeah so basically it's just </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] sci-fi Among Us you know </connor>
<connor> Among Us is sci-fi </connor>
<connor> I guess it is so it's just Among Us you </connor>
<garnt> know what Among Us it's just Battlestar </garnt>
<connor> Galactica with the suits on okay how </connor>
<connor> many seasons it's battlestock I like to </connor>
<connor> get the game okay this is what I liked </connor>
<joey> about Battlestar galatzuka I believe </joey>
<connor> it's only four seasons and it finished </connor>
<connor> it up yes it's all finished it's a </connor>
<joey> complete story </joey>
<joey> um but what I found really what one </joey>
<joey> that's the one thing I really really </joey>
<joey> liked because that's why I've rarely </joey>
<joey> rarely finished TV shows yeah uh number </joey>
<joey> two </joey>
<joey> uh is that even though they have this </joey>
<joey> you know tension between like oh who's </joey>
<joey> who's a human who's a Cylon and </joey>
<joey> everything like that what I really liked </joey>
<joey> about the show is how it took this one </joey>
<joey> group of colonies and really explored </joey>
<joey> some really interesting ideas about what </joey>
<joey> would happen if you try to govern these </joey>
<joey> group of people right so basically they </joey>
<joey> kind of created a mini Nation right and </joey>
<garnt> they they draw you in with like the </garnt>
<garnt> Space Battles and just the pew pew pew </garnt>
<garnt> and all that stuff like that but then </garnt>
<garnt> what's yeah yeah exactly but what kept </garnt>
<garnt> me interesting interested was in fact </garnt>
<garnt> the politics the politics behind behind </garnt>
<garnt> the spaceship the space this last space </garnt>
<garnt> colony and like what happened between </garnt>
<garnt> how you govern all of the humans and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that on and I found that </garnt>
<garnt> way more interesting than the PPP and </garnt>
<garnt> like the Among Us part of the uh part of </garnt>
<connor> the show I mean visual services so far </connor>
<connor> visuals can only take you so far </connor>
<joey> um it is just one of the best sci-fi </joey>
<joey> shows I've question then did you enjoy </joey>
<garnt> Firefly </garnt>
<garnt> I have not seen Firefly okay because I </garnt>
<joey> feel from if you liked Battlestar </joey>
<joey> Galactica I think you'd really like it </joey>
<garnt> like have you seen Firefly yeah okay all </garnt>
<joey> I know is I didn't finish yeah well they </joey>
<joey> made a movie called Serenity afterwards </joey>
<joey> which was supposed to be like the is </joey>
<garnt> that the sequel is that really like a </garnt>
<joey> sequel to it though no because I've seen </joey>
<joey> Serenity no it's not it's not a secret </joey>
<joey> what okay what is fireflies about </joey>
<joey> because all I know is like a space </joey>
<garnt> spaghetti western or something like that </garnt>
<joey> pretty much I'm trying to also remember </joey>
<connor> what it was about to be honest what </connor>
<connor> shouldn't find I just remember it being </connor>
<garnt> really good because like I fireflies is </garnt>
<garnt> that one show that every person tells </garnt>
<joey> you to watch yeah every every Sci-Fi TV </joey>
<garnt> fan will be like Firefly best yeah I fly </garnt>
<garnt> best and I'm like but it was right by </garnt>
<joey> Joss Whedon is that a good thing or a </joey>
<joey> bad thing anymore I don't know you know </joey>
<garnt> like it's that thing you know okay it </garnt>
<joey> kind of piss me off anyway but I guess </joey>
<joey> next okay while we're on uh sci-fi then </joey>
<joey> Doctor Who okay okay because me seeing </joey>
<joey> that immediately I was like holy [ __ ] I </joey>
<joey> forgot this show existed </joey>
<garnt> but more broadly Doctor Who in the </garnt>
<garnt> Russell T Davis era okay yes so </garnt>
<garnt> basically I'm okay the thing about </garnt>
<garnt> Doctor Who fans is a lot of them are </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] insufferable right they're </garnt>
<garnt> they're like the they're like the modern </garnt>
<garnt> Star Trek fans of old you know I think </garnt>
<joey> same thing can be said for a lot of </joey>
<joey> these shows to be honest </joey>
<joey> I mean if a Show's good in some way yeah </joey>
<garnt> long running it gets insufferable yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean but like that's why I like I </garnt>
<garnt> really talk about Doctor Who but like </garnt>
<garnt> I.E it's a good show it's a really </garnt>
<connor> really [ __ ] show and I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> this I I said Battlestar galatzka is one </connor>
<connor> of the best sci-fi shows I've seen </connor>
<connor> Doctor Who is the best sci-fi shows it </connor>
<connor> is I I'll agree with that yeah yeah it </connor>
<connor> is in terms of like TV shows yeah it is </connor>
<joey> by far the show that tackles the most </joey>
<joey> weirdest ideas you could ever imagine </joey>
<joey> and it has like what I love about Doctor </joey>
<joey> Who is that every episode is like kind </joey>
<joey> of self-contained right every episode </joey>
<joey> tackles a different idea a different </joey>
<joey> time period a different place in space </joey>
<joey> and time right that's what that's what </joey>
<garnt> makes it so [ __ ] interesting but then </garnt>
<garnt> it has like an overarching plot as well </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't necessarily need to watch </garnt>
<joey> the beginning of Doctor Who to </joey>
<garnt> appreciate it </garnt>
<joey> you can't because no one knows where the </joey>
<joey> episodes are because the BBC dumped all </joey>
<joey> the episodes oh really well because back </joey>
<connor> in the day they thought why the [ __ ] are </connor>
<joey> we need to Archive this stuff oh [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> threw it away so I think a bunch of the </connor>
<garnt> original original original logical </garnt>
<garnt> episodes are on you can watch them it's </garnt>
<connor> like lost media yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's probably never going to be found </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like to me like Doctor Who like </garnt>
<joey> David Tennant's obviously my doctor but </joey>
<joey> I all I really really he's my doctor oh </joey>
<joey> God I sound like fun </joey>
<garnt> I always like Doctor Who when I watched </garnt>
<connor> it yeah but I just never got into it </connor>
<connor> like I would watch episodes here and </connor>
<garnt> there you know the Christmas special </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah I think I started with like </connor>
<joey> because because David Taylor was the </joey>
<joey> 10th season yeah </joey>
<joey> um and I think I started on like season </joey>
<joey> eight of season nine I don't remember </joey>
<garnt> which one is this after like the who was </garnt>
<garnt> the doctor I don't remember whoever it </garnt>
<garnt> was before oh bless you whoever </garnt>
<joey> I would know his face if I saw it </joey>
<garnt> whoever it wasn't was it it was whoever </garnt>
<connor> before it was before David okay that was </connor>
<connor> Christopher okay okay it was uh that was </connor>
<connor> the first one I watched where I'm like </connor>
<garnt> oh what is this show and then I said and </garnt>
<joey> then David tennan Doctor Who like season </joey>
<garnt> 10 where I was just like holy [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's great he liked an amazing actor </garnt>
<joey> yeah like like the Christopher Eccleston </joey>
<joey> also amazing actor as well </joey>
<garnt> yeah I just think that it wasn't Matt </garnt>
<joey> Smith's fault it was like Stephen </joey>
<joey> moffat's fault was it Stephen Moffat I </joey>
<garnt> think it's Stephen Moffat I don't know </garnt>
<joey> which season was the week John left the </joey>
<connor> BBC yeah I stopped watching Doctor Who </connor>
<connor> once I left the BBC okay yeah he bad no </connor>
<joey> loyalty to it anyway the Weeping Angels </joey>
<joey> episode is by far my favorite yeah </joey>
<joey> because that is probably the most </joey>
<joey> unnerving episode of Television ever </joey>
<garnt> because like the the real beauty of </garnt>
<joey> Doctor Who is I remember I remember </joey>
<joey> getting into dog two through Christopher </joey>
<joey> Eccleston and that was like when the </joey>
<joey> Russell T Davis era started </joey>
<joey> um and I remember watching like a few </joey>
<joey> episodes and I was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> look at the monsters man look that's </joey>
<joey> that's literally this is literally the </joey>
<joey> worst CGI I've ever seen in my life so </joey>
<garnt> I'm the CGI would make [ __ ] some of </garnt>
<garnt> the anime CJ it would make berserk 2017 </garnt>
<garnt> look like [ __ ] God's here man that's </garnt>
<joey> how bad the CGI was and I'm like this is </joey>
<garnt> absolute garbage why does everyone hype </garnt>
<joey> up Doctor Who but then I just like you </joey>
<joey> just keep watching and somehow the </joey>
<joey> writing is so compelling that it it </joey>
<joey> dances the perfect line between </joey>
<joey> campiness and you know just epicness </joey>
<garnt> it's just great television because it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's something where if you just step </garnt>
<garnt> out for a minute and just look at it out </garnt>
<garnt> of context look at like something like </garnt>
<garnt> the Daleks or something and I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like and you're just like why uh why is </garnt>
<joey> this guy pointing a light at a talking </joey>
<garnt> washing machine or extermining why is it </garnt>
<connor> got a [ __ ] suction cup look [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] it looks [ __ ] ridiculous right </garnt>
<connor> but that just shows how [ __ ] good the </connor>
<connor> writing is and the actors are of this </connor>
<connor> like Doctor Who world right and that </connor>
<connor> yeah there's just there's just a certain </connor>
<connor> magic where technically it is also a </connor>
<connor> children's show but it turns everyone </connor>
<connor> who watches it into a child oh yeah well </connor>
<connor> it turns you it gives it turns you back </connor>
<connor> into that point in life where you didn't </connor>
<garnt> question things too much you just saw </garnt>
<garnt> something cool on TV and you're just </garnt>
<garnt> like wow that's that's that's scary you </garnt>
<connor> know and yeah </connor>
<joey> always go to the [ __ ] Doctor Who </joey>
<joey> Museum in Cardiff yeah really yeah </joey>
<joey> because a lot a lot of uh Doctor Who's </joey>
<joey> shot in Wales oh really sorry I mean </joey>
<connor> Cardiff they have a ton of like a big </connor>
<connor> Museum or something I remember oh my God </connor>
<connor> my school used to drag me and I was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hate this I don't like doctor </connor>
<connor> here I I also have a family guy Museum I </connor>
<joey> also thought </joey>
<joey> I also thought it was really genius the </joey>
<joey> writing that they Incorporated I guess </joey>
<connor> for the TV show where like at the end of </connor>
<connor> each season like when the doctor dies </connor>
<connor> quote unquote like he's just like no he </connor>
<joey> doesn't die it's just another version of </joey>
<connor> him dying and that's just like a great </connor>
<joey> way to just be like all right next </joey>
<joey> season who who wants to be the doctor </joey>
<garnt> yeah who wants to be the doctor I also </garnt>
<joey> think it's a good way to like reset the </joey>
<connor> house yeah to one freshen up and it just </connor>
<connor> resets the ongoing story because the </connor>
<garnt> thing is even though there's like one </garnt>
<garnt> there's one massive ongoing story which </garnt>
<garnt> is like the doctor tries to find his </garnt>
<garnt> home planet you know but then every </garnt>
<garnt> iteration of a doctor who has their own </garnt>
<garnt> kind of self-contained story with their </garnt>
<garnt> own characters their own Side characters </garnt>
<garnt> within their own self-contained story uh </garnt>
<connor> I just think uh I just think uh yeah </connor>
<garnt> David sounds amazing David is [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amazing I mean he's just an amazing </garnt>
<connor> actor and Jessica Jones he's insane [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> you know like I'm has he been in more </garnt>
<garnt> roles aside from Doctor Who and Jessica </garnt>
<connor> Jones I think he does a lot of theater </connor>
<garnt> yeah so I think he he doesn't do as much </garnt>
<joey> TV I think he's theater trainer right </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> I think he I think he does a lot of </connor>
<connor> theater yeah as much on the side of uh </connor>
<connor> yeah he's really good yeah uh anyway </connor>
<garnt> Doctor Who it's worse </garnt>
<connor> let's talk about Game of Thrones I </connor>
<joey> wanted to talk about that first okay </joey>
<connor> going going off the Breaking Bad uh Game </connor>
<connor> of Thrones going off the Breaking Bad </connor>
<garnt> Point okay okay this is definitely going </garnt>
<joey> to be a hot take </joey>
<garnt> I thought season 8 was the best what are </garnt>
<garnt> you gonna say I prefer the later seasons </garnt>
<connor> of Game of Thrones [ __ ] oh God genuinely </connor>
<connor> okay genuinely do you know how bad oh </connor>
<connor> that is I I was tired right we've been </connor>
<connor> filming all day that woke me the [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> I will tell you how bad of a take that </joey>
<joey> was I haven't seen a single episode of </joey>
<connor> Game of Thrones and I know that was gone </connor>
<connor> that's how I know how much of a bad </connor>
<connor> thing that was like it's like I want the </connor>
<garnt> one written by uh the people who didn't </garnt>
<garnt> read the book and I want Ed Sheeran in </garnt>
<garnt> it and I want people </garnt>
<garnt> yeah Ed Sheeran was in an episode like </garnt>
<connor> it is it is just bad oh my God what do </connor>
<connor> you like about that what explain </connor>
<garnt> yourself okay okay you're on trial right </garnt>
<garnt> now okay I'm on trial right now like I </garnt>
<connor> said like I said about breaking bad it </connor>
<connor> felt like tell me the season it got good </connor>
<connor> first and then tell me why </connor>
<garnt> um I mean I mean I think it was always </garnt>
<connor> good okay well it was always good but it </connor>
<connor> just got when I really when I really got </connor>
<connor> invested was around season six my </connor>
<garnt> favorite season was about season seven </garnt>
<joey> uh I mean season seven the One season </joey>
<joey> where like oh everyone got pissed off no </joey>
<joey> no that's season eight oh that's season </joey>
<joey> eight and even even I'm like okay season </joey>
<connor> eight okay that's that was that was that </connor>
<joey> was seven that was a little blunder that </joey>
<joey> was a little blunder right there all </joey>
<joey> right but I I okay because here's the </joey>
<garnt> thing right going back to my Breaking </garnt>
<garnt> Bad energy I know I got the entire world </garnt>
<garnt> watching me right now I have got the </garnt>
<joey> entire [ __ ] world watching me right </joey>
<joey> now and then people will wonder man why </joey>
<connor> is the subreddit spiking </connor>
<connor> after this episode goes live you just </connor>
<connor> here I can understand the Breaking Bad </connor>
<joey> take you this one feels irredeemable I </joey>
<garnt> can't wait to read the comments on this </garnt>
<garnt> episode go on </garnt>
<garnt> like I said Game of Thrones seasons one </garnt>
<connor> to four is almost perfect television </connor>
<joey> it's [ __ ] fantastic yeah characters </joey>
<connor> are well written well defined the World </connor>
<connor> building is amazing and everything like </connor>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> um like I said seasons one to four I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't really have any emotional </garnt>
<connor> attachment to it it's literally George </connor>
<connor> RR Martin's baby at that point that's </connor>
<connor> he's he did everything at that point no </connor>
<connor> I no no I I agree so how do you how do </connor>
<connor> you what how do you get more attached </connor>
<connor> when [ __ ] HBO takes over with their </connor>
<garnt> generic Riders because one thing that I </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] love one aspect I love in any </garnt>
<garnt> media is when you have different kind of </garnt>
<joey> different kind of aspects and cultures </joey>
<joey> clashing together right that's kind of </joey>
<joey> like why I've really I'm invested in the </joey>
<joey> MCU where you have you know Wizards and </joey>
<joey> superheroes and now you know [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Cosmic God people all existing within </joey>
<joey> the same universe and that's that's kind </joey>
<joey> of that's because that's what drew me </joey>
<joey> into Game of Thrones originally and what </joey>
<joey> I [ __ ] my favorite parts of Game of </joey>
<joey> Thrones was in the later Seasons when </joey>
<joey> you finally saw this these different </joey>
<joey> worlds that have been built up in </joey>
<joey> seasons one two and three and four and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that you finally saw all </joey>
<garnt> these worlds kind of colliding in </garnt>
<garnt> together and having some really really </garnt>
<garnt> cool moments is the writing as good [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> no okay I will fully admit the writing </garnt>
<garnt> is not as good but was it [ __ ] badass </garnt>
<garnt> seeing the Dothraki riding over a hill </garnt>
<garnt> with a [ __ ] Dragon like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> burning the Lannisters hell yeah that </garnt>
<connor> was bad [ __ ] ass and I will like </connor>
<connor> defend that [ __ ] all right I think it it </connor>
<connor> it built it up so well and then just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] unraveled the coil and then just </connor>
<connor> threw a bunch of cool battles at us to </connor>
<connor> distract our pretty little brains I </connor>
<connor> think it it squandered everything it </connor>
<connor> built up I I think it was about politics </connor>
<connor> and then it suddenly became about Ed </connor>
<connor> Sheeran and shitty battles and just </connor>
<garnt> rushing it no I will totally agree it it </garnt>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> Seasons you Game of Thrones was two </connor>
<connor> completely different shows I mean that's </connor>
<connor> I I fully admit it was two completely </connor>
<connor> different shows and technically I should </connor>
<connor> out of like every bone in my body think </connor>
<garnt> that the first four seasons are the </garnt>
<garnt> better ones but I'm following my heart </garnt>
<garnt> and my heart says you cool dragons for </garnt>
<garnt> burning stuff oh look at the dragons </garnt>
<garnt> burning the ice zombies isn't that so </garnt>
<connor> cool oh God if you wanted an easy card </connor>
<garnt> gun </garnt>
<garnt> yes okay yes let's get the [ __ ] out of </garnt>
<garnt> here with this [ __ ] tape I actually [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> take when do you okay when do you think </garnt>
<connor> Game of Thrones Go Bad season five </connor>
<connor> season five yeah season five started </connor>
<connor> falter what was it what was what </connor>
<connor> happened in season five again I felt </connor>
<connor> like season five </connor>
<connor> I can't remember exactly I do remember </connor>
<joey> because I had been watching Game of </joey>
<joey> Thrones weekly since season three season </joey>
<joey> three was amazing season four was just </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] god tier yeah one of the most </garnt>
<garnt> iconic moments in the series uh just it </garnt>
<garnt> was like headies and four season three </garnt>
<connor> season four as well I had the one fight </connor>
<connor> between the two people oh memorable oh </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah um I love how he just </joey>
<joey> fully understood no yeah you know it's </joey>
<garnt> that scene </garnt>
<connor> um I remember that scene actually gave </connor>
<connor> me PTSD like what yeah how seeing a </connor>
<connor> character and this happens a lot by the </connor>
<connor> way but there's there's one particular </connor>
<joey> scene where you saw a character that you </joey>
<joey> really liked I mean you got emotionally </joey>
<joey> attached to seeing them like get killed </joey>
<joey> off in such a gruesome way hmm it just </joey>
<connor> actually gave me like an emotional like </connor>
<connor> guttural reaction yeah me too yeah and </connor>
<garnt> it was isn't that a good thing though it </garnt>
<garnt> was horrible no no that's why it's good </garnt>
<garnt> though yeah I know I know they managed </garnt>
<garnt> to get that emotion out of you yeah I I </garnt>
<connor> totally agree it was a different thing </connor>
<connor> don't do that yeah I don't know man I </connor>
<joey> don't know what characters I'm just like </joey>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] that doesn't [ __ ] do it </garnt>
<connor> again yeah and then like you know end of </connor>
<garnt> season three as well what happened at </garnt>
<garnt> the end of season three one of the most </garnt>
<garnt> famous one of the most iconic TV moments </garnt>
<connor> of all time yes </connor>
<joey> no you've heard of it you know you have </joey>
<connor> heard of it yes don't know anything </connor>
<connor> about it I know you don't but the only </connor>
<connor> thing I know about Game of Thrones is </connor>
<connor> it's Lord of the Rings with tits yeah </connor>
<connor> like like that's what people have told </connor>
<connor> me like people are dumb yeah like I said </connor>
<garnt> I'm like you sold me like I said perfect </garnt>
<garnt> television </garnt>
<joey> is a pretty recent one I feel like I've </joey>
<connor> seen this if you've gone on Netflix </connor>
<connor> you've seen this yeah yeah yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> pushed it down everyone yeah this is </garnt>
<garnt> this is a Netflix show again only four </garnt>
<joey> seasons </joey>
<joey> um it passes itself off as a comedy but </joey>
<joey> I don't really think it's a comedy so </joey>
<joey> the whole premise of the good place is </joey>
<joey> uh you know the good place is an analogy </joey>
<joey> for heaven of course okay so all of </joey>
<joey> these people have died and gone to </joey>
<joey> heaven </joey>
<joey> except for Kristen Bell who is the main </joey>
<joey> character in the good place uh she wakes </joey>
<joey> up in heaven right but when they tell </joey>
<joey> her like when I talk about her life </joey>
<joey> story and identity in person she was and </joey>
<joey> everything she did on Earth she realizes </joey>
<joey> that she's up in heaven by mistake okay </joey>
<joey> and the whole premise initially is her </joey>
<joey> trying to convince everyone that yes she </joey>
<joey> is this person who they all believe her </joey>
<joey> to be and she is a good person that </joey>
<joey> belongs in heaven right uh and that's </joey>
<garnt> that's that's how the premise of the </garnt>
<garnt> story you know starts off and honestly </garnt>
<garnt> like I the good place started off as a </garnt>
<garnt> show that was just you know I just put </garnt>
<garnt> on in the background as background noise </garnt>
<garnt> I was like this isn't bad but this is </garnt>
<garnt> like good enough where I'm like I can </garnt>
<garnt> have it on the background just as white </garnt>
<garnt> noise to be like oh it's it's all right </garnt>
<garnt> it's all right it's it's a I like the </garnt>
<garnt> concept of like them going up to heaven </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that it was like a </garnt>
<garnt> nice little Chemistry Between all the </garnt>
<garnt> characters and everything like that it </garnt>
<garnt> was okay </garnt>
<garnt> um and then without spoiling what </garnt>
<garnt> happens a big twist happens at the end </garnt>
<garnt> of the first season </garnt>
<joey> that I like I did not know that it was </joey>
<joey> going to be that kind of show where it </joey>
<joey> turned the good place into just like a </joey>
<joey> kind of like wacky sitcom comedy into </joey>
<joey> these characters have a motive and </joey>
<garnt> they're going to try to achieve </garnt>
<garnt> something and I have an end goal and you </garnt>
<garnt> get to see not only the the character </garnt>
<garnt> progression but it kind of just becomes </garnt>
<connor> an entire Adventure right like Bojack </connor>
<connor> right like lulls you in with the funny </connor>
<connor> animals and just hits you with the </connor>
<garnt> depression yeah yeah exactly but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> one one thing I [ __ ] loved about the </garnt>
<garnt> good place is one like it is a whole </garnt>
<garnt> complete story right when you when you </garnt>
<garnt> think of most sitcoms sitcoms don't </garnt>
<garnt> really have stories you know what I mean </garnt>
<garnt> sitcoms are just okay you know you're </garnt>
<garnt> self-contained it's it's kind of like oh </garnt>
<garnt> which character's gonna get with which </garnt>
<garnt> character oh is Rachel gonna get with </garnt>
<garnt> Ross oh Rachel go with Ross by the way </garnt>
<garnt> end of friends bye-bye I really hope </garnt>
<joey> that wasn't going to I hope nobody cares </joey>
<joey> about that spoiler to be fair I was </joey>
<connor> close to putting friends on them that's </connor>
<connor> a good show </connor>
<garnt> but the point is there isn't really an </garnt>
<garnt> ongoing story yeah this one had comedic </garnt>
<garnt> moments right but what it what what </garnt>
<garnt> really shines in my eyes is the ongoing </garnt>
<joey> story and within this ongoing story it </joey>
<joey> tackles so many issues about the </joey>
<joey> afterlife about religion about morals </joey>
<joey> and it's one of those shows where you </joey>
<joey> get you get in on the laughs and you </joey>
<joey> know you say Bojack was about depression </joey>
<garnt> I was surprised you didn't put Bojack on </garnt>
<connor> by the way I thought I thought someone </connor>
<joey> would put Bojack yeah I don't know I </joey>
<garnt> didn't you know I feel like everything's </garnt>
<garnt> been said about it yeah yeah but like </garnt>
<garnt> the good place is one of those shows </garnt>
<garnt> where you end and it's just like such a </garnt>
<garnt> thing it leaves you with like such a </garnt>
<garnt> warm feeling where it feels like </garnt>
<connor> wholesome yeah it's it's it's I've </connor>
<connor> watched it through osmosis </connor>
<garnt> it's it's not just it's not just </garnt>
<garnt> wholesome but it gives you like a good </garnt>
<joey> life message at the end of it and you </joey>
<joey> feel like damn you know get sort of the </joey>
<garnt> opposite of Bojack the neutral yeah </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<connor> there are two sides of the coin yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah exactly where you know it you you </garnt>
<connor> leave the end of good place and I've </connor>
<connor> never just like I've never cried over a </connor>
<joey> leave in a good good place do I believe </joey>
<connor> in a good place do you leave in a good </connor>
<connor> place do you leave in a good place well </connor>
<joey> I won't spoil oh what the ending of good </joey>
<connor> place is thank you but uh but you know </connor>
<garnt> it's I've I've it's all right yeah it's </garnt>
<joey> rare that I cry over a sitcom okay but </joey>
<garnt> the sick the good place is the only </garnt>
<garnt> comedy that's ever made me cry at the </garnt>
<garnt> end of it just because seeing these </garnt>
<connor> characters come to the end of their </connor>
<connor> Journey their adventure and just seeing </connor>
<joey> how each character story ended was just </joey>
<joey> so gratifying and I was just genuinely </joey>
<connor> happy for everyone in the story amazing </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] shot uh just season one just </joey>
<connor> wait till the end of season one uh yeah </connor>
<connor> what do you want to talk about now let's </connor>
<garnt> do Black Mirror Black Mirror okay why </garnt>
<garnt> Black Mirror why Black Mirror because </garnt>
<connor> okay okay before before we start talking </connor>
<connor> about that yeah do you think if let's </connor>
<connor> say uh for example like Australia Game </connor>
<connor> of Thrones has three Banger seasons and </connor>
<connor> like three dog [ __ ] Seasons that it kind </connor>
<connor> of levels it out because like Black </connor>
<garnt> Mirror is that well I actually prefer </garnt>
<garnt> the later Seasons [ __ ] I'm kidding I'm </garnt>
<garnt> kidding okay </garnt>
<joey> I was about to go bald from the race she </joey>
<garnt> is great because I have bad enough taste </garnt>
<garnt> that that would be actually believable </garnt>
<garnt> no I wouldn't believe it </garnt>
<connor> no like okay let's the British ones </connor>
<connor> again </connor>
<connor> when it was in our control it was </connor>
<connor> amazing three was actually pretty good </connor>
<joey> as well I will say three three I think I </joey>
<connor> only watched up until three </connor>
<connor> well I mean season one and two I mean </connor>
<connor> season two is just oh Season Two Season </connor>
<garnt> three fantastic White Christmas yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> mean I think uh season one and two and </garnt>
<garnt> half the season three is like that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's all the Black Mirror that exists </garnt>
<joey> in my mind but to me Black Mirror is </joey>
<joey> everything that I look for in a TV show </joey>
<joey> and I think part of that part of that is </joey>
<joey> because I just like how much I respect </joey>
<joey> the original creator of Black Mirror </joey>
<joey> yeah Charlie Brooker yeah one of my </joey>
<joey> biggest influences of all time seeing </joey>
<joey> him seeing him go from like a TV show </joey>
<garnt> where he basically does what I do and </garnt>
<garnt> review movies and events and stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> that go and see him do Black Mirror was </garnt>
<garnt> just such a I actually didn't know it </garnt>
<garnt> was fine huh I actually didn't know it </garnt>
<joey> was by Charlie you didn't you didn't </joey>
<garnt> yeah no you don't know he's just </garnt>
<connor> incredibly [ __ ] talented </connor>
<connor> um and just seeing the [ __ ] wild ass </connor>
<connor> ideas that Black Mirror had in season </connor>
<connor> one and two and three I mean it kind of </connor>
<connor> just it it so like accurate that it kind </connor>
<connor> of mirrors a lot of things that have </connor>
<garnt> happened post the uh oh yeah Post Post </garnt>
<connor> Release right there's a reason why like </connor>
<joey> Black Mirror is almost like in our </joey>
<joey> vocabulary with explaining like Tech </joey>
<joey> that scares us yeah oh yeah everything </joey>
<joey> is described and it's [ __ ] annoying </joey>
<connor> but anything that is scary and tech oh </connor>
<joey> that's very Black Mirror it's one of the </joey>
<joey> most like perfect commentaries I think </joey>
<garnt> yeah of this generation basically it's </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's the it's such a perfect meta </connor>
<connor> commentary on just the world in general </connor>
<connor> it is now yeah I use meta right this </connor>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> but uh yeah I don't I don't really know </garnt>
<garnt> what else I can say about it I feel like </garnt>
<connor> anything to meant like if attack the </connor>
<connor> scares you that should be it watch it </connor>
<connor> don't don't look anything up do not </connor>
<connor> watch anything go into it you'll have a </connor>
<garnt> great time yeah because if I didn't put </garnt>
<connor> Black Mirror on it's like I I I think </connor>
<connor> Charlie Brooker took such inspiration </connor>
<connor> from Twilight Zone right because that's </connor>
<connor> the only other like goat Anthology </connor>
<connor> series that I can think of </connor>
<connor> goatsology did I use ghosts right there </connor>
<connor> don't follow me that makes sense yeah </connor>
<connor> because like I it's I actually really </connor>
<garnt> really [ __ ] love Anthology series oh </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah when it's done right like I </connor>
<connor> love that robots </connor>
<garnt> can we put love can we talk about love </garnt>
<garnt> death and robots for a bit because you </garnt>
<connor> need to watch Love death and robots I </connor>
<connor> think we actually spoke about it on a </connor>
<garnt> podcast not too long ago yeah we </garnt>
<connor> definitely recommended it because it's </connor>
<connor> so uh because we all watched season </connor>
<joey> three oh yeah I'll watch season yeah I </joey>
<connor> feel like Joe watch season three oh okay </connor>
<joey> yeah we've talked about too much TV no I </joey>
<connor> mean love death and robots season three </connor>
<joey> Banger season one Banger season two you </joey>
<connor> know yeah has has its Sparks yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> season three is really fun season three </connor>
<connor> is great yeah I just love seeing the the </connor>
<garnt> thing the thing I love about Anthology </garnt>
<garnt> series is just seeing so many different </garnt>
<garnt> ideas experiments put into one it's so </garnt>
<garnt> experimental you know this is literally </garnt>
<garnt> the opposite of a show like you know </garnt>
<garnt> Breaking Bad you know where it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like this is just so many different </garnt>
<garnt> ideas that are packed into different </garnt>
<garnt> shows and it doesn't need to be a 10 out </garnt>
<garnt> of 10 Banger every time sometimes you </garnt>
<garnt> have like a little bit of lull but what </garnt>
<garnt> I what I appreciate always an anthology </garnt>
<garnt> series is that someone has something to </garnt>
<garnt> say and they have yeah it's always fresh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and they have one chance to say it </garnt>
<garnt> and so it's it's always like it's always </garnt>
<connor> is interesting especially when they have </connor>
<connor> like when they're like different </connor>
<joey> directives or different cinematographers </joey>
<connor> for episodes yeah completely unique feel </connor>
<garnt> to each one oh yeah yeah exactly I mean </garnt>
<connor> like Black Mirror Has some really iconic </connor>
<garnt> episodes that I think are like must </garnt>
<connor> watches yeah like white Christmas being </connor>
<garnt> one like Christmas amazing yeah uh the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] uh my favorite episode of Black </connor>
<joey> Mirror is probably like the American </joey>
<garnt> Idol parody one the oh that was in </garnt>
<garnt> season two I believe yeah [ __ ] I forgot </garnt>
<connor> the name of that episode I forgot the </connor>
<joey> name of the episode </joey>
<joey> I like that one as well with like the </joey>
<joey> wife who like gets the uh AI yeah oh no </joey>
<connor> she gets the dead husband and her </connor>
<joey> husband dies she got a husband like doll </joey>
<connor> yeah that's like gets her like memories </connor>
<joey> and he like slowly learns like the post </joey>
<garnt> memories yeah that one's creepy </garnt>
<connor> I can see Japan doing that yeah is that </connor>
<joey> scary is that scary that I see Japan no </joey>
<garnt> absolutely absolutely that's so Black </garnt>
<connor> Mirror </connor>
<connor> the sex toys be like yeah so so uh you </connor>
<connor> have three left which one do you want to </connor>
<garnt> talk about all right let's go with </garnt>
<garnt> Always Sunny first I mean literally the </garnt>
<connor> ghost actually I feel like Sunny is like </connor>
<connor> the most American Comedy sitcom yeah and </connor>
<garnt> Peep Show is the most British yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> definitely oh you wouldn't say Big Bang </garnt>
<joey> Theory </joey>
<garnt> you wouldn't say How I Met Your Mother </garnt>
<joey> oh Malcolm in the Middle </joey>
<garnt> I I realized like watching things like </garnt>
<garnt> always sunny and uh Peep Show and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that maybe I just like </garnt>
<garnt> to see awful people do awful 100 it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like awful people just funny right </garnt>
<garnt> exactly I mean that's essentially what </garnt>
<connor> like people sure is not to boil it down </connor>
<connor> and really like dilute it but like yeah </connor>
<connor> it's the same awful people but just </connor>
<garnt> British version yeah yeah exactly and </garnt>
<joey> it's just like a lot of a lot of let's </joey>
<connor> say Peep Show storylines I could easily </connor>
<joey> see happening in order yeah but just </joey>
<connor> like the the dynamic would be completely </connor>
<connor> oh yeah you know what I mean right where </connor>
<joey> it's always sunny again is just uh the </joey>
<connor> five most awful people in this world </connor>
<garnt> just doing awful things and having awful </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] ideas and trying to like win in </garnt>
<joey> this world it's one of the funniest </joey>
<connor> sitcoms and long running for a reason </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah the only reason I think it's </joey>
<connor> kind of hard to get into is the first </connor>
<garnt> season first four seasons yeah we're in </garnt>
<connor> like a four by three aspect ratio and </connor>
<garnt> look a bit weird yeah oh really I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know why also I think the first season </garnt>
<garnt> is good but the second season is when </garnt>
<connor> they introduce Danny </connor>
<connor> and that's when it goes from a good show </connor>
<joey> to a [ __ ] great show because I think </joey>
<connor> Danny DeVito adds so much to their </connor>
<joey> chemistry yeah and what I love about </joey>
<joey> Always Sunny is if you look at like any </joey>
<joey> of the outtakes and everything like that </joey>
<joey> is that you can tell that so much of </joey>
<connor> this is just [ __ ] improv yeah right </connor>
<connor> there are so many lines It's Always </connor>
<connor> Sunny that you're like where the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> did this come from and you know that </connor>
<garnt> they just [ __ ] made it up on this </garnt>
<connor> it's so good though it's so weird I </connor>
<joey> don't think I've actually sat down and </joey>
<joey> watched like a full episode oh my God </joey>
<connor> I've seen so many Clips because it's so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] iconic there's like there's so </connor>
<connor> many like I could have thought about </connor>
<connor> putting this but it felt so wrong in no </connor>
<joey> sense because I'm like I think this is </joey>
<joey> my favorite but there's so many American </joey>
<connor> sitcoms that are like occupy the same </connor>
<garnt> space in my mind like Arrested </garnt>
<connor> Development not the new season it was </connor>
<garnt> just really [ __ ] funny uh what are </garnt>
<joey> some other really good American sitcoms </joey>
<garnt> that are very adult humor they're really </garnt>
<garnt> well written communities really good as </garnt>
<garnt> well Curb Your enthusiastic because yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's really good as well yeah I think </garnt>
<connor> Sunny is always always sunny is like the </connor>
<connor> best it's the best out of all of them </connor>
<garnt> for me </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<connor> um yeah I don't know it's just don't be </connor>
<garnt> sad when it ends up I'm I'm surprised </garnt>
<garnt> that it's gone on for this long honestly </garnt>
<garnt> well they renewed it for like what two </garnt>
<garnt> more seasons I think at least two more </garnt>
<joey> yeah do you think they just did 11 or 10 </joey>
<garnt> yeah so I can't remember so many [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> good meme ball moments as well you dumb </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] I love that one yeah it's just </garnt>
<connor> like sometimes you have you have a </connor>
<garnt> moment where you're watching these </garnt>
<garnt> people do these awful things and you're </garnt>
<garnt> just like [ __ ] do I kind of relate to </garnt>
<connor> what one of the characters is saying </connor>
<connor> because it's like that's the problem is </connor>
<connor> it's been a few characters you're they </connor>
<garnt> are not remotely like but it's like </garnt>
<connor> audience alike I actually like this guy </connor>
<garnt> no no you're not supposed to you're not </garnt>
<garnt> supposed to like them you're like [ __ ] I </garnt>
<garnt> can actually like kind of kind of I just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like them I mean it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's so it's so awful that it's </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] amazing I don't know </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] you have to watch it uh I will </connor>
<connor> just just watch always watch any </connor>
<connor> episodes out of context and I think </connor>
<joey> you'll be all right but I think that's </joey>
<joey> the thing is like I've only seen Clips </joey>
<garnt> out of context and it's still funny yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly because I think all I think </garnt>
<joey> all they do is just like what would </joey>
<joey> happen if we just put these four or five </joey>
<connor> characters into a situation and then </connor>
<joey> they just like let the characters act </joey>
<connor> out the situation kind of feels like an </connor>
<joey> improv class in some ways right but </joey>
<joey> because they've worked together so long </joey>
<garnt> they kind of like know each other's </garnt>
<joey> beats and everything like oh yeah like I </joey>
<garnt> do not know how they film some of this </garnt>
<garnt> without [ __ ] laughing </garnt>
<joey> all right okay two left let's do </joey>
<connor> Chernobyl I mean I love this series I </connor>
<connor> thought about putting it on yeah I was </connor>
<connor> like I don't know is it because it's too </connor>
<connor> good it's too good you know how like you </connor>
<connor> said Breaking Bad is too polished like </connor>
<connor> this is the most polished and clean TV </connor>
<connor> show that is just unarguably amazing </connor>
<joey> when I first saw this and and I haven't </joey>
<joey> seen this but when I first saw pictures </joey>
<joey> of this I thought it was like a </joey>
<joey> documentary series no yeah uh I mean </joey>
<joey> yeah I mean I mean it's not a </joey>
<joey> documentary series but obviously based </joey>
<joey> on real events yeah you actually believe </joey>
<connor> that it's based on real events yeah it </connor>
<connor> is it is it's one of those stories yeah </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] what happened </garnt>
<garnt> yeah bro when when they were writing </garnt>
<garnt> Chernobyl in real life bro they they </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] knew what they did they would </garnt>
<garnt> make some great television man yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but what I love about shinobu obviously </garnt>
<joey> it's based on real life but it's one of </joey>
<joey> those stories that happened in real life </joey>
<joey> that is so [ __ ] insane that it's you </joey>
<joey> kind of watch this and you're like wow </joey>
<joey> this is an insane story oh wait this </joey>
<joey> actually [ __ ] reality is strange </joey>
<joey> non-fiction yeah you can't actually </joey>
<joey> believe that some of the [ __ ] that </joey>
<joey> happened in Chernobyl actually happened </joey>
<joey> here and yeah it's just like I said it's </joey>
<garnt> just such a perfectly crafted TV show I </garnt>
<garnt> think the reason I've really liked </garnt>
<garnt> Chernobyl uh is because it's only like </garnt>
<garnt> it's a mini series it's so so short yeah </garnt>
<joey> like how many episodes is it five </joey>
<garnt> seconds </garnt>
<joey> oh wow yeah it is it is not much you can </joey>
<joey> watch it in a day or two </joey>
<connor> um two evenings it is just amazing you </connor>
<joey> will not regret okay I think yeah I </joey>
<connor> don't know I haven't met a single person </connor>
<garnt> who watched this TV show that didn't </garnt>
<garnt> sing its Praises because like the thing </garnt>
<garnt> the thing I loved about it is that one </garnt>
<garnt> one thing that I normally don't like </garnt>
<garnt> about let's say biopics or you know </garnt>
<connor> shows about real life events is that </connor>
<connor> there's nothing thing there's nothing to </connor>
<connor> keep me coming back because I already </connor>
<connor> know the ending because it happened </connor>
<connor> right yeah because it happened but it's </connor>
<garnt> the journey yeah yeah no no no like it's </garnt>
<joey> it is about the journey you're right but </joey>
<garnt> sometimes my brain like my brain is like </garnt>
<joey> I need something to keep me coming back </joey>
<connor> every week yes but I think with biopics </connor>
<garnt> what's so like interesting and unique </garnt>
<garnt> about them is that you can give a lot </garnt>
<garnt> more context in a human sense to the </garnt>
<connor> events and the characters involved in a </connor>
<joey> sense yeah yeah exactly I also think </joey>
<connor> that's the reason why a lot of biopics </connor>
<connor> are just movies yeah right because it's </connor>
<joey> just like one clean package because you </joey>
<garnt> know what's going to happen most of the </garnt>
<joey> time right but what what I what like </joey>
<joey> drew me into Chernobyl immediately and </joey>
<joey> kept me going to the end that made me </joey>
<joey> appreciate the journey because the </joey>
<joey> journey was amazing but the the one </joey>
<connor> thing I think it did perfectly was it </connor>
<connor> set up this mystery right so this power </connor>
<connor> plant spoilers this power plant </connor>
<garnt> basically explodes in Ukraine [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> alcohol </connor>
<joey> it's only the most devastating nuclear </joey>
<garnt> disaster exactly history and within like </garnt>
<garnt> the first episode they set up this </garnt>
<garnt> concept of this is impossible it is </garnt>
<joey> impossible for a nuclear explosion to </joey>
<joey> happen on this scale it is so impossible </joey>
<joey> that when it actually exploded people </joey>
<joey> didn't even believe that you know it was </joey>
<joey> it happened it was because of the </joey>
<joey> nuclear reaction right no that's that's </joey>
<joey> that's that's that was part of like the </joey>
<joey> incompetence of the uh higher-ups back </joey>
<joey> then where where they were sending </joey>
<joey> people to check on the nuclear reactor </joey>
<joey> to check on what caused this explosion </joey>
<garnt> and people were like oh there's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> bits of nuclear debris everywhere and </garnt>
<garnt> they were like I don't believe you go </garnt>
<garnt> check yourself and and so of course </garnt>
<garnt> everyone who checked would would die </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because they would be exposed to a </garnt>
<garnt> lethal a lethal dose of radiation yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and so he sets off this mystery and </garnt>
<garnt> that mystery like continues throughout </garnt>
<garnt> the entire series and that's what kept </garnt>
<garnt> me coming back was just not only just to </garnt>
<garnt> see what happened but there was this </garnt>
<garnt> mystery that I wanted to see how they </garnt>
<garnt> resolved this because I genuinely didn't </garnt>
<garnt> know and I genuinely wanted to know </garnt>
<joey> that's just something impossible I feel </joey>
<joey> Chernobyl the Chernobyl event is one of </joey>
<garnt> those things where everyone knows the </garnt>
<garnt> name of it and everyone knows what </garnt>
<joey> happened but very few people actually </joey>
<joey> know how it happened how or why yeah </joey>
<joey> it's also really eerie the series like </joey>
<joey> it it's always really like slow like </joey>
<joey> kind of violin eerie music that Creeps </joey>
<garnt> in yeah at no point is it even remotely </garnt>
<connor> happy it's like depressing all the way </connor>
<connor> through yeah and like the cinematography </connor>
<garnt> as well in this isn't sucking fast it is </garnt>
<garnt> stunning yeah like watching this is just </garnt>
<garnt> a treat all of the actors are amazing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um I think the only thing that it </garnt>
<garnt> could do better is that it could be like </garnt>
<connor> maybe it's like a bunch of British </connor>
<connor> actors so it could be like Russian to </connor>
<garnt> make a little more believable I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> really need it I felt like it was just </garnt>
<garnt> great like yeah you know it was good it </garnt>
<garnt> was just like and I think I think </garnt>
<garnt> Chernobyl has made like by itself made </garnt>
<connor> me just afraid of just the sound of a </connor>
<garnt> geiger counter there's yeah like the way </garnt>
<connor> they use the Geiger counters sounds you </connor>
<joey> know it's it's literally like scarier </joey>
<joey> than a horror movie yeah right that is a </joey>
<joey> horror movie yeah exactly where there's </joey>
<joey> I think there's a scene where </joey>
<connor> um these guys are like in like the sewer </connor>
<connor> or something trying to figure out where </connor>
<connor> how to get in this nuclear power plant </connor>
<connor> and the bottom out yeah from the bottom </connor>
<connor> up right and you see you just hear the </connor>
<connor> geiger counter and all you hear is the </connor>
<connor> geiger counter and then since they're </connor>
<connor> wearing like full suits you don't hear </connor>
<joey> them say anything you just hear the </joey>
<joey> breathing and the guide counter and with </joey>
<joey> those two elements alone they're able to </joey>
<joey> create such a [ __ ] tense a terrifying </joey>
<connor> atmosphere and it's just it's just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's insane amazing television you will </connor>
<garnt> not regret it uh and I just finally </garnt>
<garnt> finally Justice League I get to talk </garnt>
<connor> about Justice League did not expect this </connor>
<joey> one I was kind of expecting considering </joey>
<joey> you are like a big MCU guy yeah yeah yes </joey>
<connor> so I mean it's not MCU though </connor>
<joey> yeah I mean this series is a banger I </joey>
<joey> will admit this straight up as a bank </joey>
<joey> yeah you know so I don't think I ever </joey>
<joey> watched this dude this [ __ ] whenever it </joey>
<connor> got came on TV felt like a [ __ ] treat </connor>
<connor> it was never on it was it was [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> amazing and I I agree it was never on TV </connor>
<connor> but every time every time it did come on </connor>
<connor> in the UK I watched the [ __ ] out of this </connor>
<garnt> right and like I like I got a confession </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like not a massive fan of like the </garnt>
<garnt> DC Superheroes you know you're a Marvel </garnt>
<garnt> guzzling I'm not even like a I wasn't a </garnt>
<garnt> fan of like the mark actually </garnt>
<joey> you know I grew up with like the </joey>
<connor> Spider-Man cartoon </connor>
<connor> you literally eluded the tell us last </connor>
<joey> couple seasons of Game of Thrones to the </joey>
<garnt> MCU earlier because like I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> why I just always thought like the DC </garnt>
<garnt> um characters were just kind of boring </garnt>
<garnt> you know Superman was kind of just two </garnt>
<garnt> Spanish boys </garnt>
<connor> Superman's boring Wonder Woman's boring </connor>
<joey> Superman is just a dude Green Lantern is </joey>
<joey> like who Okay Batman's obviously go dude </joey>
<garnt> flashes like like in most iterations of </garnt>
<connor> Batman I was just like this is this is </connor>
<connor> kind of just boring he's just like he's </connor>
<connor> just edgy he's dark he's good in this </connor>
<connor> that's uh the reason I [ __ ] love this </connor>
<connor> Justice League is every character who I </connor>
<connor> normally hate in their own individual </connor>
<connor> media every character in this is a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] Banger like they they they made </connor>
<connor> Batman like Batman by himself I never </connor>
<connor> found interesting Batman in a squad of </connor>
<connor> superheroes where everyone's got [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> super powers and yeah Batman's the most </garnt>
<garnt> badass out of all of this group [ __ ] yes </garnt>
<garnt> okay I bet I became a Batman Sim because </garnt>
<garnt> of the Justice League right uh because </garnt>
<garnt> of the Justice League cartoon and also </garnt>
<garnt> like I think like Superman is a like a </garnt>
<garnt> way more interesting character in here </garnt>
<garnt> in most of what most of like the films </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen betrayed because he's just </garnt>
<garnt> like what I love about him here is that </garnt>

<joey> they gave all back then because </joey>
<garnt> obviously like the [ __ ] 19 [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> 50s whenever they made these comments </joey>
<garnt> all the [ __ ] powers to the girls yeah </garnt>
<joey> one of them no that's more that's my </joey>
<joey> smaller but actually one of my favorite </joey>
<joey> arcs involved like Hall girl which is </joey>
<connor> what basically I I really is it Hawkeye </connor>
<connor> or am I just like making [ __ ] out I </connor>
<connor> really hope it's a girl and she's a hawk </connor>
<connor> but it's when her species actually like </connor>
<connor> invades earth right that's one of my </connor>
<connor> favorite movie arcs uh sorry Justice </connor>
<connor> League's like where her entire species </connor>
<garnt> invades Earth and basically just takes </garnt>
<garnt> over and creates this dystopian Society </garnt>
<garnt> uh that's the Justice League have to </garnt>
<connor> overthrow I'm glad to accept Alberto of </connor>
<garnt> Lords </garnt>

<joey> I don't know Batman sounds way cooler </joey>
<connor> than Hawk girl I don't know what it does </connor>
<joey> maybe because I got a picture of Batman </joey>
