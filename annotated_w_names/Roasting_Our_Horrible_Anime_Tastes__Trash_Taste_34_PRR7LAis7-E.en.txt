<SPEAKER_05> another episode of the trash taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> podcast i'm your host joey and i'm with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crackheads i like how you like started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with alliteration at the start of this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> podcast and now it's just like that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> gave up with the alliteration </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well that'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> notorious for having a welcome sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they understand satire i never do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> monetize for no reason at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never happened in the history of youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> no of course not any youtuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not like it happened on the last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> chris episode or anything you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's fine to be fair i think that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just the uh copious amounts of alcohol </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we consumed on that episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think that was the demonetization that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> forced us into just being a mess which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm fine with but you know just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just a mess but welcome to this episode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> welcome to this episode of trash taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so hopefully this one's not going to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> demonetized because we're going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talking about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anime whoa wait we're going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you remember when uh he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> talking about anime do you remember when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this podcast was an anime podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not gonna bring that back i'm glad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i stopped this from becoming an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> anime podcast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> my influence and then and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me and god were like no we must bring </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> her back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm feeling nostalgic now cause i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get to talk about anime again on this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> podcast my [ __ ] god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean we barely talk about anime on our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> own </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i like it that way i like being an anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what i like yeah we're all anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> fans yeah but uh today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh we're gonna we're gonna talk about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna talk about some anime more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> specifically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are going to be doing what we do best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is roasting our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> trash tastes see anime okay as like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> anime youtubers and connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know don't do me like that all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the most annoying questions we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get asked i'm sure is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is your favorite anime like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get asked this at every panel at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> every fan meetup you've ever gone to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i swear to god i don't know about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you but i have a different answer every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i've loaded a default answer so i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't have to think and that will like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> satisfy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but as anime youtubers we know we are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally the ones judging other people's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tastes but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now we are putting our own taste on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we are judging each other's tastes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and letting you all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> judge our tastes along with us because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> normally we don't promote our my anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> list or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we will get into what we're doing but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically we are going to be showing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> each other's my anime list </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then afterwards we are going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sh if you guys remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was this trend in the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> community before called three by threes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you basically pick nine anime in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three by three grid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you show to your fellow brethren </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically encapsulates kind of your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> taste of anime it's basically just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a pinterest collage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] tumbler girls in this case yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> by like guys or pinterest or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like that i think it was started by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 4chan actually wasn't it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah of all things 4chan creates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they made this yeah so uh in in </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if to me like calling mikey or academia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mid </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> okay okay the the first thing that pops </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> out something on </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> it was how it was seven minutes it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good but it wasn't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the second coming of jesus that people </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> i mean despite the fact how much we've </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> everything else was perfect you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what i mean but like that's like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> no no you don't you don't need to yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not missing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and if you do just read or watch up to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> soul society which is the first star </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> which is what i've heard you can't just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> stop if you're like really you kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but you can't just though you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to see no you see it go down no you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't you can i mean i mean it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it depends like because bleach didn't go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out with a bang it's just i know yeah it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just like kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> fizzled out well i've watched all like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reviews of bleach for some reason i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watched like every eyepatch world video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on it and i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> cool this sounds sounds good look don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get me wrong it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back in the day when it was serializing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a super solid shown in manga </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and like you know as much as i like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to think that i'm like oh you know i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the underground like weird you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> non-mainstream [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i love my shonen and bleach was one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> them like i saw society </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly to this day i think bleach is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just the coolest anime to come out like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely i like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of the big three which is like one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> piece naruto and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bleach bleach was just like that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cool kid you know what i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it always seemed like the edgiest one it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was it was definitely the edgiest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah i mean have you seen what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kubota tito looks like he looks like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mean i used to always see the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> amvs it's like lincoln park with yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean that that was pretty much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> blue yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was bleach yeah but it was like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went better with like bleach because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they had like half skulls and [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what was going on was [ __ ] sick dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the powers were sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just it was just the sword powers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> were sick then like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i want to see some more bad guys guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say what you want about kubo but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he he has a good fashion sense oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the way he dressed the characters they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were they just always looked cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah really the drip was clean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the perfect way to decide two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> characters the drip was clean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like say what you want about bleach they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> had those characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i would go as far as to say that bleach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might be maybe not the first but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely one of the biggest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shows that kind of gave like i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i don't know maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> streetwear and animes like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> collaborations i would argue maybe came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from bleach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because a lot of the characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in like the title um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> panels that he wrote during the manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> like he gave them such cool [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> looking street yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> honestly you can see people wearing like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> people want to see this like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> drip goku exists yeah exactly bleach is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reason why drip goku exists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this a meme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i don't know who made it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll show you but like it's it's this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] meme of like goku like in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] like b-boy stance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wearing this [ __ ] drip it's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> big meme right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know why this is a meme i i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> try to explain to some people and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like but why is it a meme i'm like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know i don't know but it's a meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but the group is clean what what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> going back to dragon ball fans what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dragon ball memes man </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> and then vegeta wearing like the supreme </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like sweater as well just being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's clean goku got drip apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and there would be no drip goku without </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> drip bleaching if it wasn't for bleach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there'd be no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel like every kind of dragon ball </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> meme under the sun has just been like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> every cancerous meme in like literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cancerous memes yeah in terms of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dragon ball </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> um community like you're lost for words </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> i'm surprised you've never seen it it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> all over twitter so you rated the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bleach the same as my hero season one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> would you still stand by that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i would because like look again as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much as i don't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my hero is like the second coming of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> christ season one was solid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as [ __ ] like i enjoyed it i i would i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> would say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for me my hero it goes season two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than season one than season three right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right we haven't had season four yet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't even know wait no no no no no we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> haven't i don't think so i wouldn't no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we have no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't [ __ ] this too no no we haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no we haven't yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming out merlin have we had a am i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> here academia season four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's called it's coming okay season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> four's coming so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so the next one's announced but i i saw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on twitter everyone's like the next arc </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is boring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i was like great so just another </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> year of just mediocre [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah even the biggest even the biggest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shonen right now is just like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no i mean like the thing is with my hero </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that i started off really really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> liking it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and to me to me like out of all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> modern shonen it had the potential to be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the greatest right like like he had the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> potential to reach like a higher ceiling </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> than say </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something like say black clover or demon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> slayer or something like that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but it seems like the setup is there and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the potential is there but there just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> hasn't been that moment for me to really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make me love this and the it seems like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the more i watch just the less and less </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> invest i guess in there well that's how </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_08> defending barca and having </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> him as their favorite character is like </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_02> but he's like turned around now he's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a lot easier to get behind a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fictional character's turnaround story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah exactly right like there's people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> defending vegeta and he's talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he [ __ ] tried to blow up the planet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> two weeks ago man jesus [ __ ] christ </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> yeah i thought dragon ball was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> no that's good oh i know you gotta </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> this puts into perspective how long ago </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was that i probably put that in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like how many [ __ ] rhyme on movies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you gave [ __ ] a doraemon movie a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> masterpiece you give that a 10 and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna give the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> wait which one which star on one movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they're so good there are many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 16 you gave a 10. what is special about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 16. okay that was like the schindler's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> list of darim </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was the third doramon movie uh i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think it's 16. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no that the remake is 16. what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah the the original is the third one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> which i couldn't find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which it doesn't exist on my anime list </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason all right okay but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gave that a 10 purely because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watched that movie that that was one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first rhyme on movies i ever watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean if you guys don't know me right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now right yeah i'm a bad guy now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's it's good like honestly like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sweat like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even now i could probably rewatch that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> movie and still find it enjoyable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i don't know durian diamond holds a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> special place in my heart as you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tell from the amount of [ __ ] door i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> on movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah i'm just like i didn't even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know there were this many dare i want me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do they're still making dorado i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm surprised someone else has been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching doraemon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like further along than when they were a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> kid watching on tv because that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exposure i've ever had to derive yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right i probably would never go out my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> way yeah too much a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> one i completely understand if you did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> not grow up with doraemon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i do not blame you for not watching a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> single diamond movie or episode because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that shit's hard to get into as an adult </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but if you're if you grew up with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it like i did then you could easily go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> back and i know man to me it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah as a growing up growing up i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just like watch the [ __ ] teletubbies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> movie yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like talk to like a niece or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you're like oh show me what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch and you watch it you're like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] is happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this is [ __ ] it's just wild what is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's probably what my parents thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i what the [ __ ] is this blue thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i i noticed you gave full metal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> alchemist and full metal alchemist </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> brotherhood both </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are seven yeah why because it's like my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hero </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it was no it wasn't just being a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> brotherhood is not it's like at least an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> eight or a nine it wasn't except </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i can't look acceptable yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was except hold on hold on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> hold on let me let me let me act uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> let me act angry okay wait you gave full </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> metal alchemist a seven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how dare you joey how dare you i am so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] offended right now it is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> audacity of this [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the audacity to the new viewers gone has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> never won </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that scene with nina and the dog </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mike did did you not get the feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not trying to say like you need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> give it like a 10. i'm just saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i think it's like minimum okay okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's the thing with that one i still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stand by that to this day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like a lot of people it was not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> the first anime i watched </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> i watched that right way after a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah me too right right yeah but it was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> probably one of the first ones you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> watched right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for the first 20. yeah exactly what does </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that count this might have been in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first 200 for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but i don't know i feel like out of all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the anime i've watched definitely the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> best story here's the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my my experience with fullmetal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> alchemist is basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gone's next step which is because i hear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about it so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i watched it out of obligation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> god hasn't got to the stage i haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> got to that stage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> every time someone asks me a day gets </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> added on exactly i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like and i was like and i was like that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as well and i'm just like you know what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> i got time i'll [ __ ] watch it just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because i hear them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the same like sitting or like how did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know i watched so i watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so people were like okay you don't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch the first four minutes just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watch brotherhood right you hear that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all the [ __ ] time but i'm like no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> i want to see </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> why people are saying that right so i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> watched the original </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i was like okay this was adequate so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> brotherhood must be a lot better like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot lot better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i heard yeah i think that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> was like yeah it's better but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> like essentially this serves a point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> higher better that's essentially no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not okay the first full metal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alchemist is like a low seven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and brotherhood is like a high seven </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> call it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that's all it is to me also i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> critiquing your scores here knowing that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know some of these anime i've also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scored myself but i have no idea what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this is my list was down in 2014 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> seven years ago yeah yeah i see you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> given naruto a six compared to bleach so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> would you say that you preferred bleach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over narrative absolutely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i prefer narrative really i have never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> dropped a show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more times than i have narrator like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> naruto has been one of those shows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where it's like i've i've watched it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i've read it and watched it like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> close to the end yeah but along that way </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there were so many points throughout </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> naruto where i'm just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> uh maybe it's not worth it you didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get that with bleach at all no i did get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that bit of bleach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once during the eisenhower that's it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean bleach for me was just like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> constant downhill naruto just kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> went up and down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i i like i think back to i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back sometimes when i think is now was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> naruto a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show would it would it hold up to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day and i still think some of the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parts of naruto </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are still like a [ __ ] amazing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> no again and that's and that's why i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably gave it a six right because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i completely understand why it is one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> beloved anime out there today right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like i saw parts of that but again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was i didn't grow up with naruto </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a lot of people did like this was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again another show that this is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> another show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this is just another show right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again i'm not saying that naruto is bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i just like to point that out it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's not a 10 out of 10 for me okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm trying to see what else i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm getting interrogated you know this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is an interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> interrogation this is like weeb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interrogation this is like true crime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> weeb edition you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so yes notice his hand movement his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hands are off the table saying that he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is quite nervous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like we're not we're not like okay so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is the lowest one that you've rated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on here i'm trying to see probably a one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm trying to see oh it's i think it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> pupa oh yeah pupa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i get people one i think i get bulk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and a pico one yeah one of the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biggest thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that surprised me going through your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> list is okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be honest have you completed every anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you've scored on here yes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no way no [ __ ] there's so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> except for maybe son </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you completed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> [Music] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly think i have finished </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> everything because like i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of because when we're gonna get to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my list one of the reasons why my list </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seems </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a lot emptier is because if i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> complete a show i just don't bother </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> putting in my list </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right and well that's why i have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the on hold section as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> oh you got the [ __ ] when did you stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> updating this man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you really were the anime man before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you watched so much anime yeah you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> also rated tokyo ghoul </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> season one the same as season two right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> come on they are they are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to be fair i would rate what did i give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> season one and do what do you think you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gave season one or two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think i gave season one and two like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> seven maybe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you did okay yeah okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i would give season two maybe like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> four yeah i was gonna say it's like not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> even remotely the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i give it like a photo i don't know what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> i was on about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'll give it like a [ __ ] try </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> gunner seven you stand by that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah really really okay there were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of parts about trigon i really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoyed but i think the problem with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trigon is that i was a little too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over hyped when i came into it right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i heard so many people being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trigon is like same levels as like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> barcano cowboy b-boy it's like it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up there with the big like classic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> leagues yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right i'll get into it and i watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and again it was good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but not to give spoilers but the last </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quarter of trigon i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] is going on yeah really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah really yeah i thought the last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> quarter of tricom was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> great it was great i enjoyed it but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was like well i was like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> going on i enjoyed it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean it's been a long time i say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this i haven't watched it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in literally a decade yeah i think it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> been a long time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's since i was trying on it uh tempest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gave that a seven that is that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if there was a benchmark for seven out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of ten shows it would be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> the tempest it would be no tempest i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> actually i i </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> it's based on shakespeare's yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was it basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because i think it was very very loosely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> inspired of a shakespeare story i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> remember which one it was but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i gave i gave her points because at the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> time it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> quite creative and new i really liked it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i i put zetsune and the tempest in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same category as i do darker than black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right when i watch when i when i watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it it was kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it when i think back i was like it seems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> average in my memory but for some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but for some reason it sticks with me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i always i always think back i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always think back to the show right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what did you see what did you see what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> no i i did finish my point what yuri on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> were you just trying to get a like piss </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> off twitter that day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no i just genuinely thought it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] boring </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i just thought it was [ __ ] boring i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry oh come on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't want to get into this again man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like at the time i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so much [ __ ] remember for it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did you make an apology video yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> no because people because i said that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know you made an apology video it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because at the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the time like uranus was like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hardest thing right back like i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i don't remember when it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2016 2017 something like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> and uh and all i said in the video was i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> don't think euronice was uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> oh no i said something along the lines </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of uh 99 of people watch euronice for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the yowie elements one percent watch it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for the actual sport element </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and so many euro knife stands called me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> homosexual because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh sorry not homosexual call me uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> they called me uh uh homophobic yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> they call me homophobic because of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh first of all hey i'm not homophobic </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you also gave a free of five joey so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty bad for this wow wow damn are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because because free i gave a higher </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> score than uranus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because again because kyoto animation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> animated that way better than they did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you're on ice i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i don't really think there's any world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like any review that you could warrant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're not just below a five like it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a really good story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like it was it was minimum five i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what would you give it what would you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> give her </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i would give it a six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i think but like you could you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> reasonably put it below a five like at a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean if it's not your thing because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the thing about stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing the thing about yuri and ice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that they introduced way too many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just like kind of didn't focus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on any of them also i'm sorry i couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stand the main [ __ ] character </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i love the guy who just came while he's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> dancing that guy was funny as far oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that one yeah again there were some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> funny parts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a reason why i didn't give it a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one right like there were some parts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> wow wow there's a reason i didn't give </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it a one there's a reason i didn't give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it a one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there were some parts about it but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was it a [ __ ] like slog </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to watch all of it yeah no it was good i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> every episode pass i was like i could be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> watching something else surprised and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> beat you up for saying something like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i thought you really liked it yeah no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she likes it and she's like well that's </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> right uh kisexis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah seven out of ten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so dude do you wanna explain why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not either like a one or a ten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm guessing it's not a one because you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know he got you know he came to a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> realization with his friend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah yeah no if if i put that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in my list </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like after the first time i watched it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my friend i would have given it a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right then i rewatched it because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like i was </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> who are doing a persona 5 collaboration </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which you can get involved with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> right now unlike the super grindy rpg </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> my life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> afk arena like the name would suggest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> allows you to play without even playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a dream come true that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> optimized to the max controller yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for example i could be cooking sleeping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] and i'll still be getting xp </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for my kids i could be doing all three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the same time and still because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i would be worried if you were man that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is just min maxing life </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> list is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly what i'd expected yeah like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you give the shows that are universally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> accepted to be good good ratings </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah is the university to be bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bad ratings yeah i mean i have good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> taste what can i say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the public tastes i don't think i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the publicity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in life i gave you a nice three that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> far from public taste yeah you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just do one that was your one that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> your one whole take i wouldn't notice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you gave charlotte to seven </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and that's a pretty high score for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what i think yeah i would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in june my eight is like worst piece of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> work yeah i would give that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realistically like a fire would you say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> if the director is esteemed or like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> showmakers are esteemed you're more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> likely to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> give a fairer review i think if i'm a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like the the creator or like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> studio or like someone in the production </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> team </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then i'm more willing to give it like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know say like charlotte right like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a matter of june production </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like i love everything managing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> makes but so i gave it a seven but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realistically thinking back on charlotte </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realistically i give it like a four or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> five so this is why i'm the perfect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> critic because uh i just don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't like anybody i go into the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> show and um i don't even know what the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> make a kill was one of those shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i thought was awful and then all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the comments were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the manga's better the manga is better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trust me guys the manga is better so it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was one of those few times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why i call them on their bluff right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called the manga readers on their bluff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i read the manga up to the end right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just the same [ __ ] just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> elongated you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone was complaining about the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only ending of a karmico kill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the manga is like equally as edgy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it just it just elongates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just has a different ending and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> equally as bad in my view you also rated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> alden uh zero yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gave it a six yeah you gave that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season one to six and and season two or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> six but season two come on it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> infinitely worse than season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one i don't know what i was thinking uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> season one i know zero season one is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually like pretty decent i think yeah </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> you maybe finished both of them at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> same time like you maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe i'm pissed off with the [ __ ] maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because because i remember i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> season one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being pretty interesting and then like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was great and then the cliffhanger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season ending happened and it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> holy [ __ ] this is super interesting and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then season two just kind of pissed on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything that season one he said she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> became like kirito and stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like being the goddess i know this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like teenage gods list because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> okay dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> okay okay i i still stand by that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it is it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season two and eight as well season two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is not as good as season one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a comedy like kind of trashy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like romance itchy sounds vital yeah to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> be honest i like it so i thought it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> really good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he was pretty good human ambassador for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> domestic girlfriends he was right up his </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> phone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like one of the first comedy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> anime that actually made me laugh and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i didn't think was generic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and now that i look back i think yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was probably pretty generic i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like i look at the art style and i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like this is premium mid-2000s </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anime it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing interesting to say about this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you gave uh baccano at 10 as well i like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that i like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that yeah i i i think we all get back in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> our attention </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> on my list i don't know what that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why i'm curious to see what your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three by threes are because that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's where that's where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the real personality test comes in hold </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on i gotta ask that maylene </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> we we're gonna we're gonna be smashing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so i noticed as well that you also gave </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> uh batum an eight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah joey gave batum a six yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually would side more with god on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> even though it did end kind of [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't the ending absolute [ __ ] but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the show was really fun and the show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> opening was a bang </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> opening [ __ ] ten out of ten dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ten hour ten opening yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> soon the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was just pure fun i don't know like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> dude it was good it was it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great it was one of the few death games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that didn't feel like it was one a uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> battle royale rip-off right because the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> problem with every death game anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it feels like of like a virgin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> battle royale you know what i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's real did it and like why would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you why would i want to watch anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but soon just it was just like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't try to pretend that i wasn't a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> battle royale rip-off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but it just like really worked it went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> off that and it just was a hell of a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of fun i don't know i think i gave it a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lower score i think when i first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> finished it i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also gave her maybe like a seven or an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eight but then i read the manga and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like oh yeah compared to that wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i guess for some reason like batum has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> always been one of those shows like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuck with me i don't know why like i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always just one of the season two i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i i always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i still think about it and i still think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about why it didn't have a season two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like i i know sydney read the manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and she said the manga is also pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah the manga is way better is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> actually good yeah the manga is way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah okay you gave aramonga 10 so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you did to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but you are my brother because you gave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ganks over 10 which i also agree with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you gave code geoff season one to ten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> code gear season two and eight oh what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are your thoughts on that okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> okay okay i'm interested okay i've okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember giving it a ten okay so the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing about code yes right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is i gave it a 10 the first time i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watched it because i thought it was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a [ __ ] masterpiece it was perfect it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> uh i recently uh not recently like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really watched code yes with sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there was a lot of flaws in season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one that i guess i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of ignored as a kid or just like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of forgot about yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay like i remember re-watching it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why is there an episode dedicated to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chasing a cat and how did i just blank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this from my memory </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember first watching coke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes it was like easy 10 out of 10. this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the greatest anime can become and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think i just remembered the good points </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of codekias because there was a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plot holes and everything like it's how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can we spoil code geass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i think i think it's you know i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean we're gonna spoil cookies okay so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's universally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's okay it's like this gives skip to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this skip to this time stamp below </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because code yes if you haven't watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kgs and you want to watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's one of the most spoilable shows um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out there but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i remember re-watching it and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like man they were they really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they really had to like twist the plot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in order to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nina or what was not nina um euphemia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just [ __ ] massacre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone right right because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember watching it i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> man the plot's kind of over now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> everything's sorted and it was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just the most racism is over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone go home it was just the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> roundabout way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like okay guys we're going to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the plot continue how can we make the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plot continue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was literally it was it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally a scene where lelouch goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ha-ha wouldn't it be funny if i told you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to kill the japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ha ha psych x and and then and then it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't like it did happen right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and like and like i just i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remembered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking well i remember thinking as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kid that was a huge plot twist and now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> watching as an adult i'm just like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is stupid i'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> this this kind of this kind of doesn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> make sense this this is kind of pretty </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> pretty cheap right there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this is pretty cheap writing yeah um so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like i would now i would give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> code geass season one maybe an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> eight i think because the highs of code </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> geos are so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like you you almost forgive it the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> highs are very high so you like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> forgive it for a lot of the [ __ ] it does </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then season two was like that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know what it is about season two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like a car crash that somehow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah season two was a car crash that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> somehow perfectly parallel parked </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like absolute disaster and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> somehow it like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> landed it landed its ending perfectly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and i remember re-watching cody's r2 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after season one and i and aft going on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the problems i had was season one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season two just took all the like small </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> problems with season one and just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> extrapolated to them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so like let's take every stupid every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stupid plot twist in season one and just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> make it ten times bigger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> true and i think the the exact moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that lost me in season two was like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was lelouch it was the i am you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i am spartacine but just with lelouch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i just thought okay this this is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this is not cleverly it's just stupid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything up to that till like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> final three episodes was [ __ ] dumb </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but they just they stick the landing man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like the ending is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> still i think the best ending ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> inanimate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> thing yeah i i i i would think i'd agree </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with that i would think it's probably </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> the best of the top my head the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> ending anime has produced so far </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so god was that an unpopular opinion god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no god knows god knows okay hold on a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> second i'd like to point out uh for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone who says he doesn't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jubilee films he uh you gave mononoke a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah will you stick by that because if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you do then i can high-five you but if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the backhand is coming okay um what did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i give spirited away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh let me see because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i think thinking back what an okay is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> one of my you gave spirited away in nine </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> okay then yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah i i really had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i don't like ghibli films but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> think mononoke and spirit of the way are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the few wear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i i i still good i still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like them i also love how you gave gyo a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> six </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's pretty [ __ ] high if you ask me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought it was good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i just uh have you read the manga i have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> read the monk how did you give it a six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i watched i think i gave it a like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like shinjito </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is a ginger manga that uh and they made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a movie about it like five years ago and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> horrendous i i think it is i think it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was a fun movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i had a fun time watching okay i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so sad watching it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the thing about gyo is that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> watched the anime not knowing any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> background about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it not knowing it was junji youtube i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thought it was just a campy b </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> movie horror movie which is which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which it is but i remember because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went into there thinking it was going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolute trash and i watched it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> despite it actually being you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trashy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was trash it gave me the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of enjoyment as you do watching a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shitty b movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> b movie horror yeah because it wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it was shitty animation because gyo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the movie was animated by ufotable yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and man they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can see some effort being put into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this yeah but you also gotta admit that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the the 3d </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of the 3d elements i was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> god this is ugly but is that a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing because it's a horror like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't even know if in 2012 it wasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you know they weren't very good yeah no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was compared to some of the 3d that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> came out in 2012 compared to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> studio gonzo gans 3d which just makes me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to vomit when i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think about it don't remind me like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was it was good looking 3d </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah sure like you fightable put some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> effort into that and i and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> respect them for doing that uh you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> watched halo legends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think i think you're the only person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> on my anime list who watched i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even know there was an anime for halo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah oh my god </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> r.i.p to the other 19 000 people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> have rated this show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason i think i watched i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think i watched that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was my stint when i watched that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the mass effect anime as well which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what do you think you give halo legends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> did i say did i say what are you doing i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think so i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i can't i i i had a a foregone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay good good wow okay i i stick by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that hold on a second you gave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> re-zero season one a six </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> did i actually oh no what's that about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> oh okay why why this okay okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know why i gave it a six i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think it was because everyone was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hyping it up and i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i want to be different i was kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> underwhelmed by it right um now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i because i have rewatched zero in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> preparation for season two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um i would give it a seven but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember coming out of re-zero just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling empty right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just it just kinda it just no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it kind of like i had a good f i had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good time watching it and it just i it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just like gut reaction of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a good time and i'm probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> going to forget this show in a few years </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> i it was my it was kuroka was a sports </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime that got me back into sports anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> so no i i i watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> all of makaku city actors yeah i noticed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> he gave it a fall which i would also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> agree with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] how did you sit through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> all that it was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know i liked the aesthetic and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know why it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe i was just high that day and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just i was so disappointed with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i love the novels yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's completely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] destroyed it it was it was me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> going through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it it was me after watching bucky </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> monogatari and going through the shaft </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> type right i'm just like this is going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> to get better </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this is my studio shaft i i legitimately </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> thought that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> makaku city actors was like a gay porn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> novel because of the internet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because all you ever see about makaku </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> city actors online is like gay stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it is yeah there's a little there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a large fujioshi fan base for mega city </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and bro the opium kaka city actors is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] banger oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i still listen to that [ __ ] it's great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> all the time uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> what uh what do you think you you gave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> monster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> did i give it a 10. you did okay good i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly i would agree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd stand by that yeah i would yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> love monster yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's one of those animes that like i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> dropped and then came back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah and that i was so glad that i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> picked back up because it's obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's really [ __ ] slow in the start </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it is really slow but i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> monster is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of rarity of an anime where it's an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime that has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an amazing manga that could have easily </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be sliced up and have a shitty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> adaptation but monster is one of the few </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> epic like masterpiece manga they got a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> masterpiece adaptation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i mean like thank god it got 70 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> something episodes that are dead yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah could you imagine if monsters are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> twenty-four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why that's why i'm scared for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 20th century boys ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> gets adapted man because that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> monster but even longer and even more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> also i find it hilarious he gave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ikitorsen a too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is like imagine imagine like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> show that birth shows like high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is a battle fan service show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and back in the day this was the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> degenerate kind of fan service the titty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> action show you could do like so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like weir boomers [ __ ] love ikito </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah and guys just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> nope [ __ ] your memories it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> no i mean i look back now and maybe i'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> rate it higher i don't know it's uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i would rate it like maybe like a four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> purely because it's just so tragic i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mean like back in back in the day this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was all we had you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nowadays there's so much trash anime and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of fan service he shows but back in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the day it was kind of like ikitosun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then nothing else nothing really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> else there's nothing like the guitar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gave zetsuno tempest to seven as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i feel like i need to watch it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> again give your own isis seven as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a try gunner nine that's fair yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> tokyo ghouls season one of six </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and two google season </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it's one of the shows where i don't know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> if the manga readers are right because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone talks about the tokyo ghoul </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mark has anyone have you guys read the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tokyo ghoul manga </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no okay okay so nobody knows if the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if the manga readers were right for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tokyo ghoul but apparently it's one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most popular manga out there and one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the highest i find it interesting how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gave dunmuch your five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah by that yeah it's it was it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sword art online but beat us all out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> online so i thought art online was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why was that show so popular when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> came out i thought it was acceptable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i gave it maybe like a six so i was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> doing some passionate rant there right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> now you thought it was good and you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like i thought it was good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought it was acceptable and there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a business prison school and eight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i stand by that prison school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is one of the most i mean like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disregarding the ending of the manga it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is one of the most hilarious mangas i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> met </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've read and the anime adaptation did a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty good [ __ ] job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you gave warren to sarah for five yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't sure if i should comment on that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> offended by that not really man i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never watched this i have no idea i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> curious </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> psycho pass a seven yeah season one </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah okay thank god like psychopaths i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember psychopath is one of those few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shows that has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuck with me and it's it's one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> shows where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> re-watched it and i loved it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way more re-watching it than i watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time because i think what's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn good yeah i think i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appreciate psychopaths </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time i watched it but the more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i watched psychopaths the more i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now i like i gave it a 7 when i first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> watched it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i was doing my when i was thinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back to like my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> top 10 favorite anime of the decade of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the 2010s yeah psychopaths was up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it still has some like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> villain was one of the best villains in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it still has some of the most unique </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ideas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i've seen in anime that has like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuck with me and i don't think has aged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at all um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like the like the scene halfway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where the main character has to make a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choice that that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has stuck with me for a long time and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the one scene that has also stuck with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is um i can't remember what exactly what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's the episode where this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they start beating the [ __ ] out of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> character in like the middle of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> street </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and because of the system that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> been set up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> no one reacts just because they they've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> never seen something like this before </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i don't know i i thought that was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like such a unique idea </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like that has that was completely </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> natural in this world that genorabuchi </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> has built </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah um it's i think it's what the world </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> building is like yeah amazing i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's unfortunate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the biggest unfortunate thing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that season two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and yeah i haven't watched season three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but they just didn't have as </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> don't know why i did that i mean you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> clearly i was a fool i don't know who </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that person is who signed into my heart </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and changed my score </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i love the fact that he gave bucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> monica a higher score than parker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> weren't you [ __ ] on me for [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> liking clannad yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first season is [ __ ] right what did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i give that you didn't even give it a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> score </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so [ __ ] forgettable that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't even want to [ __ ] rate that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> piece of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> show bits if i could rate that i'd get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like a seven or an eight that was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fun show yeah that was great it's a fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay why the [ __ ] did i give c the money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the soul and possible control in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> eight yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know why i did i never even </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> season one and two the same score wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did i really yeah you did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> second thing i immediately noticed after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> our discussion like we just had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> pokemon four </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought you were my brother top top 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> anime betrayals of all time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i can probably explain why that is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> case right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> because this was made in 2014. it was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> probably the age of like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm a big boy now pokemon pokemon that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's old khan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's child conor me adult connor i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> don't like pokemon i'm a man i thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you were my boy no i am i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> i would recorrectively change that to a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> ten if i could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> big sad really a 10 corner really okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> one one thing and one thing i find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hilarious right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> come on okay so i didn't want to go last </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i have to talk [ __ ] about your scores </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and not know my own connor has given </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> steins gate and sword art online the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> same score </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of eight yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you gave sword arts online season one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think i'm actually having a strike </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> joey's just having an aneurysm right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not even gonna question you giving </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> steins get an eight okay that's fine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i meant to put ten yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i honestly you know what if i genuinely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> i i enjoyed sold out online but if i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> went back and watched it i'm sure </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know i would be like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> i enjoyed it for like what it was right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> right i liked the idea because it's my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> first ever like video game anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> right right so it was fun and then you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know you think about it more and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you think about kirito and you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wow this show is really garbage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but at that time yeah i mean at the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone everyone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think we've all gone through the stage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we thought sword art online was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cool concept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> back when it was a cool concert i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> look admittedly as much as i'm known as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the guy who publicly hates sword online </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i've said that like first couple of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episodes really great build-up of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> premise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and then it kind of just fell apart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after a while when they were like let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make kirito the edgiest protagonist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> alive and then that's when i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay i mean you had a great premise yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just kind of ruined it with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> worst main character i have no idea why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i gave back and when i got three or nine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i would never ever do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why would you give it like a five why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show [ __ ] what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> boring show what that's boring man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's so boring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but you have to understand this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a man who skips stories oh no yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so what i want to know is how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do you watch bucky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why did you even watch it you watched an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> animated light novel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so i i watched back on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gathering and then i watched like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the next three seasons or so right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and how did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how did you manage that how did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manage that i was confused a lot of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i also just like thought a lot of it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird like is this the you have to bear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> mind this is the first time i've ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seen any anime where like there was a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> protagonist or whatever he was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> touching a kid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the ghost girl and i was like i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like whoa what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the [ __ ] is this i'm like well why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is everyone liking this child porn bro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's all right man it's a deconstruction </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of heroin </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> what i want to know is how you have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> patience to do it because even me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> well again back in the age of like when </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're an anime fan yeah you can kind of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like put up with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything because you've just gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> right yeah and that was when i watched </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it because it's always high up on the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> list </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> and that that might have been the thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that may be like you know what no i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> not watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but here's what he's doing here's what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> confuses me right is that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you gave back to it and i would assume </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> majority of the mono atari series like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> mid score yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but you love katana gator catholically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like [ __ ] awesome but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the same style no yeah no okay it's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> same style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's written by the speaker dude but it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's done like a million times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> better it's so much more entertaining </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> than back among actually ever was i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not saying katanagata is bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah they're both great because like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my mind when i think of like katana </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just feels like a quentin tarantino </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like film like when i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right yeah like the dialogue is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> really important it's like one of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't really like it when seeing how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how did you not find that with the more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of atari series because i didn't find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the dialogue interesting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in like captain agatha yeah like the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> selling point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i didn't find it interesting i was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waiting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know i was sold when i circulation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> came on and i'm like yo this is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] bomb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and then i went i went to see it give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> give us the [ __ ] yeah i need it after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i need it after the aneurysm i'm having </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> katana gathering right was like legit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> oh [ __ ] okay i made my three by three i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly i didn't put katana i got three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> innings i just didn't forgot i existed </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that that would go in my three by three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah okay so katana is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> it gave me everything that like i love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like kill bill and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pulp fiction in anime form and with a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of story with a setting that i love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is like samurai i [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> samurai </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah i mean again i'm not i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not disagreeing with you on that 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> agree with all of them yeah i'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> saying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's both a lot of words it's both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's both weird yeah it's both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> characters there's a very studio shaft </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> no katana gutter is not studio shaft </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> something about katana </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i just really [ __ ] enjoyed so much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more than i ever did the monogatari </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think that's the closest you've come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to enjoying just reading words then yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah because i think because there was a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of the action </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was really [ __ ] good and it made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sense all in the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you didn't like the action in the modern </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> times the monogatari series actually was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come on man it's i don't know why but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah the action was far better than it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> had any right to be yeah exactly shaft </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like all right i'm a flicks real </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> quick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that that that fight where it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like araragi versus like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it was karen in the second </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season yeah it was like the big brother </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> versus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't even remember no no no no the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> fight was uh khan bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that was brutal man i don't even [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> remember this okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll show you afterwards and you'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you'll learn appreciation i will say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though the toothbrush scene is probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the thing that made me like curious </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about hentai i was like i was like oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> this is actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of hot yeah honestly like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> toothbrush scene it's not i'm saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's hot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it i i feel like it birthed so many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> degenerates yeah yeah yeah definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's culture was born and that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> culture was born thanks to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> toothbrush team that is a classic scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who are you and how much time did you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> spend on tumblr </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> honestly i don't know what mindset i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to ever give there was i don't think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's any point in my life where i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> genuinely like nora gary in my opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the only 10 out of 10 aspect about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> origami is the opening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah that was good but then again i find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it absolutely hilarious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that you gave black butler a 5. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly and you gave black butler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> season 2 specials a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three honestly i still yeah i still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> would really yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone i i made it no i didn't i would </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> like i was heavily influenced by what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone else was i mean i agree </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> definitely getting these them on a </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> recover from the fact that i dropped it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and had to pick it back up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you dropped it about yeah about 10 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> episodes in because the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> but then you when you watch it and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like oh wait [ __ ] it's good </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> you watched at all like zombie loan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> zombie loan i have no idea why i watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that show but i remember being angry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i watched that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember being like mad that i wasted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my time watching the only reason why i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watched zombie alone was because i heard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a peach pit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> show and i was like i like peach pits </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i gave school days of one though yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> see that i see that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you finished sunday without god yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i noticed that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i haven't finished that i finished it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but i definitely did not give it a seven </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and he gave me seven wait which one's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sunday without gobbling exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's that's the point i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah with the show oh yeah i watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that because i'm surprised you watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was when i i can actually tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact time i watched that i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> when i watched that so that when i first </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> got into anime i was watching it on like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the shitty like pirate sites figuring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out what the [ __ ] was going on yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accidentally watched full metal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> alchemist twice not realizing like what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the [ __ ] i was doing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then i finally got a free trial for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> crunchyroll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so i watched as much anime as i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could for the 48 hours right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that was one of them we're not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sponsored by crunchyroll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually that was that was one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ones that i i watched and that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> zombie along one of them as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no no no no that was before so i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> remember that was probably the first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ever 12 episode show i watched on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> crunchyroll i think right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's some of this just doesn't make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> sense you watched the outbreak company </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i did yeah that's that's i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> never expect you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i would not have paid conor to watch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i think you're the only other person i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know that has watched out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you finished the world god only knows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and gave it a nine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah all three seasons i actually really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> liked it i really liked it i liked it as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> well that just that just doesn't seem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rising </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like my jaws on the floor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because if you were to tell me that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conor finished this show and lights i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what is this wait you also gave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> higarashi an eight uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> season one yeah uh i think i would take </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what would you give it now i watch the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dubs so maybe a four </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like like i'm looking i'm looking at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of this and i'm just like is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like he gave devlius a part-timer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a [ __ ] 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i love that i love dude that's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> good that is really good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you actually look at my account my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> profile picture is devil's apartment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i loved it i loved devil as a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> part-timer i'm surprised as well you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the east yeah i did and the two movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and gave all them a nine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've really enjoyed eating of these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> really how have we never talked about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eating of these together i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how we never talk because i [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you it brings up even though these never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> come it's a great [ __ ] yeah but no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one ever brings that [ __ ] up it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great it's got a great first season but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like the movies just didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conclude it in the way i wanted to but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he gave both of them a nine though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i i thought eden of the east had one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most interesting premises </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah i watched okay since no one's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> talking about eating of the east we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna sell what you do let's do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let's give some love to you guys i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna be honest i remember i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember my feelings for the show i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cannot [ __ ] remember what happened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well i i have one memory of this show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was like a ship and a bunch of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> naked people coming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah that's all i remember no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no the the ending of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the the ending of the first season of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eating of these was [ __ ] great oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so what is the premise again okay so so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so the premise is they have a smartphone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i can't remember exactly how much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> money they were given but you have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 13 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 13 people who were given these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> smartphones and on a smartphone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you had like this ai that they could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> request anything to happen that's right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and they were given a budget of i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 million dollars always more than that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was it like a million or 10 million </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> billion yeah 10 billion yet which is 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> million dollars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so they were given a budget of 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> million dollars and all there was there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all they were told </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was to save the world yeah right there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that and that was their objective so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> good and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and so the series is just the story of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these different people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and their own take on what a hundred </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> million dollars means </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to save the world and honestly like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't want to spoil </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it but it's [ __ ] great especially 12 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not just it's not just 12 episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's 12 episodes and a movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> two movies two movies yeah are you sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are you sure it's two movies not just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because he gave both of them uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> nine out of ten okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i i feel like the first season was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] fantastic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's and you know the problem with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first season is that it didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> conclude the story but the first season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was [ __ ] fantastic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um the movies were not as good in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know i didn't even know they had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> movies yeah i don't remember much about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what happened in the movies </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> might enjoy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you try and sell me on a show i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> immediately will </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> start being like i don't know no i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> completely the opposite yeah i'm the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> opposite because like i've gotten to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i need to be sold on the show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i need to have like a reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why i'm watching this show like is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show going to get good am i going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have something i get out of this show i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i need to i need to know that before i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> get before like truly get into a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because otherwise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nowadays i end up dropping shows after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one episode if it doesn't hook me even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> critically acclaimed highly claimed show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if i if i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that something good is coming up that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to be worth my time yeah then i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just not going to give it a chance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i just don't have that patience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anymore i've sat through enough shitty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> shows to know that i don't want to waste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my time anymore yeah yeah exactly right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know it's it's just it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sad because i i do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> miss that feeling of finding hidden gems </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> where i can just be like oh i have zero </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expectations exactly exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i gave kyo uh wait there's this one yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one thing that's curious to me you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watched phase zero but you rated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the second season lower than the first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you mean the the the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> action-packed second season where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything gets concluded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's lower than the first season yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the setup </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like you're like completely going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> against everything like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all the character build up you've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> brought yourself up to right it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> oh i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> hate story i love action but the season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where there's more action i'll write </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> lore yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i really enjoyed when they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> introducing like all of the characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in in faith that's like my favorite part </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of faye right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and fate's day night as well my favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> part of fate day night is when they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> introducing the characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's so cool because you're like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i know i know there's an assassin i know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's a writer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what are they gonna be and then when and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then when you watch fate stay night and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're like wow ryder's [ __ ] in this one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> compared to fate zero </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because like fate zero you watch you're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like yo ryder he's the best alexander oh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'd [ __ ] him </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but like then you watch then that's the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> reason why i [ __ ] hated fate stay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> night except for the animation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because i was like which face they know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about the original face okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the series not the movies right the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> series okay because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't want to get into this review the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> point is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> i just need clarification because what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you saying fans were like on their seat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> right here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> aren't you cool but i can't believe they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> had like there was no like good alec </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they should just brought alexander back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again and be like hey i'm back baby or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> like it's a pre-course i guess like hey </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm i'm back in the future yeah yeah i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> back here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm back in the past yeah because that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> he was like the best part of we zero </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> relationship with the [ __ ] uh the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> weevil whatever he's called </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] weevil waver wave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a lot of ones that you haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> given a score darker than black i stand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by being a nine because if you watch the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> dub dude troy baker is in that this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before troy baker stopped doing anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] man he kills it as november 11. oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so [ __ ] i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've like darker than black is a show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that i've actually re-watched quite a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> few times and i don't know why i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rewatched quite a few times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i really i just really liked the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of darkness yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what i'm not gonna lie i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> remember anything it's like quirks but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if they were actually [ __ ] cool and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like cause cause like it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i remember watching it it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> x-men but what i found interesting was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that they had to like do this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really weird activity every time they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their power and i just know smoking yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know why i just thought that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really cool and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it has a [ __ ] amazing soundtrack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well because it was like by yokocana </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the biggest differences between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the first season every other season was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yoko kana's music just set such an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing tone for this world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this environment that it just made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just it it just felt good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exploring this world and just being in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it i feel like i gotta re-watch it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it's fun dude and watch it dub dude like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> the dub's really [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're saying this to joey now honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly dude like troy baker is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> november 11. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i love troy you all saw me on because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> troy baker plays the guy who has to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smoke even though yeah he's smoking yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i've watched it as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> so good man oh god um okay well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> hold on you watch saki uh yeah and you </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> and at the end i was like i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand myself i'm like but there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> golden wind and [ __ ] going on and stuff </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> remember yeah and it was complete [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> from what i remember yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember having a good time i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i watched the dub and i remember the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> voice acting was uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> greg as was like playing the whiny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> characters he always does </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and i think he was a little too whiny i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> mean that's just gregaris </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh he's damn he's too [ __ ] good at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> his job no no because like i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that that was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i swear he was typecasting that rolf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the longest [ __ ] because there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were so many of those characters and no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one else could do a voice like him with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like sounding whiny yeah and so it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always him doing the whiny character i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will say a wrecker seven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seven out of ten honestly i when the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> original one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when i watched that everyone was talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> about the show like jesus had came down </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> himself and brought a show </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah and i watched it and i thought </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> honestly this is kind of [ __ ] like it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it's good but like it's kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> boring like is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is that how you feel about it obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> now i would give it a six is that how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you felt about ergo proxy as well you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> gave that a seven as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh go proxy i remember i was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] is happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again this doesn't seem like an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you would watch no like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ergo proxy is the last anime i would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> think it was like watching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know when you go to a modern </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> art museum and you look at this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the same amount of like what the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i would get if you came up to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tomorrow and said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i watched uh serial experiments lane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah honestly i've been wanting to watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that for a while i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i just haven't had the the opportunity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like yeah i want to waste a day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and not not really enjoy and have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i have a brain that's supporting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i feel like you watch you watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> shows like that to come out with like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just your brain being like what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like that's not fun half the time so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is fun depending on your mood because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it took me ages to watch serial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> experiments lane and then i was just in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this weird mood where i'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i i want my mind to be [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that that sounds like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right now yeah and then i don't want a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> challenge yeah it's it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like me with you ask me like i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wait i'm waiting to wake up for the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i want i want depression right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know why the [ __ ] did i give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> uh this anime mao mao yusha </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was about to say you gave that a nine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and i'm like was it the milf titties is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that what it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all i remember from you know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gets a little two bonus points but but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think again that was in the same weekend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that i watched the other show on the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> country will 48 hours right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember the mile mile yusha </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was like studio arms and if you didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know if you don't know studio arms they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like famous for being a hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> studio well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like transitioned into anime well that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably why it connected a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and um yeah i mean that was like one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shows they produced that was an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was seen as just not complete trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but i wouldn't call it a [ __ ] night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there's little sexual things going on or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> something like that some vibes of little </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> milf step son i mean i mean that was i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd say as an impressionable teenager i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> can see why you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> connected with that on a personal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> he level with it but yeah i think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty much everything because uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you haven't rated a lot of these i would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bump kill the kill at one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for getting me into hentai that's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> same thing i would really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kill the kill is what made me be like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know what anime girls are hot i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like you know what this is a hentai of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> this and there was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's how i was like oh this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> good that's why you need to get into the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ginsengs man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um we're gonna we're gonna get him into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that event yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eventually wait wait okay then if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> liked maui maul yusha did you like long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> horizon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i loved logarithm is one of my favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> shows okay that makes sense because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> written by the same people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm actually hype even though i think i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> need to rewatch a little bit of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> logarithmic season two </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i remember i [ __ ] loved the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> world yeah like in logarithms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i don't know how they like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> write stories like i'm glad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'm almost great i'm also glad that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the show didn't like [ __ ] blow its </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> load like immediately and yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> stop telling us everything about it like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i love it when the show's teased us </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with the world like here's a little </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> crumb </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah crumb knowledge and then they just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> don't mention it for a few episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like oh [ __ ] yeah we are in a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> we're in a [ __ ] video game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i remember log horizon i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching the first two three episodes of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it dropped it immediately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm just like really what what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is this beta sword art online man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is this because like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> worst thing about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lockhorizon was that one like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> animation is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like it ain't great it's like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> most typical </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> five out of ten animation this is just a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> throwaway seasonal show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the first three or so episodes were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> generic kind of introduction you could </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> get to a world and it didn't start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> getting interesting until they probably </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> started explaining </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the game mechanics and seeing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> seeing the game mechanics being broken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like within this world was just so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that whole arc where like there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> a guy who could kill in the villages </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah that was [ __ ] cool like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what really you sold me immediately was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when they when they first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> discovered </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they could make things taste good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they like invented the burger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and was like yo this is really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting this this isn't even an issa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> car this is just like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an entrepreneur business [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically just like a business textbook </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah how do you how the [ __ ] do you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guys remember what happens in these like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seven out of ten shows bro the moment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something isn't like exceptional i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's going into the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> locker rise is not a separate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was cool because again it was like again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's done by ton of money who's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> somehow can like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> make you learn [ __ ] while reading these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stories i don't know how he does it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it's like spice and wolf right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like spice and wolf exactly like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason why i love spices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because because like i actually learned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like proper like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> useful business skills like wait a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> minute i'm just getting horny over this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one or if this wolf wife </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but i'm like who's the marketing genius </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i'm learning things about economics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not la that's not legal that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not allowed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what are you doing i can't be horny and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smart at the same time that's not how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that works </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i just feel like i have like amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> brain compression like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my my brain zips zips like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how like when you compress a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> file to like lower the memory it takes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up that's what i do with anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> immediately when i'm done i'm like zip </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that [ __ ] up put it in storage forget </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about that thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then when when i rewatch it it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like unzipping the farm like oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this did happen yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has this man like min maxed his brain i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> actually think i actually think i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i've sorted the storage on my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain apparently you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got a sorting algorithm literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just for anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my [ __ ] god but yes i think this is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> good time to move on to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> our three by threes now yes there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> reason why i have my laptop up is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we're gonna create uh three or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> share each other's three by three of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime yeah we've explained that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we've explained what three by three but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like to expand further on that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i like i love seeing people's three by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like a three by three is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> closest thing you get to a rorschach </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> test for like anime fans </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know you know you know what i mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because you get you get to see </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because like like asking someone asking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> what someone's favorite anime is it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a [ __ ] stupid question because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like if you've seen enough changes all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the time it changes all the [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with uh with like a with like a kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with nine anime to choose from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a good sample size to really get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a grasp on what this person's taste is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like not not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not if all their taste because i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know how hard a time you guys had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> choosing nine anime i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just shoved three together again that i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like but i had a pretty difficult time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just choosing mine anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well you have a [ __ ] d you probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have like a seizure just thinking like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what am i gonna do for like breakfast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh my god like jesus christ </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i swear you you like take so long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to contemplate decisions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean i came up with mine pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quickly just because like i literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought of the first night we're gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> look at mine first </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but i literally just thought of the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> first nine that i think is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i love this yeah because i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's the most important thing is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i feel if you think too hard about it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> then you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of reshaping your tastes too much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just generally just a bad policy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i was i was like all right what are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the nine shows that i [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thinking thing you're just a bad point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> don't think i personally think thinking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is overrated i'd rather just go with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> guts is that an unpopular opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm gonna say it unpopular opinions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking is overrated all right so let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look at mine first all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> let's let's see what you got here joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> lucky star clanna yo what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to the audience who cannot uh see or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> don't go to these shows what they say so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> from so the top row from left to right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is serial experiments lane clan ad fully </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> equally </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> why lucky star i i've gotta ask my my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> why why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> okay don't don't worry about placements </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like don't worry about placements too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much this could be in any random [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> order </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah reason why okay i completely get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> why someone would look at me and say bro </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> lucky star is not good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because truth be told if you watch lucky </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> star today </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it'd probably be [ __ ] right lucky star </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is so time sensitive because all of its </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> jokes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are time sensitive like lucky star was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of those shows that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> made fun of like otaku and weeb culture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back in like the mid 2000s </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm turning this into a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> video essence i'll tell you what [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lucky star is my friend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lucky star is uh reddit humor before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reddit existed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's it's it's it's like the it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the late 2000's reddit here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the reddit just didn't exist so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone's just like oh lucky sounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing yeah exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i couldn't sit through it really yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't finish it i see like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's weird because randomly like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couple of days ago i was just scrolling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> through youtube and on my recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lucky star like funny complimation and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i was just like yeah [ __ ] i haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> heard of lucky stars i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like six minutes long i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what [ __ ] it i've got time that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an oxymoron to me lucky stuff funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compilation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> but i don't know i think it's because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> like especially around the time when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched lucky star i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really heavily into obviously of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like anime obviously but yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was really heavily into like the otaku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> culture especially in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and lucky star kind of went over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all of that [ __ ] and put it into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> perspective of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's pretty [ __ ] ridiculous looking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> from an outsider's perspective </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah this cafe is weird huh yeah no not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even that it was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like the [ __ ] comic head scene is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> still funny to this day just because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so accurate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i just i looked back at lucky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> star and i never liked it originally but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i look back at some of the scenes i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah this doesn't age well to me at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right exactly and that's why i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> never recommend lucky star to people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> today yeah because it has not aged one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the jokes have not achieved i have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> question </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] is this show in the bottom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> corner i've seen this swan the bottom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> left yeah what is that shirt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what's the english name for that shirt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh [ __ ] uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> god i haven't even i think i've watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that show it's basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's basically like a comedy show that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> throws in a lot of itchy jokes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i've watched the show and i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember anything about it i 100 have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> watched this show </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and i i i'm one small girl the small </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> girl's angry that she doesn't have big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tits right a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> right that's one of the jokes yeah he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay why why is this in your three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> people three this is in my three by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> three because a well first of all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i think it's [ __ ] hilarious b it kind </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> of encompasses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my love for comedy and my love for itchy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you have a broad term of what comedy is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah um lucky stuff what what what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> encompasses your love for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comedy uh what what about the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> encompasses your love for comedy i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's [ __ ] hilarious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean i don't know what else what the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] answer were you expecting no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because it's very intricate and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> jokes that constructed are very </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like this this okay the reason why i put </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is because it encompasses my love for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> trashy shows this show </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is not good in any perspective i'm just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> saying it right now all right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> here's how you know that my three this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> is how you know my three by three is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legit right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give me some of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> is not a good show it is trashy shitty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> comedy with etchings </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's crap all right okay here's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reason why i put it in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> important question then every show in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> here yeah would you rewatch it today </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you would i would you re-watched </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> it was a lie honestly i just didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> believe it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i would 100 re-watch all these shows </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> it was such bad quality i know that it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> old but like i actually couldn't sit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> there so basically your review of you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hot show is where it's old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> no no honestly like i feel bad that i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like that but like i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually i'll read the language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my god you're really gonna hit me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> with that audio problems </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> what was your what was your problem with </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_04> favorite dubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it really i don't know i never watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the dark side i swear </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 seconds into the job i'm like [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> listen to the japanese i gotta say i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta send it i gotta turn this [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> seriously yeah it was pretty good who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] played yusuke because yusuke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] like killed him this is probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just a case of you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know watching it years later and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being spoiled for choice et cetera et </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> cetera i mean for me okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i put you hutcher there because hey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously i love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> my shonen but i feel like i don't know i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have never felt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the same level of excitement that i felt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> watching and writing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that i have from any other i'm i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> envious i want that yuei hakusho has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> some of my favorite arcs in all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> shonen the dark tournament arc </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tuesday one of the best arcs in shonen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the dark tournament arc is the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tournament arc </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hands down of all time hands down and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is this is a tournament arc that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> came out [ __ ] 20 years ago now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it it birthed the tournament arc </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> genre yeah the reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why the reason why tournament arcs have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> become a meme and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are so hyped is because of you it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's because of you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like dragon ball might have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> popularized it but then new york should </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> perfect </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it yeah it hasn't been perfected since </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then but like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> also like sensui is one of the best </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> villains in all of shonen as well oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and togaro as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my god such a good character not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna lie growing up i wanted to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he a so bad i was like i looked at hie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm just like everything about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with the black hair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is so [ __ ] cool is there's a serial </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> experiment laying at the top yeah that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> top left why i think because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> well again i still think it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> insanely ahead of its time like this was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> made back in like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the late 90s and it talks about [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> societal issues that are relevant today </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right and that's i don't know i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like a huge artist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what kind of stuff does it talk about in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the show what kind of society so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> grossly oversimplify serial experiments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> lane is essentially this idea that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> your digital identity and your real-life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> identity </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sees no barrier okay and so basically it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> follows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> obviously lane who kind of goes through </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this like discovery of herself </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and the world in being like wait so we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> create digital identities of ourselves </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the quote-unquote internet i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously back then it was very primal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right but it came out in like 1999 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 98.8 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah just just didn't even have balloons </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tower defense exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah this is the full flash player [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but basically it's it's this idea that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wait so if things happen in the digital </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then is there really no consequences of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that in the real world and vice versa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and they did that in 12 episodes and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i i will attest that ex experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lane is [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember well i watched it for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time last year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i watched it pretty much oh really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah well because it was unlike to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch this forever yeah and then i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm finally in the mood to watch this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll give it a watch and i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this normally when you see a piece of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> media that focuses around technology </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and like stories around technology it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ages </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> horribly and i remember watching zero </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> experience lane i'm thinking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how is this how does this seem like it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> more relevant now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> than it is when it first came out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> overlapping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like this shows 20 years low-key </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> foretold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the future of social media yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think i think i can understand that if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you were really in touch with the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> internet back then you could probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> see where it was going i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and and i think and i think and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> obviously i pick serial experiments </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> laying there obviously because i love it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i love i mean the shows that make you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quite unquote yeah yeah that to dive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more into that kind of stuff like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know yeah make you thunk right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> ergo proxy is in the same field as that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i love that show and uh you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> razorfan as well was in there as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and planet i mean i just think it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe cry like you made me cry they both </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's seven episodes and it feels like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] five hour long movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's a very dense show very i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it does not why does dents always just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sound like an insult </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a dense [ __ ] it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fictional what do you want to say no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's a it's a compact show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> compact sounds less of an insult than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> dense dense sounds like it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like brick [ __ ] house like filled with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like garbage </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> basically up to up to the time skip all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the way once </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then i've rewatched it again once uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then i've re-watched some of my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> favorite parts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> multiple times i [ __ ] know it is and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this was back when i had time to watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i would just like whenever i go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever i have time like i said when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you said you really watch right i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> thought you were talking about like oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i've rewatched the water seven </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i've re-watched alabaster i didn't think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you really watched you've really shown </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> your age you need years to re-watch that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one day no wonder you're older than me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like [ __ ] me you need like i love how i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> love how you compensated me like no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> only up until the pre before the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like it's still like 400 percent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why like i was having trouble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting a shonen on because i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is there any shonen that i actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> truly loved that i would you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> think that i would go back any time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i was going to put you hug show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i was thinking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> seven deadly sins come no yeah i'll come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> here for 737 right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but like one piece to me will go down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when it finishes will go down as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one well it already is one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> greatest anime slash manga series of all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time yeah of course but to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when i think back and i think back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because one piece isn't the perfect show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> right yeah i've rewatched one piece </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> does anyone claim it is yeah i know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> everyone everyone forgets about the lows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of one piece where everyone forgets </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sky ellen sky island i wasn't a fan of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> the foxy arc which was a filler cannon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> arc that everyone doesn't talk about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know you know what i mean what are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> these names </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> these things don't sound [ __ ] real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> um it was way too long it was dragged </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> out to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but nothing in my opinion can touch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the highs of one piece when one piece is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at its best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i i think it is the greatest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the greatest thing you can find in anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> i will stand by and say even though i've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> watched every minor june anime yeah i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> cried more times watching one piece </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> than any other [ __ ] when you have that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> many episodes something's gonna hit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah like [ __ ] me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i mean i wasn't excited i mean like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's plenty of shows that have a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and haven't had the highs that one piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> happens because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you know anything about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> pokemon has some pretty high highs man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what i find amazing about one piece is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been going on for like what 20 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> years now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> almost 30 now almost like i can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember when it's like i think it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started in the 1990s </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 98 or 96 or something something like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i remember i've just caught up with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the manga with like what the wano arc </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is now one of the longest arcs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so long they has three parts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it still has moments that make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me feel [ __ ] magical this is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like one piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like like i watch some of the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moments in one piece and i get reminded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is why i [ __ ] love anime this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why i like [ __ ] love manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is why i love this medium did the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> author of one piece like intend for it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to be as long as it is it was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] it's just popular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i i think he had planned because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing about one piece is that it's this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long and yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there are there's foreshadowings that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's happened like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] hundreds of chapters not from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this planet that that is that is that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being explored now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and i think he didn't expect it to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> be this long but he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but when he got popular he realized he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can explore basically every idea he that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of people a lot of people i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of undermine oda just because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> like oh yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know he made one piece but whatever </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's so long blah blah blah but i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> people when you look deep into it people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really undermine his skill for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> storytelling because yeah i mean again </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's be honest you have to be to keep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah how many how people like captivated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> he's been number one on shonen jump for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the past like 15 years yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't do that by luck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and like what i find amazing is it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been going on this long and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not one no it's it's not only got still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got [ __ ] amazing moments and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even in some of the greatest uh in some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the latest chapters and some of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> latest moments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but two no matter how far you go into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you feel like there's still an upswing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you still you still feel like he hasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> peaked yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and like how would you write a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> story that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like almost almost a thousand chapters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long and you still think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man there's an upswing coming there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's something greater it's insane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time a new </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> arc started yeah and i would keep up to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> date with like what the manga </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was saying everyone would be like how is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> it that the next arc is even better yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> how does it keep getting better yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> how does that work i thought this was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the peak and then it just keeps getting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> down how does the hot dog stand arc </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> keep just blowing me away how does the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> water park adventure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> supreme arc keep blowing me away right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the names don't make [ __ ] sense it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> literally that pro cd video where he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> talks about anime arc names </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like any one piece fan who's watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that video knows that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's just calling out one piece fans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> there because we were literally talking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about this video before the podcast </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> started and we were just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> me and me and joey was just talking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about the big marmark yeah and then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> connie </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> connor was just like oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah wait that's that's a reality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> are you guys serious i thought they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> joking because it was like big mom's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> house or something i thought it was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the joke </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like that but i felt that right like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> when i when i remember when i've watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the alabaster arc in one piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> i was like this is the greatest thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ever made yeah and then water seven came </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> out i was like how is that how is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> getting better and then the white beard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> came out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because frankly i don't really want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hear your opinions i honestly do not </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> manga sensei is what happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you take all the trashiest parts of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> orimo and put that and put that into a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> orimo was a nice wholesome look at otaku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and with incest and the thing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing is the thing is when it was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> right this is this is just this is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> your honor it was but a parody yeah i i </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> it sparked an outcry right it it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it definitely uh because the the reason </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> because no one was actually expecting it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it went from like twenty percent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> incest to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> ninety nine percent it was a hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> percent it was a hundred there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there was there was no there was no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> percentage that could be shaved off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it went full incest so and it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> unapologetic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fully admit that it went full incentive </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> because this this show like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this show is the epitome of everything i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> love about trashy harry manga and anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's when you say that it just sounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like satire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like sound it is not okay so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> remember when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> went through my anime list and i gave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ikitosin a two yeah so like back when i </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> trashy anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm i got a good [ __ ] taste right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that [ __ ] changed all that when i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why am i enjoying this so much why do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why do i like this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_08> that yeah i kissed cis being a perfect </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> example yeah i was about to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> put it in my [ __ ] three by three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> though yeah just probably put an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in this [ __ ] top nine i will middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i will [ __ ] i that that was a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> legitimate deliberate choice i put it in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the middle because i'm just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this is this show this single show has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably had the biggest overall effect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on my taste in modern anime you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally [ __ ] made orima out to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the free space in a bingo card you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like yeah of course i'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> open it i [ __ ] did it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it is yeah it is it is a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trashy anime right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there there are trashy moments there but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i will defend the point that orimo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't complete trash there there were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some legitimately good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> heartwarming moments in there and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't complete it wasn't all trash okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it was it wasn't iron margarita it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> really was okay it wasn't harry potter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're going to jail buddy era manga </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sensei is ori emo reskinned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's all it is and you have to admit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to that no i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to remember manga sensei is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> trashiest part of orimo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concentrated it is it is dense iron </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> other than like mob okay that's also why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i love them all for similar reasons okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like ping pong is like one of the only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> animes right you get all these [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stupid animes where the guys opie as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it no one [ __ ] gives a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right like okay wow kirito is a giant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dick again right cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we have another easter kai oh they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> overpowered oh they have an ability </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's unique to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what real life sucks man no one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has a unique ability and i really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a [ __ ] anime that was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life kind of sucks man sometimes people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gonna be better at things that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if they hate it that's what that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was so real and it hurt man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it hurt because i've been on both sides </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the ping pong like animation like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the characters i've been talented at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that i [ __ ] hated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i felt bad for people who really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to be good at that thing that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was good at and i've also tried my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] hardest at something and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> speak japanese fluently at birth so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know i've been on both sides of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spectrum of pink on the animation so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i'm kidding no but i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really ping ping pong ping pong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what what i call an what i call ping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> pong it's a life animal yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it it it hurt because i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you really had to like pull that out of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that that made me a little like god damn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> okay yeah you wait okay then i'm curious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> have you seen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh mosh comes in like a lion no okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> think if you loved ping pong you would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> love everyone has told me that yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because mars comes in like a lion is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> complete opposite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mars comes in like a lion is about a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> genius who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can't understand the idea of losing yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right but that in itself is what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> causing him to lose in real life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so it's literally the opposite of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> ping pong but that's just like that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just like the school when they're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're a gifted child and they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> can't [ __ ] do anything later on right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly i mean and obviously like uh i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> don't want to know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why why is sakamoto there okay why why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is that what is wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> why why is that a top night man that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so [ __ ] funny man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'll have to stand with my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sakamoto is one of the funniest animals </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sakamoto is so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's so funny it's so funny you can put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that [ __ ] on it's like the mr bean of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like the mr bean of anime if mr </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> bean was like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like handsome millionaire who was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> perfected anyway </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] so you really gotta diss me when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just like were like yeah pedophilia </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> brotherly in love okay here's what i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't understand though what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every three by three right as we've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> established so far and every three by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> three i've seen back when it was big </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> has at least one show that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like universally right yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i think all these shows are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fantastic one which is why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it's simple which is why i suppress </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> extra doubt i just don't like [ __ ] shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jerry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what do you think i'm gonna put like my </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> these yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would i willingly do it at my own free </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> world no no because like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to to bring it the other way like for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching new shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is me chasing that high that that is me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chasing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that high that i felt with the shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've already liked but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the more anime you watch and just the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> older you [ __ ] get that just gets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> harder and harder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't watch my channel anymore and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the biggest like reveal of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> video god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't watch anything no i do i watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean look honestly like i i i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling sauce about this three by three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because all nine of these shows are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> universally praised all right right it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> golden time universally praised yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i i like ordinary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in my mind it's like my two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> favorite like romance or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah yeah yeah toradora and golden </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> time but golden time felt like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> better because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> golden time is my favorite romance of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all time i would think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and yeah i thought that you guys didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> like golden time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> i love going on time okay okay i've met </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> less people who say they didn't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> golden time yeah really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because like the thing about golden </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time is that you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there are there were flaws because no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who the [ __ ] liked bannery as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's be honest like i just okay like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you talk talking about compressing your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memory like i i've only just remembered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that ghost binary was a thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and that was just something i've just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like that was like a black spot yeah in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> amazing series that i seem to remember </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> golden time but like i think that's a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> golden time i just think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> this is this is how adult romance should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be this is this took </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything that was good as you said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> about toradora and just made it better </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah perfected it put it in university </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't make it like just this high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> school romance had enough adult elements </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't have an annoying ass [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lolli </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's sad that no one gives a chance but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> also weird that it's only in 720p </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that's pretty [ __ ] weird no 480p i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think or something really yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was never released oh yeah yeah it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in 480p it's in 480p </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's such a shame because like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's such a [ __ ] good show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was either that or like one ounce </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i really [ __ ] like one hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i mean i i don't know like there's i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i guess it it looks very basic from the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> outside looking no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not basic it's not basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's it's not basic in the sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where you thought we were putting on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nine favorite shows like oh like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> no we were but what we're saying is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like there isn't a single guilty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pleasure anime here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because obviously guilty pleasure anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is bad or an emo that's more than a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> guilty pleasure that's a criminal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> pleasure joey i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my opinion the guilty pleasure is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> show that you love no matter what even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know it is [ __ ] yeah okay but then i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when i was making this nine by nine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> let's say dead man wonderland i love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dead man wonderland but it never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> finished and it was you know it was kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of you know it was kind of made because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but like i don't think it's better than </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> any of these shows for me perhaps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like i've i've talked to you and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i know what your tastes are basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like i i know you love like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] hardcore brutal shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like jojo bakki gantz i love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um i'm surprised that i thought becky </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was gonna i thought bucky was gonna be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> up there as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well i mean i love baki as like there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's a few episodes in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> backyard like yeah it's like mid but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> there was just so many [ __ ] funny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moments that like it all stand with me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> forever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here's the best way i can do this i know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you like chad shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's the best way to get like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> chat that's the best way i can describe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> honest taste like like it's it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> just it's just got chad characters isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it you know what i mean chad characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that's that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that's why i really want connor to watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or read fists than all stuff yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i know you would [ __ ] love that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i like the right amount of chat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> if there's just too much chat sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a little too much you know it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you mean you like jojo that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that's a different that's a different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's a different kind of chat that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that jojo is like the built </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> different anime like that's in its own </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> league </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as far as i can say like i think jody </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> shouldn't even be treated as anime it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a lifestyle </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah it's an artwork but like i don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> know like in first of the north star </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i see that i don't really find it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> appealing because they're like they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> too macho i want a bit of weakness to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the character right i mean if you read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it you'll know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every character is weak as [ __ ] really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay okay fine fine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i think you should read it you'll love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah but yeah it pisses me off when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm watching an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and the main character is like a wimp </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> beyond com comprehension and just causes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any problems for himself because he's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wimp and i'm like yeah listen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all you have to do is just say no and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you wouldn't have been dragged off to a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> culture are you talking about deku </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know something else there's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> lot of shows where i'm just like this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> literally could have been avoided if you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just like stood up to yourself for about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> two seconds like this whole problem </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i don't know man i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> satisfied </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you want from me huh just some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] you know what i mean like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> expecting me to have [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like this is like this is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> too polished i i i i i have good taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what can i say i can i can make a better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> nine uh three by three </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> jojo yeah but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i love baki but it's not in my top nine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you talk about it so often yeah but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it like i love it but it's i wouldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> higher than any of these for enjoyment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my mind but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's okay because shows that i love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and show that i want to talk about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> are like different i guess but it's okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like getting this we should have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> defined the rules more appropriately </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right should be like connor give me the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> nine shows that you think about keep you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> up at night </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] me that was a good show like like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need to talk about it yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> okay let's be like that's right psycho </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and hunter i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> rarely hear you talking about that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> never talking about these okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i talk about one punch man more than i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talk about mob psycho right in one punch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i think mob psych is a better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> show than one punch man well then why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wouldn't you talk about mob psycho if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a better show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well again because it's a bad show and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like there's not much to say it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] amazing like just go watch it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like like my favorite show i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> love becky right where i have to sit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there and be like listen get to the part </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where he [ __ ] someone and becomes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> extra powerful like i love having that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation again if you haven't seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> becky there is a scene where he has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only one scene yeah honestly and that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is enough to be like anime of the year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my mind just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> give it another that's that's exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i'm [ __ ] talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a scene that's stuck with you and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can bring up and you want to bring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so why would that not be in your number </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> three it's like the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i see it is that like let's say god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wants to take me to like an event and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like he has to specifically tell me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like connor don't bring up the backy sex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> scene to like my friends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the level of like i just want to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talk about it like that it's not like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> defines my taste for some reason i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> want to talk about that scene and how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] weird because because like i </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_08> over three and you can like recommend </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> some shows that they would like for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> example </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> like i knew for example that you would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love a show like dota head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what i mean because that that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that is crazy it's grimy it's a </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> foundation </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> i don't really count that as a shonen it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is a show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but it is a show because it has to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> categorized but there's no there's no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> jojo category but there should be as far </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as i'm concerned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you know okay that's what is the jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> category then i cause </SPEAKER_03>
